SCHMITT, SHANNON C. MCGREGOR, DANIEL MALMER University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA  News consumption in the United States is polarized and fragmented, with an abundance of partisan news publications appealing to political identities on both the left and the right. Yet, there is an abundance of hyperpartisan news on the right, the content of which has been shown to be harmful to democracy. This study captures one of the most comprehensive pictures to date of the U.S. Americans who consume far-right media and makes connections between such media use and the state of American democracy. After a lengthy data-cleaning process, we analyzed open-ended survey responses from a nationally representative sample of more than 10,000 U.S. American adults, finding that nearly ten percent self-report at least one far-right news outlet as a primary news source. Furthermore, significantly more  Andrea Lorenz: arlorenz@kent.edu  Carolyn E.

We also thank Dr. Deen Freelon, the Allan Randall Freelon Sr. Professor in the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, and the PIEGraph project team at the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that developed the tool used in this analysis.  \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 2 U.S. Americans report consuming far-right and moderate-right news outlets than counterparts on the left. We then examined the characteristics of this small but significant group, given the current political climate in the United States, finding that far-right news consumers are overwhelmingly white, male, Republican, Christian, and without a college degree. This study reinforces previous findings that patterns in hyperpartisan media usage demonstrate growing extremism in the U.S., and that it is deeply rooted in identity.  Keywords: hyperpartisan news, far-right news, partisan media, extremism, polarization, authoritarianism  This study looks at the Americans who consume conservative partisan news outlets and captures the scope and range of the demand for these outlets to better understand the country\u2019s political climate through hyperpartisan news. News consumption in the United States is polarized and fragmented, with partisan news publications appealing to political identities on both the left and the right (Groeling, 2013), and in various forms: online, in print, on television, and on the radio (Berry & Sobieraj, 2014; Stroud, 2010; Young, 2020). This high-choice media \u201cecosystem,\u201d however, is not symmetrically polarized: Partisan news outlets on the right far outnumber those on the left (Benkler et al., 2018; Heft et al., 2020). Corresponding to the asymmetric supply is what appears to be an asymmetric demand that also favors the right. Hardcore partisans consume more partisan news than those with more moderate viewpoints, and partisans on the right tend to consume more partisan news than partisans on the left (Guess, 2021). We argue there are important distinctions of far-right hyperpartisan outlets in their harm to a healthy democracy, not only because of their prolific presence in the U.S. media sphere, but also because they often publish false and outrageous news stories, often told through xenophobic news frames and ideologies (Heft et al., 2020). Furthermore, their extreme content diffuses to larger, more mainstream conservative outlets and beyond (Kaiser et al., 2020; Benkler et al., 2018).  \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 3 Amid the increase in the supply of hyperpartisan news on the right, researchers have not yet been able to nationally capture what hyperpartisan news looks like from the demand side. Studies that look at news usage based on media bias tend to focus on more traditional conservative partisan news outlets like Fox News (e.g., Hmielowski et al., 2020), while leaving out the more extreme far-right hyperpartisan sites. In this study, we delve into whether that ample supply of hyperpartisan news on the right is reflected in Americans\u2019 news consumption. We ask: What does the consumption of far-right news look like? What far-right outlets are these partisans consuming? And who are the Americans consuming it?  To answer these questions, we examine survey responses from a nationally representative sample of more than 10,000 U.S. American adults who answered open-ended questions about their top news sources. To our knowledge, ours is the first large-scale study about hyperpartisan media that asks Americans about their news habits in their own words. After doing so, we move into identifying and describing those who consume far-right hyperpartisan content.  We begin by defining hyperpartisan media and its influence in the media ecosystem. We then situate our work within news consumption scholarship, which shows that relatively few people turn to hyperpartisan outlets. Although this group is small, we argue that it is often overlooked and represents a politically important segment of the population. As our findings show, this group is demographically rather homogenous and align with dominant power groups in the United States\u2014overwhelmingly white, male, Christian, and Republican. They also tend to be more frequent consumers of news. Finally, we discuss the implications of these unique findings on partisan news scholarship, on the field of journalism, and on our democracy.  (Hyper-)partisan news in the United States  In this study, we aim to understand the nature of hyperpartisan news consumption in the United States. News is often labeled partisan if it does not adhere to journalistic norms of objectivity by promoting one political party over the other (Groeling, 2013; \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 4 Schudson, 2001). In recent years, scholars and media critics have added the descriptive \u201chyper-\u201d to signal the intensity or extremity of this partisan slant. The term hyperpartisan is a more apt term than alt-right or alt-left because it removes the idea that they exist as alternatives to news and acknowledges their standing within the news ecosystem and media economy, even if they do not abide by journalistic standards (Rae, 2021). Usage of hyperpartisan media can also combine partisan and alternative media, as they feature a unique \u201canti-system\u201d bent (Peacock et al., 2021, p. 214).  Rae (2021) argued for equating far-right and far-left news under the hyperpartisan umbrella because of similar populist language pitting the \u201cpeople\u201d against \u201celites,\u201d as well as the shared style of sensationalism, tabloid headlines, and anti-establishment sentiments. At times, these viewpoints have converged. Take, for example, Tim Pool, now an extreme-right YouTube magnate who got his start livestreaming from the leftist Occupy Wall Street movement (Silverman, 2021). We argue, however, that despite prominent exceptions, implying that the right and left have both become extremist\u2014much less to an equal extent\u2014applies a false equivalency that bears little resemblance to empirical research or reality.  First, conservatives have moved increasingly further to the political right without an equivalent movement of liberals to the left (Zimmer, 2019; Grossmann & Hopkins, 2015). Further, research finds stark differences in the level of harm that the views on the right and the left pose to a democracy in which all are included. When considering that no matter the ideology, people on the extreme right and left share some traits, such as more aggressive personality traits, the roots of their extremism differ: Extreme Republican views are primarily shaped by hostility toward women and Black people, for example (Kalmoe & Mason, 2022). These differences make it even more important to distinguish between right and left hyperpartisan news in analyses.  Second, hyperpartisan news on both sides might at times share a populist style, but their content\u2014and the implications of that content\u2014differ widely. For instance, only hyperpartisan news on the right furthers dangerous conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, promulgated by the losing Republican candidate, that led to the violent attempted \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 5 coup on the U.S. Capitol and continues to foment anti-democratic actions and violence across the country, contributing to democratic backsliding (Haggard & Kaufman, 2021).  Indeed, while many hyperpartisan media might be considered \u201cfringe\u201d outlets, in recent years Donald Trump accelerated the \u201cmainstreaming of the fringe,\u201d (Barkun, 2017, p. 441), wherein obscure viewpoints from the far-right that had once been contained within small subgroups by informal democratic rules and practices have now become part of common discourse. Our study aims to identify and quantify these extreme media organizations and the demographics of their consumers.  The U.S. media context from this view follows a global trend, but its robust conservative media ecosystem that blurs the lines between partisan and hyperpartisan outlets sets the country apart (Benkler et al., 2018). This conservative media system not only impacts U.S. media, but also plays an outsized role in the right-wing media ecosystems in other countries (Heft et al., 2021). Understanding the supply and demand of far-right media\u2014and the extent of extreme far-right media consumption, in particular\u2014can shed light on U.S. hyperpartisan media usage at a particularly fraught time in the country\u2019s democracy.   Supply: Hyperpartisan news in the networked media ecosystem  In this section, we describe the supply side of far-right media in the United States\u2014the options readily available for consumption\u2014and distinguish it from media on the left. The U.S. boasts a more robust conservative media ecosystem than it does on the left (Benkler et al., 2018). The ecology of conservative news sites in the U.S. is more developed than in other countries, having the largest number of sites that are also closely networked with one another, forming a dense, interconnected community outside of the mainstream news environment, as observed through analyses of which and how often sites connect to one another via hyperlinks (Heft et al., 2021).  A network analysis of the U.S. media ecosystem following the 2016 presidential election found that outlets on the left were dispersed more evenly ideologically, aligning with center outlets, whereas those on the right created an insular cluster featuring center-\nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 6 right Fox News in close proximity to Breitbart, an online publication founded by former Trump cabinet member Steve Bannon, illustrating their significance in the right-wing ecosystem (Benkler et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2020). Narratives from far-right hyperpartisan news tend to spread throughout the media ecosystem as larger partisan outlets, including Fox News, pick up and repeat the messages and falsehoods that far-right outlets such as Breitbart propagate, thereby reaching far more people than the small group who consumed the original content (Kaiser et al., 2020; Benkler et al., 2018). Extreme viewpoints become further integrated within the wider public discourse when such outlets are well-connected to the larger media ecosystem, thereby exposing more of the public to extreme content (Norocel et al., 2017).  The narratives promoted by hyperpartisan news, which are often similar to disinformation in the spreading of intentionally false information, frame current events according to partisan logics rather than completely fabricating information (Mour\u00e3o & Robertson, 2019). It follows that the agendas of partisan news outlets and untrustworthy or \u201cfake news\u201d outlets are \u201cintertwined\u201d and take cues from one another (Vargo et al., 2018, p. 2044), an occurrence also found in Breitbart setting the agenda of Fox News\u2019s immigration coverage (Kaiser et al., 2020). Furthermore, Republicans\u2019 judgments on the trustworthiness of news outlets tends to be less accurate than Democrats, which suggests that right-leaning Americans are especially susceptible to false information in news (Pennycook & Rand, 2019).  As such, far-right news has played a uniquely important role in contemporary U.S. politics. Former President Trump notably preferred conservative media, such as Fox News, and routinely attacked mainstream media (Meeks, 2020), although his favor toward traditional partisan outlets like Fox waned over his presidency, as he increasingly promoted far-right news outlets (Archer et al., 2022). Trump and other conservatives have criticized center-right Fox News and favored far-right outlets such as Newsmax, particularly after Fox News called the 2020 election for Biden (Dwyer, 2016; Rupar, 2020). Politicians preferring political news that supports their administration or party is hardly a new phenomenon, but the extent to which Trump repeated far-right talking points and implemented them in policy, such as his xenophobic border policies, set a precedent for \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 7 future politicians to make similarly extreme claims with less resistance. Moreover, Trump established a direct line between far-right news and the White House when he brought Bannon of Breitbart into his administration as a strategist (DelReal, 2016).       Outside electoral or mainstream politics, hyperpartisan media are key to extremist recruitment and maintenance strategies. For example, members of far-right organizations told researchers they would scour mainstream news websites for stories and then frame and share them through their xenophobic worldview to recruit people via social media. Once recruited, leaders said it was key that lower-ranked recruits consumed only media filtered through this view, lest they be exposed to more mainstream viewpoints (Baugut & Neumann, 2019).  Considering the prominence far-right media have gained in the United States and the unique danger they pose to democracy, it is imperative that media research continues to identify and quantify the outlets available.    Demand: Asymmetric hyperpartisan news consumption  Having shown that there is an ample supply of far-right hyperpartisan media in the United States rife with extreme content, we ask: Who consumes far-right news? Here we discuss the demand for far-right media.  Contrary to popular discourse about Americans\u2019 polarized news habits, most people consume rather moderate media\u2014with considerable overlap between Republicans and Democrats on sites such as CNN.com and MSN.com (Guess, 2021). Most Americans also care very little about politics (Krupnikov & Ryan, 2022), and as such, most Americans do not consume ideologically extreme news (Guess, 2021). Most people, regardless of ideology, get their political news from similar, well-known news sources, such as Yahoo, The New York Times, and ABC News. More partisan media, such as Fox News on the right and MSNBC on the left, also attracted an ideologically diverse set of users, suggesting that the content of these sites is appealing beyond any one partisan subset of the population (Nelson & Webster, 2017).  \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 8 For whatever reasons, people do seek out alternatives to mainstream media. This could be due to declining trust in media and institutions (Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck et al., 2020), especially among Republicans (Gottfried & Liedke, 2021). Partisanship thus influences news consumption. When given the choice, people turn to media that affirm their political beliefs, which might have a reinforcing effect on those consumers\u2014especially those with strong partisan beliefs (Stroud, 2010; Levendusky, 2013; Hmielowski et al., 2020). Partisan media use strengthens both liberal and conservative ideological beliefs, but only conservatives appear to turn to media echo-chambers (Hmielowski et al., 2020). While much research on partisanship and news consumption focuses on partisan outlets (such as MSNBC and Fox) rather than hyperpartisan, far-right news outlets (Hmielowski et al., 2020; Stroud, 2010), this work underscores the importance partisanship may play in news consumption.  However, news preferences may not merely be about partisanship. Other factors, such as identity and anti-establishment beliefs, might also factor into news choice. Partisanship and social identity groupings overlap with multiple groups and categories, including ideology, race, and religion (Mason, 2018)\u2014all of which might help us understand the role of identity in consumption of far-right media. Anti-establishment views are another potential explanation. These views, though dispersed across the ideological spectrum, are associated with conspiratorial thinking about mainstream media as well as usage of far-right social media platforms like Gab (Uscinski et al., 2021). Similarly, members of far-right extremist groups express hostility toward mainstream news media, as their anti-establishment views include news media as part of the system against which they conspire (Baugut & Neumann, 2019).  As there is asymmetry in the supply between right and left, so, too, do researchers find it in demand of hyperpartisan news. The ideologies of those who seek out partisan news suggest asymmetric political polarization in news habits. Guess (2021) found that the most left-slanted consumers landed on left-leaning sites such as NYTimes.com and Buzzfeed. Conversely, even though more Republicans than Democrats tended toward moderate sites, about a tenth gravitated to sites that were more ideologically extreme than their left counterparts\u2014well to the right of center-right Fox News. This group may be \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 9 proportionately small, but it is mighty. Guess found that this small group drove about a quarter of overall news traffic on the right, enough to create an illusion of a highly polarized audience (ibid, 2021). Rather than polarization\u2014a phenomenon at both ends of the political spectrum\u2014this suggests extremism on the right alone.  Notably, hyperpartisan news consumers were also more likely to vote, especially those consuming news on the far-right end of the spectrum. This higher political involvement may explain their outsized influence as conservative thought leaders to both the public and political leaders in the GOP (Guess, 2021). We take this as a starting point, striving to learn more about a small but influential aspect of the American electorate.   The scope, content, and consumption of far-right hyperpartisan media in the U.S.  While a minority, consumers of hyperpartisan news, especially those on the far-right, are an important and understudied aspect of the populace. Survey analysis on news consumption usually includes hyperpartisan and far-right outlets, as well as the people who regularly consume them, as \u201cOther\u201d or list prominent outlets only, such as Breitbart. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine U.S. Americans\u2019 news consumption in their own words, allowing us to robustly capture the nature of hyperpartisan news consumption, the extent of it, and the characteristics of its audience.  Our hypotheses and research questions focus on two areas of inquiry: hyperpartisan news outlets and the U.S. Americans who consume them. Leveraging a large, representative, and unique dataset, we seek to understand the consumption of hyperpartisan news in scope and content, and to develop a robust description of its consumers. We addressed this novel and exploratory inquiry in two parts with the following research questions and hypotheses: RQ1: What hyperpartisan news outlets are U.S. Americans consuming?  Although this is the first study of its kind to undertake a project on hyperpartisan news consumption with this magnitude of descriptive, self-reported data, previous literature suggests we will find key differences in hyperpartisan news outlets on the left and the right. Therefore, we hypothesize: \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 10 H1: Hyperpartisan news on the right will be more ideologically extreme than on the left and will be consumed more frequently.  Anticipating a smaller, underpowered sample on the far-left, we then turn our attention in the second part of our inquiry to address the people behind the demand for far-right news. We ask: RQ2: Who are the U.S. Americans consuming far-right hyperpartisan news?  Finally, we anticipate differences between those in this group as far as their consumption goes and hypothesize: H2: People who consume content on the far-right will be more frequent news consumers overall than those with a more moderate consumption score.  Methods   Participants and data collection   This study uses data from a Gallup Panel, which was distributed through mail and web, between July 30 and August 26, 2021. The panel is a probability-based panel of U.S. adults, selected by Gallup randomly using both address-based sampling and dual-frame random-digit dialing phone interviews. The dataset used in this study was completed by 10,226 adults in the U.S., aged 18 or older. The AAPOR5 response rate is 22%.  Before we conducted our analysis, we weighted the sample using weights provided by Gallup, which corrected for unequal selection probability and nonresponses. Weighting adjustments were made to ensure this sample matches the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, and geographic region based on the 2019 Current Population Survey figures for U.S. adults.  The questions used in this study, as well as those on the full instrument, were designed by both Gallup and The Knight Foundation, in consultation with academics, including the third author. The full dataset has been publicly available since the May 2022 release of the report. For more information on the sample, as well as the full questionnaire \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 11 from which this study is drawn, see Media & Democracy: Unpacking America\u2019s complex views on the digital public square (2022)2.  Coding open-ended responses for news outlets  In examining news consumption, we draw from an item on the survey that asked: \u201cPlease name the top two to three news sources you use. Be as specific as possible.\u201d Respondents were offered up to three text boxes, though they could choose to not answer. Respondents provided these as free-form text, resulting in more than 30,000 data points in raw form with varying articulation, punctuation, and spelling. Making sense of what this massive amount of data means for hyperpartisan news consumption in the United States required laborious cleaning and processing, detailed below.  With this large sample, we had 30,678 possible total responses. Of these, 5,200 were left blank, leaving 25,478 for us to analyze further. As a first step, we converted all responses to lower case, identified unique strings, and ranked them by frequency of appearance. This resulted in 5,319 distinct responses. The most common response was \u201ccnn\u201d with 1,967 appearances, followed by \u201cfox news\u201d with 1,027. Because the outlets appeared as free-form text, they were extremely long-tail, with the median response appearing only once. We then created a hybrid codebook/dictionary (see Appendix A) to match each response to a media outlet. This was an important step because many of the 5,319 unique responses were aliases for the same outlet. We first sorted the responses alphabetically to identify aliases. For example, 78 different responses (e.g., \u201cnytimes,\u201d \u201cthe new york times,\u201d \u201cn. y. times\u201d) were given for The New York Times. As we coded responses, we assigned political bias scores to each outlet ranging from \u201333 (extreme left) to +33 (extreme right). These scores are from Media Bias Fact Check, as described next.  We obtained these scores from Media Bias Fact Check (MBFC), an independent website that rates outlets for political bias and factual accuracy (Media Bias/Fact Check,  2 https://knightfoundation.org/reports/media-and-democracy/ \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 12 n.d.) and has been used in various peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Chen et al., 2021; Cinelli et al., 2020). We chose MBFC because they rank many sources\u2014more than 4,400 at the time of writing\u2014using a robust and well-documented methodology that considers content, word choice, and factual reporting in its ratings. Especially because we focus conceptually on hyperpartisan news, which is marked by flouting journalistic norms, we decided to use a scoring system that took content into consideration. No rating \u2013 MBFC or others \u2013 can be seen as completely objective, though MBFC notes that they use objective measures and subjective analysis in their scoring, and their full methodology is described on their website.  As a secondary source for outlets not scored by MBFC, we used Ad Fontes Media (Ad Fontes Media, n.d.), which has a similar scoring service based on content. A bivariate correlation of scores that were available from both MBFC and Ad Fontes Media showed strong correlation (n = 30, r = 0.88, p < 0.01). As with other studies that have used various measures to assign bias or ideological slant to news outlets, the midpoint of \u201c0\u201d should not be presumed to achieve ideological balance (Guess, 2021).  To match a bias score with each outlet, we obtained a comma-separated values file with MBFC scores from the PIEGraph Project at the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which uses the data to study and promote fact-based information consumption (\u201cPIEGraph\u201d, n.d.). The scale captured the range in bias between center-right and center-left outlets and the extremes. We acknowledge limitations with this scoring scale that suggests positive and negative scores are balanced or equivalent in some way, an assumption we approach with caution. This scale is not used under the assumption that -33 (far left) is the actual counterpoint to 33 (far right) but used rather to capture the variability between them. To match outlets from our codebook with political bias scores from MBFC, we wrote a Python script using the pandas data analysis library that associated those scores with each response. After several iterations of coding and scoring, 16,897 responses, more than half of our data, were scored using data from MBFC, and 193 responses by data from Ad Fontes Media (see Appendix A). However, a substantial amount\u20148,581 responses\u2014had not been scored by either MBFC or Ad Fontes Media. Because of the size of this unscored group, \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 13 we applied a categorical labeling protocol to capture the nature of these answers, detailed in Appendix B. The largest categories were local news (33.1%), social media (13.3%), news (12.59%), and aggregators (12.65%). We also created a category for anti-media sentiment (.75%), which was characterized by a negative comment directed at the media, such as in our title \u201ccnn can kiss my ass.\u201d After the data-cleaning process, we were able to identify 6,332 distinct outlets reported by respondents. Of those, 5,471 were not scored by MBFC, so we labeled them categorically, as described above. In all, 861 outlets had been scored by either MBFC or Ad Fontes Media. These outlets\u2014and the respondents who listed them as one of their three preferred news sources\u2014formed the basis for our analyses.  Variables  Partisan bias scoring. (M= -1.78, SD =14.58) This news outlet variable had scores ranging from -33 (extreme left) to +33 (extreme right).  Sex. Two categories: female (52%) and male (48%). We recoded sex as a dummy variable so that female took the value of 1 and male took the value of 0.  Age. Three categories. Ages 18 to 34 (29.9%) took the value of 1, ages 35 to 54 (33%) took the value of 2, and ages over 55 (37.1%) took the value of 3.  Race/Ethnicity. Seven categories: American Indian, (3.2%), Asian (1.9%), Black (11.8%), Native Hawaiian (0.5%), White (85.3%), and Hispanic (9.6%).  Education. Nine categories: less than a high school diploma, high school graduate, technical/ trade/ vocational/ business school or program after high school, some college, two-year associate degree, four your bachelor\u2019s degree, some postgraduate or professional school, postgraduate or professional degree, and don\u2019t know. We used a dummy variable where college graduate (45%) took the value of 1, while non-college graduate (55%) took the value of 0.  Religion. The religion variable was measured by the following question: \u201cWhat is your current religion, if any?\u201d Options were Protestant (22.5%), Roman Catholic (15.1%), Mormon (1.7%), Orthodox Christian (1%), Other Christian (14.1%), Jewish (2.1%), \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 14 Muslim (.3%), Buddhist (.6%), Hindu (.2%), Atheist (10.3%), Agnostic (9%), or Nothing in particular (14.7%). Those who answered Protestant as well as the 14% of respondents answering \u201cOther Christian\u201d were further prompted to identify as Evangelical (29.2%) or Born Again (39.3%).  Geography. The geography variable was measured by the following question: \u201cWhich best describes the area where you live?\u201d The options were: a rural area or on a farm (13.4%), a small town or village (27.1%), a large city (23.4%), or a suburb of a large city (35.5%).  News consumption frequency. (M =3.48, SD =.91, range 1-4). The news consumption frequency variable was measured by the following item, asked directly after the item asking for a respondent\u2019s top news sources: \u201cHow frequently are you using these news sources?\u201d It was a categorical question; options were daily (coded high), weekly, a few times a month, and rarely (coded low).  Political party. The political party variable was measured by the following item: \u201cIn politics, as of today, with which political party do you most closely affiliate?\u201d The options were Republican, Democrat, Independent, and Other. Respondents who selected Independent or Other were further prompted to answer if they \u201cleaned\u201d toward the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. We add Republican and Democratic leaners to those who identified with a party in the first question, leaving as Independents those who did not express a preference toward either party when pressed. Our political party variable then consisted of three options: Republican (35.2%), Democrat (52%), and Independent (7.9%).  Political ideology. (M = 3.86, SD = 1.75, range = 1-7) Participants were asked, \u201cHow would you describe your political views?\u201d Answers were given on a 7-point scale, ranging from extremely liberal to extremely conservative. The higher the score, the more conservative respondent\u2019s views were.  Anti-establishment beliefs. (range 1-5) Anti-establishment beliefs were measured using the following two items: \u201cEven though we elect our leaders, a few people will always run things.\u201d (M = 3.63, SD = 1.073) and \u201cOfficial government explanations of events cannot be trusted.\u201d (M = 3.32, SD = 1.098). The first item falls into the conspiracy \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 15 dimension of anti-establishment beliefs, while the second falls into the populism dimension of anti-establishment beliefs (Uscinski et al., 2021). Both items were asked on a 5-point Likert scale.   Findings  Our first research question asked simply, what hyperpartisan news outlets are Americans consuming? To answer this, we chose cut points to determine which outlets fall under the hyperpartisan categorization. Rather than bring our a prioris to these distinctions (or to suggest equal extremities), we sought natural cut points in the distribution of scored responses. Scored outlets showed a bimodal distribution (see Figure 1), with clear high frequencies at far-left, center-left, center-right, and far-right points.   Figure 1. Frequency distribution of all scored outlets \n Note: The frequency distribution of all scored outlets shows a bimodal distribution with high frequencies at far-left, center-left, center-right, and far-right points.  \n\nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 16 Based on the distribution of the scored responses, we chose the following cut points: -25 or less for far-left outlets (modal outlet with a score of -25 is The Young Turks); -20 or less for center-left outlets (modal outlet with a score of -20 is MSNBC); 23 or greater for center-right outlets (modal outlet with a score of 23 is Fox News); and 27 or greater for far-right outlets (model outlet with a score of 27 is Newsmax). We classified hyperpartisan news as -25 or less (on the left) and as 27 or higher (on the right).3 These cut points are bounded, such that center-left outlets encompass those with a score from -20 to -24, and outlets categorized as far-left begin at -25 and extend to -33. For outlets on the right, center-right outlets begin at 23 and extend to 26, and far-right outlets begin at 27 and extend to 33. Though the selection of cut points is both arbitrary yet important (see Fletcher et al., 2021), several considerations guided our decision.  First, we sought guidance from our conceptual focus on hyperpartisan news, aiming to determine cut points that reflect outlets\u2019 position within the news media ecosystem and media economy, even though they do not abide by journalistic standards. Because MBFC scores are based in large part on the extent to which outlets adhere to journalistic norms, we see strong alignment between our conceptual focus on hyperpartisan media, the use of MBFC for scoring, and our decisions on cut points.  Second, we looked to the number of respondents listing each outlet, taking relative reported frequency of consumption as a signal of an outlet\u2019s distinction from others. For example, on the right, the outlets between center-right Fox (23) and the far-right (27) include Townhall (24), Zerohedge (24), and Daily Wire (25). In total though, these outlets were only listed 187 times\u2014noticeably less than the number of respondents listing Newsmax (N=594) and OANN (N=257), both of which have a score of 27. Therefore, we chose this as a commonsense and conservative cut point. Finally, we are at pains to point out that what we label as far-right is a narrower range and farther to the endpoint of the scale (27 to 33) than is our labeling of the far-left (-25 to -33). Given that, our description of far-right hyperpartisan outlets is a conservative measure.  3 See appendix for frequencies of scoreable outlets mentioned more than 15 times. \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 17 Using this distribution, we found a substantial difference in the amount of people who reported preferred news outlets on the right and the left. More respondents listed the most frequent news they consume with a center-right and far-right bias score than relatively scored outlets on the left. Based on the summaries, 2,052 people, or about 21% of all respondents, listed Fox News as one of their three preferred news sources, compared to only 932 people, or 9%, who listed MSNBC. On the extreme ends, 594 people, about 6% of respondents, listed Newsmax, compared to just 31 people, 0.3% of respondents, who listed The Young Turks. The difference in the frequency of these outlets confirms previous studies that show more people are consuming far-right news than far-left. Table 1 below lists the frequencies for outlets (mentioned at least 15 times) that we classified as far-left and far-right.   Table 1. Frequency of hyperpartisan sources listed by respondents. Outlet or source Frequency Score Far-left          Daily Kos 21 -26        Young Turks 31 -25 Far-right         Newsmax 594 27       One America News Network 257 27       The Blaze 66 27       Breitbart 129 28       Dan Bongino 28 28       Tucker Carlson 27 28       Sean Hannity 20 28       Infowars 18 31       Rumble 16 31       Gateway Pundit 30 32  \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 18 Additionally, the most frequently listed sites on the right were had scores neared the extreme end of the scale than did outlets on the left, supporting our first hypothesis. Fox News, the most listed outlet of the center-right, is rated at 23, while MSNBC, the most listed outlet on the center-left is rated at -20. Newsmax, the most listed outlet on the far-right, is rated at 27, while The Young Turks is -25. Using this scoring tool, these differences show that people consuming hyperpartisan news on the right are consuming news that is more ideologically extreme than those consuming hyperpartisan news on the left.  Notably, scholars are not aligned on where to place Fox News ideologically. Some studies place Fox as an ideological counterpart to CNN, the most commonly named outlet in our study. Conversely, Fox News is considered even farther to the right in some work, with Benkler et al., (2018) suggesting the outlet\u2019s networked connection with farther-right Breitbart and other far-right outlets makes it more extreme than our scoring system reflects (see also Kaiser et al., 2020). PEW also reports significant crossover in Fox News viewers and those of Newsmax and OANN (Mitchell, 2021).  Fox News is indeed a complicated outlet worthy of further clarification. On one hand, the outlet\u2019s news anchors called Arizona for Biden in 2020, prompting many viewers to leave and seek farther-right news (Barr, 2020), but opinion programming on Fox News purposely shared disinformation related to the 2020 election (Peters & Robinson, 2023). Our study cautiously places the outlet within the center-right with the caveat that it is complicated due to the ideological range of their opinion and news programs. Importantly, MBFC scores two prominent Fox News hosts separately \u2013 Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. These two opinion show hosts each have a score of 28, to the right of Fox News itself and within our far-right categorization. Respondents who mentioned Carlson (N=27) or Hannity (N=20) are counted as consumers of far-right hyperpartisan news.  Our second research question asked: Who are the Americans consuming far-right hyperpartisan news? To examine this, we calculated an index for far-right news consumption. If a respondent listed no far-right outlets, their score was 0; if they listed one, it was 1; if they listed two, it was 2; and if they listed all three top consumed news outlets as far-right, it was 3. Overall, 90.9% of respondents listed no far-right outlets as their top news sources, while 99.1% listed no far-left outlets. Another 6.4% of respondents listed at \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 19 least one far-right outlet, 2.3% listed two, and .3% listed all three top news sources as far-right outlets. In comparison, .9% listed one far-left outlet, and no respondents listed more than one far-left outlet. We examined the relationship between this measure of depth of far-right news consumption with a series of socio-demographic variables and political attitudes. Leveraging our large dataset, we were able to richly describe consumers of far-right hyperpartisan news (see Table 2).  Table 2. Number of far-right news outlet listed by socio-demographics.

As far as socio-demographic variables go, U.S. Americans who consume far-right partisan news are a rather homogenous group. Those who reported consuming at least one far-right outlet as one of their top news sources were significantly more likely to be male, 55 or older, white, without a college degree, more likely to be Christian \u2013 especially evangelical, born-again, or Mormon \u2013 to be Republican, and to live in a rural area or small town. Consumers who report two-thirds of their top three news sources to be far-right outlets were significantly more likely to be 55 or older, white, without a college degree, Christian (again, especially evangelical, born-again, or Mormon), to be Republican, or to live in a rural area. Less than 1% of the sample (N=32) reported all three of their top news sources as far-right partisan outlets, but those who did were marginally, but significantly, more likely to be 35 or older, without a college degree, and to be Republican.  \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 21 Next, we assessed the relationship between far-right news consumption and political attitudes. We found that those who consume far-right news are more likely to be ideologically conservative. Of those who reported at least one far-right news outlet as a top news source, 60% identified as conservative, 6% as moderate, and .9% as liberal. We further find far-right news consumption to be positively and significantly correlated with conservative ideology (r = .350, p < .001). We find that far-right news consumption is positively and significantly correlated with anti-establishment beliefs, but much more so with the populist dimension (r = .293, p < .001) than the conspiracy dimension (r = .083, p < .001).  Our second hypothesis suggested that people who consume content on the far-right and far-left will be more frequent news consumers overall than those with a more moderate consumption score. We find that far-right news consumption is correlated with frequency of news consumption (r=.059, p <.001). Though the strength of the correlation is small, it provides some support for this hypothesis.  Discussion  In summary, our study captures one of the most comprehensive pictures to date of U.S. Americans\u2019 media usage through self-reporting. We build on previous research to understand demand for far-right media through the eyes of its consumers and then paint a portrait of these consumers.  First, most Americans who consume partisan content prefer outlets with a right-leaning bias, from center-right to far-right. Second, preferred outlets on the right are scored as more extreme than the most preferred on the left. Put simply, more Americans are consuming center- and far-right content than content with a center- or far-left bias, and the content on the right is far more extreme, when considering relative bias ratings. Second, our descriptive analysis found that Americans who consume the most extreme content on the right are a fairly homogenous group: white, Republican, conservative, Christian (especially born-again, evangelical, or Mormon) males who are 55 or older, who do not have a college degree, and live in rural areas or small towns. They \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 22 also consume more news content in general than others and are more likely to hold anti-establishment beliefs.  Outlets  We confirm research that most people cite moderate, mainstream news outlets, such as The New York Times, ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN, as their preferred source of news. This supports Guess\u2019s (2021) work, as do findings that those who consume far-right hyperpartisan news have stronger partisan views than those who consume center-left, center-right, or \u201cmoderate\u201d news. Then, those who consume far-right news far outnumber those who consume far-left news, making up a small but not insignificant proportion of 9% of respondents in this nationally representative survey.  Although this study focuses on this important share of respondents consuming far-right news, the connection between these outlets with more center-right outlets, notably Fox News, which a whopping 21% of Americans in this study consider a preferred source for news, cannot be understated when considering the connections between Fox and far-right news. Far-right news outlets such as Breitbart influence Fox News\u2019s coverage, and so-called \u201cfake news\u201d websites have been found to have a symbiotic relationship with partisan media (Benkler et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2020; Vargo et al., 2018). Relatedly, our use of a pre-existing scale to measure bias is not without limitations. Though we contend that a content-based scoring system, especially one that focuses on levels of adherence to journalistic norms, operationalizes well our study\u2019s focus on hyperpartisan news, the challenges of determining bias \u2013 or the ideological slant of an outlet\u2019s audience \u2013 are many. Neither of these widely used methods contend with the distinct content one consumes on any given outlet. Any scoring method suffers from interpretability, as they measure relative bias or slant, not a firm scale that allows for one-to-one comparisons.     \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 23 Self-reported and open-ended data  Our data underscores the extent to which people self-report turning to hyperpartisan news outlets that encompass a much broader and varied swath of far-right sources of information and provides a compelling argument for more self-reporting and open-ended questions in this area. Our study used an open-ended model to ask respondents to name their top three news sources, a method which have been found to be more accurate than close-ended questions (Guess, 2015), although partisan media may be likely to be named (Cardenal et al., 2022). The limitations of close-ended questions are but one of many issues plaguing meaningful measurement of media consumption. Polling organizations such as Pew Research Center, for example, now include hyperpartisan news outlets such as Newsmax and One America News in their surveys of partisan news consumption (e.g., Mitchell, 2021). These two outlets certainly appear in our dataset, yet they do so alongside Bannon\u2019s War Room, Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars, and individuals like Tim Pool, far-right content producers that rarely feature in closed-ended question types. Another question our study raises is how to make sense of self-reported data on news media use in conjunction with behavioral data, as survey respondents tend to over-report news consumption (Konitzer et al., 2021; Prior, 2009) while behavioral data show more limited consumption of partisan news than survey data in some studies, although not in all cases. While Fox News was over-reported in surveys compared to behavioral data, MSNBC was underreported (Konitzer et al., 2021). A web-tracking study during the 2016 campaign found that Republicans turned to partisan news websites more often than Democrats, with a third of all Republican website visits confined to Fox News, Drudge Report, and RealClearPolitics (Peterson et al., 2021). In his study of news consumers in 2015 using web-tracking data, Guess found that 8% of Republicans consumed conservative news, operationalized as outlets at and to the ideological right of Fox News. Notably, our study was conducted six years later, a gap that includes a spread of conspiracy beliefs ranging from public health to politics and the election of a far-right president who wielded his presidential pulpit to endorse far-right outlets (Archer et al., 2022).  \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 24 Given lower levels of response to open-ended questions, ours is likely an undercount of those who might self-report consuming far-right media. For example, when given a list of possible news sources in a recent survey, 43% of Americans reported turning to Fox News (and 10% to Newsmax) for political news in the past week (Mitchell, 2021), higher numbers than our study found. Furthermore, behavioral data, while useful, encompass only certain mediums (often excluding mobile usage) and is typically gleaned from a smaller sample size than the survey used in this study. As a relatively newer method compared to surveys, metered data comes with their own limitations (Bosch & Revilla, 2022).  We also proffer another mechanism for differences in consumption found in our study: Self-reported media use may be a stronger indicator of expressive partisan identity than it is of actual consumption. This echoes findings from Konizter et al., (2021) that surveys measure attitudes better than they do news consumption rates and Cardenal et al., (2022) that respondents might be more likely to list a partisan outlet when questions are open-ended. Responding to signals from political leaders on the right, many conservatives today know that adhering to far-right media is an important aspect of what it means to be a Republican. Future work should directly test this political identity performance hypothesis, tying detailed self-report data to tracking and traffic data.   Consumers  Like we do, Guess (2021) and others find that those consuming conservative news consume a lot of it. This minority of adherents to far-right media play an outsized role in driving web traffic but more importantly in politics writ large. Guess (ibid) finds that those with the most conservative media diets had markedly higher turnout rates for both the general election and the primaries in 2016. Put bluntly, an extremist minority both supports the far-right media ecosystem and likely plays a significant role in driving the Republican party to the right due to their increased political participation. These far-right opinion leaders, fed a steady diet of anti-democratic content, disproportionately and systemically distort elite influence.   \nJQD: DM 3(2023) \u201cCNN Can Kiss My As$\u201d 25  In finding that consumption of far-right hyperpartisan news is correlated with anti-establishment beliefs, we look toward the unique \u201canti-system\u201d bent of hyperpartisan media (Peacock et al., 2021, p. 214). This sentiment is also apparent in the people who took the time to write in anti-media sentiment, as our title illustrates.   Conclusion  Our study reinforces that patterns in hyperpartisan media usage demonstrate growing extremism, not polarization. The far-left news outlets that Americans consume are less ideologically extreme than those on the far-right by a significant margin. Furthermore, we find vast differences in the size of audiences for far-left and far-right hyperpartisan media. Given that many more Americans report consuming far-right news, this suggests asymmetric extremism, not polarization.  Extremism is intricately tied to anti-establishment sentiments and political identity, both of which we found correlate with far-right media usage (see also Berger, 2018). This extremism is dangerous to democracy, and it is not simply a matter of polarized partisan differences\u2014left or right. We contribute to literature on the range of extreme (or hyper) partisan news consumption and show that a small but politically important group turn to these extreme outlets. These extreme viewpoints, littered with hatred and disinformation, permeate public discourse and the words of elected officials. A significant number of Republicans\u2014both in the populace and in elected office\u2014deny election outcomes (Jurkowitz, 2021), reflecting an extreme anti-democratic stance. Taken together, this signals that we need to pay more constant attention to this minority group of extreme partisan news consumers.          \nLorenz, Schmitt, McGregor, Malmer Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 3(2023) 26 References  Ad Fontes Media.

Categories built from unscored responses During our data-cleaning process, we found that 8,581 responses were not outlets that had been scored by either MBFC or Ad Fontes Media. Because of the size of this unscored group, we applied a categorical labeling protocol to capture the nature of these answers. This protocol started with three of the authors repeatedly going through these unscored responses in an iterative process that included discussing the types of news outlets they observed, researching unfamiliar ones, and eventually reaching a consensus for the inductive categorical schema detailed below. Some answers were not news outlets at all, such as \u201cmy husband,\u201d Facebook, or the name of an individual influencer. We then categorized all 8,581 by assigning them 15 labels.       Categories were: local (33.1%), in which respondents named a local newspaper, television, or radio station that had not been rated; social media (13.3%), social media like Facebook or Twitter; news (12.59%), for responses that listed unspecified news such as \u201cnewspapers\u201d; aggregators (12.65%), such as Yahoo News or Apple News; individuals (5.54%), individuals or news personalities listed by name, such as Phillip De Franco; digital media (4.34%), general digital media such as \u201cmy phone\u201d; family/friends (1.13%), for when people listed personal contacts; conservative news (.8%), for unrated right-leaning sites; anti-media sentiment (.75%), which was characterized by a negative comment directed at the media, such as in our title \u201ccnn can kiss my ass,\u201d or \u201cnews tell lies\u201d; religious news (.57%), mostly encompassing conservative Christian news websites with a handful of progressive Jewish and Catholic sites; weather (.37%), such as \u201cthe weather channel\u201d; satire/comedy (.31%), such as The Onion; government website (.21%); liberal news (.2%), for unrated left-leaning sites; sports (.19%), such as MLB.com; other (1.1%), for the remaining responses that defied categorization; and finally, none/no news (14.62%), for answers that either listed a website that was not a news outlet, such as Amazon, or a statement such as \u201cI do not follow news.\u201d  ", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "\u201cCNN Can Kiss My As $\u201d: A Novel Description of Hyperpartisan US News Consumers", "author": ["A Lorenz", "C Schmitt", "S McGregor"], "pub_year": "2023", "venue": "Journal of Quantitative \u2026", "abstract": "News consumption in the United States is polarized and fragmented, with an abundance of  partisan news publications appealing to political identities on both the left and the right.

Therefore, accurately de-\nciphering and predicting partisan biases using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) is increas-\ningly critical. In this study, we address the\nchallenge of understanding political bias in dig-\nitized discourse using LLMs. While traditional\napproaches often rely on finetuning separate\nmodels for each political faction, our work in-\nnovates by employing a singular, instruction-\ntuned LLM to reflect a spectrum of political ide-\nologies. We present a comprehensive analytical\nframework, consisting of Partisan Bias Diver-\ngence Assessment and Partisan Class Tendency\nPrediction, to evaluate the model\u2019s alignment\nwith real-world political ideologies in terms of\nstances, emotions, and moral foundations. Our\nfindings reveal the model\u2019s effectiveness in cap-\nturing emotional and moral nuances, albeit with\nsome challenges in stance detection, highlight-\ning the intricacies and potential for refinement\nin NLP tools for politically sensitive contexts.\nThis research contributes significantly to the\nfield by demonstrating the feasibility and im-\nportance of nuanced political understanding in\nLLMs, particularly for applications requiring\nacute awareness of political bias.\n1 Introduction\nThe advent of social media has drastically changed\nthe landscape of political engagement, with dis-\ncourse becoming increasingly digitized and polar-\nized (He et al., 2021; Feldman et al., 2023; Iyengar\net al., 2019). Large language models (LLMs), in-\ntegral to content creation and interpretation within\nthese spaces (T\u00f6rnberg et al., 2023), frequently\nlack the nuance required to navigate the complex\nundercurrents of political communication. Tradi-\ntional approaches to infusing these models with\na sense of political awareness have typically in-\nvolved finetuning distinct models for each political\nfaction (Jiang et al., 2022). This method is not only\nresource-intensive but also limited in its flexibilityand scalability. Such an approach can inadvertently\nperpetuate siloed conversations, reinforcing exist-\ning biases rather than providing a comprehensive\nview of the diverse political dialogue.\nAs societies grapple with polarization, it be-\ncomes increasingly vital for LLMs to understand\nthe full range of opinions and emotions that fuel\npublic debate. This is not just for the purpose of\ngenerating politically aware content but also for\napplications that include moderating discussions,\ncrafting targeted messaging, and analyzing senti-\nment trends. The evolution of language models\nis essential to handle the sophistication of politi-\ncal discourse, which demands an understanding of\nthe implicit stances, emotional nuances, and moral\njudgments embedded within text.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel ap-\nproach by finetuning a singular LLM with instruc-\ntions that encapsulate bipartisan perspectives. This\nmethod not only economizes the finetuning process\nby eliminating the need for multiple community-\nspecific models but also enhances the model\u2019s\nadaptability. Through instruction tuning, our LLM\nlearns to interpret and generate content that re-\nflects the diverse viewpoints within the political\nspectrum, making it adept at responding to the in-\ntricate and often controversial nature of political\ndiscourse.\nAfter finetuning, we prompt the model to gen-\nerate perspectives toward a wide range politically\ncharged topics. To ascertain the alignment of our\nmodel\u2019s learned perspectives with real-world ide-\nologies, we assess the model\u2019s generations across\nthree textual features: stances, emotions, and moral\nfoundations. These features are critical in capturing\nthe essence of political communication. To quanti-\ntatively measure the alignment, we introduce two\nevaluative tasks: Partisan Bias Divergence Assess-\nment and the Partisan Class Tendency Prediction.\nThese tasks are designed to gauge the model\u2019s fi-\ndelity in mirroring the nuances of political leaningsarXiv:2311.09687v1  [cs.CL]  16 Nov 2023\nacross these textual dimensions.\nOur findings indicate that while the finetuned\nmodel shows a sophisticated understanding of emo-\ntional and moral nuances, it demonstrates a less pre-\ncise alignment with real-world data in stance detec-\ntion. This discrepancy underscores the challenges\nof capturing the full complexity of political stances\nthrough a language model, despite advanced fine-\ntuning techniques. However, the model\u2019s nuanced\ngrasp of emotions and moral foundations signifies\na step forward in creating LLMs that can engage\nwith the core elements of partisan communication.\nThese outcomes suggest critical pathways for\nrefining NLP tools to better understand and partic-\nipate in political discourse. The implications of\nsuch advancements are profound, encompassing\nethically sensitive applications like content moder-\nation and narrative generation, where a deep under-\nstanding of political bias is paramount.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Adapting LLMs to Different Political\nLeanings\nLLMs, trained on extensive datasets of human lan-\nguage from the Internet, are capable of simulating\nrealistic discourse. Many researchers have started\nto explore the political leanings and biases of LLMs\nor to adapt LLMs to have political leanings for so-\ncial science analysis. Feng et al. discovered that\npretrained LLMs do exhibit political leanings, per-\npetuating social biases into downstream tasks. In\nterms of adapting LLMs to simulate human opin-\nions and behaviors, Argyle et al. illustrates that\nGPT-3 can adeptly mimic respondents in extensive,\nnationally-representative public opinion surveys,\nencompassing diverse demographic backgrounds.\nOther researchers have finetuned LLMs to learn the\npolitical views of different partisan communities\nand to better study polarization (Jiang et al., 2022).\nTo evaluate news feed algorithms, this work (T\u00f6rn-\nberg et al., 2023) created multiple LLM personas\nfrom election data to simulate social media plat-\nforms. However, very few works have examined\nthe perspectives of LLMs from various aspects.\nWhen learning from texts authored by ideologi-\ncally different communities, do LLMs also learn\ntheir stance, emotions expressions and even moral-\nity? This is the research question this study aims\nfor.2.2 Instruction Tuning for LLMs\nInstruction tuning is an LLM finetuning technique\nwhich takes in human instruction for a task as well\nas the desired output that follows the instruction.\nIt bridges the gap between the original next-word\nprediction objective of LLMs and the users\u2019 intent,\nenabling a model behavior that is more controllable\nand foreseeable (Zhang et al., 2023). Researchers\nhave widely used instruction tuning to make LLMs\nbetter follow users\u2019 instructions (Ouyang et al.,\n2022; Taori et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023) and gen-\neralize to unseen tasks (Wang et al., 2022; Long-\npre et al., 2023). Prior works have shown that\ninstruction-tuned LLMs can perform better on text\nclassification (Wang et al., 2022), information ex-\ntraction (Wang et al., 2023) and aspect-based sen-\ntiment analysis (Varia et al., 2022). Due to its\neffectiveness, we use instructive tuning to induce\npolitical leanings into LLMs.\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Inducing Political Bias into LLMs\nJiang et al. (2022) finetune GPT-2 models for the\nliberals and conservatives, and probe the communi-\nties\u2019 stances towards different political targets and\nsocial groups using the corresponding finetuned\nmodels. In our study, we opt for instruction tuning\n(Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al.,\n2022) over the traditional finetuning approach to\nembed political biases into the language model.\nThe primary motivation behind this choice is ef-\nficiency and versatility. Finetuning would have\nnecessitated the development and maintenance of\ntwo distinct models, one for liberal and another\nfor conservative viewpoints. This not only doubles\nthe resource requirements but also complicates the\ndeployment and application process. In contrast,\ninstruction tuning allows us to train a single model\nthat can adapt to different political biases based on\nthe instructions provided.\nWe finetune the model with instructions in Fig-\nure 1. For a liberal tweet, we indicate in the instruc-\ntion that it is a liberal/left/Democratic perspective,\nand we randomly select one of the three terms to\nmake the instruction more diverse. Likewise, for a\nconservative tweet, we randomly select one term\nfrom conservative/right/Conservative to indicate\nthe ideology. If the tweet contains a named entity\nin it, we specify that the perspective is regarding\nthe recognized entity.\nPartisanship-aware instruction tuning not only\nInstruction:Generatealiberal/left/Democratic/conservative/right/Conservativeperspectivetowards[entity].Output:[Tweet].Instruction:Generatealiberal/left/Democratic/conservative/right/Conservativeperspective.Output:[Tweet].(a)(b)Figure 1: Instructions for tuning the LLM. (a) The in-\nstruction if a named entity is recognized in the tweet.\n(b) The instruction if a named entity is not recognized\nin the tweet.\nstreamlines the training process but also enhances\nthe model\u2019s flexibility. It enables the model to\ngenerate responses across the political spectrum as\nindicated in the instruction, without the need for\nswitching between different models. Furthermore,\nit aligns with the evolving nature of political dis-\ncourse, where the distinction between liberal and\nconservative views can be nuanced and context-\ndependent. By using instruction tuning, our model\ncan more adeptly navigate these subtleties, provid-\ning insights that are both nuanced and comprehen-\nsive.\nAfter instruction tuning, we probe partisan per-\nspectives from the model using the same instruction\n(Figure 1), on a diverse set of polarized issues.\n3.2 Assessing the Generated Perspectives\nfrom LLMs\nTo capture how well the finetuned LLM anticipate\npartisan reactions to controversies, we measure\nand compare three factors, including stances, emo-\ntions, and moral foundations (MFs), inherent in\nthe model-generated perspectives and real-world\nperspectives. This comparative analysis serves two\nkey purposes: first, it helps in assessing how closely\nthe model mimics real-world political discourse;\nsecond, it provides insights into the nuances of\npolitical biases as captured by the model. By ana-\nlyzing these three dimensions, we aim to capture\na holistic view of political discourse that extends\nbeyond mere content to the underlying sentiments\nand moral principles.\n3.2.1 Mining Text Features\nDetecting Issues. To better compare the model\ngeneration with real-world, we focus on certainsignificant and popular wedge issues. We extract\nthese issues from each real dataset (see \u00a74). We\nuse a weakly-supervised method described in (Rao\net al., 2023). This method first harvests relevant\nkeywords from Wikipedia pages discussing these\nissues, then use SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011)\nto identify distinctive keywords and phrases that\nare relevant to a specific issue, and lastly detect\nthe issues discussed using the presence of these\nkeywords and phrases in each tweet.\nMeasuring stances. Political discourse is fun-\ndamentally about positions or stances on various\nissues (He et al., 2022; Allaway and Mckeown,\n2020). Understanding the stance embedded in a\ntweet\u2014whether it supports, opposes, or remains\nneutral towards an issue\u2014is essential for gauging\nthe political bias of the language model. It helps\nin quantifying the model\u2019s alignment with typical\nliberal or conservative viewpoints on key issues,\nproviding a direct measure of the success of our\ninstruction tuning process. We measure stance of\na piece of text towards the target discussed by it.\nFor datasets that do not provide the stances of the\ninstances, we capture the stance by ChatGPT (gpt-\n3.5-turbo) using the following prompt: \u201cGiven the\nfollowing statement and the target, infer the stance\nof the statement towards the target. Answer with\nonly one word: neutral, positive, or negative.\u201d\nMeasuring emotions. Emotions are a power-\nful element in political communication (vanKleef\net al., 2016). They often drive the persuasive power\nof messages and can influence public opinion. By\nanalyzing the emotional content of tweets, we can\nuncover the affective strategies employed in polit-\nical messaging. It aids in understanding not just\nwhat is being said, but how it is being conveyed\nemotionally, which is a critical aspect of political\nbias and rhetoric. We use a state-of-the-art lan-\nguage model SpanEmo (Alhuzali et al., 2021), fine-\ntuned on the SemEval 2018 1e-c data (Mohammad\net al., 2018). This transformer-based model outper-\nforms prior methods by learning the correlations\namong the emotions. It measures anticipation ,joy,\nlove,trust,optimism ,anger ,disgust ,fear,sadness ,\npessimism andsurprise .\nMeasuring moral foundations. Moral Foun-\ndations Theory (Haidt et al., 2007) posits that in-\ndividuals\u2019 moral perspectives are built upon spe-\ncific foundational values. In the realm of politics,\nthese foundations often underlie the reasoning be-\nhind certain stances and emotional responses. An-\nalyzing tweets for moral foundations allows us to\ndelve deeper into the moral reasoning that charac-\nterizes liberal and conservative ideologies. This\ndimension is crucial for understanding the deeper,\nvalue-driven layers of political discourse that a lan-\nguage model might capture or miss. We quantify\nthe moral sentiments of tweets along five dimen-\nsions: dislike of suffering ( care/harm ), dislike of\ncheating ( fairness /cheating ), group loyalty ( loy-\nalty/betrayal ), respect of authority and tradition\n(authority /subversion ), and concerns with purity\nand contamination ( purity /degradation ). We fine-\ntune a transformer-based model on diverse training\ndata (see (Guo et al., 2023) for details). The large\namount and the variety of topics in our training\ndata helps mitigate the data distribution shift dur-\ning inference.\n3.2.2 Assessing the Alignment of Model\nGenerations with Real-World\nLetf\u2208 {ST,EMO,MF}denote one of the three\ntextual features (stances, emotions, and moral foun-\ndations), and C(f) ={c1(f), c2(f), ....c M(f)}\ndenotes the Mclasses in f. For example, if f=\nST, then C(f) ={negative ,neutral ,positive }. Af-\nter measuring fof a corpus D={t1, t2, ....t N}con-\nsisting of Ntext instances, where tirepresents\nan instance, we have the probability distribution\nof the classes P(f) ={p1(f), p2(f), ...., p M(f)},\nwhere pi(f) = n(ci(f))/Nandn(ci(f))rep-\nresents the number of instances assigned to\nclass ci(f). Note that for emotion detection\nand moral foundation detection, a text instance\ncan be assigned to multiple classes. P(f) =\n{\u00afp1(f),\u00afp2(f), ...., \u00afpM(f)}represents the normal-\nized distribution of P(f)wherePM\ni=1\u00afpi= 1.\nPartisan bias divergence assessment. To\nquantify the partisan alignment between model-\ngenerated and real-world data, we compute the\nKullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), denoted as\nDKL(P(f)||Q(f)), where P(f)represents the\nnormalized probability distribution of feature f\nin the model-generated data, and Q(f)represents\nthe distribution in the real-world data. A lower\nvalue of KLD indicates a closer alignment of the\nmodel and the real-world data. For each feature\nf, we compute the KLD separately for liberal and\nconservative datasets, across different topics.\nPartisan class tendency prediction. For each\nclassci(f)\u2208C(f), we determine the probabilities\nplib\ni(f)andpcon\ni(f)for liberals and conservatives\nrespectively for the real-world data. The model\u2019sprediction for each class cfor liberals and conserva-\ntives, denoted as qlib\ni(f)andqcon\ni(f), is compared\nagainst the real-world data. We calculate the accu-\nracy for each class as Acc(ci(f)) = 1 ifsign(qlib\ni\u2212\nqcon\ni) = sign(plib\ni\u2212pcon\ni), else Acc(ci(f)) = 0 .\nThe overall accuracy for all classes of feature f\nis given by1\nMPM\ni=1Acc(ci(f)), representing the\nmodels\u2019s ability to correctly preditc class-based par-\ntisan tendencies. A higher overall accuracy score\nsinifies the model\u2019s proficiency in capturing spe-\ncific class-based tendencies within each political\ngroup.\n4 Data\n4.1 Partisan Tweets\nThe partisan Twitter dataset (Jiang et al., 2022)\nis used to finetune the LLM with instructions. It\ncontains 4.7M tweets for liberals and conservatives\nrespectively, range from 2019-01-01 to 2020-04-\n10. The tweets are from 1M U.S. Twitter users who\nwere active around the 2020 presidential election.\nThe political affiliation of the users are identified\nby the political accounts they follow. The dataset\ncover a wide range of topics, with no specific focus\non certain issues.\nNamed entity recognition in partisan tweets.\nTo induce political bias into the LLM, we fine-\ntune the model with real-world perspectives on var-\nious entities. To identify the the entities discussed\nin the tweets, we use named entity recognition1.\nWe filter out the entities with fewer than 2 letters\nand those with fewer than 100 occurrences in the\ndataset. The top 10 entities are \u201cTrump\u201d, \u201cGod\u201d,\n\u201cAmerica\u201d, \u201cDemocrats\u201d, \u201cAmerican\u201d, \u201cObama\u201d,\n\u201cBernie\u201d, \u201cAmericans\u201d, \u201cCongress\u201d, and \u201cChina\u201d.\n9.2%tweets have at least one recognized entity in\nthem. If a tweet has multiple associated named\nentities, we randomly choose one to create the in-\nstruction for finetuning.\n4.2 COVID-19 Tweets\nWe first test our tweet generation results by com-\nparing to a publicly available COVID-19 dataset\n(Chen et al., 2020) consisting of 270 million tweets\ngenerated by 2.1 million geo-located users in the\nUnited States posted between January 21, 2020\nand November 4, 2021. These tweets contained\none or more COVID-19-related keywords, such as\ncoronavirus, pandemic, and Wuhan, among oth-\ners. We utilized Carmen (Dredze et al., 2013), a\n1https://huggingface.co/dslim/bert-base-NER\ngeo-location identification technique for Twitter\ndata to assign tweets to locations within US. We\nuse the method discussed in (Rao et al., 2021) to\nestimate the ideology of individual users. This\nmethod relies on the political leaning of URLs\nusers share accourding to Media Bias-Fact Check\n(MBFC) (Check, 2023). Using the issue detection\nmethod we described above, we have determined\nto look at five major issues during the pandemic:\n(1) COVID-19 origins, (2) Lockdowns, (3) Mask-\ning, (4) Education and (5) Vaccines. After filtering\noriginal tweets (as opposed to retweets and quoted\ntweets) from users with identified political affilia-\ntion, tweets posted within the United States, and\ntweets categorized to one of the five issues, there\nare 8.2M tweets left.\nWhen generating perspectives from the finetuned\nLLM on the five issues, we frame the [entity] as\n1) COVID-19 origins, 2) COVID-19 lockdowns,\n3) COVID-19 mask mandates, 4) school closures\nduring COVID-19, and 5) COVID-19 vaccines. For\nstance detection, we use the same framing of the\nentities as targets, except for the first issue, which\nwe frame as \u201corigins of COVID-19 as a leak from\na virology research lab\u201d.\n4.3 Abortion Tweets\nWe collect another large-scale Twitter dataset, com-\nprising of tweets about abortion rights between\nJanuary 1, 2022 to January 6, 2023. The dataset\nwas collected using a list of keywords and hashtags\nthat reflect both sides of the abortion rights debate\nin the United States. This dataset includes approxi-\nmately 12 million tweets generated by about 1 mil-\nlion users in the United States. We used the same\ntechnique to detect the geo-location, the user politi-\ncal ideology and issues as for the COVID-19 tweet\ndata. In this dataset, we focus on the following five\nmajor issues: (1) Religious concern, (2) Body au-\ntonomy, (3) Fetal personhood, (4) Women\u2019s health\nand (5) Exceptions to abortion and fetal viability.\n4.4 Congress Tweets\nThis dataset is a collection of 2,050 English-\nlanguage tweets by members of US Congress (John-\nson and Goldwasser, 2018) from 2015 to 2015. By\nhaving these real tweets from Democratic and Re-\npublican politicians, we can compare the partisan-\nship polarization in our generated tweets and that in\nreal life. The dataset covers six different political\ntopics: (1) abortion, (2) the Affordable Care Act,(3) guns, (4) immigration, (5) LGBTQ rights, and\n(6) terrorism.\n5 Experiments\n5.1 Experimental Setup\nInstruction tuning. We use Llama-2-7b-chat-hf2\nas the backend LLM. To finetune it with instruc-\ntions, we use QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023). We\nfinetune the model for 3 epochs, with batch size\n2200 and learning rate 2e\u22124. For each input in-\nstruction, we truncate it at length 48. The model is\nfinetuned on a Tesla A100 GPU with 80GB mem-\nory for 90h.\nText generation. After finetuning the LLM\nwith instructions, we prompt it to generate 100\nresponses on each issue, using the same instruction\nas for training (Figure 1(a)). We repeat the gener-\nating processes for 10 times with different random\nseeds. As a result, for each issue, there are 1,000\ngenerated responses on it.\nBaseline. To gain a deeper understanding of how\nfinetuning affects the model\u2019s partisan reactions to\ncontroversies, we use the original pretrained (but\nunfinetuned) LLaMA2 as the baseline.\n5.2 Analysis of Stances\nWe present the results of partisan bias divergence\nassessment and partisan class tendency prediction\nin Table 1 and 2. Please refer to Appendix A for\nthe distributions of the class probabilities for the\nthree datasets.\nThe finetuned model (FT LLaMA), enriched\nwith a partisan tweets dataset from a politically\nvibrant timeframe, has demonstrated a refined pro-\nficiency in reflecting nuanced political discourse.\nThe finetuned model\u2019s predictive accuracy in stance\ndetection shows a substantial understanding of the\ncharged narratives that defined the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic\u2019s progression, particularly in politically sen-\nsitive issues like \"Lockdown\" and \"Vaccine.\" This\nhighlights the model\u2019s capacity to adapt to the shift-\ning partisan perspectives as the pandemic unfolded.\nIn the abortion rights debate, the finetuned\nmodel\u2019s performance in capturing clear-cut parti-\nsan divides suggests a successful absorption of the\ndataset\u2019s strong ideological contentions. Its ability\nto accurately reflect class-based tendencies within\nsuch a polarized topic is indicative of the model\u2019s\nadvanced representation of complex societal issues.\n2https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\nContrastingly, the pretrained model (Pre\nLLaMA), while generally aligning closer with real-\nworld data in terms of Kullback-Leibler Divergence\n(KLD), indicates a baseline from which the pre-\ntrained model enhancements can be measured. The\ndivergence in performance between the two mod-\nels, especially noted in the Congress dataset, under-\nlines the finetuning\u2019s impact on the model\u2019s ability\nto mirror the subtle nuances of real congressional\ndiscourse.\nThis analysis elucidates that while the finetuned\nmodel has gained a deeper understanding of polit-\nical biases, it also brings to light the importance\nof cautious application. The observed differences\nin KLD and accuracy across topics may signal the\nchallenges inherent in modeling complex and dy-\nnamic political discussions. These findings rein-\nforce the necessity for ethical consideration in the\ndeployment of language models within politically\nsensitive contexts.\nDataset TopicMethod\nPre LLaMA FT LLaMA\nLib Con Lib Con\nCOVIDOrigin 0.04 0.10 0.03 0.03\nLockdown 0.02 0.12 0.04 0.01\nMasking 0.16 0.10 0.03 0.01\nEducation 0.30 0.29 0.23 0.17\nVaccine 0.06 0.13 0.01 0.12\nAbortionReligion 0.37 0.01 0.34 0.43\nAutonomy 0.31 0.12 0.29 0.12\nFetal 0.33 0.09 0.39 0.55\nHealth 0.09 0.11 0.17 0.27\nException 0.04 0.48 0.07 0.57\nCongressAbortion 1.08 0.54 0.52 1.09\nACA 0.04 0.18 0.22 0.06\nGuns 0.06 0.06 0.50 0.33\nImmig 0.42 0.17 0.37 0.18\nLGBTQ 0.26 0.29 0.44 0.21\nISIS 0.09 1.25 0.17 1.44\nTable 1: Results (KL Divergence) of partisan bias diver-\ngence assessment for stance detection.

Please refer to Appendix A for\nthe distributions of the class probabilities for the\nthree datasets.\nOn partisan bias divergence assessment, the fine-\ntuned model generally exhibits a lower KLD across\nvarious topics, suggesting a closer alignment with\nthe real-world emotional distributions. This is\nmost notable in topics like \"Autonomy\" and \"Fe-\ntal\" within the Abortion dataset, where the model\ndemonstrates a nuanced grasp of the complex emo-\ntional undertones.\nThe accuracy results on partisan class tendency\nclassification further substantiate the finetuned\nmodel\u2019s proficiency in class-based emotional pre-\ndiction. It shows significant improvement in match-\ning the real-world data\u2019s class distribution, espe-\ncially in the Congress dataset topics of \"Abortion\"\nand \"Guns\". This suggests that the finetuning pro-\ncess has effectively captured the emotive expres-\nsions characteristic of partisan discussions around\nthese divisive issues.\nFigures 5 and 6 depicting the probability distri-\nbution of emotion classes reveal that the finetuned\nmodel often generates a distribution that reflects a\nmore distinct emotional profile compared to the pre-\ntrained model. For instance, the finetuned model\u2019s\ndistribution for \"Health\" in the Abortion dataset\nemphasizes specific emotions more heavily, align-\ning with the intense debate and emotional rhetoric\npresent in the real-world data.\nThe discrepancy between the models in topics\nwhere the pretrained model performs better, such\nas \"Religion\" in the Abortion dataset and \"ACA\"\nin the Congress dataset, may indicate the inherent\ncomplexity of these issues. The pretrained model\u2019s\ndistributions appear to be less specific, perhaps\nreflecting a broader, less targeted understanding of\nemotional expression in political discourse, which\ncan sometimes more closely mirror the varied real-\nworld responses.\nDataset TopicMethod\nPre LLaMA FT LLaMA\nLib Con Lib Con\nAbortionReligion 1.59 1.95 0.44 1.33\nAutonomy 1.90 1.91 0.29 0.31\nFetal 2.33 2.35 0.27 0.41\nHealth 0.92 1.37 0.16 .016\nException 2.14 1.86 0.57 0.57\nCongressAbortion 1.51 1.08 0.13 0.23\nACA 1.20 0.44 0.93 0.27\nGuns 0.99 0.77 0.37 1.04\nImmig 0.98 1.07 0.26 0.04\nLGBTQ 0.92 0.94 0.22 0.37\nISIS 0.26 0.29 0.44 0.21\nTable 3: Results (KL Divergence) of partisan bias di-\nvergence assessment for emotion detection.

Within the Congress\ndataset, the finetuned model\u2019s lower KLD scores\nin \u201cLGBTQ\u201d and \u201cImmigration\u201d topics indicate a\nsubstantial grasp of the moral narratives as they are\nexpressed in partisan political dialogue. The higher\nKLD in \u201cGuns\u201d, however, suggests a divergence\nthat could stem from a broader spectrum of moral\nreasoning not fully captured by the model.\nThe accuracy results for moral foundation class\ntendency classification further demonstrate the fine-\ntuned model\u2019s enhanced predictive capabilities.\nParticularly in the Congress dataset, the finetuned\nmodel exhibits improved accuracy in aligning with\nclass-based moral foundations, as seen in the \u201cAbor-\ntion\u201d and \u201cACA\u201d topics.\nThe probability distribution for moral founda-\ntions reveal the finetuned model\u2019s ability to gen-\nerate moral profiles with distinct emphases, res-\nonating with the polarized moral stances evident in\npolitical discussions on these topics. This is espe-\ncially pronounced in the nuanced and emotionally\ncharged debates surrounding \"Abortion\" and \"Im-\nmigration,\" where the model\u2019s outputs show a clear\npartisan tilt in moral reasoning.\nThe variances in performance between the fine-\ntuned model and pretrained model highlight the im-\npact of finetuning on the model\u2019s ability to navigate\nthe moral landscape of political discourse. The fine-\ntuned model\u2019s closer mimicry of real-world data\nunderscores its potential as a tool for analyzing and\nunderstanding the moral underpinnings of political\nrhetoric.\nDataset TopicMethod\nPre LLaMA FT LLaMA\nLib Con Lib Con\nCOVIDOrigin 0.62 0.24 0.14 0.19\nLockdown 0.58 0.63 0.08 0.08\nMasking 0.64 0.77 0.31 0.27\nEducation 0.25 0.58 0.12 0.24\nVaccine 0.48 0.53 0.18 0.48\nCongressAbortion 3.51 2.39 0.53 1.17\nACA 0.52 0.28 0.49 0.25\nGuns 1.97 2.78 0.89 1.90\nImmig 0.97 1.02 0.30 0.47\nLGBTQ 1.35 3.46 0.16 1.56\nISIS 2.08 1.36 1.07 0.55\nTable 5: Results (KL Divergence) of partisan bias di-\nvergence assessment for moral foundation detection.\nModel-generated data and real-world data are compared\nacross different topics from different datasets, on both\npartisan lines.

By fine-\ntuning a single LLM with bipartisan instructions,\nwe have demonstrated its ability to reflect a broad\nspectrum of political ideologies, particularly in\nemotional expression and moral reasoning. How-\never, challenges in accurate stance detection high-\nlight the complexities of political communication\nmodeling. Our novel analytical framework, includ-\ning the Partisan Bias Divergence Assessment and\nthe Partisan Class Tendency Prediction tasks, of-\nfers a comprehensive approach to evaluating the\nmodel\u2019s alignment with real-world political ideolo-\ngies.\nLooking forward, refining stance detection ca-\npabilities remains a priority, potentially through\nintegrating more diverse datasets and enhancing\ncontextual understanding. Future research could\nalso explore adapting the model for cross-cultural\nand multilingual contexts, addressing ethical con-\ncerns and inherent biases, and expanding its ap-\nplication to real-time political discourse analysis.\nThese directions not only promise to strengthen the\nmodel\u2019s utility in political discourse analysis butDataset TopicMethod\nPre LLaMA FT LLaMA\nCOVIDOrigin 0.40 0.70\nLockdown 0.50 0.90\nMasking 0.60 0.80\nEducation 0.50 0.80\nVaccine 0.60 0.80\nCongressAbortion 0.60 0.60\nACA 0.80 0.80\nGuns 0.60 0.80\nImmig 0.50 0.60\nLGBTQ 0.40 0.70\nISIS 0.50 0.60\nTable 6: Results (accuracy) of partisan class tendency\nclassification for moral foundation detection.

The widespread attention\non detecting and characterizing deceptive information\nhas been motivated by considerable political and social\nbacklashes in the real world. As a matter of fact, social\nmedia platforms exhibit peculiar characteristics, with re-\nspect to traditional news outlets, which have been partic-\nularly favorable to the proliferation of false news. They\nalso present unique challenges for all kind of potential\ninterventions on the subject.\nAs this issue becomes of global concern, it is also\ngaining more attention in academia. The aim of this\nsurvey is to offer a comprehensive study on the recent\nadvances in terms of detection, characterization and mit-\nigation of false news that propagate on social media, as\nwell as the challenges and the open questions that await\nfuture research on the \ufb01eld. We use a data-driven ap-\nproach, focusing on a classi\ufb01cation of the features that\nare used in each study to characterize false information\nand on the datasets used for instructing classi\ufb01cation\nmethods. At the end of the survey, we highlight emerg-\ning approaches that look most promising for addressing\nfalse news.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis section serves as an introduction to the topic\nof false news on social media; we provide some ter-\nminology, describe the social media platforms where\nfalse news are most widespread, overview psycho-\nlogical and social factors that are involved, discuss\nsome of the e\u000bects on the real world and some open\nchallenges. Finally, we discuss the focus of our sur-\nvey in comparison with other existing surveys.\n1.1 Terminology\nIn recent years, the terms false news andfake\nnews have been broadly and interchangeably used\nto indicate information which can take a variety\nof \ravors: disinformation, misinformation, hoaxes,propaganda, satire, rumors, click-bait and junk news.\nWe provide next a list of the de\fnitions encountered\nin the literature, which is by no means exhaustive.\nWhile there is common agreement that these terms\nindicate deceptive information, we believe that an\nagreed and precise de\fnition is still missing.\nSome researchers de\fne false news as news arti-\ncles that are potentially or intentionally misleading\nfor the readers, as they are veri\fable and deliber-\nately false [3, 63]. They can represent fabricated\ninformation which mimics traditional news content\nin form, but not in the intent or the organizational\nprocess [32]. It has been highlighted how the neol-\nogism fake news is usually employed with a politi-\ncal connotation with respect to the more traditional\nfalse news [32, 76].\nMisinformation is de\fned as information that\nis inaccurate or misleading [32]. It could spread un-\nintentionally [14] due to honest reporting mistakes\nor incorrect interpretations [22, 13]. In contrast,\ndisinformation is false information that is spread\ndeliberately to deceive people [32] or promote bi-\nased agenda [74].\nSimilarly to disinformation, hoaxes are inten-\ntionally conceived to deceive readers; qualitatively,\nthey are described as humorous and mischievous (as\nde\fned in The Oxford English Dictionary) [31].\nSatirical news are written with the primary pur-\npose of entertaining or criticizing the readers, but\nsimilarly to hoaxes they can be harmful when shared\nout of context [8, 54]. They are characterized by hu-\nmor, irony and absurdity and they can mimic gen-\nuine news [55].\nPropaganda is de\fned as information that tries\nto in\ruence the emotions, the opinions and the ac-\ntions of target audiences by means of deceptive, se-\nlectively omitted and one-sided messages. The pur-\npose can be political, ideological or religious [74,\n73].\nClick-bait is de\fned as low quality journalism\nwhich is intended to attract tra\u000ec and monetize\n1arXiv:1902.07539v3  [cs.SI]  28 Jan 2020\nvia advertising revenue [74].\nThe term junk news is more generic and it ag-\ngregates several types of information, from propa-\nganda to hyper-partisan or conspiratorial news and\ninformation. It usually refers to the overall content\nthat pertains to a publisher rather than a single ar-\nticle [79].\nFinally, we came across several di\u000berent de\fni-\ntions for rumor . Brie\ry, a rumor can be de\fned as\na claim which did not originate from news events\nand that has not been veri\fed while it spreads from\none person to another [66, 3, 63]. As there exists\na huge literature on the subject, we refer the inter-\nested reader to [82] for an extensive review.\n1.2 Social media platforms as news outlets\nThe appearance of false news on news outlets is\nby no means a new phenomenon: in 1835 a series\nof articles published on the New York Sun, known\nas the Great Moon Hoax , described the discovery of\nlife on the moon [3]. Nowadays the world is expe-\nriencing much more elaborated hoaxes; social me-\ndia platforms have favored the proliferation of false\nnews with much broader impact.\nMost of nowadays news consumption has shifted\ntowards online social media, where it is more com-\nfortable to ingest, share and further discuss news\nwith friends or other readers [19, 65, 63]. As pro-\nducing content online is easier and faster, barriers\nfor entering online media industry have dropped\n[3]. This has conveyed the dissemination of low\nquality news, which reject traditional journalistic\nstandards and lack of third-party \fltering and fact-\nchecking [3]. These factors, together with a de-\ncline of general trust and con\fdence in traditional\nmass media, are the primary drivers for the explo-\nsive growth of false news on social media [3, 32].\nTwo main motivations have been proposed as to\nexplain the rise of disinformation websites: 1) a pe-\ncuniary one, where viral news articles draw signi\f-\ncant advertising revenue and 2) a more ideological\none, as providers of false news usually aim to in\ru-\nence public opinion on particular topics [3]. Besides,\nthe presence of malicious agents such as bots and\ntrolls has been highlighted as another major cause\nto the spreading of misinformation [60, 30].\nWe refer the interested reader to [3] for an ex-\ntensive analysis of various factors explaining the\nspreading of false news in social media platforms.\n1.3 Human factors\nAside from the technical aspects of social net-\nwork platforms, the research community has lever-\naged a set of psychological, cognitive and social as-pects which are considered as key contributors to\nthe proliferation of false news on social media.\nHumans have no natural expertise at distinguish-\ning real from false news [63, 31]. Two major psycho-\nlogical theories explain this di\u000eculty, respectively\ncalled naive realism and the con\frmation bias .\nThe former refers to the tendency of users to believe\nthat their view is the only accurate one, whereas\nthose who disagree are biased or uninformed [50].\nThe latter, also called selective exposure , is the in-\nclination to prefer (and receive) information which\ncon\frms existing views [39]. As a consequence, pre-\nsenting factual information to correct false beliefs is\nusually unhelpful and may increase misperception\n[40].\nSome studies also mention the importance of so-\ncial identity theory [5] and normative social\nin\ruence [4]; accordingly, users tend to perform\nactions which are socially safer, thus consuming and\nspreading information items that agree with the\nnorms established within the community.\nAll these factors are related to a certain extent\nto the well-known echo chamber (or\flter bubble )\ne\u000bect, which gives rise to the formation of homo-\ngeneous clusters where individuals are similar peo-\nple, that share and discuss similar ideas. These\ngroups are usually characterized by extremely po-\nlarized opinions as they are insulated from opposite\nviews and contrary perspectives [67, 66, 42]; it has\nbeen shown that these close-knit communities are\nthe primary driver of misinformation di\u000busion [10].\nSocial technologies amplify these phenomena as\na result of algorithmic bias , as they promote per-\nsonalized content based on the preferences of users\nwith the unique goal of maximizing engagement [32,\n14].\n1.4 Effects on the real world\nWe can explain the explosive growth of attention\non false news in light of a series of striking e\u000bects\nthat the world has recently experienced.\nPolitics indeed accounts for most of the atten-\ntion on false news, as highlighted in [76]. The 2016\nUS presidential elections have o\u000ecially popularized\nthe term fake news to the degree that it has been\nsuggested that Donald Trump may not have been\nelected president were it not for the e\u000bects of false\nnews (and the alleged interference of Russian trolls)\n[3]. Likewise, recent studies have shown that false\nnews have also impacted 2016 UK Brexit referen-\ndum [26] and the 2017 France presidential elections\n[15].\nOver and above we may recall the \fnance stock\ncrisis caused by a false tweet concerning president\n2\nObama [49], the shootout occurred in a restaurant\nas a consequence of the Pizzagate fake news [63]\nand the di\u000bused mistrust towards vaccines during\nEbola and Zika epidemics [16, 36].\n1.5 Challenges\nWe mention here a few challenges which charac-\nterize the \fght against false news on social media,\nas highlighted by recent research on the subject.\nFirstly, false news are deliberately created to de-\nceive the readers and to mimic traditional news out-\nlets, resulting in an adversarial scenario where it\nis very hard to distinguish true news articles from\nfalse ones [63, 60].\nSecondly, the rate and the volumes at which\nfalse news are produced overturn the possibility to\nfact-check and verify all items in a rigorous way, i.e.\nby sending articles to human experts for veri\fcation\n[60]. This also raises concern on developing tools\nfor the early detection of false news as to prevent\nthem from spreading in the network [33].\nFinally, social media platforms impose limitations\n[61] on the collection of public data and as of today\nthe community has produced very limited training\ndatasets, which typically do not include all the in-\nformation relative to false news.\n1.6 Survey Focus\nAside from a few works appeared in 2015 and\n2016 [8, 55, 54], we build our survey with a focus on\nthe last two years, as most of the research on false\nnews has developed in 2017 and 2018. Moreover,\nwe concentrate on a few social networks which at-\ntracted most of the research focus: Twitter ,Face-\nbook andSina Weibo1. This is mainly due to the\npublic availability of data and the existence of pro-\nprietary application programming interfaces (API)\nwhich ease the burden of collecting data. As a \f-\nnal remark, we considered works covering solely the\nEnglish language, as this is the prominent approach\nin the \feld.\nSince our analysis is focused on the aforemen-\ntioned social media, issues concerning false news on\ncollaborative platforms such as Wikipedia and\nYelp (namely fake reviews, spam detection, etc.)\nare out of the scope of this survey; we thus refer\nthe reader to [30] for an overview of related re-\nsearch. We suggest [34] for a comprehensive review\nof the research that focuses, instead, on rumors\ndetection and resolution , as we observed that\nmany aspects are shared with our subject. Auto-\nmated fact-checking is another related topic; it\n1A popular Chinese microblogging website which is a\nhybrid between Facebook and Twitter.deals with veri\fcation rather than search of false\nnews on social media, and we refer the interested\nreader to [69]. Finally, we suggest [16] to the read-\ners who may be interested in the research on social\nbots .\n2. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND\nMETHODOLOGY\nOur presentation of research about false news on\nsocial media is divided into three parts. We \frst\ndescribe a huge body of works whose objective is\nto detect false news, then we describe works that\nexplain the models of di\u000busion of false news and\n\fnally works that attempt to mitigate their e\u000bects.\nWe start our survey by considering a variegated\nlandscape of research contributions which focus on\nthedetection of false news. Their taxonomy, pre-\nsented in Table 1, is based on two aspects: employed\ntechnique and considered features.\nThe problem has been traditionally formulated\nas a supervised binary classi\fcation problem, start-\ning with datasets consisting of labeled news articles,\nrelated tweets and Facebook posts which allow to\ncapture di\u000berent features, from content based ones\n(text, image, video) to those pertaining to the social\ncontext (di\u000busion networks, users' pro\fle, metadata)\nand, in some cases, to external knowledge bases\n(Wikipedia, Google News). Labels carrying the clas-\nsi\fcation into true and false news are typically ob-\ntained via fact-checking organizations or by manual\nveri\fcation of researchers themselves. Appendix A\ncomparatively describes the datasets used as ground\ntruth for false news classi\fcation.\nFor what concerns the classi\fcation method, a\nwide range of techniques are used, from traditional\nmachine learning (Logistic Regression, Support Vec-\ntor Machines, Random Forest) to deep learning (Con-\nvolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks) and to\nother models (Matrix Factorization, Bayesian Infer-\nence).\nSection 4 describes the literature which focuses on\nthecharacterization of misinformation spreading\non social media. This is achieved by reconstructing\nthe di\u000busion networks pertaining to false news, as\nresulting from multiple users' interactions on the\nplatforms.\nFinally, Section 5 presents a few works which\ntackle the problem of mitigation against false news\non social media, following recent announcements\nfrom major platforms to favor crowd-sourcing ini-\ntiatives against malicious information [27].\n3.

Comparative description of twenty studies for false news detection, in terms of method and consid-\nered features.\ncontributions which focus only on content-based fea-\ntures; we next describe contributions which consider\nonly the social context and \fnally those that con-\nsider both aspects.\n3.1 Content-based\nIn this section we consider research contributions\nwhich are content-based, meaning that they ana-\nlyze solely the textual content of news articles, e.g.\nbody, title, source.\nStance detection as a helpful \frst step towards\nfake news detection was introduced during the 2017\nFake News Challenge Stage 12(FNC-1) organized\nbyD. Pomerleau et al. (2017) [46] (cf. A.5). The\ngoal was to classify the stance of an entire news\narticle relative to its headline, i.e. document-level\nstance detection. Neural networks are employed\nby three top-performing systems, respectively Talos\n(Baird et al. (2017) [6]), Athene ( Hanselowski et al.\n(2017) [20]) and UCL Machine Reading ( Baird et\nal. (2017) [51]). These models rely on a combi-\nnation of lexical features, including Bag-of-Words,\ntopic modeling and word similarity features. An\nextensive analysis of these approaches, with experi-\nments on their ability to generalize on unseen data,\nis provided by Hanselowski et al. (2018) [21].\nWang et al. (2017) [77] consider a multi-label\nclassi\fcation task on the Liar dataset (cf. A.9),\none of the \frst datasets introduced in the litera-\nture. This includes several textual and metadata\nfeatures, such as the speaker a\u000eliation or the source\nnewspaper, and labels are based on the six degrees\nof truth provided by the PolitiFact3fact-checking\norganization. They solve the classi\fcation problem\nby considering several machine learning and deep\nlearning methods, from logistic regression to convo-\nlutional and recurrent neural networks.\nA deep textual analysis is carried out in Horne\n2http://www.fakenewschallenge.org\n3https://www.politifact.com/at al. (2017) [24], where authors examine the body\nand title (cf. A.1) of di\u000berent categories of news ar-\nticles (true, false and satire), extracting complexity,\npsychological and stylistic features. They highlight\nthe relevance of each aspect in distinct classi\fca-\ntion tasks, using a linear Support Vector Machine\n(SVM), \fnally inferring that real news are substan-\ntially di\u000berent from false news in title whereas satire\nand false news are similar in content. They also ap-\nply the Elaboration Likelihood Model [41] to news\ncategories, and suggest that consuming false news\nrequires little energy and cognition, making them\nmore appealing to the readers.\nA neural network model is also presented by Popat\net al. (2018) [47], who build a framework to classify\ntrue and false claims, and also provide self-evidence\nfor the credibility assessment. They evaluate their\nmodel against some state-of-the-art techniques on\ndi\u000berent collections of news articles (cf. A.3 and\nA.10) and they show examples of explainable re-\nsults enabled by the attention mechanism embed-\nded in the model, which highlights the words in the\ntext that are more relevant for the classi\fcation out-\ncome.\nPerez-Rosas et al. (2018) [45] produce a dataset\nof false and true news articles (cf. A.4) and consider\ndi\u000berent sets of linguistic features (extracted from\nthe body of news articles) namely ngrams, LIWC\n[44], punctuation, syntax and readability. On top\nof these features they train a linear SVM classi-\n\fer, showing di\u000berent performances depending on\nthe considered feature. They suggest that compu-\ntational linguistics can e\u000bectively aide in the process\nof automatic detection of false news.\nThe goal of Potthast et al. (2018) [48] is to assess\nthe style similarity of several categories of news, no-\ntably hyper-partisan, mainstream, satire and false.\nThe proposed methodology employs an algorithm\ncalled unmasking [29], which is a meta learning ap-\nproach originally intended for authorship veri\fca-\n4\ntion. They carry out several experiments comparing\ntopic and style-based features with a Random For-\nest classi\fer and they conclude that, while hyper-\npartisan, satire and mainstream news are well dis-\ntinguished, a style-based analysis alone is not e\u000bec-\ntive for detecting false news.\nFairbanks et al. (2018) [12] also aim to clas-\nsify false and true news, using a collection of ar-\nticles gathered from GDELT4); labels are manu-\nally crawled from a fact-checking website5. They\ncompare two di\u000berent models, a content-based one\nwhich uses a classi\fer on traditional textual fea-\ntures and a structural method that applies loopy\nbelief propagation [38] on a graph built from the\nlink structure of news articles. The conclusions in-\ndicate that by modeling just the text content of ar-\nticles it is possible to detect bias, but it not possible\nto identify false news.\nHosseini et al. (2018) [25] tackle the problem\nof distinguishing di\u000berent categories of false news\n(from satire to junk news), based only on the news\ncontent. They employ the Kaggle dataset (cf. A.8),\nwhere they consider up to six di\u000berent labels. Their\napproach involves a tensor decomposition of docu-\nments which aims to capture latent relationships be-\ntween articles and terms and the spatial/contextual\nrelations between terms. They further use an en-\nsemble method to leverage multiple decompositions\nin order to discover classes with higher homogeneity\nand lower outlier diversity. They outperform other\nstate-of-the-art clustering techniques and are able\nto correctly identify all categories of fake news.\n3.2 Context-based\nHere we describe research contributions which are\n(social) context-based in the sense that they focus\non information derived from social interactions be-\ntween users, e.g. likes, comment and (re)tweets, as\nto detect fake content.\nTacchini et al. (2017) [68] propose a technique\nto identify false news on the basis of users who liked\nthem on Facebook. They collect a set of posts and\nusers from both conspiracy theories and scienti\fc\npages and they build a dataset where each feature\nvector represents the set of users who liked a page.\nThey eventually compare logistic regression with\na (boolean crowdsourcing) harmonic algorithm for\nshowing that they are able to achieve high accuracy\nwith a little percentage of the entire training data.\nVolkova et al. (2017) [74] address the problem of\npredicting four sub-types of suspicious news: satire,\nhoaxes, click-bait and propaganda. They start from\n4https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n5https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/a (manually constructed) list of trusted and suspi-\ncious Twitter news accounts and they collect a set\nof tweets in the period of Brussels bombing in 2016.\nThey incorporate tweet text, several linguistic cues\n(bias, subjectivity, moral foundations) and user in-\nteractions in a fused neural network model which\nis compared against ad-hoc baselines trained on the\nsame features. They qualitatively analyze the char-\nacteristics of di\u000berent categories of news observing\nthe performances of the model.\nWang et al. (2018) [78] propose a multi-modal\nneural network model which extracts both textual\nand visual features from Twitter and Weibo conver-\nsations in order to detect false news items. Inspired\nby adversarial settings [18] they couple it with an\nevent discriminator , which they claim is able to re-\nmove event-speci\fc features and generalize to un-\nseen scenarios, where the number of events is spec-\ni\fed as a parameter. They evaluate the model on\ntwo custom datasets, but they compare it with ad-\nhoc baselines which are not conceived for false news\ndetection.\nWu et al. (2018) [80] instead concentrate on\nmodelling the propagation of messages carrying ma-\nlicious items in social networks. Therefore they\nbuild a custom dataset, re\recting both true and\nfalse news, by leveraging the Twitter API and the\nfact-checking website Snopes6. They \frst infer em-\nbeddings for users from the social graph and in turn\nuse a neural network model to classify news items.\nTo this extent they provide a new model to embed\na social network graph in a low-dimensional space\nand they construct a sequence classi\fer, using Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [23] to ana-\nlyze propagation pathways of messages. They show\nthat their model performs better than other state-\nof-the-art embedding techniques.\nPropagation of news items is also taken into ac-\ncount by Yu et al. (2018) [33], who use a combi-\nnation of convolutional and Gated Recurrent Units\n(GRU) [7] to model di\u000busion pathways as multivari-\nate time series, where each point corresponds to the\ncharacteristics of the user retweeting the news, and\nperform early detection of false news. The method\nis evaluated on two real-world datasets of sharing\ncascades (cf. A.11) showing better performances\nthan other state-of-the-art-techniques, which were\nnonetheless originally conceived for rumor resolu-\ntion.\nThe \frst unsupervised approach to false news de-\ntection is provided in Yang et al. (2019a) [81],\nwhere veracity of news and users' credibility are\ntreated as latent random variables in a Bayesian\n6https://www.snopes.com/\n5\nnetwork model, and the inference problem is solved\nby means of collapsed Gibbs sampling approach [53].\nThe method is evaluated on LIAR (cf. A.9) and\nBuzzFeedNews (cf. A.1) datasets, performing bet-\nter than other general truth discovery algorithms,\nnot explicitly designed for false news detection.\n3.3 Content and Context-based\nIn this section we describe research contributions\nwhich consider both news content and the associ-\nated social (context) interactions as to detect mali-\ncious information items.\nThe contribution of Ruchansky et al. (2017) [56]\nis a neural network model which incorporates the\ntext of (false and true) news articles, the responses\nthey receive in social networks and the source users\nthat promote them. The model is tested on Twitter\nand Weibo sharing cascades datasets (cf. A.11) and\nit is evaluated against other techniques conceived\nfor rumor detection. They \fnally present an analy-\nsis of users behaviours in terms of lag and activity\nshowing that the source is a promising feature for\nthe detection.\nInShu et al. (2017) [64] a tri-relationship among\npublishers, news items and users is employed in or-\nder to detect false news. Overall, user-news interac-\ntions and publisher-news relations are embedded us-\ning non-negative matrix factorization [43] and users\ncredibility scores. Several di\u000berent classi\fers are\nbuilt on top of the resulting features and perfor-\nmances are evaluated on the FakeNewsNet dataset\n(cf. A.6) against other state-of-the-art information\ncredibility algorithms. Results show that the social\ncontext could e\u000bectively be exploited to improve\nfalse news detection.\nVolkova et al. (2018) [73] focus on inferring dif-\nferent deceptive strategies (misleading, falsi\fcation)\nand di\u000berent types of deceptive news (propaganda,\ndisinformation, hoaxes). Extending their previous\nwork [74], they collect summaries, news pages and\nsocial media content (from Twitter) that refer to\ncon\frmed cases of disinformation. Besides tradi-\ntional content-based features (syntax and style) they\nemploy psycho-linguistic signals, e.g. biased lan-\nguage markers, moral foundations and connotations,\nto train di\u000berent classi\fers (from Random Forests\nto neural networks) in a multi-classi\fcation setting.\nFinal results show that falsi\fcation strategies are\neasier to identify than misleading and that disin-\nformation is harder to predict than propaganda or\nhoaxes.\n3.4 Promising directions\nDespite the vast amount of contributions discussedabove, we believe that false news detection requires\na deeper and more structured approach. Several\nworks appear as academic exercises, not always com-\npared to each other (and often not comparable).\nThe main problem of most articles is that they achieve\ngood performance when applied to given input dataset,\nbut they do not generalize to unseen data. From\nour analysis, it seems that methods purely based\nupon content analysis work within a limited scope,\nwhereas context analysis addresses generic actions\n(such as liking, commenting, propagating) that gen-\neralize more easily.\nHere we highlight most promising approaches among\nworks reviewed so far. They are also summarized\nin Table 2.\nAmong the articles from Section 3.1, focused on\nthe content, we cite Perez-Rosas et al. (2018) [45]\nfor its ability to consider a huge number of linguis-\ntic features, highlighting their di\u000berent weights on\nthe classi\fcation outcome. For such comprehensive\napproach, this work outstands on approaches based\nsolely on news content; but the approach requires\na considerable amount of annotated data (and thus\nmanual e\u000borts) which may hinder the setup of a\nreal-world application.\nAmong the articles from Section 3.2, focused on\nthe social context, we believe that Liu et al. (2018)\n[33] and Wu et al. (2018) [80] are most promis-\ning; they analyzed users' pro\fles and online news\nsharing cascades. Despite the inherent complexity\nof both techniques (and the limited datasets em-\nployed), we argue that a network-based approach\nfocused on social responses might e\u000bectively detect\ndeceptive information. They opened the way for\nnew approaches that focus on the models of di\u000bu-\nsion of false news on social media, where most of\nrecent research advances stand as described next.\nWe \fnally cite Volkova et al. (2018) [73], among\nthe articles from Section 3.3 based on both con-\ntent and context-based features, for considering ad-\nditional psycho-linguistic signals, e.g. biased lan-\nguage markers, moral foundations and connotations,\nand inspecting also social responses on Twitter as\nto infer di\u000berent deceptive strategies and types of\nmalicious information.\n4.

They ana-\nlyze cascades (or sharing trees ) in terms of lifetime,\nsize and edge homogeneity (i.e. an indicator of the\npolarization of users involved) and they show that\n1) the consumption patterns di\u000ber in the two cat-\negories and that 2) the echo chambers (or commu-\nnities of interest) appear as the preferential drivers\nfor the di\u000busion of content. On top of these results,\nthey build a data driven percolation model which\naccounts for homogeneity and polarization and they\nsimulate it in a small-world network reproducing\nthe observed dynamics with high accuracy.\nSimilarly, a groundbreaking contribution is pro-\nvided in Vosoughi et al. (2018) [76], where the en-\ntire Twitter universe is explored in order to track\nthe di\u000busion of false and true news. Authors build a\ncollection of links to fact-checking articles (from six\ndi\u000berent organizations) which correspond to true,\nfalse and mixed news stories and they accordingly\ninvestigate how these rumors spread on the Twit-\nter network by gathering only tweets that explic-\nitly contain the URLs of the articles. The resulting\ndataset contains approx. 126000 stories tweeted by\n3 million users more than 4.5 million times. A se-\nries of measures are carried out including statisti-\ncal and structural indicators of the retweeting net-\nworks along with sentiment analysis, topic distri-\nbution and novelty estimation of the di\u000berent cat-\negories of news. The \fnal results show that overall\nfalsehood spread signi\fcantly faster, deeper, farther\nand broader than the truth in all categories of infor-\nmation, with a prominent weight on political news.\nMoreover, they observe that false news usually con-\nvey a higher degree of novelty and that novel in-\nformation is more likely to be shared by users (al-though they cannot claim this is the only reason\nbehind the \"success\" of misinformation).\nA slightly diverse analysis is issued in Shao et\nal. (2018a) [61], where authors study the struc-\ntural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the\ndi\u000busion network on Twitter before and after the\n2016 US Presidential Elections. They \frst illustrate\nthe implementation and deployment of the Hoaxy\nplatform [59] which is then employed to gather the\ndata required for their analysis. They build di\u000ber-\nent datasets (relative to a few months before and af-\nter the elections) which correspond to fact-checking\nand misinformation articles, i.e. the retweeting net-\nwork of users that share URLs for related news\nitems, and they perform a k-core decomposition\nanalysis to investigate the role of both narratives\nin the network. They show that low-credibility ar-\nticles prevail in the core, whereas fact-checking is\nalmost relegated to the periphery of the network.\nThey also carry out a network robustness analysis\nin order to analyze the role of most central nodes\nand guide possible di\u000berent interventions of social\nplatforms.\nSame authors largely extend previous results in\nShao et al. (2018b) [60], as they carry out a huge\nanalysis on Twitter in a period of ten months in\n2016 and 2017. They aim to \fnd evidence of the\nconsiderable role of social bots in spreading low-\ncredibility news articles. The Hoaxy [59] platform\nis leveraged once again and more than 14 million\ntweets, including fact-checking and misinformation\nsources, are collected. The Botometer algorithm [9]\nis used to assess the presence of social bots among\nTwitter users. The results show that bots are ac-\ntive especially in the \frst phase of the di\u000busion, i.e.\na few seconds after articles are published, and that\n7\nalthough the majority of false articles goes unno-\nticed, a signi\fcant fraction tends to become viral.\nThey also corroborate, to a certain extent, results\nprovided by Vosoughi et al. (2018) [76]. Moving\non, they highlight bot strategies for amplifying the\nimpact of false news and they analyze the structural\nrole of social bots in the network by means of a net-\nwork dismantling procedure [2]. They \fnally con-\nclude that curbing bots would be an e\u000bective strat-\negy to reduce misinformation; using CAPTCHAs\n[75] is a simple tool to distinguish bots from hu-\nmans, but with undesirable e\u000bects to the user ex-\nperience of a platform.\nDi\u000berently from previous works, a study of the\nagenda-setting [35] power of false news is instead\naccomplished in Vargo et al. (2018) [71], where au-\nthors focus on the online mediascape from 2014 to\n2016. They leverage a few di\u000berent agenda-setting\nmodels with a computational approach (collecting\ndata from GDELT) in order to examine, among\nother targets, the in\ruence of false news on real\nnews reports, i.e. whether and to which extent false\nnews have shifted journalistic attention in main-\nstream, partisan and fact-checking organizations.\nTo this extent they gather news articles correspond-\ning to partisan and mainstream news outlets as well\nas fact-checking organizations and false news web-\nsites; they refer to diverse references in the litera-\nture in order to manually construct the list. A net-\nwork of di\u000berent events and themes (as identi\fed\nin the GDELT database) is built to relate distinct\nmedia and to model time series of (eigenvector) cen-\ntrality scores [57] in order to carry out Granger\ncausality tests and highlight potential correlations.\nBesides other results, they show that partisan media\nindeed appeared to be susceptible to the agendas of\nfalse news (probably because of the elections), but\nthe agenda setting power of false news{the in\ruence\non mainstream and partisan outlets{is declining.\nWe described previous works in detail, as we strongly\nbelieve that they provided substantial research con-\ntributions to the phenomenon of false news spread-\ning on social media, also due to the wide reach of\nlarge-scale experiments carried out in these stud-\nies. Overall, these approaches have shown that false\nnews spread deeper, faster, broader and farther than\nthe truth, with bots and echo chambers playing a\nprimary role in (dis)information di\u000busion networks.\nThey also cautiously suggest possible interventions\nwhich might be put in place by platform govern-\nment bodies in order to curb this malicious phe-\nnomenon; nonetheless this can not be easily encour-\naged as it may raise ethical concerns about censor-\nship. As aforementioned, we argue that future re-search should follow these directions and analyze,\nfrom a network perspective, how social communi-\nties react to online news as to identify malicious\ncontent.\n5. FALSE NEWS MITIGATION\nFinally, a few potential interventions have been\nproposed for reducing the spread of misinformation\non social platforms, from curbing most active (and\nlikely to be bots) users [60] to leveraging the users'\n\ragging activity in coordination with fact-checking\norganizations. The latter approach is proposed as a\n\frst practical mitigation technique in [27] and [70],\nwhere the goal is to reduce the spread of misinfor-\nmation leveraging users' \ragging activity on Face-\nbook.\nKim et al. (2018) [27] develop CURB, an algo-\nrithm to select the most e\u000bective stories to send\nfor fact-checking as to e\u000eciently reduce the spread-\ning of non-credible news with theoretical guaran-\ntees; they formulate the problem in the context of\ntemporal point processes [1] and stochastic di\u000ber-\nential equations and they use the Rumors datasets\n(A.11) to evaluate it in terms of precision and misin-\nformation reduction (i.e. the fraction of prevented\nunveri\fed exposures). They show that the algo-\nrithm accuracy is very sensitive to the ability of the\ncrowd at spotting misinformation.\nTschiatschek et al. (2018) [70] also aim to se-\nlect a small subset of news to send for veri\fcation\nand prevent misinformation from spreading; how-\never, as they remark, with a few di\u000berences from\nthe previous method respectively 1) they learn the\naccuracy of individual users rather than considering\nall of them equally reliable and 2) they develop an\nalgorithm which is agnostic to the actual propaga-\ntion of news in the network. Moreover, they carry\nout their experiments in a simulated Facebook en-\nvironment where false and true news are generated\nby users in a probabilistic manner. They show that\nthey are able at once to learn users' \ragging be-\nhaviour and consider possible adversarial behaviour\nof spammer users who want to promote false news.\nA di\u000berent contribution is issued by Vo et al.\n(2018) [72], who are the \frst to examine active\nTwitter users who share fact-checking information\nin order to correct false news in online discussions.\nThey incidentally propose a URL recommendation\nmodel to encourage these guardians (users) to en-\ngage in the spreading of credible information as\nto reduce the negative e\u000bects of misinformation.\nThey use Hoaxy [59] (cf. A.7) to collect a large\nnumber of tweets referring to fact-checking organi-\nzations and they analyze several characteristics of\n8\nthe users involved (activity, pro\fle, topics discussed,\netc). Finally, they compare their recommendation\nmodel, which takes into account the social struc-\nture, against state-of-the-art collaborative \fltering\nalgorithms.\nMain social networking platforms, from Facebook\nto Twitter, have recently provided to their users\ntools to combat disinformation [27], an approach\nwhich seems reasonable enough to tackle the prob-\nlem of disinformation without raising censorship alerts.\nResorting to the wisdom of the crowd , as discussed\nabove, can be e\u000bective at identifying malicious news\nitems and prevent from misinformation spreading\non social networks.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nDespite the vast review of literature presented so\nfar, in agreement with [32] we believe that there\nare only a few substantial research contributions,\nmost of which speci\fcally focus on characterizing\nthe di\u000busion of misinformation on social media. It\nhas been e\u000bectively shown that false news spread\nfaster and more broadly than the truth on social\nmedia, and that social bots and echo chambers play\nan important role in the core of di\u000busion networks.\nAlthough di\u000berent psycho-linguistic signals de-\nrived from textual features are useful for false news\ndetection, content alone may not be su\u000ecient and\nother features, inferred from the social dimension,\nshould be taken into account in order to distinguish\nfalse news from true news.\nThe lack of gold-standard agreed datasets and of\nresearch guidelines on the subject has favored the\ndi\u000busion of ad-hoc data collections; the related de-\ntection techniques share several limitations, as they\ndo not always compare with each other and do not\nexplicitly discuss the impact and consequences of\ntheir results.\nNonetheless, the great number of contributions\ndelivered in the last few years shows that the re-\nsearch community has promptly reacted to the is-\nsue, and that can successfully embody previous re-\nsults to advance further in the combat against false\nnews.\nBesides the existing challenges highlighted in the\nintroductory section, we believe that: 1) in light of\nrecent contributions on the characterization of dis-\ninformation di\u000busion networks, more insights into\nfalse news detection should be gained from a net-\nwork perspective; 2) in general, the research com-\nmunity should coordinate e\u000borts originating from\ndi\u000berent areas (from psychology to journalism to\ncomputer science) in a more structured fashion; 3)\nfuture contributions should favor the developmentof real-world applications for providing e\u000bective help\nin the \fght against false news.\n7.

The most prominent threats include a loss of privacy,\nmis-/disinformation (e.g., \u201cfake news\u201d, rumors, hoaxes), and \u201cover-\npersonalized\u201d content resulting in so-called filter bubbles and echo\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

While these threats are not new, the risk has significantly\nincreased with the advances of modern machine learning algo-\nrithms. Hidden from the average user\u2019s eyes, social media platform\nproviders deploy such algorithms to maximize user engagement\nthrough personalized content in order to increase ad revenue. These\nalgorithms analyze users\u2019 content, profile users, filter and rank con-\ntent shown to users. Algorithmic content analysis is also performed\nby institutions such as banks, insurance companies, businesses and\ngovernments. The risk is that institutions attempt to instrumen-\ntalize social media with the goal to monitor or even intervene in\nusers\u2019 lives [ 85]. Lastly, algorithms are getting better in mimicking\nusers. So-called social bots [ 67] are programs that operate social\nmedia accounts to post and share unverified or fake content. This\nincludes that modern machine learning algorithms can be used to\nmodify or even fabricate content (e.g., deep fakes [104]).\nAssessing the risks of these threats is arbitrarily difficult. Firstly,\nthe average social media user is not aware of or vastly underesti-\nmates the power of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.\nWithout transparency, users do not know what personal attributes\nare collected, or what content is shown \u2013 or not shown \u2013 and\nwhy. The lack of awareness and knowledge about machine\nlearning algorithms on the users\u2019 part creates an informa-\ntion asymmetry that makes it difficult for users to effectively and\ncritically evaluate their social media use. Secondly, the negative\nconsequences of users\u2019 social media behaviour are usually not obvi-\nous or immediate. Concerns such as dynamic pricing or the denial\nof goods and services (e.g., China\u2019s Social Credit Score [120]) are\ntypically the result of a long posting and sharing history. The for-\nmation of filter bubbles and their effects on users\u2019 views is often a\nslow process. This lack of an immediate connection between\nusers\u2019 behavior and negative consequences prohibits an in-\ntrinsic incentive for users to change their behavior. Lastly,\neven users who are aware of applied algorithms and negative con-\nsequences are in a disadvantaged position. Compared to users,\nalgorithms deployed by data holders have access to a much larger\npool of information and to virtually unlimited computing capaci-\nties to analyze this information. This lack of power leaves users\ndefenseless against the algorithmic threats on social media.\nIn this paper, we call for solutions to level the playing field \u2013 that\nis, to counter the information asymmetry that data holders have\nover the average users. To directly rival the algorithmic threats, we\nargue for utilizing machine learning and data mining techniques\n(e.g., multimedia and multimodal content analysis, image and video\nforensics) but in a transparent manner and for the benefit of the\nusers. The goal is to help users to better quantify the risk of threats,\nand thus to enable them to make more well-informed decisions.\nExamples include warnings that a post contains sensitive informa-\ntion before submitting, informing that an image or video has beenarXiv:2009.07632v1  [cs.SI]  26 Aug 2020\ntampered with, suggesting alternative content from more credible\nsources, etc. While algorithms towards (some of) these tasks exists\n(cf. Section 2), we argue that their applicability in our target context\nof supporting social media users is limited. For interventions (e.g.,\nnotices, warnings, suggestions) to be most effective in guiding users\nbehavior, the interventions need to be content-aware, personalized,\nin-situ, but also trusted and minimally intrusive.\nWhile covering a wide range of research questions from different\nfields, we believe that the multimedia research community will play\nan integral part in this endeavour. To this end, we propose a re-\nsearch agenda highlighting open research questions and challenges\nwith focus on multimedia content analysis and content generation.\nWe organize relevant research questions with respect to three core\ntasks: (1) Risk assessment addresses the questions of When and Why\nsocial media users should be informed about potential threats. (2)\nVisualization and explanation techniques need to convert the out-\ncome from machine learning algorithms (e.g., labels, probabilities)\nto convey potential risks in a comprehensible and relatable manner.\n(3)Sanitization and recommendations aim to help users minimize\nrisks either through sanitizing their own content (e.g., obfuscation\nof sensitive parts in images and videos) or the recommendation of\nalternative content (e.g., from trusted and unbiased sources). Lastly,\ngiven the user-oriented nature of this research, we also highlight\nthe challenges of evaluating the efficacy of interventions in terms\nof their influence on social media users\u2019 decisions and behavior. To\nsummarize, we make the following contributions:\n\u2022We present the first comprehensive survey on the threats\nposed by machine learning algorithms on social media.\n\u2022We propose a novel data-driven scheme for user-centric\ninterventions to help social media users to counteract the\nalgorithmic threats on social media.\n\u2022We raise open research questions to tackle the information\nasymmetry between users and data holders due to an imbal-\nanced access to data and machine learning algorithms.\nSections 2 and 3 cover our main contributions, forming the main\nparts of this paper. We complement these contributions by present-\ning our current proof-of-concept implementation (Section 4) and\noutlining related research questions and challenges that are equally\nimportant but beyond our main research agenda (Section 5).\n2 THREATS & COUNTERMEASURES\nArguably, the most prominent threats of social media are loss of\nprivacy, fake news, and filter bubbles or echo chambers. In this sec-\ntion, we review automated methods that facilitate each threat, and\noutline existing countermeasures together with their limitations.\nWe use the recent global discourse surrounding the COVID-19\npandemic to help illustrate the relevance of these three threats.\nNote that social media has also been associated with a wide\nrange of other threats such as online harassment through bullying,\ndoxing, public shaming, and Internet vigilantism [ 22]. Social media\nuse has also been shown to be highly addictive, often caused by the\nfear of missing out (FOMO) [ 21]. Being constantly up-to-date with\nother\u2019s lives often leads to social comparison, potentially resulting\nin feelings of jealousy or envy, which in turn can have negative\neffects on users\u2019 self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-worth [ 196].Table 1: Selected approaches for the extraction and inference of\nprivacy-sensitive information from multimedia content.\nidentitybiometrics [168] [59] [172] [155] [173]\nsoft biometrics [27] [37] [99] [176] [71]\nlocationuser location\n(stable)[86] [42] [126] [169] [212]\n[162] [117] [138] [163] [61]\nlocation in content[72] [112] [115] [92] [166]\n[118] [101] [119]\nmobility pattern [88] [70] [220] [216] [17]\ndemo-\ngraphicsgender/age[114] [170] [217] [46] [152]\n[29] [81] [175] [144] [145]\nethnicity/nationality [159] [94] [111] [215] [36]\nincome/occupation [97] [130] [89] [160]\nperso-\nnalitytraits[9] [66] [180] [124] [150]\n[68] [98] [188] [4] [78]\nemotion & mood [13] [147] [122] [24] [127]\nsexual orientation [204] [100]\nhealth(social) well-being[39] [174] [134] [187] [31]\n[62] [73]\nmental health[20] [50] [82] [19] [34] [56]\n[43] [189] [201] [165] [203]\nphysical health [135] [107] [207] [209]\nrelation-\nshipstie strength [74] [149] [84] [30]\ntie role [225] [224] [83] [116] [206]\ncommunity [93] [16] [63] [202]\nbeliefs,\nopinions,\nlifestylereligion [146] [40] [211]\npolitical leaning[35] [158] [210] [48] [154]\n[47] [128] [49] [77]\nhabits [57] [148] [141] [161]\nHowever, these types of threats are generally not directly caused\nby algorithms and are thus beyond the scope of this work.\n2.1 Loss of Privacy\nEach interaction on social media adds to a user\u2019s digital footprint,\npainting a comprehensive picture about the user\u2019s real-world iden-\ntity and personal attributes. From a privacy perspective, identity\nand personal attributes are considered highly sensitive information\n(e.g., age, gender, location, contacts, health, political views) which\nmany users would not reveal beyond their trusted social circles.\nHowever, with the average user being unaware of the capabilities\nof data holders and with often no immediate consequences, users\ncannot assess their privacy risks from their social media use. During\nthe COVID-19 outbreak, many infected users shared their condi-\ntions online. Apart from reported consequences such as harassment\n\u2013 e.g., being blamed for introducing COVID-19 into a community \u2013\nusers might also inadvertently disclose future health issues (with\nthe long-term effects of the infection currently unknown).\nAlgorithmic threats. Given its value, a plethora of algorithms\nhave been designed to extract or infer personal information from\nmultimedia content about virtually all aspects of a user\u2019s self: iden-\ntity, personality, health, location, beliefs, relationships, etc. Table 1\npresents and overview of the main types of personal information\nwith a selection of related works. While not all methods have been\nproposed explicitly with social media content in mind (e.g., face\ndetection [ 91,95] and action recognition [ 52,194] algorithms which\nare generally used for security surveillance) they can in principle\nbe applied to content posted and shared on social media. Space con-\nstraints prohibit a more detailed discussion, but the key message is\nthat algorithms that put user\u2019s privacy at risk are omnipresent.\nExisting countermeasures. Data and information privacy has\nbeen addressed from technological, legal and societal perspectives.\nWith our focus on using technology to protect users\u2019 privacy in\nsocial media, we categorize existing approaches as follows:\n(1) Policy comprehension aims to help users understand their\ncurrent privacy settings. A basic approach is to show users their\nprofile and content from the viewpoint of other users or the pub-\nlic [8,123]. More general solutions propose user interface design\nelements (color-coding schemes, charts, graphs) to visualize which\ncontent can be viewed by others [58, 96, 132, 151, 185].\n(2) Policy recommendation techniques suggest privacy settings\nfor newly shared data items. Social context-based methods assign\nthe same privacy settings to similar contacts. Basic approaches\nconsider only the neighbor network of a user [ 5,55]), while more\nadvanced methods also utilize profile information [ 6,65,102,133,\n137,183]). Content-based policy recommendations assign privacy\nsettings based on the similarity of data items. First works used\n(semi-)structured content such as tags or labels [ 106,129,164,200].\nWith the advances in machine learning, solutions have been pro-\nposed that directly analyze unstructured content with emphasis on\nimages [ 44,182,184,221] as well as textual content [ 32,41,142].\nState-of-the art deep learning models allow for end-to-end learning\nand yield superior results [ 181,218,219]. More recent policy rec-\nommendations aim to resolve conflicts in case of different privacy\npreferences for co-owned objects [186].\n(3) Privacy nudging [3,205] introduces design elements or makes\nsmall changes to the user interface to remind users of potential\nconsequences before posting content and to rethink their decisions:\ntimer nudges delay the submission of a post; sentiment nudges\nwarn users that their post might be viewed as negative; audience\nnudges show a random subset of contacts to remind users of who\nwill be able to view a post.\nMost of the proposed solutions focus on users\u2019 privacy amongst\ntheir social circles \u2013 that is, privacy is preserved if a user\u2019s content\ncan only be viewed by others in line with the user\u2019s intention. This\nassumes that social media platform providers are trusted to adhere\nto all privacy settings but also that no threats are coming from\nthe platform providers and any data holders with access to users\u2019\ncontent. Only privacy nudging does not explicitly rely on trust in\ndata holders. However, current privacy nudges are content-agnostic.\nThey neither provide detailed information why the content might be\ntoo sensitive to share nor offer suggestions to users on how to edit\nor modify content submissions to lower their level of sensitivity.\n2.2 Fake News\nMis- and disinformation has long been used to shape people\u2019s\nthoughts and behavior, but social media has significantly amplified\nits adverse effects. Fake news often leverages users\u2019 cognitive biases\n(e.g., confirmation bias, familiarity bias, anchoring bias), making it\nmore likely for users to fall for it [ 153]. Fake news is typically also\nnovel, controversial, emotionally charged, or partisan, making itmore \u201cinteresting\u201d and hence more likely to be shared [ 198]. During\nthe COVID-19 crisis, misleading claims about infection statistics\nhave resulted in delayed or ignored counteractions (e.g., social dis-\ntancing measures). False conspiracy theories about the causes for\nthe disease have, for example, resulted in destroying 5G commu-\nnication towers. More tragically, fake news about supposed cures\nhave already cost the lives of several hundred people.\nAlgorithmic threats. The most popular algorithmic threat for\nspreading fake news is the use of bots to spread mis-/disinformation.\nParticularly bots created with malicious intent aim to mimic hu-\nmanlike behavior to avoid detection efforts and trick genuine users\ninto following them. This enables the bots to capture large audi-\nences, making it easier to spread fake news. Mimicking humanlike\nbehavior may include varying sharing frequency and schedule, or\nperiodically updating profile information [ 67,195]. Apart from bet-\nter \u201cblending in\u201d, sophisticated bots also coordinate attacks through\nthe synchronization of whole bot networks [ 80]. Recent advances\nin machine learning also allow for the automated doctoring or fab-\nrication of content. This includes the manipulation of multimedia\ncontent such as text swapping [ 104] or image splicing [ 53]. When\ncoupled with, algorithms used to detect \u201cinfectious\u201d multimedia i.e.,\ncontent that is most likely to go viral [ 60,87,191], they can be used\nto predict the effectiveness of fabrication, e.g., for the generation of\nclickbait headlines [ 179]. Finally, fake content can also be generated\nusing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a deep learning\nmodel for the automated generation of (almost) natural text, im-\nages or videos. The most popular example audio-visual content\nare so-called \u201cdeep fakes\u201d [ 104]: videos that show, e.g., a politician\nmaking a statement that never occurred. For textual content, the\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) [ 26] represents the\ncurrent state of the art of generating humanlike text.\nExisting countermeasures. The effects of fake news saw many\ncountries introduce laws imposing fines for its publication [ 167].\nHowever, the vague nature of fake news makes it very difficult to\nput it into a legal framework [ 105] and raises concerns regarding\ncensorship and misuse [ 198]. Other efforts include public infor-\nmation campaigns or new school curricula that aim to improve\ncritical thinking skills and media literacy. However, these are either\none-time or long-term efforts with uncertain outcomes [ 110]. From\na technological perspective, a plethora of data-driven methods have\nbeen proposed for the identification of social bots, automated credi-\nbility assessment, and fact-checking [ 178]. Most methods to identify\nsocial bots use supervised machine learning by leveraging on the\nuser, content, social network, temporal features, etc. (e.g., [ 109,213]).\nUnsupervised methods aim to detect social bots by finding accounts\nthat share strong similarities with respect to social network and (co-\nordinated) posting/sharing behavior (e.g., [ 38,131]). Fact-checking\nis a second corner stone to counter fake news. However, manual\nfact-checking \u2013 done by websites such as Snopes or Politifact, or\ndedicated staff of social media platform providers \u2013 scales poorly\nwith the amount of online information. Various solutions for auto-\nmated fact-checking have been proposed (e.g., [ 90,103]). However,\nfully automated fact-checking systems are far from mature and\nmost real-world solutions take a hybrid approach [79].\nExisting technological solutions to combat fake news focus on\nthe \u201cbad guys\u201d and do not address the impact of the average user\non its success. However, Vosoughi et al. [ 198] have shown that false\ninformation spreads fast and wide even without the contributions\nby social bots. To evaluate the effects of user nudging, Nekmat [ 143]\nconducted a series of user surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of\nfact-check alerts (e.g., the reputation of a news source). The results\nshow that such alerts trigger users\u2019 skepticism, thus lowering the\nlikelihood of sharing information from questionable sources. Simi-\nlarly, Yaqub et al. [ 214] carried out an online study to investigate the\neffects of different credibility indicators (fact checkers, mainstream\nmedia, public opinion, AI) on sharing. The effects differ not only\nacross indicators \u2013 with fact checkers having the most effect \u2013 but\nalso across demographics, social media use, and political leanings.\n2.3 Filter Bubble & Echo Chambers\nPersonalized content is one of the main approaches social media\nplatform providers use to maximize user engagement: users are\nmore likely to consume content that is aligned with their beliefs,\nopinions and attitudes. This selective exposure has led to the rise of\nphenomena such as echo chambers and filter bubbles [ 10,12,25].\nThe negative effects are similar to the ones of fake news. Here, not\n(necessarily) false but one-sided or skewed information leads to\nuninformed decisions particularly in politics [ 15,64]. Filter bubbles\nand echo chambers also amplify the impact of fake news since\n\u201ctrapped\u201d users are less likely be confronted with facts or different\nopinions; as was also the case for COVID-19 [45].\nAlgorithmic threats. Maximizing user engagement through\ncustomized content is closely related to the threats of privacy loss\nand fake news \u2013 that is, the utilization of personal information\nand the emphasis on viral content. A such, most of the algorithmic\nthreats also apply here. An additional class of algorithms that often\nresult in \u201cover-customization\u201d are recommender systems based on\ncollaborative filtering [ 18,23,156]. They are fundamental building\nblocks of many online services such as online shopping portals,\nmusic or video streaming sites, product and service review sites,\nonline news sites, etc. Recommender systems aim to predict users\u2019\npreferences and recommend items (products, songs, movies, articles,\netc.) that users are likely to find interesting. Social network and\nsocial media platforms in particular expand on this approach by\nalso incorporating the information about a user\u2019s connections into\nthe recommendation process [ 190,226]. Recommender systems\ncontinue to be a very active field of research [14, 223].\nExisting countermeasures . Compared to fake news, filter bub-\nble and echo chambers are only a side effect of personalized con-\ntent [ 28]. While recommendation algorithms for incorporating di-\nversity have been proposed (e.g., [ 125,192]), they are generally\nnot applied by platform providers since they counter the goal of\nmaximizing user engagement. As a result, most efforts to combat\nfilter bubbles aim to raise users\u2019 awareness and give them more con-\ntrol [ 25]. From an end user perspective, multiple solutions propose\nbrowser extensions that analyze users\u2019 information consumption\nand provide information about their reading or searching behavior\nand biases; e.g., [ 139?]. All these approaches can be categorized\nas nudging by making users be aware of their biases. Despite the\nnumerous nudging measures proposed, their application and accep-\ntance among social media users remain low [ 113,208]. This may be\nbecause of several reasons. Firstly, as an emerging new technology,\ndigital nudging is not as established as expert nudging, thus maylack users\u2019 trust in the first place [ 208]. Secondly, many people\nuse social media due to its convenience and pleasance, whereas\nnudging requires extra efforts and attention. Finally, psychologists\nhave found that nudging might only have effects on things people\nare truly aware of and care about [69].\n3 USER NUDGING IN SOCIAL MEDIA\nTo address the information asymmetry between users and data\nholders, we motivate automated and data-driven user nudging as\na form of educational intervention. In a nutshell, nudges aim to\ninform, warn or guide users towards a more responsible behavior\non social media to minimize the risk of potential threats such as\nthe loss of privacy or the influence of fake news. In this section,\nwe propose a research agenda for the design and application of\neffective user nudges in social media.\n3.1 Design Goals\nEffective nudges should be helpful to users without being annoying.\nPresenting users too often with bad or unnecessary information or\nwarnings may result in users ignoring nudges. We formulate the\nfollowing design goals for effective nudging:\n(1) Content-aware. Warning messages should only be displayed\nif necessary, i.e., if a potential risk has been identified. For example,\nan image showing a generic landscape is generally less harmful\ncompared to an image containing nudity. Thus, the latter would\nmore likely trigger a nudge. Similarly, only content from biased or\nuntrusted sources, or content that show signs of being tampered\nwith should result in the display of warnings. Effective nudges need\nto be tailored to content such as articles or posts being shared.\n(2) User-dependent. The need and the instance of a nudge\nshould depend on the individual users, with the same content po-\ntentially triggering different or no nudges for different users. For\nexample, a doctor revealing her location in a hospital is arguably\nless sensitive compared to other users. Similarly, a user who is\nconsciously and purposefully reading articles from different news\nsites, does not need a warning about each site\u2019s biases.\n(3) Self-learning. As consequence of both content- and user-\ndependency, a nudging engine should adapt to a user\u2019s social media\nuse. To be in line with the idea of soft paternalism, users should\nbe in control of nudges through manual or (semi-)automated per-\nsonalization. This personalization might be done through explicit\nfeedback by the user or through implicit feedback derived from the\nuser\u2019s past behavior (e.g., the ignoring of certain nudges).\n(4) Proactive. While deleting content shortly after posting might\nstop it from being seen by other users, it is arguably still stored on\nthe platform and available for analysis. Assuming untrusted data\nholders, any interaction on social media has to be considered as\npermanent. Thus, nudges need to be displayed before any damage\nmight be done, e.g., before privacy-sensitive content is submitted,\na fake news or biased article is shared or even read, etc.\n(5) In-situ. Educational interventions are most effective when\ngiven at the right time and the right place. Therefore, nudges should\nbe as tightly integrated into users every-day social media use as\npossible. Ideally, a false fact is highlighted in a news article, sensitive\ninformation is marked within an image, warning messages are\ndisplayed near the content, etc. The level of integration depends\non the environment, with desktop browsers being more flexible\ncompared to closed mobile apps (cf. Section 5).\n(6) Transparent. Data-driven user nudging relies in many cases\non similar algorithms as potential attackers (e.g., to identify privacy-\nsensitive information). In contrast to the hidden algorithms of data\nholders, the process of user nudging therefore needs to be as open\nand transparent as possible to establish users\u2019 trust. Transparency\nalso requires explainability \u2013 that is, users need to be able to com-\nprehend why a nudge has been triggered to better adjust their social\nmedia use in the future.\n3.2 Core Tasks\nWe argue that an effective nudging engine contains three core\ncomponents for the tasks of risk assessment, representation and\nvisualization of nudges, and the recommendation or sanitization of\ncontent. In the following section, we outline the challenges involved\nand derive explicit research questions for each task.\nRisk assessment refers to the task of identifying the need for\nnudges in case of, e.g., privacy-sensitive content, tampered content,\nfakes news or biased sources, clickbait headlines, social bots, etc.\nAs such, risk assessment can leverage on existing methods outlined\nin Section 2. Note that user nudging therefore relies on the same\nalgorithms used by attackers; we discuss ethical questions and con-\ncerns in Section 5. Despite the availability of such algorithms, their\napplicability for risk assessment is arguably limited with respect\nto our outlined design goals. Not always is an image containing\nnudity privacy-sensitive (e.g., an art exhibition), not every bot has a\nmalicious intent (e.g., weather or traffic bots), not always is a deep\nfake video shared to deceive but only to entertain users. Effective\nrisk assessment therefore requires a much deeper understanding\nof content and context. We formulate these challenges with the\nfollowing research questions:\n\u2022How can existing countermeasures against threats in social\nmedia be utilized for risk assessment towards user nudging?\n\u2022What are the shortcomings of existing methods that limit\ntheir applicability for risk assessment with respect to the de-\nsign goals (particularly to minimize the number of nudges)?\n\u2022How to design novel algorithms for effective risk assessment\nwith a deep(er) semantic understanding of the content?\nGeneration and visualization addresses the task of presenting\nnudges to users. Sophisticated solutions of risk assessment rely\non modern machine learning methods that return results beyond\nthe understanding of the average social media user. Firstly, the\noutcomes of those algorithms are generally not intuitive: class\nlabels, probabilities, scores, weights, bounding boxes, heatmaps,\netc., making it difficult for most users to interpret those outcomes.\nAnd secondly, the complexity of most methods makes it difficult\nto comprehend how or why a method returned a certain outcome.\nSuch explanations, however, would greatly improve the trust in\noutcomes and thus nudges. The need for understanding the inner\nworkings of machine learning methods spurred the research field\nof eXplainable AI (XAI) to make such models (more) interpretable.\nHowever techniques so far are targeted primarily for experts and\nimproving their usability for end users is an active area of research\n[1,2,75]. Regarding the generation of nudges, we formulate the\nfollowing research questions:\u2022To what extent are current XAI methods applicable for user\nnudging in social media?\n\u2022How to convert outcomes and existing explanations into a\nmore readable and user-friendly format for nudging (e.g.,\ncharts, content markup or highlighting, verbalization)?\n\u2022How to measure the efficacy of nudges along human factors\nsuch as plausibility, simplicity, relatability etc. to evaluate\nthe trade-off between these opposing goals?\n\u2022How to make the generation of nudges customizable to ac-\ncommodate users\u2019 preferences and expertise or knowledge?\nWith solutions for generating nudges available, the last step con-\ncerns the questions of how to display nudges. Very few works have\ninvestigated the effects of different aspects of nudges in the context\nof privacy [ 11,76,171] and credibility of news articles [ 121,143,\n157,222]. Based on previous works, we can define four key aspects\nfor visualizing user nudges: (1) timing, i.e., the exact time when a\nuser nudge is presented, (2) location, i.e., the places where a nudge\nis presented, (3) format, i.e., the media formats in which the infor-\nmation is presented (whether audio and visual information should\nbe combined with textual information, the length of the informa-\ntion), and (4) authorization, i.e., users\u2019 control over the nudging\ninformation. We formulate the following research questions for\nthese aspects as follows:\n\u2022Given the different threats in social media, what kind of\ninformation would users find most useful (e.g., visualization\nmethod, level of detail, auxiliary information)?\n\u2022How does the How,When andWhere of users\u2019 control effect\nthe effectiveness of nudges on the behavior of users?\nRecommendation and sanitization expand on nudges that\nassess and visualize risks of threats to also include suggestions\nto lower those risks to further support and educate users. In case\nof fake news, biased sources or tampered content, such sugges-\ntions would include the recommendation of credible and unbiased\nsources, or links to the original content. Regarding our design goals\n(here: content-awareness) recommended alternative content must\nbe similar or relevant to the original content. This refers to the\nfundamental task of measuring multimedia content similarity and\nrelated tasks such as reverse image search. However, besides the\nsimilarity of content, suitable metrics also need to incorporate new\naspects such as a classification of the source (e.g., credibility, biases,\nintention). For recommending alternative content, we propose the\nfollowing research questions:\n\u2022How can existing similarity measures and content linking\ntechniques be applied to suggest alternative content or sources\nfor nudging to lower users\u2019 risks?\n\u2022How can those methods be extended to consider additional\naspects beyond raw content similarity?\nIn case of users creating content, a more interesting form of sug-\ngestion involves the modification of the content to reduce any risks.\nThis is particularly relevant for privacy risks where already minor\nmodifications may avoid a harmful disclosure. However, quickly\nand effectively editing images or videos is beyond the skills of most\nusers. Content sanitization, the automated removal of sensitive\ninformation from content, is a well-established task in the context\nof data publishing to facilitate downstream analysis tasks of user\ninformation without infringing on their privacy. However, with\nvery few exceptions (e.g., [ 140,177]), the sanitized content is not\nintended to be viewed by users. This makes techniques such as\nword removal, as well as the cropping, redaction or blurring of\nimages or videos valid approaches. In contrast, content sanitization\nfor social media, where the output is seen by others, must fulfil two\nrequirements: (1) Preservation of integrity . Any sanitization must\npreserve the integrity of the content \u2013 that is, sanitized content\nmust read or look natural and organic, and it should not be obvious\nthat the content has been modified. (2) Preservation of intention.\nThe sanitized content should reflect the user\u2019s original intention\nfor posting as much as possible to make it a more valid alternative\nfor the user to consider \u2013 formulated as research questions:\n\u2022What are limitations of existing content sanitization tech-\nniques w.r.t their applicability for nudging in social media?\n\u2022How can the integrity of content be measured to evaluate if\na sanitized text, image or video appears natural and organic?\n\u2022How can a user\u2019s intention be estimated to guide the saniti-\nzation process towards acceptable alternatives?\n\u2022How to design, implement and evaluate novel techniques for\nsanitizing text, images and videos that preserve both content\nintegrity and user intention?\n3.3 Nudging Engine\nThe nudging engine refers to the framework integrating the so-\nlutions for the core tasks of risk assessment, generation and vi-\nsualization, content recommendation and sanitization, as well as\nadditional task for the personalization and configuration for users.\nFrontend. The frontend facilitates two main tasks. Firstly, it\ndisplays nudges to the users. For our current prototype, we use\na browser extension that directly injects nudges into the website\nof social media platforms. This includes that the extension can\nintercept requests to analyze new post before they are submitted;\nsee Section 4 for more details. And secondly, the frontend has to\nenable the configuration and personalization of the nudging. To\nthis end, the frontend needs to provide a user interface for manual\nconfiguration and providing feedback. To improve transparency,\nconfiguration should include privacy settings. For example, a user\nshould be able to select whether a new post is analyzed on its\nown or in combination with the user\u2019s posting history. On the\nother hand, the frontend should also support automated means to\ninfer users\u2019 behavior and preferences. For example, if the same or\nsimilar nudges gets repeatedly ignored, the platform may no longer\ndisplay such nudges in the future. The following research questions\nsummarize the challenges for developing the frontend:\n\u2022How can nudges be integrated into different environments,\nmainly desktop browsers and mobile devices?\n\u2022What means for configuring and providing feedback offer\nthe best benefits and transparency for users?\n\u2022What kind of data should users provide that best reflect their\npreferences regarding their consideration of nudges?\nBackend. The backend features all algorithms for content anal-\nysis (risk assessment), content linking (recommendations) and con-\ntent generation/modification (sanitization). Many of these tasks\nmay rely on external data sources for bot detection, fact-checking,\ncredibility and bias analysis. Depending on users\u2019 preferences (see\nabove), the backend will also have to store user content (e.g., users\u2019posting history) and perform behavior analysis to personalize nudges\nfor the individual users. By default, the backend should only keep\nas much user data as needed \u2013 formulated as research questions:\n\u2022What are suitable methods to infer user preferences for an\nautomated personalization of nudges?\n\u2022Where should user data be maintained to optimize the trade-\noff between user privacy and the effectiveness of nudges?\n\u2022How to identify and utilize relevant external knowledge to\ncomplement user data to further improve nudging?\n3.4 Evaluation\nUser nudging as a form of educational intervention is very sub-\njective with short-term and long-term effects on users\u2019 behav-\nior. Few existing works have conducted user studies (e.g., for pri-\nvacy nudges [3, 205]) or included user surveys (e.g., for fake news\nnudges [ 143]) in their evaluation. However, evaluating the long-\nterm effectiveness of user nudges on a large scale is an open chal-\nlenge. While solutions for the core tasks (cf. Section 3.2) can gener-\nally be evaluated individually, evaluating the overall performance\nof the nudging engine is not obvious. We draw from existing efforts\ntowards the evaluation of information advisors. One of the earliest\nstudy [ 193] evaluated a trust-based advisor on the Internet, and\nused users\u2019 feedback in interviews as a criteria for the advisor\u2019s\nefficacy. An effective assessment should serve multiple purposes,\nmeasure multiple outcomes, and draw from multiple data sources\nand use multiple methods of measurements [54].\nSimilarly, we propose four dimensions from multiple disciplines\nto evaluate the efficacy of user nudging, namely influence, trust,\nusage, and benefits. As the most important dimension, influence\nqualitatively measures if and how user behaviour is influenced\nby user nudging. The trust dimension evaluates the confidence\nof the user in nudges. Since nudges are also data-driven, it is not\nobvious why users should trust those algorithms more than those\nof Facebook, Twitter, and the like. Usage , as the most objective\ndimension, measures the frequency of the use of nudges by users.\nIn contrast, the benefits for a user are highly subjective as it requires\nto evaluate how the user has benefited from nudges, which can\nmostly be achieved through surveys or interviews. Objective and\nsubjective measures from psychology and economics are needed to\nevaluate the efficacy of user nudging in a comprehensive manner.\nWe formulate the following research questions:\n\u2022What are important objective and subjective metrics that\nquantify the efficacy of user nudging?\n\u2022How can particularly the long-term effects of nudges on\nusers\u2019 social media use be evaluated?\n\u2022How can the effects of nudges on the threats such as fake\nnews or echo chambers be evaluated on a large scale?\n\u2022How to evaluate the efficacy of nudging on a community\nlevel instead of from an individual user\u2019s perspective?\n4 SHAREAWARE PLATFORM\nTo make our goals and challenges towards automated user nudging\nin social media more tangible, this sections presents ShareAware\nour early-stage prototype for such a platform.\nFigure 1: Example of warning messages privacy protection.\n4.1 Overview to Prototype\nFor a seamless integration of nudges into users\u2019 social media use, we\nimplemented the frontend of ShareAware as a browser extension.\nThis extension intercepts user actions (e.g., posting of new content\nor sharing of existing content), sends content to the backend for\nanalysis, and displays the results in form of warning messages.\nThe content analysis in the backend is currently limited to basic\nfeatures to assess the feasibility and challenges of such an approach.\nIn the following examples, we focus on the use case where a user\nwants to submit a new tweet. If the analysis of a tweet results\nin nudges, the user can cancel the submission, submit the tweet\n\u201cas is\u201d immediately, or let a countdown run out for an automated\nsubmission (similar to a timer nudge [205]).\nShareAware for privacy. To identify privacy-sensitive infor-\nmation in text, ShareAware currently utilizes basic methods such\npattern matching (e.g., for identifying phone number, credit card\nnumbers, email addresses), public knowledge graphs such as Word-\nNet [ 136] and Wikidata [ 199] (e.g., to associate \u201cheadache\u201d with the\nsensitive topic of health), and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to\nidentify person and location names. The analysis of images is cur-\nrently limited to the detection of faces. Figure 1 provides an example.\nFigure 2: Example of warning messages regarding fake news.\nMore reliable and effective methods to identify privacy-sensitive\ninformation will require a much deeper semantic understanding of\nshared content. A first follow-up step will be to evaluate algorithms\noutlined in Table 1 for their applicability in ShareAware.\nShareAware against fake news. To slow down the spread of\nfake news, we display three types of warning messages; see Figure 2.\nFirstly, we leverage on the Botometer API [ 213] returning a score\nrepresenting the likelihood that a Twitter account is a bot. We\nadopt this score but color-code it for visualization. Secondly, we\ndisplay credibility information for linked content using collected\ndata for 2.7k+ online news sites provided by Media Bias Fact Check\n(MBFC).1MBFC assigns each news site one of six factuality labels\nand one of nine bias or category labels. We show these labels as part\nof warning messages. Lastly, we perform a linguistic analysis to\nidentify if a post reflects the opinion of the tweet author or whether\nthe author refers another source making the statement (e.g., \u201cMiller\nsaid that...\u201d ). In case of the latter, we nudge a user accordingly and\nask if s/he trust the source. We present ShareAware for fake news\ntogether with an evaluation in a related paper [197].\n4.2 Experts Feedback\nOur current prototype is still in a conceptual stage. To further assess\nthe validity of the concept as well as understand how and if it can\nbe effectively translated into practice, we perform a think aloud\nfeedback session with 4 experts (2 Multimedia + 2 Human Com-\nputer Interaction researchers). Each session lasted 45-60 minutes\nand consisted of discussions centred around different scenarios of\nuse of ShareAware. The sessions were transcribed, and a thematic\nanalysis was performed by 2 members of the research team. While\nwe uncovered many themes, some on implementation and interface\ndesign details, we focus on the broad conceptual challenges here.\nExplanation specificity. Our experts mentioned that users\nmight find the current information provided by ShareAware rather\nvague. For example, when ShareAware identified potential disclo-\nsure of health related information, they anticipated that users would\n1https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\nwant to know why this would be of concern to them (e.g., higher in-\nsurance premiums). Similarly, in the case of fake news, our experts\nfound the bot score indicators and credibility information insuffi-\ncient to warrant a change in users\u2019 sharing habits. They expected\nthat users would want to see what was specifically wrong about\nthe bot (e.g., spreading of fake news or hate speech).\nExplanation depth. ShareAware currently intercepts each post\nto provide information about potential unintended privacy disclo-\nsures individually. However, institutional privacy risks often stem\nfrom analyzing historical social media data. Our experts expected\nShareAware to provide explanations that help users understand how\nthe current sharing instance would add to unintended inferences\nmade from their posting history. They remarked that a combina-\ntion of both depth and specificity was required to help users reflect\nmeaningfully and that users should have the option to check the\ndeeper explanations on demand.\nLeveraging social and HCI theories. Our experts also felt that\nfor the ShareAware to be effective it had to be grounded in social\ntheories. For example ShareAware could leverage various social\ntheory-based interpretations of self- disclosure in tailoring effecting\nnudges or craft nudges which target specific cognitive biases to\nbetter help users understand the privacy risks [ 108]. Similarly, in\nthe example of preventing the sharing of fake news, the interface\ncould incorporate explanations that appeal to social pressure or\npresent posts that share an alternate point of view etc. [33]\nDesigning for trust. While ShareAware helps users through\nnudging, it in itself poses a risk due to its access to user data for gen-\nerating nudges and explanations. Instead of deferring the question\nof trust to external oversight, legislation or practices such as open\nsourcing the design, experts felt that ShareAware needed to primar-\nily perform all the inferences on the client side and borrow from\nprogress in areas such as Secure Multiparty Computations [51].\nSumming up, the feedback from our experts regarding the cur-\nrent shortcomings of our prototype and future challenges closely\nmatch our proposed research agenda. A novel perspective stems\nfrom the consideration of social and HCI theories to complement\nthe more technical research questions proposed in this paper.\n5 DISCUSSION\nThis section covers (mainly non-technical) related research ques-\ntions that are important but not part of our main research agenda.\nEthical concerns. The line between nudging and manipulating\ncan be very blurred. Efforts to guide users\u2019 behavior in a certain\ndirection automatically raises ethical questions [ 3]. Nudging is mo-\ntivated to be in the interest of users, but it is not obvious if the\ndesign decisions behind nudges and users\u2019 interests are always\naligned. Even nudging in truly good faith may have negative con-\nsequences. For example, social media has been used to identify\nusers with suicidal tendencies. Using privacy nudges to help users\nhide their emotional and psychological state would prevent such\npotentially life-saving efforts. Nudges might also have the opposite\neffects. Users might feel belittled by constant interventions such as\nwarning messages. This, in turn, might make users more \u201crebellious\u201d\nand actually increase their risky sharing behavior [ 7]. When, how\noften and how strongly to nudge are research questions need to be\nanswered before the use of nudging in real-world platforms.Principle & practical limitations. Algorithms for user nudg-\ning based on machine learning generally yield better results when\nmore data is available. As such, social media platforms will likely\nalways have the edge over solutions like ShareAware. Furthermore,\na seamless integration of nudges in all kinds of environments is not\nstraightforward. Our current browser extension-based approach is\nthe most intuitive method. On mobile devices, a seamless integra-\ntion would require standalone applications that mimic the features\nof official platforms apps, extended by user nudges. This approach\nis possible for platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram\nprovide APIs that allow for the development of 3rd-party clients.\n\u201cClosed\u201d apps such as WhatsApp make a seamless integration im-\npossible. Practical workarounds require the development of apps\nto which, e.g., WhatsApp messages can be sent for analysis.\nNudging outside social media. In this paper, we focused on\ndata-driven user nudging in social media. However, our in-situ\napproach using a browser extension makes ShareAware directly ap-\nplicable to all online platforms. For example, we can inject the user\nnudges into any website, including Web search result pages, online\nnewspapers, online forums, etc. However, such a more platform-\nagnostic solution poses additional challenges towards good UX/UI\ndesign to enable a helpful but also smooth user experience.\nBeyond user nudging. Automated user nudging is a promis-\ning approach to empower users to better face the threats on social\nmedia. However, user nudging is unlikely to be the ultimate solu-\ntion but part of a wide range of existing and future efforts. From\na holistic perspective of tackling social media threats, we argue\nthat the underlying methods and algorithms required for effective\nuser nudging \u2013 particularly for risk assessment and visualization/-\nexplanation \u2013 are of much broader value. Their outputs can inform\npolicy and decision makers, support automated, human or hybrid\nfact-check efforts, improve privacy-preserving data publishing, and\nguide the definition of legal frameworks.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper set out to accomplish two main tasks: outlining algo-\nrithmic threats when using social media, and proposing a research\nagenda to help users better understand and control threats on social\nmedia platforms through data-driven nudging. The fundamental\ngoal of user nudging is to empower users to tackle the threats posed\ndue to the information asymmetry between users and platforms\nproviders or data holders. To scale and to compete with these al-\ngorithmic threats, user nudging must necessarily use algorithmic\nsolutions, albeit, in an open and transparent manner. While this\nis multidisciplinary effort, we argue that the multimedia research\ncommunity has to be a major driver towards leveling the playing\nfield for the average social media user. To kick-start this endeav-\nour, our research agenda formulates a series of research questions\norganized according to the main challenges and core tasks.\nAcknowledgements.

The studies have revealed that women face gender -double -\nbind in politics (Engber 2020) and media (Debray et al . 2024) . Dominant ideologies and the \nconstruction of the \u2018Se lf\u2019 and the \u2018Other \u2019 are realised through the discussion of female politicians \nin media ( Herschinger 2012 ). In this MA thesis, I  investigate  the recent period marked by \npresidential elections and the war in Ukraine in media political discourse regarding the most \ninfluential female politicians of the two selected  countries. It is aimed to analyse  with what \nrecurrent themes female politicians are associated in the recent medi a articles from Lithuania and \nthe U .S., and what role conceptual metaphor has in the construction of gender -double -bind \ndilemma . To achieve this aim , 80 articles from four diffe rent media outlets  \u2013 CBS News, Fox \nNews, LRT , and Lrytas , encompassing the time period  of 2021 -2024  were analysed within the \ntheoretical framework of Critical Discourse Analysis with the main focus on thematic analysis and \nits framing by metaphors . The analysis has r eveal ed that female politicians face a gender -double -\nbind dilemma  in the mainstream Lithuanian and the U.S. media representations, where they are \nexpected to lead  and be responsible for their countries\u2019 actions regarding national and internationa l \nissues , yet at times, they  are discussed  within the frame of traditional femininity . \n \nKeywords: media political discourse , gender -double -bind dilemma , female politicians, Critical \nDiscourse Analysis, Critical Metaphor Analysis, recurrent themes.  \nRakt iniai \u017eod\u017eiai: politinis \u017einiasklaidos diskursas, lyties stereotip\u0173 dilema,  moterys politik\u0117s, \nkritin\u0117 diskurso analiz\u0117, kritin\u0117 metafor os analiz\u0117, pasikartojan\u010dios temos.    \n \n  \n 5 INTRODUCTION  \nWomen have fought for many years to ensure gender equality. Society has moved towards a \nbroader understanding of women\u2019s roles in social and political spheres . Gender stereotypes have \nevolved over the decades; the perceptions of women's capability in the labour force and \nintelligence have risen (Santoniccolo et al. 2023 , 4). A female politician is no longer a surprising \ncareer choice. There have been female political leaders all around the globe, holding high positions \nof power  such as P rime minister and President. Although female political leadership is evident, \nfemale political leaders still face biased repercussions from the media. The media often focuses on \ntheir family relations, and criticises them for their femininity, or lack thereof . \nThere have been numerous studies conducted on the gender -double -bind, revealing that women \nface conflicting societal expectations (Butler 200 6; De Beauvoir 20 15; Kruks 1992). The media \nsamples in this research will be collected from the period of 2 -3 years, involving the current times \nof crisis.  Some claim that female political leaders are not capable of handling serious decisions \nbecause of their emotional nature (Engber 2020 , 102). Therefore, i t can be speculated that during \ntimes of crisis, the media tends to focus more on the nurturing and maternal qualities of female \nleaders. Such representation in the media might reinforce the perception that  women are less \ncapable of performing certain roles in politics.  \nThe research aim is to analyse how female political leaders are discursively represented in news \nmedia (political) discourse , and to what extent the gender -double -bind dilemma is ideologically \nenacted. To achieve the above , the following research objectives  were raised:  \n1. To analyse how female political leaders are discursively represented in the news media . \n2. To identify the recurrent themes associated with female leaders hip. \n3. To investigate how gender -double -bind dilemma (double standards) is discursively \nenacted . \n4. To overview the role of metaphor in gender -double -bind dilemma representation . \n5. To compare the reoccurring similarities and differences across the data set s. \n \nThe outline of the paper  is as follows . The thesis comprises six parts, namely, an introduction, a \ntheoretical overview, a methodology, an empirical analysis, conclusions , and a summary . The \n 6 summary is provided in both Lithuanian  and English languages, and a list of references and data \nsources is included at the end. Additionally, the appendix contains a table with examples that were \nanalysed.  \nThe literature review encompasses  the general principles of Critical Discourse Analysis, the \ndiscourse of news, specifically the gender -double -bind dilemma in news media discourse, and \ncritical metaphor analysis with a focus on ideological metaphor use. Background information on \nthe chosen politicians is also included . The second part presents data characteristics . In the third \nchapter, the results collected from these articles are discussed, and the most prominent examples \nof metaphor use are analysed in more detail by comparing the media outlets. The thesis concludes \nwith a summary of the research findings. The following section will elaborate on the key concepts \nof the theoretical framework that form the basis for this thesis.  \n1. LITERATURE REVIEW  \nThis section deals with the main principles of the theoretical framework of the research. It consists \nof four main sections, which present  and discuss  critical discourse analysis, critical metaphor \nanalysis, gender issues, and metaphor use in political discourse. The  fourth  section provides \nbackground information about the selected political leaders from Lithuania  and the U.S. , namely  \nDalia Grybauskait\u0117, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris.  \n1.1. Critical Discourse Studies  \nThe discourse theory project was initially developed by Michel Foucault in the 1970s \n(Angermuller et al . 2014 , 98). Later, Norman Fairclough defined discourse as a sum of three \nelements involving social practice, text, and discoursal practice (Fairclough 1995 , 74). Critical \nDiscourse Analysis (CDA) lacks a unified framework (van Dijk 2001 , 353) and involves  various \ninterdisciplinary practices, which treat language as a form of social practice. To practically apply \nCDA, Fairclough has developed a framework consisting of three stages (cited in Snowdon & \nKarlsson 2021):  \n\u2022 Language analysis which determines the target group as active or passive.  \n\u2022 Identif ication of the intended audience and its relation to the author.  \n\u2022 Interpret ation and analysis of social practice to recogni se the relationship between ideology \nand text.  \n 7 Regarding ideology, Norman Fairclough ( 1995 , vii\u2013viii) extensively discusse s the relationship \nbetween sociocultural change, discourse, and ideological premises in professional practices. He \nclaims  that ideologies are not found  in the texts themselves; they arise from the interpretations of \nthose texts and their social setting ( ibid., 80). Critical Discourse Analysis provides a framework to \nunderstand how media texts reinforce certain ideologies and biases. Overall, it studies the way \ninequality and power abuse are enacted through language in the political sphere (Van Dijk 2001 , \n352). According to Antonio Reyes, CDA analyses the construction of the \u201cOther ,\u201d which is a \nproduct of ideology in society (2011 ).  \nOne of the recent  studies investigating gender ideologies in politics has been  conducted by Carolin \nDebray et al. (2024) , where  images, texts, and media reports were investigated. By looking into \nthe discursive strategies that the media sources apply, the scholars found out that media relies on \ndominant ideologies and therefore the portrayal of female politicians is biased; they are  held to the \nmale standard (Debray et al. 2024 , 67). Ideology is employed in t he process of creating identities , \nwhich  works through \u201cinclusion\u201d and \u201cexclusion ,\u201d which create the dichotomy  of the \u201cSelf\u201d and \nthe \u201cOther\u201d  (Herschinger 2012 , 67). For instance, a nother study by Schneider and Bos (2014) has \ndetermined that female politicians  are often viewed as a \u201csubgroup\u201d of women (Schneider & Bos \n2014 , 253). Moreover, s ome scholars state that the \u201cOther\u201d is usually created regard ing \nimmigrants, although, women are also often targeted by far -right political parties (Pettersson et al. \n2022 , 4). \nConsequently, language often functions as a tool for legitimisation and delegitimisation practices \nin politics. Francesco Screti  (2013 , 212) describes legitimisation as \u201cdiscursively creating and \ntransmitting a positive image of the Self; delegitimizing means discursively creating and \ntransmitting a negative image of the Other\u201d . For instance, Antonio Reyes delves deeper into the \nprocess of legitimisation and deligitimisation in politics (2011). The author discusses the discourse \nstrategies that politicians themselves employ to persuade constituents (Reyes 2011). The author \ndistinguishes separate categories of legitimisation, for instance,  legitimisation through emotions, \nsuch as sympathy or fear ( ibid.).  \nThe discursive strategies are often employed to victimise or demonise (Reyes 2011 , 789\u2013790). \nAccording to Wodak (2015 , 2), slogans, speeches, posters, and other media are instrumentalised \nin producing and reproducing dominant ideology. Fairclough (1995 , 5) claims that spoken and \n 8 written discourse conforms to the dominant ideologies and relations of power employed in news \nmedia production . The study by Ross and Rivers  (2017 , 1) provides insights into how  \nlegitimisation is achieved by prescribing positive values and deligitimisation occurs through \nsarcasm. The study investigated  memes , a contemporary phenomenon, which are used to mock \npolitical candidates  (Ross & Rivers  2017 , 1) with sarcasm  and metaphors as a part of figurative  \nlanguage  (Skalicky 2018). Specifically, metaphoric expressions  are valued for their encoded  \nconceptual information (ibid.). The paragraphs below will dis cuss the role of metaphor in media \npolitical discourse.  \n1.2. Critical Metaphor Analysis  \nDelving deeper into the topic, m etaphor can be described as a discourse structure and a mental \nmodel, which includes ideological implications (A rcimaviciene & Jonaitiene  2015 , 346). In \npolitics, metaphors are coined and employed to legitimise democracy and delegitimise, for \ninstance, terrorism (Hellin 2013 , 302). Therefore,  metaphor  is viewed as an essential part of \nconceptualising reality and producing Us versus Them binary oppositions ( Arcimaviciene & \nJonaitiene  2015 , 347). Metaphoric expressions represent mappings between source and target \ndomains (Musolff 2006 , 24), the basic  meaning of which derives  from embodied  experiences. The \npioneers  of the Conceptual M etaphor Theory Lakoff and Johns on (1980/2003)  claim that abstract \nconcepts are generally perceived through more specific concept ual experience  (Lakoff and \nJohns on 2003 , 116). The authors illustrate that with the conceptual metaphor of LOVE IS A \nJOURNEY (Lakoff and Johns on 2003 , 117), where more specific experie ntial domain of journey \nis mapped onto the more abstract domain (ibid.).  \nIn political discourse, s ome scholars argue that the most popular conceptualisation is realised  via \nthe \u201cgame \u201d (Brugman et al. 2019 , 43) and \u201cwar\u201d frames (Lapka 2021 , 85) that have shared features \nof competitiveness . Another reason why metaphors are ubiquitous in political discourse is their \nnarrative simplicity. Mio, for instance, claims  that people are limited in their understanding of all \nkinds of information; they tend to focus on the topics they are interested in (1997 , 117). The use \nof metaphor can evoke interest in an issue through a \"part -to-whole\" relation ( ibid.). Through the \nanalysis  of metaphoric utterances, researchers can unde rstand why women are represented \ndifferently in media (Arcimaviciene & Jonaitiene  2015 , 345).  \n 9 The study of metaphors used by male and female politicians was conducted  by Arcimavi\u010dien\u0117 \n(2023 ). The study included the analysis of metaphors in the first lockdown speeches of the COVID -\n19 pandemic . The study concluded that males and females use similar conceptual metaphors, yet \nideologically, they serve different purposes (Arcimaviciene 2023 , 15). For instance, the WAR \nmetaphor in male politicians' discourse is employed to mobilise the nation against the pandemic, \nwhile in female politicians \u2019 discourse, the metaphor stands for the general concept of \u2018 fight\u2019  \nwithout the confrontational divide between the nation and virus -as-the-enemy  (ibid.). Overall, the \nempath etic language use is more evident in female politicians\u2019 discourse ( ibid.) \nIn political discourse, metaphors are also used to persuade  (Lapka 2021 , 85) the audience of \npoliticians\u2019 right intentions . The study by Burgers, Brugman, and Vis (2019 ) investigate s the use \nof conceptual metaphors for promot ing ideas that are in line with liberal and conservative \nconservatives ( ibid., 44).  One of the reasons why metaphors can vary is explained by cognitive \nprocesses, therefore, \" various contextual factors constantly in fluence the way we conceptuali ze \nthe world \u201d (K\u00f6vecses  2014 , 23). The scholars (Brugman et al . 2019 , 44) give the example \nconceptualising economy in terms of weather  that influences  people to believe that the problems \nrelated to it are outside of people\u2019s control . The study conclude s that in certain situations  the use \nof metaphors can make a difference in how political discourse  impacts  its audience (ibid., 60).  \n \n1.3. Gender Double  Bind Dilemma in Discourse/ News Media Discourse  \nGender is a topic that is especially  widespread nowadays. Media and various political movements \npromote gender equality (Santoniccolo et al.  2023 , 2). Butler (2016)  emphasises the division \nbetween gender and sex and argues  that the two terms  cannot be used interchangeabl y. Sex is the \nterm describing biology , especially in the context  of hormones, anatomy, etc ., while gender is \napproached as a psychological construct shaped by society ( West & Zimmerman 1987 , 125). \nJudith Butler  draw s on L\u00e9vi  Strauss's concepts and describes  sex as the \"raw\" material and gender \nas its \"consequence\" , therefore, t his binary relationship is responsible for specific power dynamics \nwithin culture (2006 , 50). Consequently , gender is perceived as the rationale and outcome of \nvarious social arrangements for both males and females ( West & Zimmerman 1987 , 126). The \nsocial impact of gender perceptions is seen in the division  of labour , and social expectations that \nare prescribed in society based on gender  (ibid., 128).  Therefore , it is fair to say that b iological sex \nemerges as a significant socio -demographic factor , which forms perceptions of competence (Bligh \n 10 et al.  2010 , 827). Such ideas were debunked by several reports in the media that highlighted the \nfact that female leaders managed to deal better with the COVID -19 crisis rather than male political \nleaders  (Debray et al . 2024 , 53). Nevertheless, c ompetent women are often perceived as \nemotionally cold, but not able to handle stressful situations, while men are perceived to be \ncompetent enough to lead, particularly in times of uncertainty ( Bligh et al . 2010 , 827). The \nfollowing sections explain  the contradictions in women's roles.  \nCambridge Dictionary Online (2024) explains d ouble -bind as a situatio n in which regardless of \nthe position a person takes, they cannot avoid displeasing outcome s. From a psychological point \nof view,  women  in politics  are perceived as not competent enough to assume leadership , yet \nlacking attributes stereotypically  linked to  women ( Schneider & Bos 2014 , 259).  Some scholars \nargue that female candidates are often associated with the ability to handle social welfare issues \nbetter than men, yet they are perceived as less competent in matters related to defence , crime, and \nthe economy (Jones 2016 , 628).  Most female candidates face double -bind stereotypes if their \ncampaigns do not conform to stereotypical gender roles ( Costa 2020 , 1). For instance, t raditional \nwomen tend to be represented in a more positive light (Huber & Baena 2022 , 243).  Therefore, \nfemale politicians often highlight their maternal qualities. Scholars discuss the fact that  the former \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton often speaks about her grandchildren,  Senator  Kirsten  Gillibrand  \noften highlights  her role as a mother, and Vice President Kamala  Harris  tends to  positively discuss  \nher relationship with her stepchildren  (Winfrey & Carlin 2023 , 141).  The emphasi s on maternal \nqualities can sometimes work for or against female politicians  in certain situations.  \nFurthermore, scholars have observed that the media often emphasi ses the physical appearance of \nwomen  (Huber & Baena 2022 , 241). For instance, even female scientists attract the media \u2019s \nattention regarding their looks  (ibid.). In politics, female s tend to be held to a higher standard than \nmale s (Costa 2020 , 1). Some scholars argue that the sexist treatment of female politicians is \ndecreasing; however, studies show that female politicians are still considered to be unlikeable, \nphysically weak, and unfit to be leaders (Winfrey & Carlin 2023 , 134). The examples above \nillustrate  that female politicians find themselves balancing between femininity and masculinity. \nSuch situations often result in a double -bind; they are not feminine enough to be likable and not \nmasculine enough to lead ( ibid., 141).  \n 11 1.4.  Background Information About Female Political Leaders  \nNowadays, with the rising equality, it is no longer surprising to see women holding powerful \npositions. In Lithuania\u2019s political history, there has been one female president and two female \nPrime Ministers. In the political history of the United States, the re have been three female \npresidential candidates. The following subsections will provide an overview of the most influential \nfemale political leaders of the two selected countries, focusing on their political work and impact  \non society . \n1.4.1.  Dalia Grybauskait\u0117  \nGrybauskait\u0117 (b. 1956) is a former Finance Minister, economist, and the former president of the \nRepublic of Lithuania. She became president in 2009 and was re-elected  in 2014, becoming the \nfirst woman to hold the presidential post in Lithuania (Deloy 2014). After her first term, she gained \nthe title of the 'best-elected president' in Lithuania\u2019s history ( ibid.). \nAfter b ecoming president in 2009, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 i ntroduced changes in Lithuania\u2019s decision -\nmaking  processes regarding foreign policy affairs (Janeli\u016bnas 2021). She encouraged  politicians \nto reevaluate relations with Russia and Belarus. During her second term, she expressed support for \nDonald Trump and strongly critici sed Russia\u2019s behaviour  on the international s cale (ibid.). \nGrybauskait\u0117 initiated the relationship  between Lithuania and the Nordic countries,  setting the \nNordic countries as  examples of democracy  to establish closer ties between Lithuania and the West \n(ibid.). During her presidency, she served as the head of the Council of Women World Leaders \n(2014 \u20132019) ( President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 2023 ). Since 2020, she has been working for the \nUnited Nations, preparing documents and recommendations to ensure international financial \ntransparency ( Istorin\u0117 Lietuvos Respublikos Prezident\u016bra Kaune 2024 ). \nHer leadership style has been extensively analy sed in academia.  One of the scholars who have \ndiscussed the style of female political leadership is H annah Engber. In her research, she claims  \nthat female politicians are subjected to greater scrutiny for public approval compared to male \npoliticians  (2020). Engber writes  that Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 is an example of resilience within the \npolitical sphere ( ibid.). Engber further draws parallels between Grybauskait\u0117  and Margaret \nThatcher  regarding their outspokenness . The media has given Grybauskait\u0117 the titles of \"Steel \nMagnolia of the Baltics\" and the \"Iron Lady,\" reflecting her  tough demeanour regarding  \n 12 Lithuania\u2019s  relationship with Russia . Furthermore , Grybauskait\u0117  has compared Vladimir Putin\u2019s \npolitical regime to the governance styles of Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler (Engber 2020 , 107).  \nAnother study, focusing specifically on metaphorical analysis, examined the leadership discourse \nof many world leaders, including Dalia Grybauskait\u0117. Conducted by Liudmila Arcimavi\u010dien\u0117 and \nVida Jonaitien\u0117 (2015), th e research investigated the use of metaphors in Grybauskait\u0117's and other \npoliticians' speeches. The scholars discovered that from 2010 to 2012, the former president \nemployed 42 metaphors, involving  thematic domains of strength/unity, journey, and \npersonification (Arcimavi\u010dien\u0117 & Jonaitien\u0117  2015). They argue that Grybauskait\u0117's strategic use \nof metaphors evokes notions of strength, assertiveness, and authoritative power, where unity is \ndeemed essential for political and social capacity  (Arcimavi\u010dien\u0117 & Jonaitien\u0117 2015 , 350\u2013356).  \nOverall, the scholarly investigations of her leadership style align with the notion that Dalia \nGrybauskait\u0117 is a leader widely recogni sed for her outspokenness  and strong  political decisions.  \n1.4.2.  Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117  \nIngrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 (b. 1974) is the current Prime Minister of Lithuania, who came to  power  in 2020. \nShe was a candidate in the presidential election of 2019. \u0160imonyt\u0117 is the second woman to hold \nthe position of Prime Minister, following Kazimira Prunskien\u0117, who served as Prime Minister  at \nthe time  when Lithuania regained its independence (Deloy 2020).  \n\u0160imonyt\u0117\u2019s career includes holding high -ranking positions in public administration (Eriksonas \n2019). Her political career  began when she joined the Ministry of Finances in 1997 ( Visuotin\u0117 \nLietuvi\u0173 Enciklopedija  2024). S he served as the head of the Tax Credit Office in 2002  and later \nbecame  the Minister of Finance in 2009 ( ibid.). In 2022, she became a member of The Homeland \nUnion \u2013 Lithuanian Christian Democrats party ( ibid.). The outgoing government consisted of 13 \nmen and 1 woman;  therefore,  her goal was to establish a coaliti on with equal representation  (Deloy \n2020). She did not become president i n 2019, as she  lost her presidential candidacy to Gitanas \nNaus\u0117da.  \nIngrida \u0160imonyt\u0117's diplomatic strategies have been discussed in academia. In her recent study, \nAmber Brittain -Hale, for instance, analyses \u0160imonyt\u0117's communicati on online during the Russo -\nUkrainian war era (Brittain -Hale  2024). In scholarly discourse, \u0160imonyt\u0117  is considered to be  a \nprominent European politician , elected to be the voice of million s of people  (ibid.). Furthermore, \n 13 the analysis proves that \u0160imonyt\u0117's broadcasted messages serve as examples of  collabora tion, \nempathy, and a commitment to  resolve the conflict without violence (Brittain -Hale  2024 , 174). \nMoreover, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 held a leadership position and was responsible for  managing the \nCOVID -19 crisis.  Scholars have noted the small number of women serving as top chief executives \nduring the pandemic (Piscopo & Och 2021).  Nevertheless, h er decision against utilising the \nSputnik V vaccine in Lithuania was interpreted as Lithuania's suspicion toward Russia's actions \nand motives (Kojala 2021).  Rasa Bortkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 describes \u0160imonyt\u0117's leadership as \n\u201ctransformational \u201d (Bortkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117  2023 , 7). Among women leaders in the Global North, \u0160imonyt\u0117 \nis known for her responsibility in policy-making  that kept COVID -19 deaths per one hundred \nthousand people under one hundred (Piscopo & Och 2021 , 6). Therefore , her leadership during  the \nCOVID -19 pandemic is viewed positively by many . \n1.4.3.  Hillary Clinto n \nHillary Rodham Clinton ( b. 1947 ) was born in Illinois and was the eldest child of parents who \nowned a business (Caroli, Britannica 2024). Her parents  valued hard work and encouraged her to \nchoose the career that she wanted the most (whitehouse.gov  2024 ). Clinton's career in politics and \npersonal life has been heavily discussed in the media. Her political success, particularly in relation \nto her gender, has been an important topic in academia (Uscinski & Goren 2011; J. J. Jones 2016; \nJ. Lee & J. Lim 2016 ). \nIn 2000, she ran for the New York Senate seat and was elected by the majority of voters ( National \nWomen\u2019s History Museum  2024). In 2006, she was re-elected  to the Senate, and in 2008, she ran \nfor the presidential campaign against Barack Obama ( Caroli, Britannica 2024).  Scholars have \nconsidered Hillary Clinton to be the right candidate for the presidential post (Jones  2016). Despite \nthat, Obama was inaugurated as president in 2009.  \nHillary Clinton's political career has attracted  attention both in the media and scholarly discourse. \nMany have criticised her for her lack of femininity and  trustworthiness, particularly in the context \nof losing to Donald Trump in the presidential election (Engber 2020 , 103). Noor Ghazal Aswad \ndescribes  Clinton  as an establishe d politician who unexpectedly lost to a billionaire reality TV star \n(Aswad 2018 , 56). The outcomes of the 2008 and 2016 elections raised interest in her political \ncampaigns. Her personality traits  had been previously examined in the 2008 presidential election . \n 14 The findings  suggest  that Hillary Clinton lacked charisma, which  may be considered a  weakness \nin a leader (Bligh et al. ). The media coverage of the 2016 election similarly suggests that the lack \nof charisma was one of the contributing factors to Clinton's defeat (Aswad 2018 , 57). Overall , \nHillary Clinton\u2019s performance in the 2016 election was evaluated negatively  even by her \nsupporters ( Lau et al. 2019 , 424).  In both elections, Clinton lacked  the qualities  necessary to meet \nthe demands of the general public.  \nA study regarding her style of speech was conducted by Jennifer J. Jones (2016). The study relies \non sociology, psychology, and linguistics to examine the phenomenon of the \"double bind\" evident \nin Hillary Clinton's speech.  The analysis focused on  function words and the emotional elements \nwithin linguistic styles, which are seldom  investigated in scholarly discourse (Jones 2016 , 631). \nThe study  suggests that Hillary Clinton  conformed  her speech toward a more masculine style  \nduring her active engagement in politic s.  \n1.4.4.  Kamala Harris  \nHarris  (b. 1964)  is the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American \nto hold the position of Vice President of the United States ( The White  House 2024). As a member \nof the Democratic Party, she is known  for her significant contributions to women's rights, \nhealthcare, and LGBT+ rights.  \nHer professional career includ es serving as a deputy district attorney in Oakland throughout the \n90s, where she dealt with s erious cases involving drugs, gang violence, and sexual abuse \n(McNamee, Britannica 2024).  She became district attorney in 2004 and, in 2010, made history as \nthe first female and the first African American to be elected attorney general of California ( ibid.). \nAs a prosecutor, Harris argued that the majority of  committed crimes are non -violent, but the way \nthe system treats such offenses  wastes resources (Chettiar & Waldman 2015). She initiated \nprogrammes to reduce  violence, prosecute violent criminals, identify the root causes of youth \noffenders' criminal behaviour, and provide support to victims ( ibid.). \nMoreover, she refused to defend Proposition 8, which banned same -sex marriages , and therefore \ncontributed to its overturn in 2013 ( McNamee, Britannica 2024). In 2015, she ran for the U.S. \nSenate seat and won.  She has also advocated for the improvement of maternal health care, \ninfrastructure, and opportunities for small businesses ( The White House  2024).  After becoming \n 15 Vice President in 2021, she advocated for women's freedom in decisions about their bodies, and \nthe safety concerning gun violence, and established alliances with leaders from 150 countries ( The \nWhite House  2024). Additionally, she played a n important  role in the landmark Inflation \nReduction Act, which addresses the climate crisis ( ibid.). \nHarris\u2019s leadership has been  analysed  by many . Scholars note that she breaks stereotypes and \nchallenges the p atriarch y within the government  itself  (Locke & Joseph 2021).  She often promotes  \nherself as a part of the general public.  According to Hanan A. Amaireh, the inclusivity  aspect plays \na key role in female politicians \u2019 discourse  (Amaireh 2022 , 1767). It preaches a shared identity \nbetween the public and the politician herself ( ibid.). Moreover , Harris\u2019s  discourse in the media  \naddresses the challenges that women face in the United States ( ibid.). Nevertheless, the evaluations \nof her work have not always been positive. Harris has encountered backlash for her positive view \non the death penalty and her defensive stance on police officers accused of misconduct  (Locke & \nJoseph  2021 , 454).  \n  \n 16 2. DATA AND METHOD S \nThis study aims to primarily distinguish the recurrent themes in the mainstream media articles and \nsubsequently analyse the metaphoric expressions within the recurrent themes.  \nTo achieve the aim, a total number of 80 articles were collected and analysed  within the period of \n2021 -2024. First, t he articles were select ed by random sampling , while searching for the \npolitician\u2019s name in the search bar . In the second round, each  of the articles was qualified whether \nthey focus on the selected political leader.  More details are provided in the Table 1 below.  \nTable 1.  Data Characteristics  \nFemale leader  Media source  Time span  Word count  \n1. Kamala Harris  CBS News   2023 -2024  5258  \nFOX News  2021 -2024  5763  \n2.

Dalia Grybauskait\u0117  LRT  2022 -2024  4720  \nLrytas  2023  6692  \nTotal  46,903 \nAs shown in  Table 1 , 80 articles  with the overall coverage of 46,903 words  have been chosen for \ninvestigating recurring themes and metaphorical expressions : 40 articles come from the US and \n40 articles come from the Lithuanian sources. The selection criteri a for the data collection are as \nfollows:  \n1) Reference to the f emale leader . The chosen articles had to include female politician\u2019s \nname.  \n2) Time p eriod . The articles were chosen during the time period of four years of 2021 -2024. \nThe period of 2 -3 years is marked by important  and recent events in society, such as \npresidential elections, the imprint of COVID -19, and the war in Ukraine.  \n3) Media bias . The sources were investigated using an online media bias check engine  \n(www.mediabiasfactcheck.com ). The  sources were separated into two main categories:  \nleast biased or leaning towards political left (CBS News and LRT)  and sources leaning \ntowards political right (Fox News  and Lrytas).  \n 17 4) The politic al leaders \u2019 nationality .  Two Lithuanian and two U.S. female leaders.  \n5) Politic al status . Both Lithuanian and U.S. female political leaders, who are actively \nengaged in politics and currently hold position in power; and two female political leaders \nwho stepped down from active politics ( i.e., Kamala Harris  and Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117  with a \ncurrently a ctive  position in power  Hillary Clinton  and Dalia Grybauskait\u0117  with a formerly \nactive position in power ). \nThe study relies on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), specif ically drawing on Fairclough\u2019s \n(1995 , as cited in Qiu 2013 ) three -dimensional model, identifying and interpreting recurrent \nthemes  in the primary stage of the coding procedure . Fairclough identifies three main steps that \nmust be taken to effectively analyse discourse:  \n1. Text analysis  (the language description ). \n2. Discourse practice ( interpretation  of the text ). \n3. Sociocultural analysis (social reasoning ). \nThe Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP), as developed by the Pragglejaz Group (2007), was \nprocedurally implemented in the second step of the analysis . According to MIP  (2007) , the \nfollowing steps are taken to identify  the metaphorical nature of the unit and/or expression : \n1. The contextual meaning for each  lexical  unit must  be identified . \n2. The basic contemporary  meaning in other contexts  must  be identified . \n3. The lexical unit can be marked as metaphorical  if the two meanings are different but are \ncompatible in the context of use.  \nDrawing upon the Conceptual Metaphor T heory by Lakoff and Johnson ( 1980/ 2013) , the form ula \nis \u2018A IS B\u2019 was applied in reference to the conceptual source and target domains. F or instance, in \nthe conceptual metaphor of ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT\u201d  (Lakoff & Johnson 2013 , 86), A \nrepresents the target domain  of ARGUMENT, while B represents the source domain  of FIGHT . \nThe expressions containing metaphorical meanings were selected manually  and coded in Excel . \nFor clarification of the basic meaning Cambridge  Dictionary Online (2024) and online dictionary \nof etymology were used.  \n 18 The statistical  data s uch as raw frequency  and metaphorical density  was used for the purposes of \ncomparison of the recurr ent themes and metaphor use in the U .S. and Lithuanian  mainstream \nmedia in reference to four female politicia ns. The following section presents the findings of the \nresearch and the detailed discussion.  \n  \n 19 3. RESEARCH FINDINGS  \nThe analysis of 80 articles (40 from the U .S. and 40 from Lithuania)  resulted in 922 thematic \nthreads where female politicians were referenced. In the CBS News , Kamala Harris  was referenced \nthe most frequently at 72%, while Hillary Clinton was referenced at a significantly less rate of \n28%.  Regarding the Lithuanian media, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 , who is currently Prime  Minister of the \nLithuanian government, was targeted on LRT at the range of 61% and 55%  in the Lrytas articles, \nBy comparison , the references to  Dalia Grybauskait\u0117  are lower though without significant \ndifferences in the coverage range ( i.e., 39% on LRT and 45% on Lrytas ). Table 2 below  \nsummarises the trend of female politicians\u2019 media coverage across the media sources.  \nTable 2.  Research Findings  \nFemale p olitical \nleaders  Media source s \nCBS News  Fox News  LRT  Lrytas  \nKamala Harris  138 (72%)  112 (46%)    \nHillary Clinton  73 (28%)  138 (54%)  \nIngrida \u0160imonyt\u0117    169 (61%)  103 (55%)  \nDalia Grybauskait\u0117  103 (39%)  86 (45%)  \n  461 (10 ,814 words)  461 (9 ,138 words)  \nTotal  922 (19 ,952 words)  \n \nThe results above illustrate the initial hypothesis  that the representation of politicians aligns  with \nthe media source\u2019s political views and the politicians\u2019 active/passive role in politics . Regarding \nthe selected U.S. media  sources , Kamala Harris was referenced quite extensively in both media  \noutlets  due to the upcoming presidential elections  in the U .S. It is not surprising  that Kamala \nHarris , being the representative of the Democratic  party , was thoroughly  referenced by CBS Ne ws, \nwhich is  a left-centre  media outlet , that prioritises the coverage of material related to liberal \npolitical views  (mediabiasfactcheck.com).   \nFurthermore , Hillary Clinton , who is known as a representative of the  Democratic party, was \ncovered significantly less  by CBS News  (28%)  than Kamala Harris . The reason for such an \noutcome might be the fact that she is a former secretary of state and no longe r holds an active \npower position in politics. Surpri singly, she was covered more by the Fox News, the source  known \nfor its political bias , right-wing political views , and a lack of critique regarding conservative \npoliticians  (mediabiasfactcheck.com). The reason for such results could be the fact that Hillary \n 20 Clinton is known to openly criticise her former 2016 presidential election rival Donald Trump, \nwho is an active member of politics and a member of the Republican party  (political right). \nRegarding Kamala Harris and Fox News, she is mentioned in 46% of the analysed material . \nKamala Harris is the Vice -President of the current U.S. President Joe Biden, who is running against \nDonald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, therefore, she i s covered quite extensively in both \nmedia outlets.  \nThe results of the Lithuanian media indicate that Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 is covered quite extensively in \nboth media sources. The politician is a candidate for the presidential office in 2024. According to \nthe Media Bias Fact Check, LRT is the least biased Lithuanian source, leaning slightly to the left \n(mediabiasfactcheck.com ); therefore , it is not surprising that Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 , as the head of the \nincumbent government and the member  of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats \u2019 party,  is covered \nmore on LRT (61 %) rather than Lrytas (55%).  \nMoreover, the coverage of Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 , unlike the media coverage of Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117, \ndoes not exceed 50% in both media sources.  The former president no longer actively participates \nin politics yet is outspoken about the war in Ukraine. She is known for her extensive critique \nregarding Vladimir Putin \u2019s actions  (Engber 2020 ); therefore, it is not surprising that she is still \nfrequently referenced by the media.  The content analysis of the collected data is described in the \nfollowing subsections.  \n3.1.  Recurrent Themes Associate d with  Female Political Leaders  \nOut of 922 instances, 3 major themes were identified in each country\u2019s media coverage regarding \ntheir references  to female politic al leaders . The themes are summarised in Table  3 below . \nTable 3. Recurrent Themes  \nU.S. female  \npolitical leaders  \n Media sources  \nCBS News  Fox News  \nTheme  RF \n(COV)  Theme  RF \n(COV)  \nKamala Harris  Abortion rights  34 Abortion rights  \n 17 \nVisit  34 Anecdote  17 \nElection  9 Migration  13 \nHillary Clinton  Book  20 Election  66 \n 21 TV series  19 Transgender  \nissues  14 \nScandal  \n 7 Hotline  \n 9 \nWar in Ukraine  7 Human rights  9 \nTotal  130 145 \nLT female \npolitical leaders  LRT Lrytas  \nTheme  RF Theme  RF \nIngrida \u0160imonyt\u0117  Party election  63 Military aid  35 \nPresidential \nelection  28 Protest  13 \nBudget  24 Slogan  11 \nDalia \nGrybauskait\u0117  War in Ukraine  53 Presidential \nelection  51 \nRelationship with \nRussia  25 War in Ukraine  18 \nEvent  \n 7 Visit  17 \nTotal  200 145 \n \nRegarding Kamala Harris, as observed in Table 3, the t heme  of \u2018Abortion rights\u2019 is the most \nprominent in both media sources , which is not surprising as the Vice-President is known for being \nan advocate of women\u2019s rights (McNamee, Britannica 2024).  With the recent overturn of the Roe \nv. Wade abortion regulation act in 2022 (Britannica 2024),  the theme  is mentioned  twice more \nfrequently on the CBS News  (a liber al source) than on the Fox News . Moreover, the CBS News \nfocuses on Kamala Harris \u2019s various visits  during the presidential election  campaign . By contrast, \nthe Fox News focuses on sensitive issues related to Kama la Harris  such as her \u201cAnecdote ,\u201d and \nmigration issue s that are of concern to right -wing political parties, specifically the former president  \nand presidential  election candidate Donald Trump (Bolter et al., migrationpolicy.org  2022). \nRegarding Hillary Clinton, the CBS News tend mostly to focus on lighter topics such as Clinton\u2019s \nbook and TV series. It is worth noting that the news outlet wrote about Clinton\u2019s support regarding  \nSana Marin\u2019s scandal  and the war in Ukraine was prominent.  The Fox News deal with the themes \nrelated to Donald Trump such as the presidential election  and Trump\u2019s alleged \u201chotline to  Russia\u201d . \nShe is finally related with the sensitive topics such as human rights and transgender issues.   \nThe theme of election was one the most recurrent themes in the LRT  articles with the 2022 \nreferring to Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 \u2019s candidacy in the party election and more recent articles from 2024 \n 22 focus ing on the upcoming presidential election. Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117, being the former Minister of \nFinance, was mentioned several times regarding budget issues.  Due to the current war in Ukraine, \nthe Lithuanian media tend s to focus on the theme of war  with Lrytas articles focusing mostly on \nthe military aid ( 35 instances). Within that context, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117\u2019s campaign sloga n in \nassociation with Vladimir Putin  was also mentioned . Finally, the Lrytas articles  extensively \nhighlighted the farmer s\u2019 protest in Lithuania . \nThe former President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 was mentioned several times , regarding the war in \nUkraine. In the LRT  articles , Grybauskait\u0117\u2019s name was dominating in the topics related to t he war \ndirectly , the overall relationship with Russia , and a more light -hearted theme regarding an event \nof a national holiday.  In the Lrytas  data set , the thematic references to Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 included \nthe upcoming presidential election in Lith uania, the war in Ukraine, and her visit to Taiwan, which \nwas heavily criticised by President Gitanas Naus\u0117da.  \nIn the second coding stage, the most recurrent metaphorical expressions and their representative \nsource domains were identified and compared across the collected media texts. The analysis of the \nmetaphoric expressions aims  at identifying any gendered uses that place women politicians into a \ngender -double -bind (Lim 2009). Consequently , the relationship betw een the metaphor and the \nrecurrent theme  will be discussed  in the context of gender -double -bind dilemma . The overview of \nthe source domains and their frequency is provided in Table 4 below.  \nTable 4.

In the CBS there are fewer metaphor ic expressions  than in its counterpart - Fox \nNews ; however, the CBS News references to the female political leaders are more metaphorically \nmarked. In the Lithuanian media, the us e of metaphors is similar ly spread across both outlets , \nalthough the Lrytas  references  to the female political leaders  are less metaphorical (1 ME per 169 \nwords) . The general trend of fewer metaphoric expression s per entire data set is explained by the \nfact that only metaphoric expressions in references to female political leaders were considered for \nthe analysis.  \nAs the current study aims to investigate media bias es regarding female politicians\u2019 representation , \nit is hypothesised that metaphors will represent shared attitudes and opinions  about the female \npolitical leadership .  As observed  in Table 4 above , 11 source domains were the most frequent in \nthe CBS and FOX News articles , while 1 3 source domains were evoked in the Lithuanian  data set.  \nOnly 9 most recurrent source domains  were selected for a more detailed analysis, (see Table 4 and \nFigure 1 /Figure 2  below ) as follows  PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, WAR, BODY, MOTION, \nand FOOD  in the U.S. media data set and JOURNEY, BODY , THREAT , and NATURE  in its \nLithuanian counterpart. The findings also point out to the overlapping source domains across the \ntwo data sets which are JOURNEY, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, WAR , MOTION  and BODY . \n \nFigure 1. Prevalent Source Domains in the U.S. \nmedia  (%) \n  \nFigure 2.  Prevalent Source Domains in the \nLithuanian media (%)  \nThe source domains  were selected and grouped  from both countries\u2019 media  according to the \nsimilarities  in their epistemic correspondences : \n\u2022 WAR & THREAT  \u2013 both source domains are connected to violence and have negative \nconnotations. THREAT  is the primal feeling and an initial stage of WAR.  \n\u2022 BOD Y & MOTION  \u2013 the two source domains are related to human body  as a mechanism; \noverall the concept of BODY  and its ability to  MOVE  in SPACE.  \n\u2022 NATURE  & JOURNEY  \u2013 both source domains are conn ected by the idea of change. \nNATURE has its cycle and JOURNEY is an act that brings change.  \n\u2022 PERSONAL RELATIONS HIP & FOOD \u2013 both source domains are related to culture. \nFOOD is a part of culture , while consuming FOOD is  both a cultural and PERSONAL  act. \nDue to the limited length of the thesis, only t he group ed source domains  will be analysed in more \ndetail and their specific  examples will be provided  in the following subsections of the thesis .  \n  4.8\n5.42.62.11.4\nPersonal relationship War Body Motion Food1.8\n1.51.61.6\nJourney Nature Body Threat\n 25 3.1.1. The Metaphors of WAR & THREAT  \nAs mentioned previous ly, WAR is the source domain that is recurrent in both countries \u2019 media , \nwhile the source domain of THREAT  is quite extensively used in the Lithuanian media. Both  \nsource domains involve negative emotions , as illustrated in the examples below.   \nAccording to Lakoff (201 3), we can understand complex systems using  metaphor. Metaphor , as a \nsystem , does not  hold any morality or immorality, therefore  it is a useful tool in understanding \ncomplex or abstract situations , such as war  (ibid., 5). Lakoff states that metaphor is used to \nunderstand international relations and war (Lakoff 2013).  Therefore, i n times of war or conflict , \ncertain political rhetoric emerges , where the narrative differentiates between what it means to be \nmale or female ( Aggestam et al. 2018). For instance, in the example below, Kamala Harris is \ndescribed as a \u201chostess \u201d having a meeting with a \u201cbattleground state \u201d. She is prescribed feminine \nqualities yet dealing with the matters of ELECTION  conceptualised as WAR.  \n(1) A weekend meeting hosted by  Vice President Kamala Harris with battleground state  \ngovernors included no conversation about removing President Biden from the \nDemocratic Party ticket, but plenty of talk about how to discredit special counsel Robert \nHur's rep  (CBS News , 2024 ). \nIn this example, there is a combined use of two types of traits: combativeness in politics and \nentertainment in social relationships, with the latter specifically attributed to Kamala Harris.  \nAnother example below illustrates a different situation, where Kamala Harris is associated with \nactive agency in political decision -making, i.e.  \u2018targeting\u2019 the migrant crisis.  \n(2) Vice President Harris this week returned to focusing on targeting  what the \nadministration believes are the \"root causes\" of the migrant crisis at the southern \nborder, announcing $1 billion in additional funding and a new initiative to direct money \nto Central America (Fox News, 2023).  \nOther examples represent the metaphors used to comment on the ongoing war in Ukraine and its \nconsequences. Lakoff\u2019s (2013) idea that metaphor s can offer moral assessment of complex reality . \nIn this case, Hillary C linton is indirectly cited where she antagonises Russia -as-the-Other by using \nthe WAR  metaphor and thus expressing her moral stance on Russia\u2019s agency in the on -going \nconflict.   \n(3) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the trafficking of women and girls  is \n\"sadly exploding  in Ukraine\" and neighboring countries after Russia's invasion  (CBS \nNews , 2022 ). \n 26 This example clearly portrays Hillary Clinton as an assertive politician who can make harsh  \njudgments on the ongoing issues.  \nThe assertive stance is also d isplayed  in the Lithuanian  media , wher e Dalia Grybauskait\u0117  is \nreferenced in the context of her assessment  of the war in Ukraine .  In (4), the female political leader \nis directly cited , where she ideologically confronts  the collective Self (Ukraine and Europe)  with \nthe collective Other ( Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenka ). By doing so, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 \nlegitimises the collective Self through its opposition to the collective Other (Screti, 2013, 212).   \n(4) Paklausta, kaip situacija gali klostytis toliau, D. Grybauskait\u0117 sak\u0117, jog yra akivaizdu, \nkad kova u\u017e Ukrain\u0105  taip pat yra kova u\u017e Europ\u0105 : \u201eTai jau yra visos Europos karas. \nJei nesustabdysime  Putino ir Luka\u0161enkos Ukrainoje, jie ateis prie m\u016bs\u0173 sien\u0173 ir jie \nprad\u0117s puolim\u0105  \u2018the fight for Europe \u2019 (LRT , 2022 ). \nAs mentioned in the theoretical framework, war is the most frequently used domain to explain \npolitics (Lapka 2021, 85).  The following cases involve the metaphor of THREAT , which is used \nin the theme of Presidential election in both, Lithuania and the U .S. In previous studies of political \ndiscourse  analysis, it is observed that the same WAR metaphor  can have different ideological \nmeanings when used by male and female political leaders. For example, female politicians referred \nto the WAR metaphor  through its generalised aspect of fighting without evoking the aggression \nscenario (Arcimaviciene 2023). In the examples below, the female politicians are described in their \ndiscussion of foreign policy and international conflicts by mainly referring to the concept of \nTHREAT. This metaphor is traditionally us ed in political discourse for a clear stance of the \npolitical leader to refer to the ideological divisions between groups or countries.  Thus, the  female \nleaders with these examples are positioned in the narrative of confrontational rhetoric, where Dalia \nGrybauskai t\u0117 (4, 6) and Hillary Clinton play an active role (3, 5):  \n(5) Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton warned  this weekend that \nformer President Trump will try to withdraw the U.S. from NATO if he wins re -election \nin November (Fox News , 2024 ). \n(6) D. Grybauskait\u0117s biuro atsakas Tikina, kad G. Naus\u0117da neturi pana\u0161um\u0173 su apie \nprezidento rinkimus svarstan\u010diu I. V\u0117gele Prie\u0161 prezidento rinkimus \u2013 daugyb\u0117 m\u012fsli\u0173: \nmatyt\u0173 gr\u0117sm\u0119  net D.

The following section will deal with metaphors related \nto the source domains of body , and motion.  \n3.1.2. Metaphors of BODY  & MOTIO N \nWomen politicians are widely discussed using  the B odily Senses and Motion  source domains. In \nmany instances, the representation of Kamala  Harris was constructed in the contexts of public polls \nand surveys, where the conceptual metaphor of UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING played a primary \nrole. It should be noted that by using both metaphoric al expressions of \u201cholding a net negative \nview\u201d and \u201cholding a p ositive v iew\u201d. In the example below, Kamala Harris is described in the \npassive role of being assessed, her agency is thus determined by the public view.  \n(7) In a November survey, 29% of registered voters said they  held a net negative view of  \nHarris, compared to 52% who said they held a net positive view  of her  (Fox News, \n2024 ). \nIn the example  (8), the negative assessment of the former Lithuanian President  Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 \nis provided by the representatives of the incumbent government  through the use of the adjective \n\u201ckandi\u201d, which  is associated with the bodily action of biting . By using this metaphor, the  bodily \nsenses are mapped on the target domain of more negative assessment : \n(8) D\u0117l D. Grybauskait\u0117s kelion\u0117s \u2013 kandi  G. Naus\u0117dos patar\u0117jo replika \u2018abrasive \u2019 (Lrytas, \n2023).  \n \nIn (9) below, the former president is cited by employing the metaphor of MOTION. In the \ncitation, she personifies Lithuania and its  ability to withstand Russian propaganda . The use of \nthis metaphorical  expression follows the same pattern of conformational rhetoric assigned to \nDalia Gr ybauskait\u0117. Such behaviour in political discourse  is generally  associated with traditional \nmasculinity : \n(9) Buvusi Lietuvos prezident\u0117 Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 teigia, kad Lietuva  i\u0161moko atsispirti  \nRusijos propagandai ir i\u0161gyventi prie\u0161o pa\u0161on\u0117je \u2018learnt to withstand \u2019 (LRT, 2024).  \n \nIn the example s below, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117\u2019s criticism is metaphorically assigned the sensory \nsource domain of \u201cbitterness \u201d. Metaphorical adjectives such as \u201csweet \u201d and \u201cbitter\u201d , tend to \nencode the brain with  \u2018emotion\u2019 more than non -metaphorical adjective s (Thibodeau et al. 2017, \n289).  Therefore, in this case, the use of \u2018bitter\u2019 expresses negative emotions  on Grybau skait\u0117\u2019s \n 28 behalf aimed towards the political  elite. This expresses her power status and recognised legitimacy \nof the leader, who can take a critical stance towards the elite. The concept of \u201cbitterness\u201d is \nfrequently contextualised within the farming of traditional femininity , at the same time within this \ncontext the female leader is shown  as the one who contests the status quo : \n(10) Po Kaliningrado tranzito klausimo kulminacijos Grybauskait\u0117s karti kritika  politiniam \nelitui: matome bla\u0161kym\u0105si ir apgail\u0117tin\u0105 komunikacij\u0105 \u2018bitter critique \u2019 (LRT , 2022 ). \n \n(11) Dvi kadencijas prezident\u0117s pareigas \u0117jusi D. Grybauskait\u0117 negaili kar\u010di\u0173 \u017eod\u017ei\u0173  m\u016bs\u0173 \npolitikos elitui, teigia, kad jis demonstruoja negeb\u0117jim\u0105 daryti strateginius sprendimus, \ntai priver\u010dia bla\u0161kytis  \u2018bitter words \u2019 (LRT, 2022).  \nThe above -mentioned  source domain  of MOTION  is another conceptual domain  that is frequently \nevoked in the references to female political leaders . According to Lakoff and Johnson ( 1980/ 2003 ), \nthe source domain of MOTION  is closely related to time  and, more specifically, represen ts \nmovement in time ( ibid., 42). The example  (12) below illustrates Kamala Harris\u2019s active election \ncampaigning through the MOTION metaphor, while (13) illustrates Dalia Grybauskait\u0117\u2019s \nconfrontational attitudes to Russia as an aggressor, e.g.: \n(12) It will be Harris' fourth stop a month after her nationwide tour kicked off  on Jan. 22 in \nWaukesha County, Wisconsin  (CBS News , 2024 ).  \n(13) Nei mes j\u012f suk\u0117l\u0117me, nei mes j\u012f a\u0161triname, o, jeigu atsitraukin\u0117sime  ir leisime tokiems \nagresoriams  lipti ant galvos , jie u\u017elips ant vis\u0173 m\u016bs\u0173 , pakeis vis\u0105 tvark\u0105 ir gal\u0173 gale \ntur\u0117sime labai blogas pasekmes , su kuriomis nesusitvarkysime, \u2013 d\u0117st\u0117 D. Grybauskait\u0117  \n\u2018backed off; get on \u2019 (LRT, 2022 ). \nIn (12), Kamala Harris\u2019s election experience is described in terms of the MOTION metaphor that \ngenerally signifies  change and on -going action. By contrast, i n (13) the MOTION source domain \nis used to ascertain Dalia Grybauskait \u0117\u2019s critical view of Russia as a \u201ctrespasser\u201d. This example \nsolidifies Grybauskait\u0117 \u2019s image of being direct  and harsh in her political assessments.  \n3.1.3 . Metaphors of NATURE & JOURNEY  \nPeople are influenced by metaphors because they evoke emotion ( Thibodeau et al. 2017 , 289), and \nNATURE is one of those source domains that affects how the  received  information is processed . \nThe examples below illustrate the NATURE metaphor that represent extremely powe rful \nemotions : \n(14) Lietuvos vie\u0161ojoje erdv\u0117je kilo s\u0105my\u0161is , kur\u012f gesinti tur\u0117jo  ir pati premjer\u0117, ir Lenkijos \npremjeras Donaldas Tuskas \u2018put down  the fire\u2019 (Lrytas , 2024 ). \n 29 (15) Premjer\u0117s pasakymai \u012f\u017eieb\u0117  diskusijas vie\u0161ojoje erdv\u0117je \u2013 Vyriausyb\u0117 sulauk\u0117 kritikos \nd\u0117l to, kad dar n\u0117ra i\u0161sprendusi \u0161i\u0173 teisini\u0173 formalum\u0173 \u2018sparked \u2019 (Lrytas , 2024 ). \n(16) Pastarieji dveji metai parod\u0117, kad m\u016bs\u0173 klaidos, m\u016bs\u0173 silpnyb\u0117s yra tai, kod\u0117l Ukrainoje \nvis dar liejamas kraujas \u201c, \u2013 nurod\u0117 ji  \u2018blood is pouring\u2019  (Lrytas, 2023)  \n(17) Internetas o\u0161ia : I. \u0160imonyt\u0117 rinkim\u0173 kampanijai pasirinko V. Putino naudot\u0105 \u0161\u016bk\u012f  \n\u2018internet rustles \u2019 (Lrytas, 2024).  \n(18) Politik\u0117 taip pat nurod\u0117, kad neketina pretenduoti tapti eurokomisare, \u201en epaisant \nkar\u0161tai verdan\u010dios  diskusijos\u201c, \u201eMan Lietuvoj tvoros \u017eydi \u201c, \u2013 nurod\u0117 premjer\u0117  \u2018fences \nbloom \u2019 (LRT, 2023).  \nThe examples above showcase how w omen face certain expectations in politics. If female \npoliticians exhibit traits that are not associated with femininity, such as for instance assertiveness, \nthey are punished for it (Costa 2020). In this case, the assertive stance of the Lithuanian P rime \nMinister was met with backlash from the public. The word '\u012f\u017eieb\u0117\u2019 (sparked) denotes an intense \ndiscussion associated with intense emotion s. As mentioned in the theoretical  overview , female \npoliticians are often considered to be not competent enough and incapable of handling serious \nmatters because of their emotional nature (Engber 2020, 102).  It can thus be argued such \nmetaphoric al expressions representing the source domain of NATURE can foreground the societal \nbias of traditional femininity guided by uncontrolled emotion.  \nThe uncontrolled emotion is also expressed in the example (17). In this case, the slogan that the \nPrime Minister chose to use called out strong reactions online. The verb \u201co\u0161ia\u201d indicates that the \nPrime Minister provoked \u201ca storm\u201d on the internet. As it was mentioned in the theoretical \nframework, conceptualising certain matters in terms of weather denotes a lack of control (Brugman \net al.  2019 , 44). Despite that, in example (18) , the Prime Minister says that \u201cthe fences are \nblooming\u201d for her in Lithuania, meaning that she claims not to be affected by the negative public\u2019s \nopinion.  \nMoreover, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 employs the metaphor of NATURE speaking about matters related \nto war in Ukraine. She claims that \u201cthe blood in Ukraine is still pouring like water\u201d. Negative \nemotions  and societal problems are also discussed in the U.S. media.  The role of the negative \nemotions as conveyed by the NATURE metaphor can be also recognised in the overturn of the \npro-abortion act is described as a natural phenomenon associated with the dissolution of materials \nover time. The metaphor can imply Kamala H arris\u2019s lack of control over the overturn of the Roe \nv. Wade decision, e.g.: \n 30 (19)  Not VP Kamala Harris watching the erosion of #RoeVsWade from her plane, at a \ndistance (Fox News , 2022 ). \nAnother example related to the source domain of NATURE  indicat es that the problems in the \ncountry are deep and not easy to get rid of, yet her government is doing everything they can and \nalready seeing positive outcomes, e.g.: \n(20) Our root causes  strategy and these investments represent a long term development \neffort, but we are already beginning to see positive trends ,\" she said on Monday (Fox \nNews, 2023).  \nAnoth er example of the NATURE metaphor is  water -related and is used in reference to Kamala \nHarris\u2019 ratings e.g.: \n(21) The favorability rating for Vice President Kamala Harris continues to sink  nine months \nahead of the 2024 presidential election in November (Fox News, 2024).  \nAnother source domain that was used extensively in reference to female political  leaders is that \nof JOURNEY. The m etaphor of JOURNEY is generally viewed as one of the most frequent \nconceptualis ations of political events, with their  focus on change and progress (Moragas -\nFern\u00e1ndez et al. 2018 , 521).  In the examples below, the Lithuanian politicians are described  as \ntaking \u2018step s\u2019 or \u2018steering the wheel \u2019 and thus being actively engaged in politics:  \n(22) Paklaustas, ar tarp I. \u0160imonyt\u0117s politini\u0173 ambicij\u0173 tapus partijos nare gali b\u016bti ir \nart\u0117jantys prezidento rinkimai, M. Jastramskis abejojo, ar eidama Ministr\u0117s \npirminink\u0117s pareigas ji imt\u0173si tokio \u017eingsnio  \u2018step\u2019 (LRT , 2022 ). \n(23) M.Laurinavi\u010dius: visi\u0161ka nekompetencija Ap\u017evalgininko M.Laurinavi\u010diaus teigimu, \nkadencij\u0105 baigusios prezident\u0117s D.Grybauskait\u0117s vizitas Taivane \u2013 labai svarbus \n\u017eingsnis \u2018step\u2019 (Lrytas , 2023 ). \n(24) LRT.lt primena, kad iki 2009 met\u0173 i\u0161kilmingus pri\u0117mimus rengdavo prezidentas Valdas \nAdamkus su pirm\u0105ja \u0161alies ponia Alma Adamkiene, ta\u010diau \u0161i tradicija nutr\u016bko, kai \nekonominio sunkme\u010dio laikotarpiu valstyb\u0117s vair\u0105 per\u0117m\u0117  prezident\u0117 Dalia \nGrybauskait\u0117, atsisakiusi rengti pri\u0117mimus tada, kai dauguma \u0161alies \u017emoni\u0173 susiduria \nsu finansiniais sunkumais \u2018took the steering wheel\u2019  (LRT , 2022 ). \nAs see n in the examples above , the JOURNEY metaphor is used to foreground female political \nleaders\u2019 agency in politics , which  is associated with competitiveness (in 22) and active political \nrole (in 23 and 24 ). In (24), Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 is described not only as an active agent but as the \none who stood her ground and refused to waste resources during the economically challenging \nperiod . This use of the JOURNEY highlights the female leader\u2019s responsibility and resistance.  \n 31 By contrast, in reference to Hillary Clinton\u2019s reference in the Fox News, this metaphor can have \nnegative connotations, e.g.: \n(25) Clinton\u2019s comments are a stark departure from  what she once described as the \"highest \npriority.\" (Fox News , 2022 ) \nClinton is referenced only by her second name. Moreover, \u201cstark\u201d implies darkness. Such \nrepresentation of Clinton\u2019s rhetoric implies that she can radically change her views, therefore, she \ncannot be trusted.  \nTo sum up, it can be argued that female politicians\u2019 actions are often associated with the source \ndomain of NATURE , which can denote intense emotions  that cannot always be controlled . \nNevertheless, they are also expected to lead their countries  and governments despite challenges , \nas is denoted using  the JOURNEY metaphor.  The following section will deal with metaphors of \nPERSONAL RELATIONS HIP and FOOD.  \n3.1.4. Metaphors of PERSONAL RELATIONS HIP & FOOD  \nThe source d omains of PERSONAL RELATIONS HIP and FOOD are extensively used in  the U.S.  \nmedia  sources, though their examples are also found in the Lithuanian media  in reference to the \nfemale leaders.  Both source domains involve personal lives and domestic spheres , the examples \nof which  are presented  and discussed  below.  \n(26) Vice President Harris and governors dish on immigration, abortion, special counsel \u2014 \nbut not on dumping Biden  (CBS News , 2024 ). \n(27) Kamala Harris roasted for Thanksgiving pic: 'Is that a gas stove ?' (Fox News , 2023 ). \nIn the examples, the use of t he verb s \u201cdish\u201d and \u201croast for\u201d as well as direct reference to \u201cgas \nstove\u201d  raise associations in line with the domesticated environment . In previous studies it has been \nshown how references to domestic space, specifically  a woman\u2019s kitchen (see example 27) can \ncontribute to enacting traditional gender roles ( Lim 2009). In addition, Kamala Harris is criticised , \nwhich can imply that  her feminine traits are not empowering her but contrarily  diminishing  her \nagency . Another  example  of such criticism is observed in the following example:  \n(28) Vice President Kamala Harris attempts to explain AI in latest word salad gaffe : 'Kind \nof a fancy thing'  (Fox News , 2023 ). \n 32 The metaphor suggests that Harris is incompetent , she is trying to say as much as possible yet \nwithout any valuable exchange of ideas . According to Costa  (2020 ), female  politicians receive \nmore negative evaluation regarding the ir communication style rather than their male  colleagues .  \nA similar trend is observed in t he Lithuanian media, where a well -known Lithuanian proverb  \u201cA \nspoon of tar spoils a barrel of honey \u201d is metaphorically used in the context of the presidential \nelection . The role of p roverbs  in displaying metaphoric al language  and social attitudes has been \nwidely discussed by linguists  (Mieder  & Dundes 1994 , 56). In this case, the proverb is used to \ncompare two presidential candidates and the consequences regarding the election  outcome . In the \nmetaphor ical meaning, Dalia  Grybauskait\u0117 \u2019s political career is compared to a barrel of honey , \nwhile her loss to Gitanas Naus\u0117da in the presidential election is viewed as a reputation issue  for \nher political career.  \n(29) Jeigu ji eina ir pralaimi tuos rinkimus G.Naus\u0117dai , kas irgi yra pakankamai realu, \npolitin\u0117s karjeros pabaiga gaunasi \u0161iek tiek su \u0161auk\u0161teliu deguto statin\u0117je medaus , kas \ngali b\u016bti tai, ko D.Grybauskait\u0117 ne visi\u0161kai trok\u0161ta \u2018with a teaspoon of tar in a barrel of \nhoney \u2019 (Lrytas , 2023 ). \nIt can be argued that references to food can display the attempts of displaying the characteristic of \ngender biases towards female political leaders.  In a similar way, the f eminine qualities are \nprescribed to Kamala Harris , when she is in the role of a hostess . As mentioned previously, gender \nassociations signify social expectations of traditionally perceived gender norms (West & \nZimmerman 1987).  The examples below illustrate how the source domain of PERSONAL \nRELATIONSHIP  is used in the political context:  \n(30) It was described by people familiar with the exchange  as an  intimate listening session , \nwhere governors who have overseen their large states during the COVID -19 pandemic, \nwon tough reelection fights and could one day face off against the vice president in (CBS \nNews, 2024).  \n(31) Many voters think President Biden is too old to run in 2024, but Vice President Kamala \nHarris refuses to engage  in speculation about what would happen if President Biden \nwere unable to stay in the race (CBS News, 2023).  \n(32) I.\u0160imonyt\u0117 teig\u0117, kad nuomoni\u0173 yra \u012fvairi\u0173 ir tai n\u0117ra jokia paslaptis  \u2018is not a secret\u2019  \n(LRT , 2023) . \nWords such as \u201cintimate\u201d and \u201cengage\u201d are used to describe Vice President\u2019s actions in politics, \nwhich blurs the line between the public and the personal. Example (32)  mentions \u201csecrets\u201d as a \npart of politics. In the following example  below , Kamala Harris is described as not having a \u2018cozy\u2019 \nrelationship with Joe Biden . It is interesting to note how the etymology of this word derives from \n 33 Scandinavian and refers to \u201ca padded covering for a teapot to keep the heat in, \u201d (etymonline.com) . \nThe etymological and contextual cues point  out to the overarching theme of personal relationship \nbetween Joe Biden and Kamala Harris , which can potentially undermine the latter\u2019s agency in the \npolitical decision -making.  \n(33) \"In terms of her popularity, that's a big question and it could be a big risk. It just depends \non where she shows up, when she shows up, and what she has to say, because she and \nBiden don't exactly have a cozy relationship ,\" she noted  (Fox News , 2023 ). \nAnother example, involving  the theme of personal relationship' comes from the Lithuanian media \nsource. In the example, the Prime Minister of Lithuania  is described as not being able to continue \nher relationship with the party. Such examples illustrate how political leadership transitions from \nthe private to the public sphere (Lim 2 009, 255), which blurs the line between the two and can \ngive rise to certain biases. The  themes the politicians are mentioned in deal with serious public \nmatters yet  are described with words typically associated with private spheres.  \n(34) Anot politolog\u0117s, d\u0117l u\u017eimam\u0173 pareig\u0173 I. \u0160imonyt\u0117 t\u0119sti tokio santykio  su partija ilgai \nnegal\u0117s  \u2018to continue the relationship\u2019  (LRT , 2022 ). \nIn (35), there is another instance of such use realised by the Lithuania verb \u201c vie\u0161inti \u201d. According  \nto the etymology dictionary of the Lithuanian language (etimologija.baltnexus.lt), the word \n\u2018vie\u0161inti/ vie\u0161\u0117ti\u2019 derives from Balto -Slavic and means to be a guest at somebody\u2019s house. In the \nexample below , the Prime Minister \u2019s visit to Bucharest can affect the politician\u2019s  agency and \nportray her role in the process as less significant, e.g.:   \n(35) \u0160iomis dienomis Bukare\u0161te vie\u0161inti  ministr\u0117 pirminink\u0117 Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 tre\u010diadien\u012f \nsusitiko su Rumunijos prezidentu Klausu Iohannisu ir Suomijos premjeru Petteriu Orpo  \n\u2018staying with\u2019  (Lrytas , 2024 ). \nThe examples above have demonstrated that wom an politicians and their q ualities regarding their \npolitical careers and their opinions are metaphorically described in terms of food or personal \nrelationships. Such representation positions female politicians as leaning towards the domestic \nrather than the public sphere , which  can be an indicator of gender -double -bind in media political \ndiscourse . \nTo summarise, t he analysis of the metaphorical expressions in reference to female politicians has \nresulted in eight prevalent source domains that were recurrent in both the Lithuanian and the U.S. \nnews mainstream media  in the time period of four years from 2021 to 2024.  The overlapping \n 34 source domains represent the following semantic fields: WAR & THREAT , BODY & MOTION, \nNATURE & JOURNEY, PERSONAL RELATIONS HIP & FOOD.  \nThe source domains of WAR , THREAT  and JOURNEY were the most frequently realised . The \nsource domains projecting female political leaders\u2019 agency  within the media narrative can serve \ndifferent purposes. They  can be used to project female political leader\u2019s agency and \nconfrontational tactics.  Furthermore, female political leaders\u2019 agency is projected through the \ntarget domain of emotions structured through the source domain of BODY. The lack of political \nagency is realised through the source domains of FOOD and NATURE.  \n  \n 35 CONCLUSIONS  \nThe analysis of the recurrent themes and metaphorical expressions regarding female politicians \nhas led to the following conclusions . \nIn the 80 articles analysed, there w as an equal number of references  to female politicians in both \nLithuanian and  U.S. media sources (461). The m edia sources referenced th e female politicians  \nwithin the framework of their political views  as well as the current status of the politic al leader. \nThe themes associated with female politicians in the media sources are context -depen dent. In the \nU.S. media, the most referenced themes were abortion rights, elections and migration. In the \nLithu anian media, most female politicians were contextualised within the themes of elections, the \nwar in Ukraine, and military aid . Therefore, female politicians \u2019 current political role also \ndetermined their referencing and description . \nThe representation of and reference s to both countries\u2019 female politicians  can depend  on the bias \nof the media source.  The American m edia sources that are considered to be leaning towards \npolitical right , reference female politicians regarding sensitive issues , such as a joke by Kamala \nHarris, which was misunderstood, topics related to Donald Trump  and Hillary Clinton, as well as \ntransgender issues . The Lithuanian right -leaning source Lrytas, focused on \u0160imonyt\u0117\u2019s \ncontroversial slogan and President  Naud\u0117da\u2019s critique of Grybauskait\u0117\u2019s political visits . Yet, \nsurprisingly, in both  right -leaning sources , the representation of female politicians is less \nmetaphorically marked . \nThe framing analysis of the recurrent themes resulted in contextually paired source domain s: WAR \n& THREAT , BODY  & MOTIO N, NATURE & JOURNEY, PERSONAL RELATIONS HIP & \nFOOD.  The source domains  of JOURNEY , PERSONAL RELATIONS HIP, WAR, and BODY \nwere used the most in both countries' media  sources . Additionally, the analysis has revealed that \nthe U.S. media is more  metaphorically loaded , especially the Fox News (1 ME per 52 words) , \nwhile  the Lithuanian media source that uses the least metaphors in reference  to female political \nleaders is LRT (1 ME per 169 words).  \nThe source domain s of WAR & THREAT  position female politicians as both active and passive  \npolitical agents. By comparison, the source domains of BODY & MOTION  project agency and \nemotional aspects of their political leadership. The s ource domain of NATURE emphasi ses their \n 36 lack of control, while the JOURNEY metaphor denote s change and progress. The source domains \nof PERSONAL RELATIONS and FOOD  provide an ambiguous assessment of how female \npolitical leaders are represented, though mainly the focus on the traditional femini nity associated \nwith the meanings of domesticated identity.  \nIt can be claimed that the initial hypothesis was confirmed. The metaphors employed in the \nrepresentation of female political leaders exemplify the double expectations regarding politicians\u2019 \nleadership.  Additionally, the media representation of female politicians aligns with the source\u2019s \nmedia bias and the politicians' active/passive position in politics.  \nDue to the limited length  of the research, the analysis encompassed the years 2021 -2024 and four \nfemale politicians from two countries. The research is limited since  more articles from more media \noutlets  could have been analysed, encompassing a longer period of time  in order  to compare the \nrepresentation of female political leaders throughout the years. Additionally, a Corpus -based \napproach could have been implemented.  \nDespite its limitations, t his research has contributed to the fields of gender, politic al, and media \nstudies, represent ing that gender -double -bind is a  prevalent issue  and its linguistic realisations \npoint out the complexity of this issue . In the current times of uncertainty,  ongoing war s, changing \nlaws, and elections, female politicians are expected to lead their countries,  simultaneously  \nconforming to traditional gender roles . In further studies , more attention could be given to the \nchanges regarding gender -double -bind realisations in political discourse over time , by including \nmore countries and more female politic al leaders into the analysis.  \n  \n 37 DATA SOURCES  \nCambridge Dictionary.

The Politics of Fear. What Right -Wing Populist Discourses Mean.  DOI: \n10.4135/9781446270073.w  \n 50 SUMMARY  \nFemale leadership is evident all around the globe  with women hold ing power positions  such as \nPrime minister or President. Yet to this day, female politicians  face gendered stereotypes. For \ninstance, f emale politicians are held to a higher standard and face sexist attitudes (Costa 2020 ). \nThe study aims to analyse how female political leaders are discursively represented in the media \n(political) discourse, and to what extent gender -double -bind dilemma is ideologically enacted. To \nachieve the  goal set  above, the following research  objectives were raised: (1) to analyse how are \nfemale political leaders discursively represented in the news media, (2) to identify the recurrent \nthemes associated with female leaders, (3) to investigate how the gender -double -bind dilemma \n(double standards) discursively represented,  (4) to overview the role of metaphor in gender -\ndouble -bind dilemma representation, (5) to compare the reoccurring similarities and differences \nthe across the data set.  \n461 references to female politicians in the U.S. media sources and 461 references in the Lithuanian  \nmedia sources were identified and analysed within the theoretical framework of Critical Discourse \nAnalysis . The prevalent themes that were established across the data set are as follows:  war, \nabortion rights, elections, and various visits.  Media bias as well as the politician\u2019s active or passive \nrole in politics  contributed to the representation of female politicians . Moreover, the framing of \nthe identified themes was metaphorically analysed and has resulted in the following source \ndomain s: WAR &  THREAT ; BODY & MOTION ; NATURE & JOURNEY ; and PERSONAL \nRELATION SHIP  & FOOD . \n \n \n  \n 51 SANTRAUKA  \nMoter\u0173  lyderyst\u0117 yra akivaizdi visame pasaulyje.

According to recent\npolls, roughly three quarters of Republicans believe that the 2024 investigations on Donald\nTrump\u2019s alleged crimes were unfairly conducted, against only 15% of Democrats (Bal-\nlard, 2024).1In 2019, just before the House hearings on President Trump hypothetical\nimpeachement, the partisan gap on whether he should be impeached was about 80 percent-\nage points. These sorts of contrasts are not new, but they seem larger today than in the past.\nIn 1998, at a similar point in the process of Clinton\u2019s impeachment, the partisan gap was\nabout half that size (40 p.p.), and the same was true in 1974 about Nixon\u2019s impeachment\n(Jones, 2019). Partisanship also in\ufb02uences factual beliefs over the features of immigrants\n(Alesina et al., 2023), the extent of inequality and social mobility (Alesina et al., 2018),\nthe causes of climate change (Kahan, 2015), the risks associated with Covid (Allcott et al.,\n2020a). Why do views differ so much along ideological lines? And could social media\nplay a role?\nWe investigate the mechanisms behind this divergence by studying how people debate\npolitical news during the 2016 Clinton vs. Trump election on a widely used web platform,\nReddit. Our analysis suggests two main conclusions.\nFirst, we document evidence of a political \"ostrich effect\": individuals are substantially\nless likely to engage with news that contradict their political preferences (\"non-consonant\"\nnews), and more likely to do so if the news support them (if the news is \"consonant\").\nFor example, when a recording containing Trump\u2019s lewd comments on women was leaked\nduring the 2016 campaign, Trump supporters decreased their political activity, relative to\ntheir total activity on the platform, by 17.5% and Clinton supporters increased it by 15.3%,\ncompared to independents. For almost a week, partisan users shied away, in relative terms,\nfrom all political discussions (not only those strictly covering the scandal) and engaged\nmore with non-political posts: baseball, \ufb01nancial news, and the likes.\nSecond, based on a model of online interactions, we argue that social media can amplify\nthis \"ostrich effect\" because of a complementarity in news engagement: users engage more\nwith news on which they expect other like-minded users to also be more engaged. The\nreason is that they enjoy receiving positive feedback on their views, and this is more likely\n1The four crimes concern the Georgia election, the Federal election and Jan 6 event, the classi\ufb01ed docu-\nments and the Hush money cases.\n1\nto come from those who share their political beliefs. If a user neglects a piece of news, for\nwhatever intrinsic motive, and anticipates that other like-minded individuals will also do\nso, she is even less attracted to it because she expects fewer validations of her views. And\nconversely if a user is attracted to a spe\ufb01c news. As users with different ideologies engage\nwith different news, their beliefs polarize. Since social media provide more opportunities\nfor social interactions, they amplify any intrinsic force that leads to ideological segregation\nin news exposure, a channel that adds to others already studied in the literature - cf. Levy\nand Razin (2019) and Aridor et al. (2024).\nTo formalize this point and guide the empirical analysis, we formulate a theoretical\nmodel where individuals choose how much attention to pay to political news on a web\nplatform and whether to comment on it. The purpose of commenting is purely social:\nindividuals draw utility from how many likes their comment receives, and post a comment\nif their expected utility is above a given random threshold. Attention is costly and has two\npurposes. First, an instrumental motive, namely to gather information in order to rank two\ncompeting political candidates in an imminent election. Second, a social motive, namely\nto engage with the news and come up with a comment. As users pay more attention to a\ngiven debate, they are also more likely to post likes or dislikes on the comments of others,\nbecause higher attention means more exposure to the post and its comments.\nThe model allows for various intrinsic reasons why users with different ideologies pay\nattention to different news. They may be more or less informed about one of the candidates\n(so that news convey different informational value in a Bayesian sense), they may be more\nor less interested in a topic, or they may \ufb01nd it psychologically pleasant or unpleasant to\nengage with different news. In this last case, beliefs do not only perform a cognitive func-\ntion, but they also shape one\u2019s self image and provide anticipatory utility (or disutility).\nPerhaps unconsciously, individuals trade-off these cognitive and psychological effects, and\nthey are less willing to engage with uncomfortable news (B\u00e9nabou and Tirole, 2011, 2016;\nFlynn et al., 2017; Thaler, 2024). In equilibrium, social interactions associated with news\u2019\nengagement induce more ideological segregation of attention and of comments across po-\nlitical news, compared to a setting without social approval. In turn, this in\ufb02uences beliefs.\nThe rest of the paper provides evidence of these patterns of asymmetric engagement\nand sheds light on the motivations behind them. To do so, we study how users comment\non political news posted on Reddit between June and November 2016. Reddit was the 7th\n2\nmost visited website in the US in 2016, behind Facebook and YouTube but ahead of Twitter.\nWe mostly focus on the platform\u2019s main political community, r/politics , which hosted\n8 million comments made by 285,000 unique users to more than 120,000 news articles\nshared in our period of interest. Users of r/politics are interested in politics and heavily\nengaged in political news, and their online activity suggests that they could be opinion\nleaders of\ufb02ine. They also hold a variety of political views and their engagement with news\non the platform is highly consistent with the online behavior of the general US population,\nas we show below. Two other features of the platform stand out. First, due to the rules\nof the forum, posts on r/politics approximate a \ufb02ow of US political news. Each post\nonly shows the title, the source, and the link of an article strictly related to US politics,\nwhich allows us to focus on political discussions without relying on hard-to-validate topic\nmodels to identify a political debate. Second, in our period Reddit did not select, within\neach community, which post to present to different users based on their revealed tastes.\nThus, different individual engagement across posts is exclusively due to users\u2019 decisions\u2014\nnot those of an engagement-maximizing algorithm. No other major social media platform\nhas such advantages.\nTo study how users\u2019 behavior is in\ufb02uenced by the congruence of the news with their\nideology, we identify r/politics posts that contain \u201cbad news\u201d about Trump or Clinton:\neither political scandals casting doubts on the competence or integrity of the candidate, or\nnew information showing that the candidate was behind in the latest polls. We then employ\na Diff-in-Diff estimation strategy that compares the behavior of independent vs partisan\nusers across different types of news or across different days.\nAs anticipated, our \ufb01rst result is that partisan users are less likely to comment any\npolitical news, compared to independents, in the days immediately following the breaking\nof news of a major scandal on their candidate, and more active in the days after the scandal\nof his / her opponent. The results we previewed around Trump\u2019s leak of lewd comments\nextend, symmetrically, to all three major Clinton scandals during the campaign. Except,\nof course, in this case it was Clinton supporters who shied away from politics and Trump\nones who engaged more. As in the \u201costrich effect\u201d documented in \ufb01nance by Karlsson et al.\n(2009), when political news are likely to focus on scandals on their own candidate, partisan\nusers detach themselves from politics and are instead relatively more active on fora that\ndiscuss sports, entertainment, \ufb01nancial news and the like. Conversely, when the political\n3\ndebate is likely to focus on scandals about the opponent, they are attracted to political\nfora. This effect is not driven only by users\u2019 activity on postings that cover the scandals in\nquestion, it extends to the political discussion overall.\nNext, we explore this pattern more systematically for a wider set of bad news posted\nonr/politics on either Trump or Clinton during the entire period June-November 2016,\nwhich we manually classify by looking at all news posted from Reuters.com on the plat-\nform. On average partisan users are 30% less likely to comment a bad news if it concerns\ntheir candidate, and 30% more likely if it concerns his/her opponent, compared to inde-\npendents, relative to the difference between partisan and independents in their propensity\nto comment general news. Moreover, as predicted by our model and in line with the so-\ncial motive of news engagement, comments on consonant news receive about 70% more\nlikes (net of dislikes) than the average comment, while comments on non-consonant news\nreceive less likes than the average (how much less varies across samples).\nThe theory predicts that these patterns are ampli\ufb01ed in absolute value by an \u201caudience\neffect\u201d. When the audience is larger and debates are more lively, social complementarities\nare more relevant and the difference in behavior between consonant vs non-consonant news\nis larger. With our non-experimental data we cannot precisely identify the presence of these\npeer effects. However, we repeat our analysis on another sample of \u201cmega\u201c-posts (called\nMegathreads), which are created by moderators of the platform for hot topics that draw\nlarge discussions and aggregate many individual postings on the same topic on a single\nposting. Megathreads host large audiences, receiving 7,000 comments as opposed to 44\non the average Reuters post. In this sample, compared to Reuters, we \ufb01nd a much larger\ncontrast in news engagement between consonant vs non-consonant news, as predicted if\nsocial motives are at play.\nTo distinguish among different intrinsic motives for news engagement, we further split\nthe Reuters sample into scandals and negative polls. As outlined in the model, a possible\nexplanation of our \ufb01nding is that users are already more informed about their own candi-\ndate, and hence less interested in news about him/her, whether good or bad. While opposite\npartisan users may be differentially con\ufb01dent about the valence or moral character of the\ntwo candidates, the outcome of polls refers to a single underlying event: who is ahead.\nHence, uncertainty is symmetric across candidates. And yet, we \ufb01nd that, relative to in-\ndependents, partisan users comment less frequently on negative polls for their candidate,\n4\ncompared to negative polls for his/her opponent.\nFinally, we study the content of comments to shed light on the feelings and thoughts of\nusers when they engage with different kinds of news, still with the same diff-in-diff strategy.\nWe \ufb01nd that, when partisan users comment on a scandal on the opponent, they display a\nmore positive and emotional reaction, as if they liked the news. When commenting on a\nscandal on their candidate, instead, they are more negative and rational, as if they tried to\nrationalize and explain an undesirable event. Compared to independents, partisan users are\nalso more likely to speak about scandals concerning the other candidate, if the scandal is\nunpleasant than if it is pleasant. That is, when a post casts doubts on the valence of their\ncandidate, partisan users are more likely to highlight controversies on his/her opponent.\nOverall, these \ufb01ndings are dif\ufb01cult to explain without invoking some form of motivated\ncognition. Differences in policy preferences cannot explain why they engage differently\nwith news concerning the scandals of different candidates. Differences in prior uncertain-\nties cannot explain asymmetric engagement with negative vs positive polls, nor can they\nexplain the patterns of our event studies, where we study engagement with politics overall\naround scandal dates, rather than with a particular piece of news. Differences in the per-\nceived reliability of speci\ufb01c news postings (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2006) seem unlikely\nin the Reuters sample, where all news come from the same source, and in any case they\nalso cannot explain the event studies. Moreover, the content of the comments reinforces the\ninterpretation that these patterns re\ufb02ect feelings of pleasure or discomfort when faced with\ndifferent kinds of news. Finally, the comparison of our results across samples that differ in\nthe size of the active audience, and the results on the number of likes received, suggest that\nsocial motives also play a role and may amplify the magnitude of the psychological drivers\nof news engagement.\nThis paper is related to several strands of literature. The motivation of this work is\ntied to understanding the ideological polarization of beliefs. A common explanation of this\npolarization rests on differential exposure to information across ideological lines (see the\nsurvey by Levy and Razin, 2019, and Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2006, 2011; Bakshy et al.,\n2015; Golub and Sadler, 2016). Our paper suggests a novel explanation of why we observe\npolitical segregation in social media: because individuals enjoy receiving positive feedback\non their views. Moreover, compared to the existing literature, we focus on how individuals\nengage with unpleasant political news, and we study the content of online debates and not\n5\njust selective exposure to news.\nOur theoretical model relates to the literature on rational inattention and its application\nto politics (see Mat \u02c7ejka and Tabellini, 2020 and Ma \u00b4ckowiak et al., 2023 for a general\nreview). Our paper is also related to the large literature on motivated beliefs, surveyed by\nB\u00e9nabou and Tirole (2016). Most of the existing evidence of motivated cognition is based\non experiments, with the exception of Di Tella et al. (2007) and Karlsson et al. (2009). Our\nresult indicate that the \u201costrich effect\u201d found in \ufb01nance by Karlsson et al. (2009) is also\npresent in online political debates.2\nFinally, our \ufb01ndings shed light on how the political debate unfolds on social media\nand broadly relate to the literature on the effects of social media on political ideology and\ninformation acquisition (Bail et al., 2018; Sunstein, 2017; Allcott et al., 2020b; see Aridor\net al., 2024 for a review). Acemoglu et al. (2023) discusses social complementarities in\nthe posting of news, while we focus on commenting activities. Within this literature, we\nare among the \ufb01rst to study data on the Reddit platform and to highlight its advantages for\napplied economic and political analysis, following D\u2019Amico (2018) (see also Moehring,\n2022).\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. The next section formulates a model of news\nengagement and derives a number of predictions. Section 2 describes our data and the\ncontext of the web platform. Section 3 studies the propensity to comment different kinds\nof news and the net likes received, while the content of the comments is studied in section\n4. A \ufb01nal section concludes.\n2 Theory\nThis section describes a simple model of news engagement that guides our empirical anal-\nysis. Individuals choose how much attention to pay to political news on a web platform and\nwhether to comment on it. They are motivated by two goals: to rank the candidates, and to\n2This part of our \ufb01ndings is related to Garz et al. (2020). They analyze Facebook posts by German news\nsources covering the lifting of immunity for German politicians between 2012 on 2017 and \ufb01nd that posts that\nare congenial with the outlet\u2019s ideology receive more likes, shares, and comments. In their case, congeniality\nof a post is de\ufb01ned as the ideological distance between the outlet and the party whose member has received the\nlifting of immunity. Differently from their paper, we focus on evidence at the individual-post level and de\ufb01ne\nwhether a given post is consonant for each single user in our sample. This allows us to capture observed and\nunobserved individual heterogeneity (most importantly in partisanship) and to discriminate across different\nindividual-level motives of engagement with news.\n6\nsocially engage with other users. We start by outlining the social motive, which determines\nwether a user comments on the news. We then study the instrumental motive of ranking the\ncandidates. Finally, we put the two together to determine equilibrium attention and discuss\nthe empirical predictions.\n2.1 Social Motive\nThere is a continuum of individuals composed by a discrete number of types indexed by\niwho differ in their political preferences. Each type has size 1. Individuals are exposed\nto political news indexed by p, described below. With probability P(xi\np)they think of\nsomething to say about the news, where xi\npdenotes individual attention to that news and\nP(.)is a twice continuously differentiable increasing and concave function. Thus, attention\nincreases the probability that the news triggers a thought or reaction that could be shared\nwith others in a comment.\nIf individuals comment on the news, they draw a utility proportional to the number of\nlikes posted on their comment by other users. Likes received are random, and re\ufb02ect the\nattention of other users of the same type. Speci\ufb01cally, with a probability that increases\nwith their attention to the news, individuals read the comments of others and can react by\nposting a like. We assume that individuals post a like with a positive probability only if the\ncomment was made by the same political type (their \"friend\"), otherwise the probability\nof posting a like is zero. Implicit in this assumption is the idea that, although users are\nanonymous, comments re\ufb02ect the true feelings and opinions of users, and likes manifest\nagreement with the content of the comment.\nThus, the expected utility of type ifrom commenting on news pcan be expressed as a\nfunction of the attention of other users of the same type, namely:\nwi\np=W(x\u0000i\np;#i\np)\nwhere\u0000idenotes other individuals of the same type as i,andW(.)is an increasing, con-\ncave and continuously differentiable function of x\u0000i\np. The parameter #i\npcaptures variation\nin expected net likes received, due to factors other than users\u2019 attention. For instance, p\nwas posted when there was a lively and emotional debate that induced others to post more\nlikes on the comments they read. For concreteness, higher values of #i\npincrease net likes\n7\nreceived and hence the expected utility of commenting: W(.)is also increasing in #i\np.To\nsign some comparative statics results, we assume \u00b62W(.)/\u00b6x\u00b6#\u00150.We refer to #i\npas the\nsize of the audience for type iwho comments post p.Since individuals of the same type\nare identical, we let x\u0000i\npbe a scalar. This exploits the fact that, as shown below, in equilib-\nrium all individuals of the same type choose the same level of attention. Since we neglect\ndislikes, no strategic interaction occurs between individuals of different types (i.e. with\ndifferent political preferences).3\nFinally, we assume that individuals post a comment if their expected utility exceeds a\nrandom threshold, wi\np\u0015vp,where vpis distributed according to a uniform distribution\nF(.).\nPutting all of this together, the expected utility of individual ifrom commenting news\npcan be written as:\nvi\np=P(xi\np)F[W(x\u0000i\np;#i\np)]W(x\u0000i\np;#i\np)\u0011V(xi\np,x\u0000i\np;#i\np)\nThe \ufb01rst term is the probability of \ufb01nding something to say in a comment. The second\nterm is the probability of writing a comment, conditional on having something to say.\nTheir product is the probability that the individual comments on the news. The last term is\nhis/her expected bene\ufb01t from the comment. Thus, expected utility increases with own at-\ntention, because it increases the probability of having something to say. Moreover, through\nlikes, the marginal bene\ufb01t of own attention increases with the attention of other users of\nthe same type: \u00b62V(xi\np,x\u0000i\np;#i\np)/\u00b6xi\np\u00b6x\u0000i\np>0.Thus, attention of users with the same po-\nlitical preferences are strategic complements. If individuals expect others of the same type\nto be more attentive to news p,they expect more likes on their comments. This has two\neffects: \ufb01rst it makes them more likely to comment, since wi\np\u0015vpis more likely. Second,\nit induces them to pay more attention in order to be able to write a comment, both because\ntheir expected utility from commenting wi\npis higher, and because they are more likely to\ncomment conditional on their own attention ( F(.)is higher). Hence, as discussed more ex-\ntensively below, news engagement exhibits homophily and induces segregation. Similarly,\nthe marginal bene\ufb01t of own attention is higher if the post has a larger potential audience\u2014\n3In principle, dislikes could be added to the model, assuming that they are posted by users with opposite\npolitical preferences compared to the author of the comment. This would complicate the analysis, however,\nbecause attention of others would be a strategic complement for the same types, and a strategic substitute for\nopposite types. We also neglect higher level comments (i.e comments on the comments of others).\n8\ni.e., if #i\npis larger\u2014since the probability of of receiving likes on one\u2019s comments rises with\n#i\np:\u00b62V(xi\np,x\u0000i\np;#i\np)/\u00b6xi\np\u00b6#i\np>0.\nBut social interactions through comments is not the only reason to follow political news.\nIndividuals are also intrinsically interested in the news for political reasons. We now turn\nto this second motive for attention.\n2.2 Instrumental Motive\nIn line with our empirical setting, political news concern an imminent election. There are\ntwo political candidates indexed by subscripts candc0.From the perspective of voter i,\ncandidate chas quality Qi\nc=\u00e5kci\nkcqkc,wherefqkcgis a vector of true features of candi-\ndatec(eg. his/her policy position on issue kor his/her personal featues), ci\nkc>0is the\nweight assigned by voter ito that feature, and k=1,2,... K. We assume thatfqkcgare\nunobserved and voters\u2019 priors are drawn from independent normal distributions with prior\nmeans mi\nkc>0and prior variances (si\nkc)2. Different voter types have different political\npreferences ( ci\nkc6=cj\nkc)and / or different priors ( mi\nkc6=mj\nkc)for at least some kifi6=j.\nThe news described above (the index p)refer to candidate features, kc.4Speci\ufb01cally,\nat any given moment in time, voters observe a noisy signal si\nkc=qkc+#i\nkcof true feature\nqkc,where #i\nkcis normally distributed with mean 0 and variance (hi\nkc)2.As in the literature\non rational inattention Ma \u00b4ckowiak et al. (2023), the choice of attention is modeled as the\nchoice of the variance of the signals, (hi\nkc)2. Speci\ufb01cally, voters choose the attention levels\nxi\nkcde\ufb01ned as:5\nxi\nkc=(si\nkc)2\n(si\nkc)2+ (hi\nkc)2(1)\nV oters\u2019 expectation of overall candidate\u2019 quality conditional on observing signal si\nkc(i.e\ntheir posterior mean) are denoted by band are formed according to Bayes rule, namely:\n\u02c6Qi\nkc=ci\nkc\u02c6qi\nck+Li\nkc(2)\n4That is, while in the previous subsection we indexed news with p, we will substitute subscript pwithkc,\nto make explicit that news pdiscusses feature kof candidate c.\n5We assume that the choice set is compact: xi\nkc2[\u00afx,1]for\u00afx!0,or equivalently that hi\nkc2[0,\u00afh]for\n\u00afh!\u00a5.\n9\nwhere \u02c6qi\nkc= (1\u0000xi\nkc)mi\nkc+xi\nkcsi\nkcandLi\nkc=\u00e5h6=kci\nhcmi\nhc. The \ufb01rst term is the posterior\non the candidate feature on which the user receives a signal, the second term ( Li\nkc) captures\nthe posterior on all other features, which equal the prior since the news concerns kc. If\nvoters pay more attention, their posterior means re\ufb02ects observed signals more closely.6\nV oters wish to rank the two candidates. Thus, voters\u2019 preferences from this instrumen-\ntal motive of attention are Wi\nkc(xi\nkc) =EiMaxf\u02c6Qi\nkc;Qi\nc0g, where Eiis the expectations\noperator over the posterior mean \u02c6Qi\nkcdescribed above. That is, Wi\nkc(xi\nkc)encodes the ex-\nante expectation of the overall quality of the best candidate, from the perspective of i. It\nisex-ante because it represents the expectation before attention is chosen and the signal is\nobserved. It is from the perspective of ibecause it depends on i\u2019s prior beliefs. And it is\nindexed by candidate feature kcbecause we are considering the choice of attention over\nnews about that candidate feature.7\nFinally, attention is costly, with a convex cost function Mi\nkc(xi\nkc)multiplied by a shifter\nli\nkc. We follow the literature on costly attention and assume that the cost of attention is\nproportional to the relative reduction of uncertainty upon observing the signal, measured\nby entropy, namely:\nli\nkcMi\nkc(xi\nkc) =\u0000li\nkclog(1\u0000xi\nkc) (3)\nwhere li\nkc>0re\ufb02ects the attention cost for voter ifrom observing signal si\nkc(Ma\u00b4ckowiak et\nal., 2023) . The term \u0000log(1\u0000xi\nkc)measures the reduction of uncertainty about candidate\ncupon observing the signal .8The parameter li\nkcre\ufb02ects the material or time cost of paying\nattention to a particular news, but also the psychological cost of paying attention to an\nuncomfortable news, in line with research on motivated beliefs (see B\u00e9nabou and Tirole,\n2016). In particular, a higher value of li\nkcimplies that the voter prefers a late resolution\n6The variable \u02c6Qi\nkcrefers to the overall quality of candidate cbut is indexed by the subscript kas a reminder\nthat it refers to posterior means condition on si\nkc.As discussed in the appendix, by (9), before individual i\nchooses attention and observes the content of signal si\nkc,his/her posterior mean \u02c6Qi\nkcis also normally dis-\ntributed, with known mean and variance, the latter a known function of user attention.\n7V oters know that they will vote for the candidate with the higher expected quality in the imminent elec-\ntion. Thus, when exposed to signal si\nkc,they take into account that attention affects their posterior beliefs over\nthe expected quality of candidate c. For candidate c0nothing is observed ,and the voter therefore compares\nthe updated posterior \u02c6Qi\nkcagainst the prior for the other candidate, Qi\nc0.\n8Note that the variance of posterior beliefs on qi\nkc(i.e the posterior variance) is: ri\nkc=xi\nkc(hi\nkc)2.From\nEquation (1), it is easy to see that the term 1\u0000xi\nkcis the ratio between the posterior variance and the prior\nvariance (si\nkc)2(i. the variance of prior beliefs) .More attention to the signal (higher xi\nkc)thus corresponds\nto a reduction of uncertainty upon observing the signal. As stated in the Appendix, we assume that li\nkcis\nsuf\ufb01ciently small that optimal attention is always at an interior optimum.\n10\nof uncertainty (it dislikes resolution of uncertainty), and viceversa if li\nkcis lower. The\nqualitative results discussed below would be similar for any strictly convex function of\nattention.\n2.3 Equilibrium\nPutting all this together, the objective function of user iwhen choosing attention to post kc\nis:\nMaxxi\nkc[Wi\nkc(xi\nkc)\u0000li\nkcMi\nkc(xi\nkc)+bV(xi\nkc,x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc)] (4)\nThe \ufb01rst term is the instrumental motive of attention, namely to rank the two candidates. As\ndiscussed above, this depends on the prior distributions on the candidates\u2019 qualities, which\nin turn depend on the vector of prior means, prior variances and weights of each candidate\nfeature. The second term is the convex cost of attention. The last term is the expected social\nbene\ufb01t of attention, resulting from engaging with the news in a social environment. The\nparameter b>0is the relative weight assigned to this goal. In equilibrium user ichooses\nxi\nkcso as to maximize (4), taking as given equilibrium attention of all other users of the\nsame type.9\nAs shown in the Appendix, equilibrium attention xi\u0003\nkcis implicitly de\ufb01ned by \ufb01rst taking\nthe FOC of (4), and then setting x\u0000i\nkc=xi\nkc.Since \u00b62V(xi\np,x\u0000i\np;#i\np)/\u00b6xi\np\u00b6x\u0000i\np>0,the game\nis smooth super-modular (Vives, 2005). Hence an equilibrium exists, and the comparative\nstatics properties of the extremal equilibria (i.e. of the equilibria with highest and lowest\nattention respectively) re\ufb02ect those of the marginal bene\ufb01ts and cost of attention (eg., Amir,\n2005 or Vives, 2005). The Appendix proves:\nProposition 1 If the relative weight b>0assigned to social engagement is suf\ufb01ciently\nsmall, the equilibrium is unique and it has the following properties: in equilibrium, users\npay more attention to news concerning candidate features kcfor which:\n(i) the cost of attention li\nkcis lower: \u00b6xi\u0003\nkc/\u00b6li\nkc<0\n(ii) prior uncertainty si\nkcis higher: \u00b6xi\u0003\nkc/\u00b6si\nkc>0\n9As stated in the appendix, to make sure that the second order conditions for optimal attention are satis\ufb01ed,\nwe assume that\njxi\ncj<qi\nkc\nfor all levels of attention xi\nkcand all kandc,where xi\ncandqi\nkcare respectively the mean and the standard\ndeviation of the normally distributed random variable Di\nkc=\u02c6Qi\nkc\u0000Qi\nc0,forc06=c.\n11\n(iii) the relevance ci\nkcis higher, if candidate cis not their favored candidate: \u00b6xi\u0003\nkc/\u00b6ci\nkc>0\nif\u00e5hci\nhcmi\nhc<\u00e5hci\nhc0mi0\nhc.\n(iv) the potential audience, #i\nkc,is larger: \u00b6xi\u0003\nkc/\u00b6#i\nkc>0\nEffects (i)-(iii) are larger in absolute value the larger is the potential audience #i\nkcand the\nmore users care about the likes to their comments (i.e. the larger is b):\nj\u00b62xi\u0003\nkc/\u00b6xi\nkc\u00b6#i\nkcj,j\u00b62xi\u0003\nkc/\u00b6xi\nkc\u00b6bj>0forx=l,s,and for x=cif\u00e5hci\nhcmi\nhc<\u00e5hci\nhc0mi0\nhc).\nFor instrumental or psychological motives, users are intrinsically interested in news that\nre\ufb02ect their political preferences: what they \ufb01nd entertaining or less disturbing given their\nideology (low li\nkc), what they are unsure about (high si\nkc), what they \ufb01nd relevant (high\nci\nkc).10This explains political segregation: users with similar political views are attracted\nby the same news. These effects are ampli\ufb01ed by the social bene\ufb01t of engaging with like-\nminded people, as captured by the size of the audience, #i\nkc, or by the preference parameter\nb. Commenting the news is a social activity, and users are more attracted to it if their\ncomments are appreciated by other users. This in turn is more likely to happen if like\nminded-users are also more attentive to the post (if x\u0000i\nkcis higher) and if there are more of\nthem around (i.e. if #i\nkcis higher).\nNote that this social aspect of news engagement that creates echo-chambers does not\ndirectly in\ufb02uence beliefs: beliefs are revised only by the content of the signal si\nkc,not\nby the content of the comments of other users. Nevertheless, socialization induced by\nnews engagement in\ufb02uences belief formation indirectly, through attention. Users pay more\nattention to news to which others with similar views are also attracted, while they neglect\nnews that are also neglected by their political friends. This social aspect of online news\nampli\ufb01es asymmetries in beliefs of users with different political preferences, besides what\nwould happen if individuals were exposed to the news in isolation.\n10Ifcis the ex-ante favored candidate (i.e. if \u00e5hci\nhcmi\nhc>\u00e5hci\nhc0mi0\nhc),a rise in ci\nkchas an ambiguous\neffect because it also makes candidate ceven more attractive ex-ante (it raises the prior mean of \u02c6Qi\nkc).This\nin turn makes the news less discriminating and hence it reduces the marginal bene\ufb01t of attention (see Barto\u0161\net al., 2016 for a similar result in a different setting).\n12\n2.4 Predictions\nIn the data we observe comments, not attention. But in equilibrium, the probability that\nusericomments post pis:\nci\np=P(xi\u0003\np)F[W(xi\u0003\np;#i\np)] (5)\nwhich is an increasing function of (own and others\u2019) equilibrium attention, xi\u0003\np,and of the\nsize of the potential audience, #i\np.Own attention matters through the term P(xi\u0003\np),others\u2019\nattention through the term F[W(xi\u0003\np;#i\np)].Likes received are also increasing in these two\nvariables, by assumption.\nAs described in the next section, we observe whether speci\ufb01c news are consonant (i.e.\npleasant) or non-consonant (i.e unpleasant) for speci\ufb01c political types, depending on their\ncontent. Suppose that the cost of attention, li\nkc,is higher on non-consonant news, and lower\non consonant news, compared to news that are emotionally neutral. For instance, as in our\nempirical setting, news reporting a scandal on the candidate that I dislike is consonant and\nmore enjoyable, because it con\ufb01rms my political beliefs, while news about a scandal on my\npreferred candidate is non-consonant and more costly to consider, because it contradicts my\npolitical judgement. Then Proposition 1 and equation (5) imply:\nPrediction :Users are more likely to comment on a post p, and receive more likes on\nsuch comments, if:\n(i) the post reports a consonant news, for which the the cost of attention, li\np,is lower,\ncompared to non-consonant news\n(ii) the potential audience of like minded individuals on that post, #i\np,is higher, compared\nto news on which the audience is lower.\n(iii) These two effects are interactive: the larger is the potential audience #i\np, the greater\nis the difference in the probabilities of commenting and on the likes received, between\nconsonant and non-consonant news.\nPredictions (i) and (iii) re\ufb02ect a direct effect of costly attention, which is ampli\ufb01ed\nby social interactions. On the direct effect, users pay more attention to news that they\nenjoy, compared to news they dislike, because the cost of attention is lower. Being more\nattentive makes them more likely to come up with a comment on consonant than on non-\nconsonant news. But social interactions amplify these effects: users realize that other like\nminded individuals are also more attentive to consonant than to non-consonant news. Since\n13\nothers\u2019 attention also drives the likes received on one\u2019s comments, the expected utility from\ncommenting is higher, and this makes it more likely to comment. Finally, the effects of\nsocial interactions are larger the greater is the expected audience of like minded individuals.\nHere too there is a direct effect (a larger audience increases the probability of commenting\nand the number of likes received), and an indirect effect (a larger audience increases the\ndifference in the effects of consonant vs non-consonant news).\nNote that the amplifying effect of a lager audience works in opposite directions on\nconsonant vs non-consonant news: with a larger audience, I realize that more of my friends\nare drawn to the news if it is consonant, and this increases my probability of commenting.\nSymmetrically, I also realize that more of my friends are drawn away from non-consonant\nnews towards more consonant ones, and this makes me less likely to comment a non-\nconsonant news when many of my friends are online.\nOverall, these results also imply that news engagement exhibits segregation by political\npreferences, because political preferences are correlated with the instrumental motives of\nattention. Whether a political news is consonant or not, or whether a user is interested or\nnot in a topic, largely correlates with ideology. However, our model illustrates an additional\nmechanism of segregation. While the instrumental motive can be its primary cause, social\nmedia can powerfully amplify segregation because people also enjoy online validation of\ntheir views. The likelihood of receiving such validation depends on other ideologically\naligned users being active on that particular news story. Because ideologically aligned users\ntend to like and dislike similar things, this audience effect induces even more segregation\nin news engagement. A democrat, for instance, will rationally expect fewer democrats to\nbe engaged with scandals casting Clinton under a bad light, and this makes him /her even\nless inclined to engage with such news.\nThe empirical analysis mostly focuses on prediction (i), although we have something\nto say also about predictions (ii) and (iii).\n3 Data\n3.1 Reddit\nOur data consists of the record of every comment and post on the web platform Reddit\nduring the last \ufb01ve months of the 2016 US Presidential Campaign (June 1 \u2013 November\n14\n7, 2016). Reddit is a social network where users post content, either produced by them or\nobtained from a variety of sources (mostly news media), and comment on those posts (or on\nthe comments of others). The platform is divided into a hierarchy of subreddits, themselves\ncreated and moderated by users. Each subreddit is de\ufb01ned by the topics discussed, ranging\nfrom sports to hobbies to politics. We also refer to a subreddit as a forum.\nFor any post or comment, we know the author and exact time and date of the posting, the\nsubreddit where it is posted, its complete text content; if it is a post, we know the original\nsource from which it is drawn, if any (f.e., for posts sharing a news article, we know the\noriginal website); if it is a comment, we know the post (or comment) to which it refers and\nwhether it is a \ufb01rst level or a higher level comment (i.e. whether it is a comment on a post\nor on another comment).\nUnlike other social networks, Reddit has no individual-level algorithm to increase users\u2019\nengagement. Users are supplied content according to the subreddits to which they are sub-\nscribed, but beyond that Reddit does not operate any individual-level customization. Users\ncan either browse a speci\ufb01c subreddit, or the general Reddit home page (in which case they\nsee only the content posted on the subreddits to which they subscribed). Within a subreddit,\nevery user sees exactly the same posts, sorted by novelty, popularity, or a combination of\nboth, depending on the criterion chosen by the user. Thus, there are no unobserved con-\nfounding factors that determine which content is presented to each user, something that is\nunique to Reddit.11\nPolitical discussions take place in a wide variety of subreddits, which we group into\nthree categories: partisan, ideological, and independent. We de\ufb01ne as partisan all those\nsubreddits explicitly centered around the support of a given candidate. The most prominent\nexample is r/The_Donald , a subreddit for supporters of Donald Trump, created in June\n2015, which rallied more than 790,000 subscribers and was then banned in June 2020 for\nviolating Reddit rules on harassment and targeting. Ideological fora, on the other hand, are\nde\ufb01ned by supporting a political ideology, such as conservatism, liberalism or feminism.\nFor instance, r/republican de\ufb01nes itself as a \u201cplace for Republicans to discuss issues\nwith other Republicans\u201d.12Finally, we de\ufb01ne as independent those fora that are explicitly\n11In Appendix B.1, we offer a more detailed discussion of how a user can engage with Reddit.\n12Fora supporting candidates (eg. r/The_Donald and r/hillaryclinton) differ from ideological\nfora (eg. r/republican , or r/Democrats ), because parties may have more than one candidate and users\nare active also in non-election periods.\n15\nopen to all views and opinions and have no stated ideology or af\ufb01liation. Table B.2 in\nthe Appendix reports all the political fora, along with their classi\ufb01cation and a precise\ndescription of the classi\ufb01cation method (in Section B.3). Users can be active on several\nfora at once.\nMost of our analysis focuses on r/politics, the largest and most active of the in-\ndependent political fora. In 2016, r/politics had 3 million subscribers,13making it the\n55th largest one on Reddit (out of 900,000 subreddits in June 2016). In our period of in-\nterest, it hosted 8.3 million comments made by 287 thousand authors. Individuals from all\npolitical sides can post and comment content strictly concerning current US politics. The\nforum is explicitly open to all ideologies, and it forbids political advertisements, hateful\nspeech, and satire. It is heavily moderated by a team of users that ensure a civil debate.14\nImportantly for our purposes, users can write posts only sharing the title of the news source\nand the links, while their thoughts on the article are in the form of comments to the post. In\nthis way, each posting does not re\ufb02ect the authors\u2019 views on the topic, which are relegated\nto the comments section. Thus, the forum approximates a continuous feed of political news\non which users can post comments. While browsing it, a user is presented with a stream of\ntitles and links to news articles, which also reveal the source of the article. Figure 1 shows\nan example of a posting related to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d scandal.\nFigure 1: Example of Posting\nIn 2016, 7% of all US adults used Reddit (11% in 2019), with 78% of them reporting\nthey get their news there. As shown in Appendix Table B.1 users of Reddit, across the\nentire platform, tend to be younger, more liberal, more educated and more likely to live\nin large cities, compared to users of other popular web platforms (Pew Research Center,\n2016, 2019).\n138.5 million as of July 2024.\n14See Appendix Section B.4 for a full description of the rules of the forum.\n16\nEven though the sample is selected, the patterns of engagement with sources on r/poli-\ntics are similar to the online visits to those sources\u2019 web pages, as collected by Comscore\nfor a representative sample of the US online population between May 2017 and May 2021\n(earlier dates are not available). Online appendix Table B.3 reports the share of comments\nthat each source has in r/politics ( out of the top 50 sources in r/politics), and com-\npares it to the share of pageviews of the same source online (out of the the top 50 sources in\nComscore). The major differences between the two samples are due to the fact that many\nsources are not exclusively political, such as USAToday. Whereas our sample only reports\ncomments to political news, Comscore reports all pageviews, political and non-political.\nThe table also reports the share of comments (resp. pageviews) of all the exclusively po-\nlitical sources that are common to r/politics and Comscore, and the two shares now\nbecome more similar. Overall, the news sources attracting more comments in r/politics\ntend to be those that also attract more online page views in the Comscore sample.15\n3.1.1 Measuring Political Preferences\nReddit users are anonymous, but we observe their behavior on the social network. We ex-\nploit this information to measure their political preferences, using two alternative methods.\nOur \ufb01rst and preferred indicator uses Algorithm 1 to classify a user ias a Trump supporter\n(Ai=TS), a Clinton supporter ( Ai=CS), or as independent ( Ai=I). Independents are\npredominantly active on independent fora, while partisan supporters are predominantly ac-\ntive in the partisan fora of either Trump or Clinton. We do not classify users that have low\nactivity or an inconsistent partisan activity.\n15The correlation coef\ufb01cient between the share of comments and the share of page views is 0.79 for the\npolitical sources, and 0.32 for all sources.\n17\nAlgorithm 1 User Classi\ufb01cation\nforuserido\nificommented more than 5 times in r/politics or other fora labeled as independent\nandmore than 95% of the comments of user ion all political fora are in independent\nforathen\nAi=independent\nelse if icommented more than 5 times in all partisan fora and more than 95% of the\ncomments of user ion all partisan fora are in partisan fora supporting candidate P\nthen\nAi=supporter of P\nelse\nAi=non-classi\ufb01ed\nAs reported in Panel A of Table 1, this classi\ufb01cation yields 71,344 users, of which\n20,725 are Trump Supporters, 5,740 are Clinton Supporters and 44,879 are independent.\nWe are unable to classify about 215,000 users due to an inconsistent pattern of partisan\nactivity or because they have made very few comments during our \ufb01ve months period.\nBoth Trump and Clinton supporters active on r/politics allocate a considerable share\nof their activity on this forum. When considering their activity within r/politics and\npartisan fora, Clinton supporters make 46.7% of their overall comments on r/politics ,\nTrump supporters 22.9%.\nDespite the large number of non-classi\ufb01ed users, they do not account for the majority\nof comments. 61.6% of the total comments on r/politics come from classi\ufb01ed users\nand, of these, 71.5% come from independents, 11.1% from Clinton supporters, and the\nremaining 17.4% from Trump supporters.\nGiven the large fraction of non-classi\ufb01ed users resulting from this categorical classi\ufb01-\ncation, we also rely on a continuous measure of political preferences. Here we consider all\nusers who have posted a total of more than 5 comments on non partisan fora or more than 5\ncomments on all partisan fora. We then measure his/her political preferences for candidate\nPby the continuous variable\nVP\ni=# of comments of ion partisan subreddits supporting P\n# of comm. of ion all partisan fora\n18\nTable 1: Authors af\ufb01liation and share of total comments per fora by af\ufb01liation of comment au-\nthor\nPanel A: Discrete Classi\ufb01cation Relative Activity by Fora\nN r/politics Pro-Clinton Fora Pro-Trump Fora\nTrump Supporters 20,725 0.229 0.001 0.769\nClinton Supporters 5,740 0.467 0.532 0.001\nIndependents 44,879 0.996 0.002 0.002\nNon-classi\ufb01ed 215,243 0.802 0.071 0.127\nPanel B: Continuous Classi\ufb01cation\nN Mean St. Dev.\nPro Trump Partisanship 125,555 0.324 0.436\nPro Clinton Partisanship 125,555 0.15 0.321\nNotes: discrete classi\ufb01cation was performed for all users that either commented or posted on r/politcs . Continuous\nclassi\ufb01cation was performed for all users with at least one comment/post on r/politics and at least 6 comments on non\npartisan fora or on partisan fora. Here, furthermore, we restrict the sample to authors with at least one comment on either\nr/politics or a partisan fora. The relative activity is measured by the share of total comments for each type of fora, over\nall comments in r/politics , Pro Trump, and Pro Clinton fora.\nforP= Trump and Clinton, and during the period June 1\u2013November 7, 2016. If user inever\ncommented on any partisan fora, we impute VP\ni=0.\nPanel B of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for these continuous classi\ufb01cations,\nwhile their distributions are reported in Figure B.1 in the Appendix. This measure of po-\nlitical preferences can be computed for a larger sample of 125,555 individuals, since we\nonly require users to be suf\ufb01ciently active in all political fora together. In particular, the\nvariable VP\niis de\ufb01ned also for users active on both partisan fora, while such users tend\nto be excluded as non-classi\ufb01able in the three-way classi\ufb01cation. On the other hand, the\ncontinuous variable VP\nicould be measured with more error, since we attribute political\npreferences also to individuals whose behavior is more ambiguous. This larger sample\naccounts for practically all comments (99%).\n3.2 Classi\ufb01cation of Political News\nFinally, we classi\ufb01ed a selected sample of news based on their content, so as to distinguish\ngeneral political news from bad news about a candidate. Bad news refer to content about a\ncandidate that is liked or disliked depending on the user\u2019s political preferences.\nTo minimize measurement error, the classi\ufb01cation was done manually. Given the large\n19\nnumber of items, we restrict attention to two types of postings in r/politics . The \ufb01rst set\ncontains all 1,350 posts that shared articles from the media agency Reuters during our sam-\nple period. The second set contains 97 \u201cMegathreads\u201d. These are collections of postings\non the same topic aggregated by the moderators of r/politics , with the goal of facili-\ntating discussion of salient events. The comments appearing in the Megathreads are only\nthose posted after the Megathread was created. Throughout we refer to a Megathread as a\npost, since the comments in it refer to the whole Megathread, although strictly speaking it\nconsists of a collection of news postings.16\nThese two subsamples are representative of two types of debates that can take place on\nthe platform. The posts from Reuters are short articles that report new speci\ufb01c facts with\nminimal or absent editorial comment (e.g. an article reporting a new declaration by Billy\nBush concerning the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d scandal). Comments on these posts capture the\nreaction to new information; in terms of our model, attention here is likely to largely re\ufb02ect\nthe instrumental motive of ranking the candidates. Megathreads are on the opposite side\nof the spectrum: they are chances for debate of general events that became known in the\ndays preceding the thread (e.g. a large thread discussing the entire \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\nscandal). Comments here are likely to have a much larger active audience interested in\nthat topic. In terms of our model, the parameter #i\npis presumably larger on Megathreads,\nimplying a greater in\ufb02uence of the social motive on users\u2019 activity.\nCoherently with these differences, the total number of comments on Megathreads is\nmore than an order of magnitude larger than on Reuters posts. As shown in the \ufb01rst column\nof Table 2, the average number of comments on a Megathread (by all authors) is 7,280.7\nversus 44.2 on a post from Reuters. The 97 Megathreads alone account for 8.5% of the\nentire activity in r/politics during our sample period, with the remaining activity spread\nacross 121,314 posts. Each post on r/politics receives on average 68.4 comments, of\nwhich 7.3 are from Trump supporters, 4.7 from Clinton Supporters, 30.1 from indepen-\ndents, and 26.3 from users that we are unable to classify. Clinton supporters tend to be\nmore active (recall that they are fewer), with each Clinton supporter making an average\nof .00082 comments per post, while Trump supporters and independents make .00035 and\n.00067, respectively.\n16The total number of Megathreads in our period is 110, but we drop thirteen that do not concern political\nnews and are called \u201cFriday Fun Off-topic Megathread\u201d. Including them in the sample does not change our\nresults.\n20\nTable 2: Average number of comments per post by af\ufb01liation\nSet of posts:\nReuters Megathreads\nAll All BNT BNC All BNT BNC\nTrump Supporters 7.31 5.02 7.78 8.07 792.00 459.40 1,571.00\nClinton Supporters 4.70 3.01 4.69 3.09 544.09 789.40 577.38\nIndependents 30.11 19.77 33.22 29.30 3,191.88 3,219.80 3,202.62\nNot Classi\ufb01ed 26.25 16.42 27.42 27.43 2,752.76 2,525.40 4,502.12\nTotal number of comments 8,300,833 59,704 5,264 7,060 706,231 34,970 78,825\nTotal number of posts 121,410 1,350 72 104 97 5 8\nAverage number of comments per post 68.37 44.23 73.11 67.88 7,280.73 6,994.00 9,853.12\nAverage score per comment 6.68 5.33 8.16 5.08 6.07 17.52 9.96\nNotes: Comments appearing in Megathreads and reported above refer to the each whole Megathread, not to individual\nposts collected within each Megathread. BNT and BNC indicate the sample of bad news (scandals or polls) for Trump\nand Clinton, respectively.\nEach Reuter post and each Megathread was manually classi\ufb01ed as either a general news\nor as a bad news about either Trump or Clinton.17Bad news are de\ufb01ned as any post\nor objective fact concerning a candidate that might damage his/her image or hurt his/her\nchances of election, and that might provoke an emotional reaction amongst partisan users.\nTypical examples are scandals that emerged because a candidate was under investigation\nby the FBI or special prosecutors. For instance, scandals on Trump are allegations of\nsexual misconduct, or episodes referring to Russian interferences colluding with the Trump\ncampaign. Examples of scandals on Clinton are email leaks or Clinton handling of the\nBenghazi attack.18\nScandals and misbehavior are not the only source of bad news for a political candidate.\n17Reuters posts were read by a research assistant, and in case of doubt we reviewed and discussed the\nclassi\ufb01cation. Classi\ufb01cation of the Megathreads was simpler, since there is few of them and their topic is\nclear from the title.\n18We do not classify as bad news episodes such as racist or islamophobic comments by Trump, since these\ncould be received favorably by some of his supporters. Similarly, we do not classify as bad news derogatory\ncomments on the two candidates by foreign leaders (e.g. the President of Mexico) or by US personalities (e.g.\nRobert De Niro), nor statements concerning conspiracy theories, since such statements could be interpreted\ndifferently by different voters. If a post focuses on a speci\ufb01c negative episode for a candidate (e.g. Clinton\u2019s\nemails), but attenuates a candidate\u2019s responsibility (e.g. Clinton relied on her staff to deal with classi\ufb01ed\ninformation), we still classify it as bad for the candidate, in line with the idea that users may avoid topics that\nconcern shortcomings of their preferred candidate, and viceversa for the opponent. Some articles within those\ncovering Russia\u2019s involvement in the DNC email hacking hint at Trump\u2019s involvement in the hack. As such,\nit is ambiguous for whom these are emotionally charged news. In our main speci\ufb01cation, articles mentioning\nthe possibility of Trump\u2019s involvement in the hack are tagged as bad news for both candidates. Results are\nrobust to either tagging these only as bad news for Clinton, dropping them, or tagging them as general news.\n21\nAnother bad news is the publication of unfavorable polls on the candidate. Since these\nnegative polls are objective facts concerning a candidate, and they have the same relevance\nfor voters with opposite political orientation, we included them in our classi\ufb01cation of bad\nnews. Speci\ufb01cally, we also classi\ufb01ed as bad news on a candidate any new poll reported by\nReuters that highlighted a drop in his/her popularity, or a persistent large negative gap with\nthe other candidate. Appendix Section C.1 provides the precise de\ufb01nition of bad polls and\nsupplementary analyses in Appendix Section C.4 show that results are robust to alternative\nde\ufb01nitions.\nOn the basis of this classi\ufb01cation, we thus construct dummy variables for scandals, bad\npolls, or either of the two. In what follows, we use the term bad news when referring to\neither a scandal or a bad poll, and the more speci\ufb01c terms when we discriminate between\nthese two different kinds of bad news. Table 2 reports the average number of comments in\neach subsample, disaggregated by af\ufb01liation of the author of the comment and by whether\nthe post reports a bad news. As already noted, Megathreads attract many more comments\nthan Reuter posts. Within Reuters, bad news attract more comments than other political\nnews. The last line of the Table reports the average comment score (one plus the number\nof likes net of dislikes received by comments to that post). The average score on bad news\nis twice as large on Megathreads than on Reuters, again in line with the observation that\nMegathreads have a much larger active audience (a larger #i\np).\nAs shown in Appendix Table C.2, most bad news are posted by either independent\nor non-classi\ufb01ed users, but partisan supporters are more likely to post bad news on the\nopponent than on their preferred candidate. Appendix Tables C.4 and C.5 provide some\nexamples of scandals and bad polls, for Reuters, and the entirety of scandals posted as\nMegathreads. An exhaustive list of all bad news on Reuters and the links to each original\narticle is available in supplementary material available upon request. Appendix Table C.3\nreports the number of authors of comments, by type, active on the whole r/politics and\nin the two sub-samples. Users active on Reuters are 17,422 (9,700 classi\ufb01ed), those active\non the Megathreads are 78,074 (30,886 classi\ufb01ed).\n22\n4 Engagement with News\nOur empirical analysis starts by describing how partisan users comment on all political\nnews in the days of four major scandals, in an event study fashion. We then study partisan\ncomments on single postings about all the scandals that we identi\ufb01ed in Section 3.2. We\ndiscuss our identi\ufb01cation strategy in each context.19\n4.1 Event Studies\nAs in the \u201costrich effect\u201d \ufb01rst studied in \ufb01nance by Karlsson et al. (2009), if the cost of\nattention li\nkcis higher on non-consonant news and lower on consonant news, we expect\npartisan users to detach themselves from politics in days when political news are likely\nto focus on scandals on their own candidate, devoting instead more attention to sports,\nentertainment, \ufb01nancial news and the like. Conversely, we expect them to be attracted to\npolitical fora when the political debate is likely to focus on scandals about the opponent.\nTo choose the main scandals, we used the fact that all popular discussions on r/politics\nwere aggregated into Megathreads. These Megathreads, which are reported in Appendix\nTable C.4, highlight four main controversies, three on Clinton and one on Trump: The\nleak of DNC emails and subsequent resignation of the DNC Chairman, discussed on July\n23, 24, and 25, which received a total of 23,625 comments. The release from the FBI of\ndocuments concerning the Clinton e-mail investigation, discussed on September 2 with,\n9,664 comments. The Hollywood Access Trump scandal, discussed on October 7 and 8,\nwith 37,916 comments. Finally, the reopening of the FBI investigation on Clinton\u2019s emails,\ndiscussed on October 28 and 29, with 32,739 comments.20\nAs shown in Appendix Table C.4, the raw counts of engagement on these scandals\n19Conducting event studies for all the bad news (including minor ones) that we identify is unfeasible, since\nthey occur repeatedly, at high-frequency, and overlap.\n20There was also another substantial controversy, which received 9,508 comments: the recommendation\nfrom Jim Comey (then FBI director) of no indictment over Clinton\u2019s handling of her email server, which was\nposted on July 5. We exclude this from our analysis since it can be interpreted as attenuating the concern of\nClinton\u2019s mishandling of emails. There were also three other minor controversies covered by the Megath-\nreads, which received less than 5,000 comments each. The resignation of the Trump campaign chairman, Paul\nManafort, on August 19 (1,899 comments). The release from the Clinton campaign of medical records on\nSeptember 14 (3,295 comments). The order to the Trump foundation to stop fundraising in NY on October 3\n(3,496 comments). They are minor and partially overlap with other major scandals. Section 4.2, will include\nthese scandals, as well as others, when we analyze comments across posts, rather than over time as we do\nhere.\n23\nare already quite telling of ideological segregation. In Clinton scandals, Trump supporters\nmake twice to four time as many comments compared to Clinton supporters. The reverse is\ntrue for the Trump scandal, where Clinton supporters make 1.7 times more comments than\nTrump supporters.\nTo study these patterns more systematically, as well as dynamically, we estimate the\nfollowing regression in a two-week window around each scandal:\nYit=ai+bt+7\n\u00e5\nt=\u00007\nt6=\u00001\u0010\ngT\nt\u0003TSi+gC\nt\u0003CSi\u0011\n\u0003Dt+t+#it\nwhere Yitdenotes the fraction of comments by user iin day ton all political fora relative\nto all his comments in the entire Reddit platform, aiandbtare individual and day \ufb01xed\neffects, TSiandCSiare dummy variables for Trump and Clinton supporters respectively,\nandDt+tare day dummy variables.21The sample includes all users classi\ufb01ed either as\nindependent or partisan, and t=0refers to the day in which the scandal \ufb01rst became\nknown. Figure 2 plots the estimated coef\ufb01cients gT\ntandgC\ntfor all scandals, with their 95%\ncon\ufb01dence intervals (standard errors are clustered by individual). Each coef\ufb01cient measures\nthe change between day tand day t=\u00001in the activity on political fora, as a fraction of\nall Reddit activity, for Trump (solid red line) and Clinton supporters (dashed blue line),\ncompared to average independents, in the period surrounding each scandal.\nAs expected, Trump supporters are more active on political fora compared to indepen-\ndents right after the Clinton scandals, and less active after the Access Hollywood scandal,\nwhile the reverse is true for Clinton supporters. There is no obvious evidence of pre-trends.\nIn all cases but one, effects for both groups of users vanish after one week.22\nThe effect of these scandals is sizable in magnitude. The day after the Access Hol-\nlywood scandal became public, Trump supporters decreased their share of comments on\npolitical fora by 7 percentage points, a 17.5% decrease compared to a mean of 40% in the\n7 days before the scandal. Clinton supporters increased it by 6 percentage points, a 15.3%\nincrease compared to the pre-period. For the Comey scandal, the pattern is similar: Clinton\n21Political fora include r/politics , partisan fora, and all other subreddits devoted to discussions of US\npolitics. The exhaustive list is reported in Appendix Table B.2.\n22The only exception is engagement by Trump supporters after the Comey scandal, which seems to last\nlonger. This might be driven by the fact that the scandal occurred shortly before the presidential election, so\nthat later days capture additional engagement by Trump supporters.\n24\nFigure 2: Engagement with Political News Around Scandal Dates\n(a) DNC Email leak (Clinton scandal) (b) FBI Email leak (Clinton)\n(c) Hollywood Access Scandal (Trump) (d) Comey Scandal (Clinton)\nNotes: The \ufb01gure presents the average change, with respect to day t=\u00001, of the ratio of comments on\npolitical fora over total comments on the entire Reddit platform, for Trump supporters (solid red line) and\nClinton supporters (dashed blue line), expressed as a difference with the same measure for independent users.\nThe bands denote 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (standard errors are clustered by user). Day t=0is the date when\na scandal on either candidate became public. Panel (a) refers to the leak of DNC emails showing that the DNC\nfavored Clinton over Sanders in the primary. Panel (b) refers to the release of FBI documents concerning the\nClinton e-mail investigation. Panel (c) refers to the Access Hollywood videotape scandal, where Trump was\nrecorded making lewd comments on women. Panel (d) refers to the declaration by James Comey that the FBI\nwould re-open the investigation of Clinton\u2019s email controversy. The sample of political postings is restricted\nto posts by categorized authors\u2019 one week before and after the scandal announcement. All regressions control\nfor individual \ufb01xed effects.\n25\nsupporters decreased their share of comments by 3 p.p. the two days after (7% compared\nto the pre-period mean), while Trump supporters increased it by 6 p.p. at the peak of the\neffect two days after (13.3%). For the DNC scandal, in percentage terms compared to the\npre-period mean, effects were of a 12% increase for Trump supporters and a 21% decrease\nfor Clinton supporters. Around the FBI Email leak, these \ufb01gures were somewhat smaller:\na 3% increase for Trump supporters and an 8% decrease for Clinton supporters.\nDo these patterns re\ufb02ect increased /decreased engagement with all political news, or\nonly with emotionally charged news? To answer, we used ChatGPT to tag all political\nposts around scandal windows, extending the manual tagging of scandals that we did on\nthe Reuters sample described in Section 3.2. The classi\ufb01cation exercise yields reassuring\nresults and the prevalence of scandals increases right after the dates when they become pub-\nlic, as shown in Appendix Figure C.1.23We then repeat the event studies dropping all news\ntagged as bad news n either candidate, thus studying engagement only on non-scandals.\nAppendix Figure C.2 reports the results. The coef\ufb01cients of the full sample overlap with\nthose in this restricted sample, highlighting that asymmetric engagement concerns all po-\nlitical discussions, and not just those strictly covering the scandals.\nOverall, it is dif\ufb01cult to explain these \ufb01ndings without recourse to some kind of moti-\nvated cognition. In particular, they cannot be explained by the argument that partisan users\ndo not have con\ufb01dence on a speci\ufb01c news source or posting, or that they have different\nprior uncertainties about different candidates, since engagement refers to all political news.\n4.2 Analysis Across Political News\n4.2.1 Econometric Framework\nWe now turn to a systematic investigation of how individuals react to the bad news about a\npolitical candidate. Our goal is to test whether partisan users react differently to bad news\n23Appendix Section C.3.1 describes the classi\ufb01cation algorithm and reports the confusion matrices.\nAmong 181 Reuters articles not included in the training data, the AI correctly classi\ufb01es 13 scandals on\nClinton out of 19 and 5 Trump scandals out of 7. Of the 155 non-scandals, the AI correctly classi\ufb01es 154.\nNo scandals on one candidate are mis-classi\ufb01ed as scandals on the other. To further corroborate the tagging\noutside of Reuters, we manually classi\ufb01ed an extra random sample of 200 posts from political fora. Within\nthis set, the AI correctly classi\ufb01es the only post covering a Trump scandal, 35 posts on Clinton scandals out\nof 37, as well as 151 non-scandals out of 162. Because Trump scandals are relatively less frequent, we further\nmanually classi\ufb01es 119 posts around the Hollywood scandal in all political fora excluding those of Trump\nsupporters. We \ufb01nd 6 posts on Trump scandals, 4 of which are correctly classi\ufb01ed by the AI. Both the AI and\nus \ufb01nd no Clinton scandals in this set of postings.\n26\nconcerning their own candidate vs the opponent, and to explore the mechanisms that may\nlead to this.\nIn line with the predictions of the theory, there are two outcomes of interest: the propen-\nsity of user ito comment post p,Yip,and the score (net likes) of his/her comments to that\npost, Yipc- here we have to index the dependent variable also by subscript c,because the\nsame user could write more than one comment to the same post. For both outcomes, we\nstudy both the intensive margin (the number of comments to the post, and the numerical\nvalue of the score) and the extensive margin (whether the user commented the post, and\nwhether his/her comment received a strictly positive score).24\nWhen we study the propensity to comment, the unit of observation is the user-post pair,\nand the sample consists of a balanced panel of all posts in r/politics sharing Reuters\narticles and of all Megathreads (always analyzed separately), and of active partisan and\nindependent users as de\ufb01ned in Section 3.1.1. When studying the comment score, the\nunit of observation is the comment, and the sample consists of all comments to Reuters\nposts and to Megathreads (again analyzed separately) in r/politics . Appendix Table C.9\nreports the relevant summary statistics (variables on activity are multiplied by 100).\nThe treatment variables of interest are whether post preported a bad news on the can-\ndidate supported by a partisan user or on his/her opponent. To gain statistical power, we\nassume that partisan differences in activity are symmetric across ideologies. Thus, we\nde\ufb01ne two treatment variables:\nConsonant News ip=BNC p\u0003TSi+BNT p\u0003CSi (6)\nNon-consonant News ip=BNT p\u0003TSi+BNC p\u0003CSi\nwhere BNT andBNC are the dummy variables de\ufb01ned above for bad news concerning\nTrump and Clinton respectively (or on scandals and bad polls when disaggregating be-\ntween these events), and TSiandCSiare dummy variables that equal 1 if user iis a\npartisan supporter of Trump and Clinton respectively. Thus, the dummy variable Non-\nconsonant News ipis 1 if post pis a bad news on a candidate supported by partisan user i,\nandConsonant News ipis 1 if post pis a bad news on his/her opponent.\n24A strictly positive score means that the comment received at least as many likes as dislikes (each comment\nautomatically receives one like from the author, so it starts with a default score of 1). We don\u2019t distinguish\nbetween comments made directly to the post and comments made to comments.\n27\nOn all samples and for all dependent variables, we estimate the following regressions,\nforYipandYipcrespectively :\nYip=ai+yp+b1\u0003Consonant News ip+b2\u0003Non-cons. News ip+gXip+#ip(7)\nYipc=ai+yp+b1\u0003Consonant News ip+b2\u0003Non-cons. News ip+gXipc+#ipc(8)\nwhere aiandypare individual and posting FEs and XipandXipcare vectors of user- and\npost-level controls. In (8), controls include some post characteristics, such as the article\nlength or which candidates are mentioned, interacted with user type. The same controls are\nused in (7), but in addition we also control for user\u2019s activity in a 5-day window around the\npost.25\nEquation (7) identi\ufb01es the coef\ufb01cients of interest, b1andb2,through a diff-in-diff type\nof speci\ufb01cation. The coef\ufb01cient b2measures the average difference, between supporters of\na given candidate and independent users, in the comments to a post containing a bad news\non that candidate, relative to the difference in comments to a non-bad news post between\nthese same two groups. The coef\ufb01cient b1measures the same difference, but concerning\nbad news on the opponent of the candidate supported by partisan users. To test prediction\ni)in section 2, we test whether b1\u0000b2>0.\nComparing the reaction of partisans vs independents to the same post (i.e. includ-\ning post FE) allows posts to have different relevance, uniformly for all users (in terms of\nthe model, ci\np6=ci\np0). It might still be that partisan users are more interested in scan-\ndals compared to independents, however, and this unobserved heterogeneity would not be\ncaptured by the post FE. This is why the prediction is phrased in terms of consonant vs non-\nconsonant news ( b1\u0000b2>0), rather than consonant and non-consonant news vs. general\nnews ( b1>0>b2). In this way, we keep the type of news constant (e.g. a scandal), and\n25In the Reuters sample we scraped the text of all the articles and control for the following post character-\nistics alone and interact with whether the user is a Trump or Clinton supporter: the article length, whether\nthe author of the post is a Trump or Clinton supporter, the number of mentions of Clinton and Trump in the\narticle. For Megathreads, instead, their author is always a moderator and we do not have information on\nthe text of the article (since we are unable to scrape the content of each article linked in the post). We thus\ninclude the following variables alone and interacted for whether the user is a Trump or Clinton supporter: the\nshare of left-wing and right-wing sources cited in the Megathread (to impute the ideology of a source, we\nuse the so called Political Bias Index, developed by the website mediabiasfactcheck.com , which assigns\nto several media sources a score on a 7-point scale from left to right; see D\u2019Amico and Tabellini (2022) for\nmore details). For both Reuters and Megathreads, we also control for whether the post reported a poll (alone\nand interacted with being a Trump or Clinton supporter).\n28\njust exploit variation coming from the fact that the same scandal is consonant for some\nusers and non-consonant for others.\nComparing the reaction of the same individual to bad news vs general news (i.e. in-\ncluding individual FE) allows users to differ systematically in their propensity to comment\nand in the contents of their comments. Note that the speci\ufb01cation with individual FE is de-\nmanding, because most individuals comment on only a few posts (see Appendix Table 2).\nFor this reason, we also report speci\ufb01cations without individual FE, or where we control\nonly for whether the individual is partisan or independent.\nThe Reuters sample has fewer comments, but it has the advantage that all news originate\nfrom the same source. This reduces the concern that our results may be due to correlation\nbetween partisan identities and (unobserved) con\ufb01dence in the news source.\nStandard errors are always two-way clustered at the author and post level. Given the\nlarge number of 0s in the number of comments, we also estimate (7) by NLLS (using Logit\nwhen focusing on the extensive margin and Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood for the\nintensive margin). In the sensitivity analysis, we also replace the dummy variables TSand\nCSthat classify partisan supporters by the continuous variables de\ufb01ned 3.1.1.\n4.2.2 Results\nMain results Table 3 reports our results on the propensity to comment, Panel A for\nReuters, Panel B for Megathreads. In Columns (1)-(4) refer to the intensive margin (i.e. the\ndependent variable is the count of comments by user ito post p, multiplied by 100), while\nColumns (5)-(8) refer to the extensive margin (i.e. the dependent variable is a dummy vari-\nable for whether user icommented post p, multiplied by 100). Columns (1) and (5) report\nunconditional correlations. In Columns (2) and (6) we add the controls described above,\nand then the \ufb01xed effects in the remaining columns. Our preferred speci\ufb01cations are in\nColumns (4) and (8).\nResults for the extensive margin on Reuters show that, compared to independents, parti-\nsan users are .046 percentage points (with a SD of .022) more likely to comment consonant\nnews and .0475 percentage points (SD .0234) less likely to comment non-consonant news.\nThe estimated coef\ufb01cients, which are almost perfectly symmetrical, imply an economi-\ncally signi\ufb01cant magnitude. At the mean, individuals are 32.6% more likely to comment a\nconsonant news and 33.6% less likely to comment non-consonant news. On the intensive\n29\nmargin, we \ufb01nd a signi\ufb01cant effect only for non-consonant news - cf. Column (4). Partisan\nusers write .001446 (SD .000646)26fewer comments on non-consonant news, compared\nto independents (with an implied magnitude, at the mean, of \u000050.38% ). The key quantity\ndisciplined by the model is b1\u0000b2. This estimate is always positive and statistically sig-\nni\ufb01cant, as expected, with a p\u0000value of .0034 on the extensive margin and of .0132 on the\nintensive one. Thus, overall, partisan users are less likely to comment on non-consonant\nnews on Reuters, compared to consonant ones, both on the extensive and the intensive\nmargin.\nAs shown in Panel B of Table 3, results on Megathreads are similar, except that here the\ndominant margin is whether the news is consonant. In particular, we \ufb01nd that, compared to\nindependents, partisan users are 3.33 percentage points (SD .86) more likely to comment a\nconsonant posting and they write .0972 more comments (SD .0026). The implied magni-\ntudes, at the mean, are of +102.3% on the extensive margin and +66.3% on the intensive\none.\nThe estimated values of b1\u0000b2are generally much larger in the Megathreads than in\nthe Reuters sample. This is in line with prediction iii)of Section 2.4, because the relevant\naudience is larger and more active on Megathreads than on the Reuters posts.\nTable 4 repeats the same regressions, but with comment score as a dependent variable.\nIn Columns (1)-(4) the dependent variable is the numerical value of the score, in Columns\n(5)-(8) it is a dummy variable for whether the comment score is strictly positive. The rest\nof the Table is the same as Table 3. As expected, partisan comments on consonant news\nreceive a signi\ufb01cantly larger score than on non-consonant news, compared to independents\ncommenting on the same news, both on Reuter posts and in the Megathreads. Again, the\nmore demanding speci\ufb01cations are in Columns (4) and (8).\nConsider \ufb01rst the regressions with the numerical value of the score (Column 4). In the\nReuters sample, the effect is driven by consonant news: the difference in score between\npartisan vs independent comments on consonant posts is about 75% of the average score.\nOn Megathreads, the difference in score between partisan and independent comments is\nsigni\ufb01cant (and with the expected opposite sign) on both consonant and non-consonant\nposts. Expressed as a percentage of the average score, this difference is 77% for consonant\nposts and 50% for non consonant ones.

See notes to Table 3.\nMechanisms What mechanisms drive these results? The model of Section 2 suggests\ntwo possible reasons why partisan users are more attentive and hence comment bad news\nmore frequently on the opponent than on their candidate. First, they have sharper priors\n(lower si\nkc)on their own candidate than on the opponent. Second, the cost of attention\n(li\nkc)is lower on consonant news and higher if it is non-consonant.\nNote that the estimated coef\ufb01cients of the interaction between users\u2019 partisanship and\ncandidate mentions in the Reuters articles, which are reported in Appendix Table C.12,\nalready cast some doubts on the \ufb01rst explanation. If the pattern described above was due to\nasymmetric information, we should \ufb01nd that, also for general news, partisan users comment\nmore frequently on the opponent than on their own candidate. These interactions are instead\nnot statistically signi\ufb01cant, and their algebraic sum implies that, compared to independents,\non average partisan users do not comment more frequently posts mentioning the opponent\nthan those mentioning their candidate. Instead, they do this only when they comment bad\nnews.27\n27Speci\ufb01cally, consider the coef\ufb01cients labelled as gi,i=1\u00004,in Appendix Table C.12. The sum\n(g1+g2)\u0000(g3+g4)is positive and not statistically sign\ufb01ciant\u2014both on the intensive ( 36.42 ) and on\n32\nTo disentangle these two mechanisms more precisely, Table 5 disaggregates bad news\nposted on Reuters in scandals and bad polls. Since uncertainty on poll outcomes is symmet-\nric (if one candidate gains, the other looses), evidence that partisan users comment more\nfrequently on the bad polls of the opponent than on those of their candidate cannot be due\nto asymmetric priors. Here we report directly the estimated difference b1\u0000b2between\nconsonant and non-consonant news, separately for scandals and bad polls. The speci\ufb01ca-\ntion is identical to Table 3, but we only report two speci\ufb01cations: with no covariates and\nwith all the FEs and controls.28\nIdeological segregation on polls is, if anything, even stronger than on scandals. Columns\n(1) to (4) report results on the intensive margin, Columns (5) to (8) on the extensive one.\nFor ease of comparison, Columns (1), (2) and (5), (6) report the difference between b1\u0000b2\nestimated in Columns (1), (4) and (5), (8) of Table 3, respectively. The estimated difference\nb1\u0000b2is always positive, as expected. On the intensive margin this difference is statis-\ntically signi\ufb01cant only for bad polls. Users make .002985 (SD .001432) more comments\non bad polls of the opponent, relative to those of their candidate, about the same mag-\nnitude as their average number of comments.29On the extensive margin, the difference\nb1\u0000b2is positive and statistically signi\ufb01cant for both scandals and bad polls. Users are\n.1358 percentage points (SD .061) more likely to comment bad polls on the opponent than\non their candidate, again about the same magnitude as their average probability of com-\nmenting. By ruling out the channel of asymmetric uncertainties, results on polls thus point\nunambiguously to a role of emotions in the propensity to comment pleasant vs unpleasant\nnews. Appendix Tables C.13 and C.14 replicate Tables 3 and 5, respectively, using a nar-\nrower de\ufb01nition of bad polls (described in Appendix Section C.1) and show that results are\nsimilar.\nRobustness In the Appendix we show that these results are robust and even stronger un-\nder different speci\ufb01cations and de\ufb01nitions. Consider \ufb01rst the regressions on the propensity\nthe extensive margin ( 4.17).\n28For Megathreads we cannot perform a similar disaggregation, because all polls are contained in a sin-\ngle Megathread. We only report regressions on the propensity to comment, and not on score, because the\ndistinction between scandals and polls could affect the score in other ways, besides users\u2019 attention. For\ninstance, comments on scandals could attract more likes or dislikes than comments on polls, because they are\nemotionally more charged.\n29The coef\ufb01cients b1andb2, separately estimated for scandals and bad polls, are reported in separate\nsupplementary material available upon request.\n33\nTable 5: Activity Analysis, Polls and Scandals on Reuters\nDependent variable : Comments of User ion Post p(\u0002100)\nNum. of Comments (Intensive Margin) Num. of Comments >0 (dummy, Extensive Margin)\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)\nb1\u0000b2, all Bad News 0.1733\u0003\u0003\u00030.1842\u0003\u00030.1024\u0003\u0003\u00030.0935\u0003\u0003\u0003\n(0.0623 ) ( 0.0743 ) ( 0.0260 ) ( 0.0319 )\nbS\n1\u0000bS\n2, only Scandals 0.0830 0.1180 0.0662\u0003\u00030.0681\u0003\n(0.0816 ) ( 0.0818 ) ( 0.0329 ) ( 0.0359 )\nbP\n1\u0000bP\n2, only Bad Polls 0.3227\u0003\u0003\u00030.2985\u0003\u00030.1668\u0003\u0003\u00030.1358\u0003\u0003\n(0.1030 ) ( 0.1432 ) ( 0.0471 ) ( 0.0610 )\nFE and Controls No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes\nDep.

The\nestimated difference b1\u0000b2is always positive and statistically signi\ufb01cant, as expected.\nMoreover, it is always much larger on Megathreads than on Reuters posts, sometimes by\nan order of magnitude, as predicted if Megathreads have a larger audience. The fact that\nthe results are robust to estimation by NLLS is reassuring given the sparsity of our dataset.\nNext, consider Appendix Table C.11 where the dependent variable is the score. Column\n(1) refers to the numerical value of the score, Columns (2) to (4) to whether the score is\npositive. In Column (1) and (2) we estimate b1\u0000b2by OLS using the continuous measure\nof partisanship. In Column (3) and (4) we estimate b1\u0000b2by Logit, using the discrete\nand continuous tag, respectively. Results are robust across all models and types of author\ntagging.\n5 Content Analysis\nWhat do users write in their comments to emotionally charged news? We now address\nthis question, with two objectives: \ufb01rst, to interpret our previous results on users\u2019 activity;\n34\nsecond, to provide novel evidence on online debates over potentially emotional issues.\nAs in the theory, we maintain the simple hypothesis that comments express users\u2019 true\nfeelings and opinions. We study four outcomes that can be inferred from the text of a\ncomment, the \ufb01rst of which measures what gets discussed, while the last three measure\nhow news are discussed. The unit of observation here is the comment, rather than the\nuser-post pair.\n5.1 What Is Discussed\nTo capture whether users discuss different topics across emotionally vs. not emotionally\ncharged posts, we start by employing a c2test that highlights words that are most common\nin the sample of partisan vs. independent users when discussing scandals. Speci\ufb01cally,\nin Appendix Figure C.4 we plot the most distinctive bigrams by partisan supporters when\nthey comment non-consonant scandals (i.e. scandals on their candidate), compared to inde-\npendents when they comment scandals on the same candidate. The most distinctive tokens\nthat distinguish Trump supporters from independents are those that relate to scandals on\nClinton. That is, compared to independents, Trump supporters respond to scandals on\ntheir candidate by highlighting topics that cast doubts on the valence of his opponent. The\npattern is less pronounced for Clinton supporters, although they too, compared to indepen-\ndents, seem to talk less about Clinton scandals.\nMotivated by this pattern, we investigate whether partisans are more likely to discuss\nscandals of the opponent when commenting consonant vs non-consonant scandals. To do\nso, we construct one measure for each candidate xthat, for each comment to a scandal con-\ncerning a candidate x, reports the \u201csimilarity\u201d of that comment to any scandal concerning\nx\u2019s opponent. The measure is constructed as follows. First, we start from the text of all\nReuters articles in our sample. For each candidate x, we estimate a c2test (as in Gentzkow\nand Shapiro, 2010) of the uni- and bigrams that are most distinctive of scandals of xvs. all\nother news (general news and scandals on x06=x). Armed with this token-level measure\nof distinctiveness, we project it at the comment level by taking the weighted average of the\nc2statistics of each token in the comment, weighted by the occurrence of each token in\nthe comment. Note that this measure is only available for scandals, because general news\ndon\u2019t concern a speci\ufb01c candidate (i.e. similarity of the comment to a scandal of his/her\nopponent cannot be computed for comments on general news, because the opponent is not\n35\nwell de\ufb01ned). Thus, the analysis that follows is restricted to scandals, and ( when includ-\ning individual FE) we can only identify the difference in the reaction to consonant vs.\nnon-consonant scandals.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, let Yipcbe our measure of similarity of comment cto a scandal of the\nopposite candidate. We estimate the following speci\ufb01cation:\nYipc=ai+yp+b\u0003Non-consonant Scandal ip+dXc+#ipc\nwhere aiandypare individual and post \ufb01xed effects and Xca vector of controls that in-\ncludes a polynomial of order three in the comment length and a dummy indicating the level\nof the comment. bis our coef\ufb01cient of interest.

Post pis a Non-consonant Scandal for author iif\nit reports a scandal affecting the candidate supported by i. The dependent variable is the similarity to the news opposite to the one commented.\nThe sample is restricted to comments to scandals on Trump or Clinton by authors classi\ufb01ed as either Trump Supporters, Clinton Supporters or\nIndependent.\nTable 6 reports the results. The \ufb01rst set of four columns focuses on the Reuters sample,\nthe last four on Megathreads. Within each set of columns, the \ufb01rst two report results when\nusing word counts of unigrams, the last two those using bigrams. Columns (1), (3), (5),\n36\nand (7) report the correlations without controls and \ufb01xed effects, which we add in the\nremaining columns. The results show that partisans are signi\ufb01cantly more likely to talk of\nscandals of the opposite candidate when they comment scandals of their candidate (i.e. non-\nconsonant scandals), compared to when they comment scandals on his/her opponent. That\nis, a Trump supporter is much more likely to talk about Clinton scandals when commenting\na scandal on Trump, compared to how much he/she is likely to talk of Trump scandals when\ncommenting a scandal on Clinton.\nThis evidence is in line with the idea of supporters shifting the focus of the comment\naway from emotionally discomforting news, towards comforting ones.\n5.2 How Are News Discussed\nWe now focus on how users discuss scandals, estimating equation (8) again but now with\nmeasures that relate to the content of the comment, instead of its score. Our \ufb01rst measure\ncaptures the degree of emotionality vs. reason in a text (Gennaro and Ash, 2021). It is\nconstructed as the ratio of the distance of a comment from two sets of words: one relating\nto emotionality and affection (in the numerator), and one relating to rationality (in the de-\nnominator).30A value of 1 means that the text is equally distant from emotional words and\nfrom rational ones, a higher value means that the text displays relatively more emotionality\nthan reason.\nThe other two measures captures the sentiment of a comment - i.e. whether a comment\nexpresses positive or negative opinons or feelings.31Our preferred measure of sentiment is\nthe classi\ufb01er provided by Hartmann et al. (2023), which builds on a document-embedding\nrepresentation of each comment using the RoBERTA model by Liu et al. (2019) that tags\neach comment as having either positive or negative sentiment.32For robustness, we also\nreport results on an alternative measure of sentiment developed by Gennaro and Ash (2021).\n30For the speci\ufb01c procedure to construct their measure, see the method outlined in Gennaro and Ash (2021),\nwhich we follow in its entirety. We are grateful to them for making the code available to us.\n31Sentiment analysis differs from measurement of emotion vs reason, because it aims to classify the polar-\nity of a text, as positive or negative. Even cognitive and rational statements can contain positive or negative\ncontent.\n32Although the lack of a neutral class is undesirable, it is outweighed by the reliability of the classi\ufb01er and\nits performance compared to other alternatives. Sentiment classi\ufb01cation is still a dif\ufb01cult task, no matter how\nadvanced the classi\ufb01er. To assess the extent of measurement error, we inspected 500 comments and manually\nclassi\ufb01ed their sentiment, which reassures that measurement error is within reasonable bounds (see Appendix\nSection C.6 for the details of the classi\ufb01cation).\n37\nTheir algorithm constructs the sentiment score as the distance between the comment and\nsets of words representing positive and negative sentiment centroids.33\nWe estimate a speci\ufb01cation like in equation (8). Standard errors are again clustered at\ntheiandplevel and reported in parentheses. As above, we report the p\u0000value against a\nnull that the difference between b1\u0000b2is zero. Since independents are always included\nin the sample, b1\u0000b2measures the difference in the outcome variable of comments of\npartisan users between consonant vs non-consonant posts, compared to the difference by\nindependents between these same posts.\nWe only report estimated coef\ufb01cients for the Megathreads sample, where emotions pre-\nsumably play a larger role.34Results are displayed in Table 7. For all outcome variables,\nin odd columns we report a speci\ufb01cation without controls and FE, and in even columns\na fully saturated speci\ufb01cation. In Columns (1)-(2) the dependent variable is the ratio of\nemotionality to rationality, the remaining columns refer to the two alternative measures of\nsentiment.\nEmotionality Column (2) shows that, compared to independents, partisan users, are less\nemotional when they comment non-consonant scandals on Megathreads, relative to the\ndifference between partisan and independents when commenting a general news, and the\nestimated difference b1\u0000b2between comments on consonant and non-consonant scan-\ndals is positive and signi\ufb01cant. Note however that the magnitudes of the effect, although\nstatistically signi\ufb01cant, is not large. The estimated coef\ufb01cient of 0.57 in column (2) on\nnon-consonant news implies that the affection/cognition ratio of partisan comments on a\nnon-consonant scandal is roughly a tenth of a standard deviation lower, compared to com-\nments by independents on the same post, relative to the difference between partisan vs\nindependents on general news.\n33In particular, for each comment c, the sentiment score is computed as1\u0000cos(c,p)\n1\u0000cos(c,n), where cos(c,p)and\ncos(c,n)represent the cosine distance between a vector representing comment cand a positive ( p) and neg-\native ( n) sentiment centroid respectively. We represent comments using word embeddings trained on our\nr/politics corpus. The positive (p) and negative (n) centroids are computed as a weighted average of the\npositive and negative seed-words identi\ufb01ed by Demszky et al. (2019) and the 10 most similar embeddings for\neach seed in our vector space. Differently from Gennaro and Ash (2021), we do not restrict the number of\nseeds used.\n34In the Reuters sample these two measures of content are generally not signi\ufb01cantly different between par-\ntisan comments on consonant vs non-consonant news, relative to independents. Compared to Megathreads,\nthe Reuters sample is also much smaller, and this matters if the dependent variable, as likely, is measured\nwith error.\n38\nTable 7: Emotionality and Sentiment of Comments to Scandals on Megathreads\nDependent variable : Content of Comment ito Post p(\u0002100)\nEmotionality Sentiment Sentiment\n(RoBERTa) (Gennaro-Ash Score)\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nConsonant Scandal i,p(bS\n1)\u00001.2743\u0003\u0003\u0003\u00000.0321\u00005.1164\u0003\u0003\u00031.8944\u00032.0569\u0003\u0003\u00030.2008\n(0.2932 ) ( 0.1595 ) ( 0.8934 ) ( 1.0432 ) ( 0.6546 ) ( 0.3158 )\nNon-consonant Scandal i,p(bS\n2)\u00001.7500\u0003\u0003\u0003\u00000.5740\u0003\u0003\u0003\u00007.8137\u0003\u0003\u0003\u00002.6515\u0003\u0003\u00030.8465\u00000.4524\n(0.3466 ) ( 0.1313 ) ( 0.8327 ) ( 0.9138 ) ( 0.6895 ) ( 0.3480 )\nFE and Controls No Yes No Yes No Yes\np-value (bS\n1\u0000bS\n2) 0.0057 0.0001 0.0278 0.0002 0.0017 0.0309\nDep.

Sample restricted to Megathreads. Dependent variable\nis the emotion vs. reason ratio in columns (1) and (2); sentiment score in columns (3) to (6), as tagged by RoBERTa in columns (3) and (4);\nand using the Gennaro-Ash score in columns (5) and (6). All dependent variables are multiplied by 100. The sample is restricted to comments\nof authors classi\ufb01ed as either Trump Supporters, Clinton Supporters or Independent. FE refer to post and author \ufb01xed effects. Controls refer to\nwhether preports a poll, interacted with the af\ufb01liation of i; the share of right- and left-wing sources shared in p(separately), interacted with the\naf\ufb01liation of i; the activity of user iin a \ufb01ve-day window around p.\nA plausible interpretation of this \ufb01nding is that, when confronted with a scandal by\nhis/her candidate, a partisan user tries to protect its self-identity, rationalizing the candi-\ndate\u2019s behavior, \ufb01nding excuses for it, or attenuating its relevance. When instead the scan-\ndal concerns the opponent, this does not happen, because they don\u2019t need to \ufb01nd excuses\nor explanations. The idea that users react to unpleasant news with more cognitive content\nin order to protect their identity is in line with other results in the literature on motivated\nbeliefs (see in particular Kahan, 2015), as well as with \ufb01ndings in neuroscience (Westen\net al., 2006).\nSentiment Next, consider our preferred measure of sentiment, in column (4) of Ta-\nble 7. Compared to independents, partisan users are signi\ufb01cantly more likely to express\na positive sentiment in their comments to consonant scandals than on general news, and\nto express negative sentiment if the scandal is non-consonant. The estimated difference\nb1\u0000b2between comments on consonant and non-consonant scandals is positive and sig-\nni\ufb01cant. Thus, partisan users are more positive when commenting consonant rather than\nnon-consonant scandals, compared to how independents comment on the same news, and\nviceversa if the news is non-consonant. Compared to comments on general news, partisan\ncomments are 1.9 p.p. more likely to display a positive sentiment on a consonant scandal\n39\n(6% at the mean), and 2.65 p.p. less likely on a non-consonant one (9% at the mean), com-\npared to the same difference for independents. To alleviate concerns of measurement error,\ncolumn (6) shows that the estimated difference b1\u0000b2remains positive and signi\ufb01cant\nwhen sentiment is measured by an alternative indicator of sentiment developed by Gennaro\nand Ash (2021).\n6 Conclusion\nWe have studied how users of Reddit\u2019s main political forum commented on political news\nduring the 2016 US Electoral Campaign. We \ufb01nd four main results.\nFirst, on days of major scandals on their supported candidate, partisan users disengage\nfrom political discussion altogether, compared to independents\u2014while the opposite is true\nwhen the scandal falls on the opponent.\nSecond, when faced with bad news about a candidate, partisan users are less likely\nto comment if it concerns their candidate, and more likely if it concerns the opponent,\ncompared with how independents comment the same news. These differences are large\nand symmetric (partisans are about 30% more or less likely to comment depending on\nwhether the news is consonant or not). Moreover, they cannot be attributed to partisans\nbeing less uncertain about their candidate than about the opponent, because this different\nbehavior is also observed on polls outcomes, where prior uncertainty is obviously the same\nfor the two candidates.\nThird, the number of net likes received by partisan comments on consonant news is\nmuch larger than those received on non-consonant news, as one would expect if news en-\ngagement re\ufb02ects a social motive.\nFourth, the contents of the comments are systematically correlated with the emotional\nimplications of the news. If the news is pleasant (a scandal of the opponent), the comments\nof partisan users are more likely to display positive (rather than negative) sentiment and\nemotional (rather than rational) content, compared to unpleasant news (a scandal of the own\ncandidate) and relative to how independents comment on the same news. Finally, when they\ncomment a scandal, users are more likely to speak about a scandal of the opposite candidate\nif the scandal is not consonant than if it is.\nThese results paint a highly consistent picture. Partisan users seem reluctant to accept\n40\ndiscomforting political news. They engage less with such news, and when they do they try\nto rationalize them or to \ufb01nd excuses, and they point to the sins of the opponent, as if they\ntried to defend their political identity. These behavioral features of online debates can shed\nlight on why individuals with different partisan af\ufb01liations hold starkly different beliefs on\ncontroversial issues.\nOur analysis also suggests that social media amplify the relevance of these psycholog-\nical drivers of news engagement. The new web platforms provide enhanced opportunities\nto exchange views with others, allowing users to self-select into more or less congenial\ndebates. If individuals enjoy receiving positive feedback on their views, this will give rise\nto echo chambers, where individuals with similar political views engage with the same\nkind of news. Even if these echo chambers do not directly in\ufb02uence beliefs, they create\nsocial incentives to pay more attention to consonant vs non-consonant news, amplifying\nthe effects of motivated cognition on belief formation.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, Asuman Ozdaglar, and James Siderius (2023). \u201cA Model of Online\nMisinformation\u201d.

Attention only affects the ex-ante variance of conditional ex-\npectations, not their ex-ante means, which are pinned down by prior beliefs. Intuitively,\nmore attention implies that the voter puts more weight on the true underlying variables ,\nso the variance of his posterior means re\ufb02ects more closely what the voter believes is the\ntrue variance of quality .If the voter paid no attention, he would not expose himself to any\nrandomness, thereby keeping his posterior mean identical to his prior (0 variance). If no\nsignal on candidate cis observed, then posterior means coincide with prior means.35\nTo compute equilibrium attention, we exploit the properties of the distribution of the\nrandom variable Di\nkc=\u02c6Qi\nkc\u0000Qi\nc0,forc06=c,which measures the expected difference in\ncandidates quality for voter i, conditional on observing signal si\nkc. Ex-ante (i.e. before\nobserving the signal), Di\nkcis also normally distributed, with mean\nxi\nc=\u00e5\nh(ci\nhcmi\nhc\u0000ci\nhc0mi\nhc0) (10)\n35Note that the variance of posterior means, Vari(\u02c6Qi\nc),should not be confused with the variance of poste-\nrior beliefs on qi\nkc(i.e the posterior variance), which instead is: ri\nkc=xi\nkc(hi\nkc)2.Note also that the subjective\ndistribution of posterior means differs from the true distribution of posterior means if individual priors are\nnot rational (i.e., if prior beliefs over the random variable qkcdiffer from true distribution of qkc).\n45\nand variance\n(qi\nkc)2=xi\nkc(ci\nkc)2(si\nkc)2+Gi\nkc(11)\nwhere Gi\nkc=\u00e5h6=k(ci\nhc)2(si\nhc)2+\u00e5h(ci\nhc0)2(si\nhc0)2.Higher attention increases the (ex-\nante) variance of Di\nkc,because voters\u2019 expectations re\ufb02ect more closely the signals received.\nThroughout we assume that:\njxi\ncj<qi\nkc(A1)\nf(xi\nc\n\u00afqi\nkc)(si\nkc)2(ci\nkc)2\n2\u00afqi\nkc>li\nkc\n1\u0000\u00afx(A2)\nfor all xi\nkcand for all kcand all iand where (\u00afqi\nkc)2=\u00afx(ci\nkc)2(si\nkc)2+Gi\nkc.As shown below,\n(A1) implies that the suf\ufb01cient second order conditions for an optimum are satis\ufb01ed, and\n(A2) implies the optimum is not at the corner corresponding to the lower bound of the\nchoice set [\u00afx,1].\nThe \ufb01rst order conditions for an interior optimum of (4) with respect to xi\nkcare:\n\u00b6Wi\nkc(xi\nkc)\n\u00b6xi\nkc\u0000\u00b6Mi\nkc(xi\nkc)\n\u00b6xi\nkc+\u00b6bVxi\nkc(xi\nkc,x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc)\n\u00b6xi\nkc=0 (12)\nWe have:\n\u00b6Wi\nkc(xi\nkc)\n\u00b6xi\nkc=(\nf(xi\nc\nqi\nkc)[1\u0000(xi\nc\nqi)2]\u0000f0(xi\nc\nqi\nkc)xi\nc\nqi\nkc)\n\u00b6qi\nkc\n\u00b6xi\nkc(13)\n\u00b6bVxi\nkc(xi\nkc,x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc)\n\u00b6xi\nkc=P0(xi\nkc)bA(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc) (14)\nwhere A(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc) =F[W(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc)]W(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc)>0.Note that f0(x) =\u0000f(x)x,and\n\u00b6qi\nkc\n\u00b6xi\nkc=1\n2qi\nkc(ci\nkc)2(si\nkc)2\n\u00b6Mi\nkc(xi\nkc)\n\u00b6xi\nkc=li\nkc/(1\u0000xi\nkc)\n46\nInserting these expressions in (12) and simplifying yields:36\nf(xi\nc\nqi\nkc)(si\nkc)2(ci\nkc)2\n2qi\nkc\u0000li\nkc\n1\u0000xi\nkc+bP0(xi\nkc)A(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc) =0 (15)\nHence, the second order conditions for an optimum is:\n(\n(si\nc)2(ci\nkc)2\n2(qi\nkc)2f(xi\nc\nqi\nkc)(\u00001+ (xi\nc\nqi\nkc)2))\n\u00b6qi\nkc\n\u00b6xi\nkc\u0000li\nkc\n1\u0000xi\nkcbP00(xi\nkc)A(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc)<0\nor:\n(\n(si\nc)4(ci\nkc)4\n4(qi\nkc)3f(xi\nc\nqi\nkc)(\u00001+ (xi\nc\nqi\nkc)2))\n\u0000li\nkc\n1\u0000xi\nkcP00(xi\nkc)bA(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc)<0\nwhich is certainly satis\ufb01ed if (A1) holds.\nA.2 Equilibrium Attention\nTo study the equilibrium, rewrite (15) more succinctly as:\nG(xi\nkc;d) +bA(x\u0000i\nkc;#i\nkc) =0 (16)\nwhere d= (li\nkc,si\nkc,ci\nkc,#i\nkc)is a vector of parameters of interest and\nG(xi\nkc,d) =1\nP0(xi\nkc)(\nf(xi\nc\nqi\nkc)(si\nkc)2(ci\nkc)2\n2qi\nkc\u0000li\nkc\n1\u0000xi\nkc)\nEquation (16) de\ufb01nes implictly the best response function: xi\nkc=H(x\u0000i\nkc),which of course\ndepends on all parameters of the model. The equilibrium is a \ufb01xed point of H(.),such that\n36To guarantee that the optimum is not at the corner \u00afx, we also assume:\nf(xi\nc\n\u00afqi\nkc)(si\nkc)2(ci\nkc)2\n2\u00afqi\nkc>li\nkc\n1\u0000\u00afx\nwhere (\u00afqi\nkc)2=\u00afx(ci\nkc)2(si\nkc)2+Gi\nkc.\n47\nxi\u0003\nkc=H(xi\u0003\nkc).Hence, the equilibrium is implicitly de\ufb01ned by:\nG(xi\u0003\nkc;d) +bA(xi\u0003\nkc;#i\nkc) =0 (17)\nNext, we prove the following:\nLemma 1 Ifb>0is suf\ufb01ciently small, then the equilibrium is unique.\nProof. We show that H(.)is a contraction, so that it admits a unique \ufb01xed point. By the\nassumption in footonote 5, xi\nkc2[\u00afx,1]. The function G:[\u00afx,1]!Ris continuously differ-\nentiable and, by the second order condition and by concavity of P(.),\u00b6G(xi\u0003\nkc;d)/\u00b6xi\u0003\nkc<0\nin[\u00afx,1]. Thus, G(.)admits an inverse function G\u00001:R![\u00afx,1]that is continuous, differ-\nentiable, and bounded.

QED\nB More on Reddit\nB.1 User Experience\nUsers of Reddit make two decisions over how to engage with the platform in two main\nways (both choices are unobserved to us). First, they choose what to browse: either the\n\u201cfront page\u201d or a speci\ufb01c subreddit of their interest. Second, within a browsing window,\nthey choose how to sort posts. Essentially, users could decide whether to sort posts by\ntheir novelty or popularity, or a combination of both. Based on internet archives of the\nReddit front page in June 1, 201637a user could decide to sort posts by \u201chot\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d, \u201cris-\ning\u201d, \u201ccontroversial\u201d, \u201ctop\u201d, and \u201cgilded\u201d. In essence, these all re\ufb02ect different weighting\nschemes of novelty and the reactions received, in terms of aggregate upvotes and down-\nvotes. For instance, \u201chot\u201d posts are those that have many \u201cupvotes\u201d, discounted by the\ntime of posting; \u201ctop\u201d posts, are those that have the highest number of upvotes overall,\nwithin a time period; \u201ccontroversial\u201d posts received both many upvotes and downvotes at\nthe same time. Selecting \u201cnew\u201d sorts posts by the time of submission, with the newest at\n37https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000340/https://www.reddit.com/\n51\nthe top of the page. \u201cRising\u201d posts are those that are currently receiving a lot of activity,\nin terms of comments and upvotes. Finally, posts that received \u201cawards\u201d from other users\n(that is, other users spent money to highlight those posts by purchasing virtual awards and\nassigning them to those posts) are called \u201cgilded\u201d.\nWhen browsing the front page during our sample period (and, more generally, un-\ntil 2017), users were presented with the most popular/newest postings (according to their\nsorting choice) from a random subset of subreddits to which they subscribed, without any\nfurther individual-level customization. When browsing each single subreddit, users are pre-\nsented with the most popular or newest postings on that subreddit only, again according to\ntheir preferences. Notably, users also seem to often browse a subreddit denoted as r/all ,\nwhich aggregates posts from all the subreddits on Reddit, regardless of a user\u2019s subscrip-\ntions. This serves as a common page, available to the entire site regardless of individual\npreferences.\nThus, until 2017, two individuals that subscribed to the same subreddits and were\nsorting posts in the same way were presented the same postings, on average, regard-\nless of their individual interactions with each posting or the amount of time they spent\non the different subreddits. After 2017, a changelog was implemented that customized\nthe home feed so to give more weight to subreddits where the individual user spent rel-\natively more time (reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7hkvjn). Furthermore, Reddit also\ncustomized the home page so to remove posts with which the user already interacted (red-\ndit.com/r/changelog/comments/7j5w9f).\nB.2 Engagement with Posts\nUsers on Reddit can \u201cupvote\u201d a comment (an equivalent concept to what other social media\ncall \u201clikes\u201d) or \u201cdownvote\u201d it, and the score is de\ufb01ned as the number of upvotes minus that\nof downvotes. We don\u2019t observe the identity of who posts the upvotes.\nB.3 Classi\ufb01cation of Subreddits\nAs anticipated, Reddit is divided in more than 900,000 subreddits (in June, 2016). Thus,\nto classify the type of each subreddit, we must \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne an exhaustive list of political\nfora and, within this list, manually inspect each subreddit to determine its slant (if any).\n52\nTo de\ufb01ne a list of political fora, we start from the 1,417 biggest fora by total number of\ncomments (during our sample period) written by users who have posted or commented at\nleast once on r/politics . Together, these 1,417 fora host 90% of their comments on the\nplatform in our period. Within these subreddits, we identify forums that discuss politics as\nthose subreddits whose main focus is the discussion of US Politics, US politicians, and po-\nlitical ideologies. Subreddits that discuss topics and social issues such as gender and racial\ndiscrimination, religion, free speech, police brutality, guns, or the environment, are also\nclassi\ufb01ed under this label when it is clear that the political aspect of such issues is debated\nwithin the forum. Within political fora, we distinguish between independent, partisan, and\nideological forum, following the discussion in Section 3.1. To distinguish between parti-\nsan (supporting a candidate) and ideological (supporting an ideology), we require that the\nforum is centered around a person vs. around an ideology or party. Partisan fora are then\nfurther divided in three categories: pro Trump, pro Clinton, and supporting others (Bernie\nSanders, Jill Stein). Ideological fora are divided in Pro Democrats, Pro Republicans, and\nOthers. Table B.2 reports all the political fora, along with their classi\ufb01cation.\nB.4 More on r/politics and Our Sample\nThe total number of r/politics comments available to us is 9.3 millions, but we exclude\n1 million of comments made by either automated bots that post the rules of the forum under\nevery post, together with comments that were deleted by the moderators for violating the\nrules, for which we have no information on the author.\nAs described in the main text, r/politics is moderated by a team that ensures a civil\ndebate. In particular, users are not supposed to comment a story with the only objective of\nangering others or to in\ufb02ame the debate. Insightful comments, even if stating unpopular\nopinions, are rewarded by the community, whereas derogatory comments are banned or\n\u201cdownvoted\u201d. The guidelines, which are always printed on the side of the webpage, state,\namong other things \u201cBe civil\u201d and\u201cVote based on quality, not opinion\u201d . Upon hovering on\nthese two buttons, a user is reminded, respectively, \u201c[to] treat others with basic decency.\nNo personal attacks, hate-speech, \ufb02aming, baiting, trolling, witch-hunting, or unsubstanti-\nated accusations.

(ii) There is a drop of at\nleast 1.5 percentage points in his/her probability of victory, relative to the previous Reuters poll.\n(iii) The candidate was trailing behind in the previous poll by at least 3 percentage points, and the\nlatest poll does not improve his/her chance of winning by at least 1.5 percentage point (e.g., we\nconsider as bad poll for Trump a July 15 article titled: \u201cClinton leads Trump by 12 points ahead\nof Republican convention\u201d, which states \u201c[...] little change from Tuesday, when Clinton had led\nTrump by 13 percentage points.\u201d). This last criterion mainly refers to the early part of the electoral\ncampaign, when Trump was lagging behind Clinton by a wide margin and his popularity was not\nyet improving. In Tables C.13 and C.14 we show that the results are robust if we instead consider\na narrower classi\ufb01cation of bad polls, based exclusively on criterion (i) above. We cannot classify\nMegathreads as referring to a bad poll, because they aggregate several polls together, and the poll\noutcomes vary across pollsters and dates within each meagthread.\n61\nTable C.5: Examples of Reuters Scandals and Bad Polls\nType Title (URL) Article Leading Paragraph\nBad\nNews\nClinton\u2019Lone hacker\u2019 claims\nresponsibility for cy-\nber attack on Democrats\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-\nusa-election-hack-\nidUSKCN0Z209QA \u201clone hacker\u201d has taken responsibility for a cy-\nber attack on the U.S. Democratic National Com-\nmittee, which the DNC and a cyber-security \ufb01rm\nhave blamed on the Russian government.\nBad\nNews\nTrumpRuling against ex-AIG boss\nGreenberg raises stakes\nin Trump University case\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-\nusa-election-trumpuniversity-\nidUSKCN0YT2M2A ruling by New York\u2019s highest court in a\nfraud case against former American Interna-\ntional Group Inc AIG.N Chief Executive Maurice\n\"Hank\" Greenberg could affect the state\u2019s case\nagainst Republican presidential candidate Donald\nTrump and his defunct Trump University.\nBad Poll\nClintonClinton\u2019s lead over Trump\nslips after Florida shoot-\ning: Reuters/Ipsos poll\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-\nusa-election-poll-\nidUSKCN0Z32BXDonald Trump chipped away at Hillary Clinton\u2019s\nlead in the presidential race this week, accord-\ning to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, as\nthe candidates clashed over how to respond to the\nworst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\nBad Poll\nTrumpClinton opens up double-\ndigit lead over Trump na-\ntionwide: Reuters/Ipsos poll\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-\nusa-election-poll-\nidUSKCN0YP2EX?Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clin-\nton has opened up a double-digit lead over Re-\npublican rival Donald Trump, regaining ground\nafter the New York billionaire brie\ufb02y tied her last\nmonth, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released\non Friday.\n62\nC.2 Classi\ufb01cation of News Sources\u2019 Ideological Bias\nTo control for the share of left-wing and right-wing sources cited in each Megathread, we use the\nPolitical Bias Index constructed by the website mediabiasfactcheck.com . The index assigns\nto several media sources a score on a 7-point scale, from \u201cExtreme Left\u201d to \u201cExtreme Right\u201d. The\nscore is based on four evaluations, namely whether: (i) the source uses biased wording or headlines;\n(ii) it reports stories factually and documents the evidence presented; (iii) it reports news from\nboth the democratic and the republican side; (iv) it endorses a particular political ideology. See\nmediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/ for more details.\nC.3 Supplementary Material for Event Studies\nC.3.1 ChatGPT Tagging of Bad News\nWe used a \ufb01ne-tuned version of ChatGPT to tag posts coming from r/politics and partisan fora as\nTrump scandals, Clinton scandal, or neither. This was done using gpt-3.5-turbo as the base model.\n1.Task De\ufb01nition and Training Data: To \ufb01ne-tune ChatGPT for a speci\ufb01c task, we \ufb01rst need\nto de\ufb01ne the task and gather a dataset that we can train the AI on. We used as a training set\nthe Reuters articles we tagged manually, split in train/valuation/test with a standard 70/20/10\nsplit. 95 Clinton scandals and 71 Trump scandals, while the validation dataset consisted of\n335 no scandals, 28 Clinton scandal, and 23 Trump scandals. We used the following prompt:\n\u201cYou are a helpful research assistant. I am going to present you with some post titles taken\nfrom Reddit. I want you to tell me whether you think the post refers to a scandal that\ninvolves Trump, a scandal that involves Hillary Clinton, or neither. Some of the names or\ntext may contain typos. Fix these in the output if needed. \u201d\nThis prompt was chosen as the one providing us with the best results in the pre-\ufb01ne-tuning\ntrials.\n2.Training Process: The model has been trained for 3 epochs on 470,955 tokens on the Ope-\nnAI servers. Following best practices, the hyperparameters\u2019 values were the default ones\noptimized by the openai.fine_tuning.jobs.create function of the openai library.\n3.Evaluation: To evaluate model performance, we test it on i)the 181 Reuters articles that\nwere not included in the training data, 200 Reddit posts taken at random from our initial\ndatabase of posts, and other 119 posts around the Hollywood scandal from fora that were\n63\nnot pro-Trump. This last step was done to ensure that we have some Trump scandals in our\nmanual evaluation dataset.

The sample drops comments to posts that explicitly discuss scandals. The\nbands denote 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (standard errors are clustered by user). Day t=0is the date when\na scandal on either candidate became public, with the four panels covering the four scandals described in\nthe notes of Figure 2.

Table C.15 reports the confusion matrix, which cross-tabulates our manual clas-\nsi\ufb01cation with that of the model. Table C.16 reports the accuracy, precision, and the F1-score of\nthe model, which are 76.6%, 89.4%, and 81.2%, respectively. The relatively low accuracy is due\nto the fact that forcing a binary classi\ufb01cation is a strong restriction. Indeed, when restricting the\nmanual sample to comments judged as non-neutral (373 out of 500, considering the classi\ufb01cation\nof both human coders), accuracy rises to 83.1%. The confusion matrix for such types of comments\nis reported in the right panel of Table C.15. As the matrix shows, most mistakes are on negative\ncomments that get misclassi\ufb01ed as positive. This is mainly because the model fails to recognize\nsarcasm.\nTable C.15: Sentiment Classi\ufb01cation: Confusion Matrix\nAll comments - Binary Scores Comments with Extreme Scores\nClassi\ufb01er RoBERTa Classi\ufb01er RoBERTa\nHuman Label Negative Positive Human Label Negative Positive\nNegative 354 102 Negative 285 58\nPositive 15 29 Positive 5 25\nNotes: the Table shows a confusion matrix comparing our manual sentiment scores\n(in the rows) with those generated by RoBERTa (in the columns). The confusion\nmatrix on the left reports results for the entire sample of 500 comments that we man-\nually classi\ufb01ed. The one on the right refers to a subset of 373 comments that were\nconsidered as decidedly negative or decidedly positive upon manual inspection, thus\nexcluding 127 comments for which the sentiment displayed was more ambiguous.\nTable C.16: Sentiment Classi\ufb01cation: Performance\nAll comments - Binary Scores Comments with Extreme Scores\nLabel Precision Recall F1-score Support Label Precision Recall F1-score Support\nNegative 0.959 0.776 0.858 456 Negative 0.983 0.831 0.900 343\nPositive 0.221 0.659 0.331 44 Positive 0.301 0.833 0.442 30\nAccuracy 0.766 Accuracy 0.831\nSimple avg 0.590 0.718 0.595 500 Simple avg 0.642 0.832 0.671 373\nWeighted avg 0.894 0.766 0.812 500 Weighted avg 0.928 0.831 0.864 373\nNotes: the Table reports several performance measures of our classi\ufb01er: the precision (i.e., how many true\nnegative over true negatives and false negatives, and similarly for positive), the recall (i.e., how many true\nnegative over the true negatives and the false positives, and similarly for positive), the F1-score (i.e., harmonic\nmean between precision and recall).

Introduction\nMany of the issues discussed in the media today are deeply po-\nlarizing and thus are subject to political ideology or bias. On\nthe one hand, it is natural for media that are openly associated\nwith a particular political ideology to offer strong cues about\ntheir political preferences when discussing such polarizing top-\nics [1, 2]. For example, what liberals and liberal media call the\n\u201cestate tax\u201d, conservatives call the \u201cdeath tax\u201d [3]. On the other\nhand, such left-vs-right (and other) biases can potentially exist\nin any news media, even in such that do not openly subscribe to\na left/right agenda, and prefer to be seen as fair and balanced.\nAlthough objectivity remains an important principle of journal-\nism, researchers and watchdog groups agree that many of the\nsupposedly objective news media are actually biased [4, 5].\nSpotting a systematic bias of a target news medium is easy\nfor trained experts, and in many cases can be done by ordinary\nreaders, but it requires exposure to a certain number of articles\nby the target medium. There have been systematic efforts to\ndo this based on clear criteria by projects such as the Media\nBias/Fact Check1(MBFC) and AllSides2, to mention just two.\nHowever, as checking the bias is a tedious process, MBFC so far\nonly covers 2,700 media, while this number is 600 for AllSides.\nObviously, this does not scale well, and it is of limited utility if\nwe wanted to characterize newly created media, so that readers\nare aware of what they are reading.\n1http://mediabiasfactcheck.com\n2http://www.allsides.comAn attractive alternative is to try to automate the process, and\nthere have been several attempts to do this in previous work.\nHowever, most work has focused on predicting the bias of in-\ndividual articles [1, 6, 7] rather than characterizing entire news\noutlet [8, 9]. Yet, we believe that focusing on entire news out-\nlets is more useful if we want to raise awareness about what\npeople are reading, and it is also arguably easier to work at the\nmedium level as detecting political ideology requires looking\nfor systematic bias over a period of time, for which looking at a\nsingle article is clearly not enough.\nNotably, previous work on bias detection has focused ex-\nclusively on newspaper-like media, which are text-based. How-\never, online news are currently increasingly being consumed as\nmultimedia, including videos. As a result, many media started\ncreating YouTube channels where they are posting videos on-\nline. Thus, we believe that we should also move media bias\nanalysis to YouTube channels, as for many media YouTube\nhas become one of their main channels for content distribution.\nMoreover, videos allow us to explore not only the textual con-\ntent of what is being said, but also the way it is said. Previous\nwork has looked into text only, while we believe there is a lot\nthat analysis of the acoustic signal can offer. Thus, below we\naim to bridge this gap by combining textual and acoustic as-\npects of videos in order to predict the leading political ideology\nof YouTube channels. Our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We study an under-explored but arguably important\nproblem: predicting the leading political ideology of\nYouTube channels.\n\u2022 Unlike previous work, we model both the textual content\nand the acoustic signal (and metadata).\n\u2022 As ours is a pioneering work, we create a new dataset\nof YouTube channels annotated for left-center-right bias,\nand we release the dataset and our code, which should\nfacilitate future research.\n2. Related Work\nIn previous work, political ideology, also known as media bias,\nwas used as a feature for \u201cfake news\u201d detection [10]. It has\nalso been the target of classi\ufb01cation, e.g., to predict whether an\narticle is biased ( political orbias) vs. unbiased [6]. Similarly,\n[7] classi\ufb01ed the bias in a target article as ( i) left vs. right vs.\nmainstream, or as ( ii) hyper-partisan vs. mainstream. Left-vs-\nright bias classi\ufb01cation at the article level was also explored by\n[1], who modeled both the textual and the URL contents of the\ntarget article. There has been also work characterizing the bias\nof an entire news outlet [8, 9]. Bias has been also tragetted\nat the phrase and the sentence level [3], focusing on political\nspeeches [11], legislative documents [12], or targeting users in\nTwitter [2].arXiv:1910.08948v1  [cs.CL]  20 Oct 2019\nAnother line of related work focuses on propaganda, which can\nbe seen as a form of extreme bias [13, 14, 15]. See also a recent\nposition paper [16] and an overview paper on bias on the Web\n[17]. Unlike the above work, here we focus on predicting the\npolitical ideology of YouTube channels. Moreover, most of the\nabove work has analyzed text only, while we also use acoustics\nand meta data.\n3. Data\nThere is no pre-existing political labelling for videos or video\nchannels on YouTube. Thus, following [8, 9], we used media-\nlevel annotations for political bias from Media Bias/Fact Check\n(MBFC). MBFC uses the following seven categories: extreme\nleft,left,center-left ,center ,center-right ,right , and extreme\nright . However, we found the center-left and the center-right\nlabels confusing (are they more center or more left/right?), and\ntherefore we dropped all instances with these labels. Moreover,\nin order to reduce the impact of subjective decisions made by\nthe annotators, we merged the \u201cextreme\u201d examples with those\nthat share the same polarity. Thus, ultimately, we model bias\non a 3-point scale: left,center , and right . Table 1 shows some\nexamples of media with their bias labels.\nName Bias Youtube\nDaily Mirror left \u02dc/user/dailymirror\nAssociated Press center \u02dc/user/AssociatedPress\nFox News right \u02dc/user/FoxNewsChannel\nTable 1: Example media with their bias and Youtube channel.\nWe associated media with YouTube channels by looking for\nlinks to Youtube on the medium\u2019s home page. Unfortunately,\nthe process could not be fully automated as many media had\nfully functioning YouTube channels without mentioning them\nin their websites and some media referred to external YouTube\nchannels that were not theirs. Eventually, we had to process\nover 2,000 media manually by verifying the extracted links from\nthe home page or by matching media to a channel after search-\ning in YouTube. In particular, we tried to match the name of the\nmedium (or its website) to the name of the YouTube channel,\nin addition to matching the logos, the font styles, the overall\ndesign, and the contact information. Overall, we managed to\nconnect 1,161 media to their Youtube channel. We \ufb01ltered 28\nof them as they contained primarily non-English content. After\nadditional \ufb01ltering based on minimum duration for the videos\nand the captions, we ended up with a dataset of 421 channels.\nTable 2 shows some statistics about the dataset.\nName Value\nChannels 421\n\u2013left 101\n\u2013center 177\n\u2013right 143\nVideos 3,345\nSpeech episodes 15,945\nAverage number of videos per channel 7.94\nAverage number of speech episodes per video 4.76\nAverage video duration 602 sec.\nTable 2: Statistics about our dataset.The dataset contains the following textual and metadata infor-\nmation about each video:\n\u2022Text: For each YouTube channel and for each Youtube\nvideo, we have a title as a mandatory text property. For\nchannels, we can also have description. For videos, we\nhave a description and tags.\n\u2022Metadata : There is no mandatory meta information, as\nit is generated based on Youtube statistics. For Youtube\nchannels, we have a total number of views, a total num-\nber of videos, and subscribers count. For videos, there\nare \ufb01ve numerical values: number of views, number of\nlikes, number of dislikes, number of comments, and du-\nration (measured in seconds). In the experiments in Sec-\ntion 4, we use metadata for the videos only.\nAs we have an audio \ufb01le and the captions for a video, we\ncan match the location of the speech episodes on the audio time-\nline. Each caption has a starting and ending time and even\nthough it does not match the actual speech (as it is used by\nYouTube captions API to signal when to display a caption and\nwhen to hide it in their video player), we found that about 80%\nof these time intervals were \ufb01lled with actual speech. Using this\ninformation, we retrieved the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve speech episodes for each\naudio \ufb01le, requiring that the time between speech episodes be\nat least one second. Each speech episode is 15 seconds long.\nOverall, we generated 15,945 speech episodes from the 3,345\nvideos for our 421 Youtube channels.\n4. Model\nWe use the following types of features:\n\u2022 NELA: We use features from the NELA toolkit [18],\nwhich were previously shown useful for detecting fake\nnews, political bias, etc. The toolkit implements 130 fea-\ntures, which we extract separately from the title and from\nthe description of the video: a total of 260 features.\n\u2022 openSMILE: We experimented with the following pre-\nde\ufb01ned openSMILE con\ufb01gurations:\n\u2013IS09 emotion[19]: The baseline from the INTER-\nSPEECH\u20192009 Emotion Challenge.\n\u2013IS12 speaker trait[20]: The baseline from the IN-\nTERSPEECH\u20192012 Speaker Trait Challenge. This\nset of features yielded no actual improvement, and\nthus we do not use them in the experiments we re-\nport below (yet, we release them with the dataset).\n\u2022 i\u2013vectors [21]: These features model speech using a\nuniversal background model (UBM), which is typically\na large Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), trained on a\nlarge amount of data to represent general feature char-\nacteristics, which plays the role of a prior on how all\nspeech styles look like. The i\u2013vector approach is a pow-\nerful technique that summarizes all the updates happen-\ning during the adaptation of the UBM mean components\nto a given utterance. All this information is modeled in\na low-dimensional subspace referred to as the total vari-\nability space. In the i\u2013vector framework, each speech ut-\nterance can be represented by a GMM supervector. The\ni\u2013vector is the low-dimensional representation of an au-\ndio recording that can be used for classi\ufb01cation and es-\ntimation purposes. In our experiments, we used 600\u2013\ndimensional i\u2013vectors, which we trained using a GMM\nwith 2048 components and BN features.\n\u2022 BERT: In 2018 Google, presented a new model [22] for\nsentence representation, which achieved very strong re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing tasks includ-\ning GLUE, MultiNLI, and SQuAD. Since then, it was\nused to improve over the state of the art for a number\nof NLP tasks. We used the cased pretrained model, and\nBERT-as-a-service [23], which generates a vector of 768\nnumerical values for a given text. We generated features\nseparately ( i) from the video\u2019s title, description and tags\ncombined, and ( ii) from the video\u2019s captions.\nTable 3 gives some statistics about our feature set.\nType Features\nBERT (captions) 768\nBERT (title, description, tags) 768\ni\u2013vectors (Speech embeddings) 600\nNELA (title, description) 260\nNumeric (metadata) 5\nopenSMILE (IS09 emotion) 385\nTable 3: Statistics about our feature set.\n5. Experiments and Evaluation\n5.1. Experimental Setup\nWe used strati\ufb01ed 5-fold cross-validation at the YouTube chan-\nnels level. We further split the channels into videos, and the\nvideos into episodes. Then, we extracted features from each\nepisode, we aggregated these features at the video level, and we\nperformed classi\ufb01cation using distant supervision, i.e., assign-\ning to each video the label of the channel it comes from. Finally,\nwe aggregated the posterior probabilities to obtain a probability\ndistribution over the bias labels but now for channels.\nFor classi\ufb01cation, we used a feed-forward neural network\nwith two hidden layers (128 nodes with ReLU activation, and\nthen 64 nodes with tanh activation), and dropout layers (with\n0.2 dropout rate) before each layer, as shown in Figure 1. For\noptimization, we used Adagrad with a batch size of 75, and we\nran it for 35 epochs.\n....................softmax.......12864#features..........#classes\nhidden layersInput layerOutput layer\nFigure 1: The neural model architecture.We \ufb01rst experimented with each feature type in isolation. Then,\nwe tried various combinations thereof. The results are shown in\nTable 4.\n\u2022Baseline : This is a majority class baseline, where we\npredict the most common label in the dataset, which is\ncenter (see Table 2). This baseline yields 42% accuracy.\n\u2022Individual feature types : We perform isolated experi-\nments with each of the feature types de\ufb01ned in Section 3\n(and also listed in Table 3). We can see that the best-\nperforming features are those based on BERT, achieving\nup to 68.91% accuracy for BERT that is calculated on ti-\ntle + description + tags. BERT based on captions comes\nsecond with accuracy of 64.64%. The two types of au-\ndio features, based on i\u2013vectors and on openSMILE, per-\nform much worse with accuracy of 50.85% and 56.63%,\nrespectively. The metadata features yield comparable ac-\ncuracy of 50.35%. Interestingly, the NELA features did\nnot help at all, and they performed the same as the major-\nity class baseline at 42.04% accuracy;3this is a surpris-\ning result that is worth a closer investigation in future\nwork.\n\u2022Feature combinations : We performed various combina-\ntions of feature types, and we report some of the most\ninteresting ones below. We can see that combining the\ntextual and the metadata features yields 70.10% accu-\nracy, which is about 1.2% of improvement absolute over\nthe best text-only feature. Adding the i\u2013vectors to the\ncombination gives a marginal improvement to 70.33%.\nAdding both audio features yields an improvement to\n72.02%. However, using only openSMILE and not using\nthe i\u2013vectors yielded the best result: 73.42% accuracy.\nThe fact that the i\u2013vectors did not help is worth a closer\ninvestigation in future work. Comparing line 11 to line 7,\nwe can see that the feature combinations yield 4.5% im-\nprovement absolute. Comparing line 10 to line 8, we can\nconclude that using audio information yields about 2%\nof absolute improvement, which shows the importance\nof modeling the acoustics as an additional information\nsource, even if the audio features are relatively weak in\nisolation (see lines 4 and 5).\n# Type Experiment Accuracy\n1 Baseline 42.04\n2 Text NELA (title, description) 42.04\n3 Meta Numerical 50.35\n4 Audio i\u2013vectors 50.85\n5 Audio openSMILE 56.63\n6 Text BERT (captions) 64.64\n7 Text BERT (title, description, tags) 68.91\n8 Combined Text + Meta 70.10\n9 Combined Text + Meta + i\u2013vectors 70.33\n10 Combined Text + Meta + Audio 72.02\n11 Combined Text + Meta + openSMILE 73.42\nTable 4: Evaluation results.\n3The NELA features performed even worse when extracted from the\ncaptions, going below the baseline. Thus we did not include this result\nin Table 4.\n6. Discussion\n6.1. Aggregation Strategies\nIn the above experiments, we were splitting the channels into\nvideos, and then the videos into episodes. Then, we were ex-\ntracting features from the episodes, which we were averaging\nto form feature vectors for the videos. Next, we were training a\nclassi\ufb01er and we were making predictions at the video level us-\ning distant supervision, i.e., assuming each video has the same\nbias as the Youtube channel it came from. Finally, we were\naggregating, i.e., averaging, the posterior probabilities for the\nvideos from the same channel to make a prediction for the bias\nof that channel. Two natural questions arise about this setup:\n(i) Why not perform the classi\ufb01cation at the episode level and\nthen aggregate the posteriors from the classi\ufb01cation for episodes\nrather than for videos ? (ii) Why not use a different aggregation\nstrategy to perform the aggregation of the predictions, e.g., why\nnot try maximum instead of average ?\nTo answer these questions, we performed an ablation study\nfor all our experiments trying classi\ufb01cation at the episode vs.\nthevideo level, and aggregation using maximum vs.average . A\npotential advantage of using maximum is that it could be more\nsensitive to stromg signal coming from a single episode; how-\never, it could also turn out to be too sensitive to a single episode.\nA possible advantage of classifying at the episode level is that\nthere would be more training data; however, episodes are short,\nand thus it is harder to make clasi\ufb01cation at that level. Even-\ntually, we found that the original strategy of classifying at the\nvideo level and aggregating using average performed best.\nTable 5 illustrates this as an ablation for our best result from\nTable 4. We can see from Table 5 that using maximum for ag-\ngregating the posteriors performs worse than using average . We\nfurther see that classifying at the video level is better than clas-\nsifying at the episode level (if we use average for aggregation).\nWe can further see that our choice was better than the other three\nalternatives.\n# Level Aggregation Accuracy\n1 Video Average 73.42\n2 Video Maximum 67.94\n3 Episodes Average 72.02\n4 Episodes Maximum 71.27\nTable 5: Results for different basic classi\ufb01cation levels and for\ndifferent kinds of aggregation.\n6.2. Impact of i\u2013vectors and openSMILE Features\nNext, we looked into why openSMILE worked better than\ni\u2013vesctors. In Table 3, we can see that there are 600 i-\nvector features and 385 features generated from openSMILE\u2019s\nIS09 emotion con\ufb01guration (explained in section 3). Thus, one\npossible explanation is that i\u2013vectors simply have more fea-\ntures, and we do not have enough training data to make use\nof so many features.\nThe difference could be also due to openSMILE focusing\non representing the emotions in a target speech episode, while\ni\u2013vectors retrieve general feature characteristics from a target\nepisode, and thus should be expected to be of limited utility for\nour task.7. Conclusion and Future Work\nWe have addressed the problem of predicting the leading po-\nlitical ideology, i.e., left-center-right bias, for YouTube chan-\nnels of news media. Previous work on the problem has focused\nexclusively on by printed and online text media, and on anal-\nysis of the language used, topics discussed, sentiment, and the\nlike. In contrast, here we studied videos, which yielded an inter-\nesting multimodal setup, where we have textual, acoustic, and\nmetadata information (and also video, which can be analyzed\nin future work). We crawled more than 1,000 YouTube hours\nalong with the corresponding subtitles and metadata, thus pro-\nducing a new multimodal dataset. We further developed a mul-\ntimodal deep-learning neural network architecture for the task.\nThis model achieved very sizable improvements over the base-\nline: accuracy of 73.42% (baseline: 42.04%). Our analysis has\nshown that the use of acoustic signal helped to improve bias de-\ntection by more than 6% absolute over using text and metadata\nonly. We release the dataset to the research community, hoping\nto help advance the \ufb01eld of multi-modal political bias detection.\nIn future work, we plan to increase the size of the dataset in\nterms of processed volume. Currently, we have around 3,300\nvideos, and we plan to expand the data by several thousand\nmore videos, aiming at 3,000-5,000 videos per class. We fur-\nther plan to move to 5-way or 7-way classi\ufb01cation by adding\nthecenter-left and the center-right labels, and possibly also\nextreme-left and extreme-right . Another direction for future\nwork is better modeling of the audio features: we plan further\nexperiments with i\u2013vectors, trying various openSMILE con\ufb01g-\nurations, and trying custom neural network architectures to ex-\ntract better task-speci\ufb01c acoustic features. We further want to\nadd features from the video itself, features from image analysis\nof the thumbnails, as well as social information from the com-\nments in the Youtube forum below the target video. Last but not\nleast, we want to develop end-to-end training in a single neural\nnetwork.\n8. Contribution\nThe dataset we created can be found on Kaggle4. We further\nopen-sourced our code for the experiments described in this pa-\nper, and it can be found on GitHub5. The GitHub repository\ncontains additional information about our experimental setup\nand the packages used.\n9.

Ever since Russian trolls were brought to \nlight during the 2016 US Presidential elections, the influence of trolls has been studied in Computer \nScience and other fields. However, there is no clear \ndefinition of what a troll is. Most authors assume that it is obvious and their meaning of the word troll can \nonly be inferred from their treatment of the subject. \nMojica\u2019s use of the word \u201ctroll\u201d focuses on determining the intentions of the user (Mojica, 2016), \nwhether the user is attempting to keep their intention \nhidden, how the posts were interpreted by other users, and what the reactions are to specific posts. Kumar et \nal. (Kumar, 2014) use the term \"trolling\" when a user \nposts and spreads information that is deceptive, inaccurate, or outright rude. The authors developed an \nalgorithm called TIA, Troll Identification Algorithm, \nin order to classify such users as malicious or benign. \nKumar\u2019s study is more focused on the integrity of the \nnetwork that the trolls are working on. Thus, anyone who posts information that is incorrect may be a troll, \nunlike in (Mojica, 2016), where the intentions of a user are the focus. In addition, if non-troll users make \nnegative comments or posts, they are also considered trolls. The decision for being classified as a troll is not \nonly based on the users' own posts, but also on the \nresponses. \nI n  o u r  w o r k ,  w e  f o c u s  o n  a  s u b c l a s s  o f  t r o l l s  \ndefined by their domain, namely \u201cpolitical trolls\u201d that \nhave nefarious intentions. We use machine learning algorithms to identify Russ ian troll tweets. More \nspecifically, we employ known Russian troll tweets \n(Fivethirtyeight, Roeder, 2018) to build classification models that classify any tweet as either being from a \nRussian troll or not. An initial review indicated that \nnot all Russian trolls are of the same kind. Specifically, we discovered that some of the trolls \nindicate a \u201cleft\u201d political orientation, while other \ntrolls appear to be politically at the right end of the spectrum. Therefore, after building a machine \nlearning model that distinguishes between troll and \nnon-troll tweets we built another model that separates \nleft trolls  from right trolls . Figure 1 shows the overall \nprocess flow. The box marked as Troll Classifier is the result of running a machine learning model on \ndata that was already classified by humans. Similarly, \nthe Political Bias Classifier model has been developed to detect the political bias towards \u201cleft\u201d or 334\nChun, S., Holowczak, R., Dharan, K., Wang, R., Basu, S. and Geller, J.\nDetecting Political Bias Trolls in Twitter Data.\nDOI: 10.5220/0008350303340342\nInProceedings of the 15th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies (WEBIST 2019) , pages 334-342\nISBN: 978-989-758-386-5\nCopyright c/circlecopyrt2021 by SCITEPRESS \u2013 Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

To analyze \nwhether trolls have a political bias toward one or the \nother political affiliation, we use a two-step analysis. We first identify a tweet as coming from a troll or not, \nusing the troll classifier and then further predict \nwhether it expresses a right or left bias. \n \nFigure 1: Political Bias Tr oll Detection Framework. \n2 DATASETS  \nTwitter data has been widely used in many text \nmining projects. Unlike other social media platforms, \ntweets are public and easy to retrieve from Twitter. \nTwitter has APIs that help users to retrieve data in a \nmethodological way, e.g., for a specific geographic region, a specific timeframe, etc. One can fetch data \nfrom a targeted set of users as well. \nFor building our troll model and the political bias \ndetection model, we used a dataset published by an \nonline news portal called FiveThirtyEight  ( R o e d e r ,  \n2018). This dataset contains roughly 3 million tweets that Twitter concluded were associated with the \n\u201cInternet Research Agency (IRA).\u201d The IRA is a \ncompany paid by the Russian government to sow disinformation (Wikipedia, 2019). The data is \ncompletely open source licensed and includes \n2,973,371 tweets from 2,848 Twitter handles. It includes every tweet\u2019s author, text and date; the \nauthor\u2019s follower count and the number of accounts \nthe author followed; and an indication of whether the tweet was a retweet. Author s are not real names, but \nfabricated personas. We call this data table the \nRussian Troll dataset, where each tweet is considered \nto be from a troll.  \nEvery tweet in the data is also labeled with an \n\u201caccount_type\u201d that shows whether the tweet indicates a left or right political orientation. Many \ntweets are written in the Russian language. These \ntweets have an \u201caccount_type\u201d Russian, which we did not consider as part of our dataset.  There are over \n1.538K tweets identified as \u201cright\u201d and \napproximately 890K as having a \u201cleft\u201d political bias.   \nIn the first step of preprocessing, we removed \nURLs. We also removed Twitter handles that \nappeared to be irrelevant to the classification, and we removed Non-ASCII characters from the tweets, \nusing the \u2018Pandas\u2019 package of Python (McKinney, \n2017; https://pandas.pydata.org). \n3 TROLL CLASSIFICATION \nMODELS \nThe training of the troll vs. non-troll and right troll vs. \nleft troll classifiers was performed using different \nmachine learning approaches to compare their performances. For all the machine learning \na l g o r i t h m s  t h a t  w e  a r e  u s i n g ,  t o  d e r i v e  a  c l a s s i f i e r ,  \npositive and negative instances are necessary. The positive instances are constituted by the Russian Troll \ndataset . However, we needed to generate a negative \n(i.e. non-troll) data set of the same size. For this we \nfetched 3 million random tweets from several Twitter \nfeed sites (e.g., http://followthehashtag.com/datasets/ free-twitter-dataset-usa-200 000-free-usa-tweets/) \nand the Tweepy API (Roesslein, 2019) to fetch real \ntime tweets. We labeled this dataset as \u201cnon-troll,\u201d hence, we will call it Non-Troll dataset .  \nUnfortunately, it was impossible to ascertain that \nevery one of these 3 million random tweets is not a troll tweet, thus, the training data may contain some \nerrors. Given the very large number of tweets posted \nevery day (estimated at 500 million), the negative effect should be limited.   \nTable 1: Sample Troll and Non-Troll Tweets. \nLabel Text \n1 (troll) a.

The Support Vector Machine conceptually i m p l e m e n t s  t h e  f o l l o w i n g  i d e a :  i n p u t  v e c t o r s  a r e  \n(non-linearly) mapped to a  very high-dimensional \nfeature space. SVM has been proven effective for many text categor ization tasks.  \nIn SVMs, we try to find a hyperplane in an N-\ndimensional space that can be used to separate the data points with two different classifications. \n\u201cSupport Vectors\u201d define those points in the data set \nthat affect the position of the hyperplane. These are \nthe data points nearest to the hyperplane on both \nsides.  Usually, there are several possible hyperplanes that can be used to classify a  dataset into two different \nclasses. The main objective of the SVM algorithm is \nto find a hyperplane with the maximum margin between the data points. This ensures that when this \nmodel is used to classify new data points, it is likely \nto classify them correctly.  It requires input data \nrepresented as multi-di mensional vectors.  \nData Preprocessing a nd Representation:  Besides \nthe steps described in Section 2, we deleted emoticons from our dataset, since we are not taking them into \nconsideration for building the model. For methods of \nusing emoticons in sentiment analysis, see, e.g., (Bakliwal, 2012) and our previous work (Ji, 2015). \nAs the next step, we applied stemming to the \ndataset, using the Porter Stemmer (Porter, 2006).  \nTo construct one input data model, we used a \nTerm Frequency\u200a\u2014\u200aInverse Document Frequency (tf-\nidf) vectorizer to convert th e raw text data into matrix features. By combining tf and idf, we computed a tf-\nidf score for every word in each document in the \ncorpus. This score was used to estimate the significance of each word for a document, which \nhelps with classifying tweets. \nSVM Classification Model:  We built the SVM \nmodel using the FiveThirtyEight dataset. The stored \nmodel can be called later for classification of new \ndata.  We used the SVM scikit-learn implementation named SVC (Support Vector Classification). It is an \nimplementation based on libsvm (Chang, 2001).   \nIn this text categorization problem, we made use \nof a linear SVM classifier with the regularization \nparameter, C = 0.1. The regularization parameter is \nused to control the trade-off between misclassifications and efficiency. The higher C is, the \nfewer misclassifications are  allowed, but training gets \nslower. In our case, since our regularization parameter is very small,  misclassifications are \nallowed, but training is relatively faster. As this \ndataset is very large,  this was necessary.  \nWe use a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for \nour SVM model as the set of unique words in our data set presents a high dimensional vector space (Albon, \n2017).  \n3.2 Neural Network Classifier with \nOne-hot Encoding \nData Representation:  There are two popular ways of \nrepresenting natural language sentences: vector \nembeddings and one-hot matrices. One-hot matrices \ncontain no linguistic information. They indicate whether words occur in a document (or a sentence) \nbut suggest nothing about its frequency, or itsr \nrelationships to other words. The creation of one-hot matrices begins with tokenizing the sentence, that is, \nbreaking it into words. Then we created a lookup \ndictionary of all the unique words/tokens, which need not have a count or an order. Essentially, every word \nis presented by a position/index  in a very long vector. \nThe vector component at that position is set to 1 if the word appears. All other components in the vector are \nset to 0. For example, in a dictionary that contains \nonly seven words, the first word would be represented \nby [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the second by [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, \n0], etc. Each vector is of the length of the dictionary (in our case 3000 words), and vectors are stored as \nPython arrays. A whole  sentence needs to be \nrepresented by a 2-dimensional matrix. Neural Network Classifier:  For comparison with \nSVM, we first built a sequential classifier, which is a \nsimple neural network model that consists of a stack of hidden layers that are executed in a specific order. WEBIST 2019 - 15th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n336\n\nW e  u s e d  o n e  d e n s e  l a y e r  a n d  t w o  d r o p o u t  l a y e r s .   \nDense neural network layers are linear neural network \nlayers that are fully connected. In general, in a dense layer, every input is connected to every output by a \nweight. A dense layer is usually followed by a non-\nlinear activation function. Dropouts are randomly used to remove data, to prevent overfitting.  \nActivation functions of a node compute the output \nof that node, when given any specific input or set of inputs. The output of the activation function is then \nused as the input for the ne xt layer. Some of the most \ncommon activation functions are ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, SoftMax and Logistic \nfunction. In our first input layer, we made use of the \nReLU activation function and 512 outputs come out of that layer. Our second layer, which is a hidden \nlayer, consisted of a Sigmoid activation function with \n256 outputs. Our output layer, consisted of SoftMax activation functions. This configuration was the result \nof a number of preliminary experiments and achieved \nthe best classifier performance. \nWe made use of a categorical crossentropy loss \nfunction. This loss function is also called the SoftMax loss function. It measures the performance of a \nclassification model, whose output is a probability \nvalue between 0 and 1. \n \nWe used small batch sizes of 32 sentences to train \nour model so that we could check its accuracy. \nSmaller batches make it faster and easier to train a model with a large dataset. We ran the algorithm for \nfive epochs while training, where epochs measure the \nnumber of times the machine learning program goes through the entire dataset during training. We \nobserved that six epochs led to overfitting, hence we \nreverted to five epochs.  We implemented the Neural Network model using keras (Chollet, 2015) with \nTensorflow (Tensorflow, 2017) backend, which has \nits own loss function and optimization function for computing the accura cy and loss.   \nAfter the model was constructed, it was saved in \ntwo parts. One part contains the model\u2019s structure, the \nother part consists of the model\u2019s weights. The model \ncan then be used for predicting categories of tweets on a new dataset. Results will be shown in Section 4. \n3.3 CNN Neural Network Classifier \nwith Word2vec Representation \nData Representation:  Vector embeddings are spatial \nmappings of words or phrases onto a vector. In a vector embedding a word is represented by more than \none bit set to 1. Similar patterns of 1s suggest \nsemantic relationships between words\u2014 for instance, vector embeddings can be used to generate analogies. An important vector embedding method is Word2vec \n(Le & Mikolov, 2014). \nWord2vec can be constructed and trained to \ncreate word embeddings for entire documents. \nWord2vec can group vect ors of similar words \ntogether into a vector space. With enough data, W o r d 2 v e c  m o d e l s  c a n  c o n s t r a i n  t h e  m e a n i n g  o f  a  \nword using past appearances. The output of a \nWord2vec model is a vocabulary where each item has a vector attached to it, which can be used to query for \nrelationships between words.   \nFor building our classifi ers, we used an existing \nWord2vec model, by the name of \u201cGoogle \nWord2Vec\u201d (Skymind, 2019 ). It is a huge model \ncreated by Google, which comprises a vocabulary of about 3 million words and phrases. It was trained on \na Google news dataset of roughly 100 billion words. \nThe length of the vectors is set to 300 features.  \nSince the Word2vec representation of 3 million \nwords and phrases was unnecessarily large, we cut it \ndown to around 20,000 words, by computing the \nintersection between words in our dataset and the \nWord2vec model. Our embedding dimension is equivalent to the length of the vectors, which is 300.   \nCNN Classifier:  Convolutional Neural Networks \n(CNNs) (LeCun, 1995) are a supervised machine l e a r n i n g  a l g o r i t h m ,  w h i c h  i s  m a i n l y  u s e d  f o r  \nclassification and regression. CNNs usually require \nvery little preprocessing as compared to other neural networks. Though CNNs were invented for analyzing \nvisual imagery, they have been shown to be effective \nin other areas, including in Natural Language P r o c e s s i n g  ( K i m ,  2 0 1 4 ) .  A  C N N  c o n s i s t s  o f  i n p u t ,  \noutput and multiple hidden layers. The intermediate \nlayers, which are the hi dden layers, generally \ncomprise convolutional layers.  \nWe used three convolutional layers other than the \ninput and the output layers, and we used ReLU as the activation function for all of them. The three \nsequences have the same number of filters, which is \nequivalent to the total number of data points in the \ntraining data. The filter sizes for the three \nconvolutional layers were 3, 4 and 5 respectively. The activation function in the final output dense layer is \nSoftMax, and the number of word embeddings is \naround 20,000. \nWe developed CNN models with both described \ndata representations, one-hot encoding and \nWord2Vec encoding.  We trained the CNN models over 10 epochs. We ran our model using keras with \nTensorflow backend. \n  \n Detecting Political Bias Trolls in Twitter Data\n337\n\n3.4 State-of-the-Art NLP Model BERT \nBERT (Bidirectional Encoding Representations from \nTransformers) (Devlin e t al. 2019) applies \nbidirectional training of \u201ctransformers\u201d to language \nmodelling. A transformer is used for converting a sequence using an encoder and a decoder into another \nsequence. BERT is the first deeply bidirectional \nmodel and relies on a language learning process that is unsupervised. It has been pre-trained using only a \nplain Wikipedia text corpus.  \nIn a context-free model, the system generates a \nsingle word embedding repr esentation for each word \nin the vocabulary, whereas previous contextual \nmodels generated a representation of each word that is based on other words in the sentence. However, this \nwas done only in one direction. BERT uses a \nbidirectional contextual representation that is, it uses both the previous and next context in a sentence \nbefore or after a wo rd respectively.  \nWe made use of the BERT-base, Multilingual \nCased model with 12 layers; 768 is the size of the \nhidden encoder and pooling layers and in all there are 110 Million parameters. A Cased model preserves the \ntrue upper and lower cas e (cased words) and the \naccent markers. Thus \u201cbush\u201d (the shrub) is different from \u201cBush\u201d (the president). We trained our model \nfor three epochs with a bat ch size of 32 and sequence \nlength of 512. The learning rate was 0.00002. As before we used keras with Tensorflow.  \nThe max_position embedding was set to 512, \nwhich is the maximum sequence length. That means that a specific tweet can have a maximum length of \n512 characters. Everything beyond 512 characters is \nignored. The num_attention_heads parameter was set to 12, which is the 12-head attention mechanism. In \nthis mechanism, the vector is split into 12 chunks, \neach having a dimension of 512/12 = 42 (42.666\u2026) and the algorithm uses these chunks for each attention \nlayer in the Transformer encoder. Exhaustive \nexperiments with these hyperparameters is practically \nimpossible, but the chosen parameters provided the \nrelatively best results in our experiments.  \nWe made use of an Adam optimizer, which is the \ndefault optimizer for BERT. Adam is an alternative to \nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is used to update network weights iteratively when training \nwith data. A learning rate is maintained for each \nnetwork weight (parameter) and separately adapted as learning unfolds. The model was saved for future use \nfor classification and was also evaluated.  \n  \n 3.5 Political Bias Classifiers \nTo classify the political orientation of tweets, we \ntrained the corresponding models described in \nSections 3.1\u20143.4, based on the Russian Troll dataset.  The Russian Troll dataset has a field labeled \u201caccount_type\u201d with the po litical bias or orientation \nvalues of left or right (among others).  \nThe right and left political orientation data \ndistribution in the Russian Troll dataset used for \ntraining and testing is as follows: Right: 1,538,146; \nLeft: 890,354.  The SVM, Fully Connected NN, and CNN models and the BERT-encoded CNN model \nwere used to classify the left and right political bias \nin a tweet.   \n4 RESULTS \n4.1 Political Bias Troll Detection \nModels \nTable 3 compares the accuracy, precision and recall \nscores for the troll detection and political bias detection models.  It shows that the neural network \nmodels (fully connected NN and CNN models) \nperformed worse than the base SVM model.  On the other hand, the BERT model outperformed all other \nmodels with an accuracy level of 99%, and with \nprecision and recall levels of 98% and 99% respectively.   \nTable 3: Comparing the accura cy, precision and recall of \nfive Machine Learning Models. \nModel \nTypeClassifier Type Accuracy  Precision Recall \nSVM \nModel Troll Detector  84% 85% 86% \nPolitical Bias \nDetecto r86% 88% 91% \nNN with One-hot Encoding Troll Detector 74% 76% 76% \nPolitical Bias \nDetecto r84% 88% 90% \nCNN with One-hot Encoding Troll Detector  74% 78% 81% \nPolitical Bias \nDetector 84% 85% 86% \nCNN with \nWord2-vec  Troll Detector  56% - - \nPolitical Bias \nDetecto r85% - - \nBERT model Troll Detector  99% 98% 99% \nPolitical Bias \nDetecto r89% 89% 90% \nAn important drawback of one-hot encoding is that it \nincreases the length of the data vectors. We used only the 3000 most commonly occurring words in the WEBIST 2019 - 15th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n338\n\ntraining corpus, and hence each one-hot vector is of \ndimension 3000.  The performance of CNN with the \nWord2vec model is significantly lower than that of the SVM, NN or CNN with one-hot encoding models, \nwith an accuracy level of only 56%.   \nFor political bias classification experiments, the \naccuracy of SVM, 86%, was slightly better than NN \nor CNN with one-hot encoding and CNN with \nWord2Vec, with accuracies of 84%, 84% and 85%, respectively. However, the BERT-based \nclassification model again outperformed the others \nwith an accuracy level of 89%. \n4.1.1 Political Bias Troll Analysis in Tweets \nWe collected a new unique data set of tweets starting \nin October of 2016, just prior to the US election. An \ninitial set of 500 Twitter handles belonging to \u201cAlt-\nRight,\u201d \"Right,\u201d \u201cRight-Center,\u201d \u201cLeft-Center,\u201d and \u201cLeft\u201d biased magazines, web sites and personalities \nwas identified using data collected from the Media \nBias/Fact Check web site (Media Bias/Fact Check). The initial set of Twitter handles was thus labeled \nwith biases as follows: \nAlt-Right Bias: 103 twitter handles \nRight Bias: 133 twitter handles \nRight Center Bias:  77 twitter handles Left-Center Bias: 122 twitter handles \nLeft Bias: 65 twitter handles \nThe Alt-right bias media sources are often described as moderately to strongly biased toward conservative \ncauses, through story selection and/or political \naffiliation. They often use strong, \u201cloaded\u201d words to influence an audience by using appeals to emotion or \nstereotypes, publish misleading reports and omit \nreporting of information that may damage conservative causes. \nWe next identified followers of each of these \nTwitter handles (eliminating duplicates) and then proceeded to download their complete tweet histories, \nthus including tweets from many years back.  Each \ntweet was then labeled with the Twitter handle and political bias.  The results of the data collection \ninclude 1.6 billion tweets from 25 million unique \nTwitter handles.  Random samples of 1 million, 5 \nmillion and 20 million tweets were extracted to form \nthe data set for further ana lysis. We call these samples \nPolitical Bias datasets, and we applied our model to \nclassify them into trolls vs. non-trolls.  \nThe SVM models were used on the Political Bias \n1 million tweet dataset and the results are in Table 4.  \nAmong 1 million tweets, 730,215 are considered \ntrolls and among these, the right trolls (546,430) outnumber the 183,785 left trolls.  When the CNN neural network classification model with one-hot \nmatrices representation was applied to the 5 million \ntweets, over 3,586K tweets were classified as trolls.  Among these, the right troll set consisted of 2,553K \ntweets, outnumbering the left trolls (1,032K tweets), \nas shown in Table 4.  \nTable 4: Political Bias trolls  using SVM and CNN with one-\nhot encoding and two classifier models.  \n Tweet Type SVM  CNN \nSample datase t 1000000 5000000\nTroll Tweets 730215 3586213\nLeft Troll  Tweets 183785 1032422\nRight Troll Tweets 546430 2553791\nThus, 75% and 71% of all troll tweets were found to \nbe politically right tweets, compared to left tweets (25% and 29%) for the respective models.  \nWe applied the BERT-encoded CNN model for \nclassifying the 5 million tweet Political Bias  dataset \ninto troll vs. non-troll tweets.  The results show that \n3,598,898 (72%) were trolls and 1,401,102 (28%) \nwere non-trolls.  The breakdown of Political Bias \ntweets into trolls and non-tro lls is shown in Table 5.  \nTable 5: Political bi ases in non-troll twee ts and troll tweets \nusing BERT -CNN Cla ssification Model. \nNon-Trolls Trolls\nAltRi ght 530,990 2,013,935\nRight 31,897 64,533\nRightCente r 162,061 330,314\nNeutral 492,820 766,660\nLeftCente r 122,681 270,755\nLeft 60,653 152,701\nTable 6: Average Number of T roll tweets and % of Trolls \nby Political Bias of Unique Tweet handles. \nPoltical Biases # of \ntweethandlesAvg # of \nTroll tweets % of Trolls \nAltRight 541 1098 76% \nRight 29 530 2% \nRightCenter 78 789 8% \nNeutral 189 393 10% \nLeftCenter 43 595 3% \nLeft 37 180 1% \nGrand Total 917 844 100%\nWe identified 917 unique Twitter handles (users) that \nwere associated with trolls from the 1 million tweet machine-labeled dataset, a s shown in Table 6, using \nBERT classifiers. A much higher average number of \ntroll tweets (on average 1098 tweets per unique handle, 76% of all trolls) were associated with the 541 Detecting Political Bias Trolls in Twitter Data\n339\n\nunique Twitter handles with an alt-right bias, while  a \ntotal of 80 user accounts considered as left center or \nleft posted on average 595 (3%) and 180 (1%) troll tweets, respectively. \n4.2 Temporal Analysis \nWe performed a temporal pro gression analysis of left \nand right trolls after identifying trolls using the 5 \nmillion Political Bias sample dataset to understand how political bias troll tweets have changed over \ntime. Figure 2 shows the temporal analysis from 2004 \nto 2016.  In 2009, there was a notable peak of trolls, especially right-biased trolls. This coincides with the \nbeginning of Barak Obama\u2019s first presidency. \n4.3 Geospatial Analysis \nWe performed a geospatial analysis on 5 million \ntweets to locate the left and right troll tweets. In the dataset, only 133,801 tweets (2.7%) had geolocation \ninformation and 83,232 geolocated tweets were \nclassified as trolls. Table 7 shows the number of left and right troll tweets based on the geolocation data. \n \nFigure 2: Temporal Analysis on Political Bias Trolls: Blue \n= Left Trolls. Yellow = Right Trolls.  \nFigure 3 show the geospatial distribution of approx. \n50K right troll tweets. The distribution of left troll tweets is omitted due to space constraints. \nTable 7: Breakdown of tweet s containing geo location \ninformation from the 5 Million tweets dataset. \nTweet type (from 5 Million) Count\nTotal tweets with geolocation 133801\nTotal Troll Tweets with geolocation 83232\nRight Trolls with geolocation 50154\nLeft Troll with geolocation 33078\nThe total ratio of right to left troll tweets is 60:40 in \nJapan, South Korea and Thailand, where the right \ntroll tweets are more prominent. In the UK, the count of left troll tweets is significantly higher as compared \nto the right troll tweets. In the United States, the ratio \nof left to right troll tweets is 60:40. We also observe that the right troll tweets and left troll tweets are \nevenly distributed in most of the countries.  \n \nFigure 3: Geospatial distribut ion of Right troll tweets.  \n4.4 Sentiment Analysis on Political Bias \nDataset of Five Million Tweets \nSentiment analysis was performed for left and right \ntroll tweets to understand the emotional tone that \ntrolls used to influence people\u2019s minds. The sentiment analysis model was built using the Sentiment140 \ndataset (Sentiment140) \nFigure 4 illustrates the breakdown of sentiments \nof right troll tweets, which have been classified into \nfive different classes, namely neutral, positive, extremely positive, negativ e and extremely negative, \nbased on the data. Figure 5 shows the same \nbreakdown for left troll tweets. Figure 6 shows a side-by-side comparison. \n \n \nFigure 4: Sentiments of \nright bias trolls.  \nFigure 5: Sentiments of left bias trolls. \nThe sentiment analysis res ults show the following: \n\uf0b7 The ratio of positive, negative and neutral trolls \ndoes not vary much in either left or right troll \ntweets. \n\uf0b7 The number of negative tweets is slightly higher \nin right troll tweets by a count of around 7,000 \ntweets. \n\uf0b7 The number of positive tweets is slightly lower in \nright troll tweets by a count of 13,000 tweets. \nWEBIST 2019 - 15th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n340\n\n \nFigure 6: Sentiment analysis on right (in red) and left (blue) \ntroll tweets. \n5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE \nWORK \nIn this paper, we built several machine learning \nmodels to identify the political bias of trolls. The \nclassifiers for troll identif ication were developed with  \nthe Russian Troll dataset. The BERT-encoded \nclassification models had an accuracy of 89.4% for \nleft/right troll detector and 99% for troll/non-troll detector, which is higher than SVM, CNN with \nWord2vec and Neural Network with one-hot \nencoding. Using the troll detection and political bias detection models, we analyzed the large scale \nPolitical Bias datasets of varying sizes. There are \nmore Alt-right accounts/users associated with large numbers of troll tweets in the number of trolls and \ntotal proportion of trolls than left biased users. We \nalso presented geospatial, temporal and sentiment analyses. Sentiment analysis on the Political Bias \ntweets shows that there are slightly fewer positive \nright troll tweets compare d to left troll tweets. \nIn future work, we plan to develop a large-scale \nweb-based system that performs real time classification of political bias trolls to monitor the \ntrolls and their political biases and to perform the \ngeospatial and temporal analyses for identifying extreme political bias region s and time intervals.   We \na l s o  p l a n  t o  p e r f o r m  t r o l l  c o n t e n t s  a n a l y s e s  t o  \nunderstand the topics and topic categories of trolls of different political affiliations. Lastly, we want to \nextend our methods to other social networks, such as \nReddit, following work by Weller and Woo (2019). \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work is partially supported by NSF CNS 1747728 and 1624503, and by the National Research \nFoundation of Korea Grant NRF-2017S1A3A2066084 . \nIt is supported by PSC-CUNY Research Awards (Enhanced): ENHC-48-65. 2017-2018. \nThis research was supported, in part, by the City \nUniversity of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island \nfinanced in part by National Science Foundation \nGrants CNS0958379, CNS-0855217, ACI-1126113. \nREFERENCES \nMojica, L.

Unfortunately,\nprogress in this area is hampered by limited access to data due to\nthe closed nature of social media platforms. Consequently, prior\nstudies have been constrained to considering only fragments of\nusers\u2019 news exposure and reactions. To overcome this obstacle,\nwe present an innovative measurement approach centered on do-\nnating personal data for scientific purposes, facilitated through\na privacy-preserving tool that captures users\u2019 interactions with\nnews on Facebook. This approach offers a nuanced perspective\non users\u2019 news exposure and consumption, encompassing differ-\nent types of news exposure: selective, incidental, algorithmic, and\ntargeted, driven by the diverse underlying mechanisms governing\nnews appearance on users\u2019 feeds. Our analysis of data from 472\nparticipants based in the U.S. reveals several interesting findings.\nFor instance, users are more prone to encountering misinformation\nbecause of their active selection of low-quality news sources rather\nthan being exposed solely due to friends or platform algorithms.\nFurthermore, our study uncovers that users are open to engaging\nwith news sources with opposite political ideology as long as these\ninteractions are not visible to their immediate social circles. Over-\nall, our study showcases the viability of data donation as a means\nto provide clarity to longstanding questions in this field, offering\nnew perspectives on the intricate dynamics of social media news\nconsumption and its effects.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n\u2022Information systems \u2192Social networks; \u2022Human-centered\ncomputing\u2192Social media.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

Earlier, people had to search and actively select\nthe news sources they would like to read from, leading to selective\nexposure [20]. More recently, with the growing popularity of social\nmedia, news has started to appear on people\u2019s social media feeds as a\nbyproduct of their social relations (i.e., posts shared by friends) and\nrecommendation algorithms (i.e., posts recommended by the plat-\nforms). In this new media environment, people are unintentionally\nexposed to news during their diverse online interactions [ 30,59,61].\nA vast literature in both social and computer science has since\nstudied the impact of such incidental exposure on public discussion\nquality (abundance of fast, junk, or fake news) [ 21,22,57], and\nto which extent it may exacerbate political polarization and filter\nbubbles [ 31,38,47]. The findings are mixed with evidence sug-\ngesting both (a) incidental exposure leads to receiving information\nfrom a significantly narrower spectrum of sources compared to web\nsearch [ 37], and (b) social media users get exposed to significantly\nmore news sources than people who do not use social media at\nall [49]. While the topic has received wide attention, research has\nbeen hindered by the lack of access to data due to the closed nature of\nonline platforms \u2013 external researchers do not have access to what\nnews users see on social media. We tackle this limitation in this\nwork by proposing a measurement methodology that can provide a\ncomprehensive picture of users\u2019 news exposure on social media and\ncapture user interactions at a finer granularity.\nThe first contribution of our paper is to present a measurement\nmethodology based on donations of personal data for scientific re-\nsearch that allows us to study exposure and consumption of news on\nsocial media in a realistic and fine-grained manner. The key to this\nmethodology is to enable users to donate their data in an automated\n2371\n\nWWW \u201924, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore Salim Chouaki, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Oana Goga, and Savvas Zannettou\nand inconspicuous manner that does not disturb their regular ac-\ntivity. We enable this by building a monitoring tool CheckMyNews\nwhich is able to capture, in the background, all posts related to news\nthat appear in users\u2019 Facebook feeds, how users interact with them\n(e.g., share, click), and the news articles users read on news websites\noutside of Facebook. CheckMyNews ensures that data donations\nare pseudonymized and do not include any non-news private posts\nor data from friends. We posted about the tool and the surrounding\nconcept of data donation on Prolific [ 46]; 889 U.S. residents agreed\nto install our tool and keep it active for six weeks. For the analysis,\nwe filtered out users with minimal activity on Facebook, ending\nup with 472users exposed to 143,129 news posts during the data\ncollection period (November 2020 to February 2021).\nTo capture a wide range of news posts, we aggregated a list\nof over 12,000 U.S. news sources for our tool to monitor. We first\nconsult two independent news ecosystem auditors \u2013 Media Bias\nFact Check [ 33] and News Guard [ 36] \u2013 who list a total of 4,149\nnews domains. We further develop a method to discover an addi-\ntional 8,084 under-the-radar news sources not listed by journalistic\nauthorities but that claim to be news organizations on Facebook. To\nour knowledge, this is the most extensive compilation of U.S. outlets\nclaiming to be news organizations.\nThesecond contribution of the paper is to use the realistic andfine-\ngrained representation of users\u2019 news exposure and consumption\nto answer several longstanding questions about social media news\nthat have been only partially answered till now, due to the lack\nof access to data. First, we measure the political diversity of users\u2019\nnews diets on Facebook \u2013 how much they are exposed to a varied\npolitical spectrum. Second, we assess the quality of news users\nreceive and how prevalent misinformation is on their feeds. Finally,\nwe measure how users engage with news and the extent to which\nexposure to news transforms into real consumption.\nContrasting (some) previous works [ 10,49], we argue in this\npaper that we need to move beyond treating news exposure on\nsocial media as a whole, as there are different underlying mecha-\nnisms through which news appears on users\u2019 feeds. First, users can\nchoose to follow news outlets on Facebook, and as a result, they\nwill see posts from these outlets in their feeds. This constitutes a\nform of selective news exposure. Second, users can see news posts in\ntheir feeds because their friends or communities share them. This\nis classically considered as incidental news exposure. Third, some\nnews posts appear in users\u2019 feeds because the platform predicts that\nthe users might be interested in such posts based on their behavior.\nThese posts are labeled as \u201cSuggested for you\u201d posts on Facebook.\nWe call this algorithmic news exposure. And finally, much less real-\nized by the community, there is a fourth type \u2013 the targeted news\nexposure. Targeted news exposure is brought by the emergence\nof online advertising where self-interested third parties can pay ad\nplatforms to show specific news to particular groups of people.\nTo understand the impact of these different types of exposure,\nwe assess the diversity, quality, and consumption of news per un-\nderlying mechanisms and make the following observations:\n\u2022On average, 5.1%of news posts users encounter on Facebook\nare from sources known to post misinformation repeatedly. When\nexamining each category separately, we find that selective news\nexposure has the highest fraction (5 .8%) of posts from misinforma-\ntion sources, while targeted news exposure has the lowest fraction(2.5%). These results suggest that users are more likely to expose\nthemselves to sources known to spread misinformation than be\nexposed to them due to their friends or the platform\u2019s algorithms.\n\u2022Targeted, algorithmic, and incidental news exposures are signifi-\ncantly more politically balanced than selective exposure, indicating\nthat while users actively subscribe to news sources of the same\npolitical leaning, they get exposed to sources from the opposite\npolitical leaning through other mechanisms on Facebook.\nWe further analyze three types of interactions with news posts:\n(i)visible interactions like commenting, sharing, or liking a post\nthat are visible to other Facebook users, (ii) hidden interactions that\nare not visible to a user\u2019s friends, such as visiting the actual article\nor visiting the Facebook page of the publisher, and (iii) visibility\ntime that captures the time a post was visible on the user\u2019s screen.\n\u2022We find that users interact with only 5.1%of news posts they see\non Facebook (visible interactions on 2.6%and hidden interactions on\n2.8%of news posts). Users had both visible and hidden interactions\non<0.5%of posts. Interestingly, users accessed the landing URLs\nof only 14%of the news posts they shared. This indicates that users\nmostly limit themselves to reading the news post\u2019s text and/or images\nbefore sharing rather than reading the actual news article.\n\u2022While the fraction of visible interactions on selective and inci-\ndental news posts is close to the fraction of hidden interactions, the\nfraction of visible interactions on algorithmic and targeted news\nposts is 1.8 to 6 times lower than the fraction of hidden interactions.\nThis suggests that algorithmic and targeted exposure might have\nan inhibitory effect on users\u2019 willingness to share or comment on\nnews posts publicly.\n\u2022Finally, we observed more visible interactions on posts published\nby sources with a matching political ideology than the opposing\nideology of a user. For instance, Republicans interacted with 3.1%of\nposts from the right-leaning media vs. 1.8%from left-leaning ones;\nwhereas Democrats interacted with 3.9%of posts from left-leaning\nsources vs. 3.1%from right-leaning ones. Surprisingly, when it\ncomes to hidden interactions, we observed that both Republicans\nand Democrats interacted more with posts with opposing political\nideology. For example, Republicans interacted with 4.1%of posts\nfrom left-leaning sources vs. 2.3%from right-leaning media, while\nDemocrats interacted with 2.9%of posts from right-leaning sources\nvs.2.4%from left-leaning ones. This suggests that users are indeed\nwilling to engage with opposing views, albeit in a private manner.\nBesides answering multiple open questions in the literature re-\nlated to how users interact with news posts, our work shows that\ndata donations from social media users are both feasible and critical\nin uncovering the impact of current technologies on society, as\nwell as for the advancement of scientific research. Our codebase is\npublicly available to be audited and to encourage other researchers\nto build on this methodology.\nRelated Work. Prior works have attempted to reconstruct users\u2019\nnews exposure using computational [3,4] and survey-based meth-\nods[8,20,39]; but both approaches provide only an incomplete\npicture. For example, one computational approach suggests using a\nuser\u2019s public activities (e.g., all news articles they publicly shared\nor commented on Twitter or Facebook) to reconstruct their news\nexposure [ 3,11,22]. This approach introduces two kinds of biases.\n2372\nWhat News Do People Get on Social Media? Analyzing Exposure and Consumption of News through Data Donations WWW \u201924, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore\nFirst, it can only consider users who publicly share content, while\nprior studies have shown that only a small fraction of users take\nsuch explicit actions [ 60]. Second, it can only observe the content\nusers are comfortable sharing publicly. A newer computational\napproach consists of analyzing users\u2019 web browsing history (e.g.,\nthe news articles a user has clicked on) [ 6,23,24,27,32,40]. While\nthis approach addresses previously mentioned limitations, it still\nprovides data only on a subset of news articles users are exposed\nto (i.e., the ones they subsequently click on). Finally, Prior studies\nhave utilized browser extensions to gather data from Facebook\nfeeds [ 25,26,34]. However, these works operated with limited user\nprofiles created for the study\u2019s purposes, thereby providing a con-\ntrolled experimental environment. We tackle these limitations in\nthis work by adopting a measurement methodology based on data\ndonation from real users, providing a comprehensive picture of the\nnews landscape on social media.\n2 METHODOLOGY AND DATASET\nOur measurement methodology consists of building a non-intrusive\ntool enabling people to donate data about the news content they see\non Facebook. In this section, we describe the design and technical\nconsiderations of the measurement infrastructure.\n2.1 Monitoring tool\nTo enable users to donate data about the content they encounter,\nin a manner that does not disturb their regular activity, we imple-\nmented CheckMyNews, a privacy-preserving browser extension for\nGoogle Chrome that automatically collects, in the background, data\nabout the content users see when browsing Facebook. The browser\nextension collects the following information from users:\ni.News posts: CheckMyNews collects posts related to news. To\ndetect these posts, we compiled an extensive list of over 12,000 news\noutlets and the Facebook pages with which they are associated (see\nSection 2.2 for details). We consider a Facebook post as a news post\nif: (a) it was published by a page from our list of Facebook pages or\n(b) the landing URL of the post points to one of the news outlets\nwe have in our list. A news post can be published or shared by the\nFacebook page of a news outlet or a random Facebook profile or\npage. A news post can be private (only a limited group of users can\nsee it) or public (all users can see it). CheckMyNews collects the\ntext, the media (e.g., image), the publisher, and the landing URL if\nthe news post is public. On the contrary, if the news post is private,\nCheckMyNews only collects the landing URL and a hashed version\nof the publisher\u2019s username to keep it pseudonymous.\nii.Other posts: To evaluate the coverage of our list of news outlets\nand extend it, upon user permission, CheckMyNews can collect\nthenon-news public andnon-news targeted posts users see in their\nfeeds. This data is also useful to calculate the proportion of news\nposts among all the posts received by users, and compare how users\ninteract with news posts vs. other posts. Note that CheckMyNews\ndoes not collect any private non-news posts (see Appendix A.1).\niii.Visibility time of posts: CheckMyNews collects how much time\neach Facebook post was visible on the user\u2019s screen. For this, we\ncheck what post is visible on the user\u2019s screen every 0.5seconds,\nand we start a time counter each time a new post becomes visible.\nThe timer counts as long as more than 30%of the post is still visible.iv.Interactions with posts: CheckMyNews collects both visible and\nhidden interactions of users with all the collected posts. The visible\ninteractions are actions such as whether the user liked, disliked,\ncommented, or shared a post. The hidden interactions are actions\nsuch as visiting the landing URL of the post, clicking on one of the\nimages of the post, or checking who is the publisher of the post by\nvisiting their Facebook profile. The hidden interactions are invisible\nto friends, while visible interactions are visible to friends.\nv.Survey data: CheckMyNews has an option to send surveys to\nthe user panel. It allowed us to request the participants to volun-\ntarily disclose their demographic information, such as, gender and\npolitical affiliations (Democrat, Republican, or Independent).\nCheckMyNews identifies users using hashed versions of their\nFacebook IDs; their PIIs, such as names, usernames, or emails, are\nnever sent to our servers. Overall, we have collected the news\nposts, their visibility time, and how users interact with them. To our\nknowledge, none of the prior works have looked at such granular in-\nformation. This is partly due to the difficulty of collecting such data\nas Facebook changes its HTML markup, sometimes adversarially,\nto disturb data collections from tools such as ours [ 7]. We devoted\nconsiderable time to developing a monitoring tool that can enable\nreliable data donation (see Appendix A.2 for more details). Our code\nis available at: https://github.com/CHOUAKIsalim/CheckMyNews\n2.2 Extended lists of news outlets\nThe list of news outlets we monitor determines the breadth of our\nview of news posts that users are exposed to and consume. To have\na comprehensive view, we need an extensive list of news outlets to\nmonitor. However, most previous studies have only monitored a lim-\nited number of traditional news media [ 24,31,49], and the research\ncommunity lacks a comprehensive list of outlets active on social\nmedia. To overcome the limitation, we employ three approaches.\nFirst, we rely on News Guard and Media Bias Fact Check, two\nindependent data providers that survey news outlets and provide\nqualitative information about them (e.g., political leaning, quality).\nNews Guard contains 2,939 news sites, while Media Bias Fact Check\ncontains 2,062 news sites. We call the aggregate list of 4,149 news\noutlets the Established News Sites list. For every news outlet,\nwe also collected the corresponding Facebook page. Overall, we\nhave a list of 4,323 Facebook pages corresponding to the established\nnews domains, which we call Established Facebook Pages list.\nWe know from recent reports that there is an emergence of sites\nthat claim to be news organizations [ 44]. Hence, it is essential to\ngo beyond established media sites and consider news outlets that\nsimply claim to be news media, irrespective of their reputation,\npopularity, or whether they create original content or are simply\ncontent farms. We refer to these sites as under-the-radar news out-\nlets, and we hypothesize that some use Facebook to advertise their\ncontent, as they probably have a small organic reach. Hence, our\nsecond approach consists of grabbing from the Facebook Ad Li-\nbrary [ 18] all pages that promoted a political ad in the U.S. between\nJune 2018 and June 2020 and claim to be \u201cNews Media.\u201d Then, for\nevery page, we extract the website mentioned in the \u201cAbout\u201d page.\nWe could gather 8,084 websites for 9,679 different pages. Hence, this\nmethod provides us with a significant number of sites that News\nGuard and Media Bias Fact Check have not reviewed.\n2373\nWWW \u201924, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore Salim Chouaki, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Oana Goga, and Savvas Zannettou\nThird, as mentioned earlier, CheckMyNews can collect the tar-\ngeted and public posts on users\u2019 feeds. Most of these posts come\nfrom Facebook pages. Hence, we select all Facebook pages that\nclaim to be \u201cNews Media\u201d in their \u201cAbout\u201d section and extract the\nnews domain if they mention it. This method gave us 404additional\nnews domains associated with 449Facebook pages.\nIn total, our list of under-the-radar news media sites (collected\nwith the second and third methods) contains 8,489 different do-\nmains associated with 10,128 different Facebook pages. We call\nthe corresponding lists the Under-the-Radar News Sites list\nand the Under-the-Radar Facebook Pages list. Overall, our list\nof news media websites contains 12,638 different news domains\nand 14,451 Facebook pages. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe most extensive list of (both established and under-the-radar)\nnews domains in the US. The list is available at https://github.com/\nCHOUAKIsalim/US_News_Outlets_Dataset.\n2.3 Ethical considerations\nCheckMyNews collects sensitive data from the study\u2019s participants.\nBefore collecting any data, we obtained the necessary approvals\nfrom the Data Protection Officers and the Ethical Review Board of\nour institution and the participants\u2019 explicit consent. Additionally,\nwe use various strategies to minimize security and privacy risks\nfor the participants, and we comply with the EU General Data\nProtection Regulation. We provide more details in Appendix A.3.\n2.4 User recruitment and dataset\nWe posted about the tool and the surrounding concept of data\ndonation on Prolific, and 889 users living in the U.S. agreed to\ninstall CheckMyNews on the computer they use to connect to\nFacebook and keep it active for six weeks (between November 2,\n2020, and February 15, 2021, centered around the U.S. presidential\nelections). We tried to reach out to Prolific users across various\nU.S. states and ethnicities. We provide a detailed breakdown of age,\nlocation, ethnicity, and political affiliation in Appendix B.2. Some\nusers dropped out from the study and uninstalled the extension in\nbetween (see Appendix B.1). Hence, our analysis focuses on data\nfrom 472users who spent at least 30minutes browsing Facebook\nor received more than ten news posts in their feeds. We found\nthat all 472users had typical browsing activity on Facebook, with\na reasonable number of posts with respect to the time spent on\nFacebook. Hence, it is unlikely that any of these users are bots\nbrowsing on Facebook (see Appendix C.2).\nOur dataset contains 143,129 news posts. For each user, on aver-\nage, we collected 303news posts ( \ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b)=57,\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc51)=789)\nand 6news posts per active day ( \ud835\udc40=3,\ud835\udc60=10). Moreover, we have\ncollected a total of 8,612 user interactions with 5,386 different news\nposts. Each user interacted on average with 18posts (\ud835\udc40=2,\ud835\udc60=60).\n(see Appendix C.1 for more statistics).\n2.5 Limitations\nDespite our best efforts, our data collection methodology has two\nmain limitations. First, our monitoring tool cannot capture news\nexposure and consumption on users\u2019 mobile phones. Sadly, provid-\ning such a tool for mobile phones is technically very challenging.\nSecond, since the study requires the collection of personal data from\nusers, understandably, many users are uncomfortable with donat-\ning data, and thus, they would be reluctant to install a monitoring\nT argeted\n news postsSelective\n news postsIncidental\n news postsAlgorithmic\n news posts020406080100Proportion of posts (%)\nFigure 1: The distribution of the proportion of selective, in-\ncidental, targeted, and algorithmic news posts received by\neach user in our dataset.\ntool. This makes it challenging to obtain a large and representative\nsample of users. Despite the limitations, we believe that the com-\npiled dataset goes much beyond previously compiled datasets in\nterms of comprehensiveness and detail, and provides much-needed\nanswers to several long-standing questions in the community.\n3 WHAT NEWS DO PEOPLE GET ON SOCIAL\nMEDIA?\nThis section attempts to answer longstanding questions about the\nexposure and consumption of news that appear on users\u2019 social me-\ndia feeds. We answer these questions by examining the underlying\nmechanisms responsible for news appearing in users\u2019 feeds.\n3.1 Types of Social Media News Exposure\nPrior works have looked at exposure to news in social media in silos.\nFew works have focused on incidental exposure [ 20,49,56], while\nothers on selective exposure [ 10]. For instance, [ 20,56] considered\nthat incidental exposure consists of all news users encounter on\nsearch engines or social media platforms when they use them for a\npurpose different than seeking news; whereas [ 10,35] considered\nthat all tweets a user potentially receives are selective news. Both\ninterpretations are justifiable, even if they seem contradictory.\nWe argue, however, that we need to differentiate social media\nexposure based on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the\nnews appearing in users\u2019 feeds, especially if we want to characterize\nthe consumption pattern and the quality and diversity of news.\nSuch a systematic perspective allows a better understanding of root\ncauses and finding potentially better technological and algorithmic\ndesigns. We identify the following four mechanisms through which\nnews posts (and posts in general) can appear on users\u2019 feeds.\nA. Selective news exposure: On Facebook, users can follow or\nlike the pages of their preferred news outlets. This enables them to\nreceive posts published by these pages in their feeds. If a user no\nlonger wants to receive such content from a page, they can unfollow\nit. Hence, they control which posts from which news outlets appear\nin their feeds \u2013 this is a form of selective news exposure.\nB. Targeted news exposure: Advertisers can pay the Facebook ad\nplatform to show specific content in the feeds of users who satisfy\ndistinct characteristics (i.e., targeting criteria). While most of the\nads users see are for commercial products, these targeting mech-\nanisms are increasingly being used for political propaganda [ 28]\nand propagating news items. For example, an advertiser can pay\nFacebook to show ads containing links to a specific news article to\n2374\nWhat News Do People Get on Social Media? Analyzing Exposure and Consumption of News through Data Donations WWW \u201924, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore\nan audience \u201cinterested in climate change, living in San Francisco.\u201d\nThese news posts appear in users\u2019 feeds because advertisers want\nthem. Advertisers on Facebook can utilize 250\ud835\udc3e+attributes to de-\nfine their audiences, which allows them to expose people with very\nprecise interests to particular news stories [1].\nC. Algorithmic news exposure: Facebook users receive \u201cSug-\ngested for You\u201d posts on their feeds. These are personalized posts\nthat Facebook\u2019s algorithms determine to be relevant for users, pri-\nmarily based on their previous engagement and behavior on Face-\nbook [ 17]. Note that these posts are neither shared by friends nor\npaid by advertisers. While not all \u201cSuggested for You\u201d are news-\nrelated, a fraction of them could be.\nD. Incidental news exposure: Finally, all other posts with links to\nnews articles, which are not targeted and do not result from a user\nfollowing a news page, form incidental news exposure. It includes\n(a) posts from friends, groups, or pages that either directly share or\nre-share posts with a link to a news article and (b) posts from news\nsources\u2019 Facebook pages that share links to other news sites.\nAppendix C.3 describes in more detail how we technically identify\nthe four types of exposure in our dataset.\nThe first elemental question we ask is what proportion of news ex-\nposure on social media is selective, incidental, algorithmic, or targeted.\nFigure 1 shows the proportion of selective, incidental, algorithmic,\nand targeted news posts received by users. Median values across\nall users show that a user\u2019s Facebook feed contains 50%of inciden-\ntal,24%of selective, 4%of algorithmic, and 9%of targeted news\nposts. It is noteworthy that only 38%, 13%, and 11%of users did not\nreceive algorithmic, targeted, and selective news during the study\nperiod. Hence, most users follow news providers; they are targeted\nwith news by advertisers and are exposed to algorithmic news on\nFacebook, resulting in all four types being prevalent across users.\nMoreover, we find that the ratio of targeted, selective, incidental,\nand algorithmic news posts varies with time (see Figure 8 in Ap-\npendix C). Precisely, we find that targeted news posts reached their\nhighest proportion at two different periods: (i) at the beginning of\nNovember, coinciding with the general election day on November\n3\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51, and (ii) at the end of December 2020, coinciding with the vote\nof the Electoral College members on December 14\ud835\udc61\u210e[13]. Hence,\nthe users were targeted with more news advertisements during\nthese two sensitive periods. These results indicate that major of-\nfline events might directly impact the composition of news on social\nmedia, emphasizing the need to distinguish and analyze each type\nof exposure separately. Precisely, the fact that users were targeted\nmore around two important dates during the U.S. elections is partic-\nularly alarming considering that some news publishers are exempt\nfrom the Facebook ad authorization process when targeting U.S.\nusers with political advertisements, and their ads are not labeled as\nrelated to politics and are not listed in the Facebook Ad Library [ 16].\nThis opens up the possibility of voter manipulation through tar-\ngeted advertisements in a stealth mode, evading scrutiny.\n3.2 Quality of Social Media News\nThis section assesses the quality of news users receive on Facebook\nand how prevalent misinformation is on their feeds. We characterize\nthe quality of a news post at the source level, i.e., we consider a post\nto have the same quality as the media source publishing the news.All\nne\nws\npostsTargeted\nnews\npostsSelective\nnews\npostsIncidental\nnews\npostsAlgorithmic\nnews\nposts\nFactual\nne\nws sources63% 52% 64% 66% 64%\nMisinformation\nnews sources5.1% 2 .5% 5 .8% 5 .0% 4.5%\nUnder-the-radar\nnews sources13% 32% 16% 7% 12%\nTable 1: Fraction of posts from factual, misinformation, and\nunder-the-radar news sources across all users. The table ex-\ncludes posts from under-the-radar sources and posts from\nestablished sources rated as Mixed.\nRecall that we collect posts from both news organizations reviewed\nby Media Bias Fact Check and News Guard (Established News\nSites list) and news from under-the-radar websites associated\nwith Facebook pages claiming to be news providers (Under-the-\nRadar News Sites list). Based on the available information, we\nuse three indicators to evaluate the quality of a news source:\n(a) Whether it is considered as repeatedly spreading misinformation\nand conspiracy theories by either Media Bias Fact Check or News\nGuard. Out of the 4,149 domains in the Established News Sites\nlist, 456(11%) are considered low-quality (i.e., repeatedly spreading\nmisinformation). These domains are associated with 467Facebook\npages (see Appendix C.4 for details on the misinformation ratings).\n(b) Whether it is an under-the-radar news source not covered by\nMedia Bias Fact Check and News Guard. While not all under-the-\nradar sites necessarily spread low-quality information, we know\nthat advocacy groups have created under-the-radar news sources\nshortly before the U.S. elections to spread information (or misinfor-\nmation) [45]. Hence, we consider them as potentially suspicious.\n(c) Whether it is considered as spreading mostly factual information\nby Media Bias Fact Check or News Guard. There are 2,942 such news\nsources, that correspond to 3,074 Facebook pages (see Appendix C.4\nfor more details on the factualness ratings).\nThere are 723domains listed by Media Bias Fact Check and News\nGuard that are considered to be sharing mixed content (factual and\nmisinformation) and 28for which we do not have an evaluation.\nTable 1 represents the fraction of posts from factual, misinforma-\ntion, and under-the-radar sources across all users. It shows that 5.1%\nof news posts users are exposed to are from news sources known\nfor repeatedly spreading misinformation. Additionally, we observe\nthat selective exposure has the highest rate of posts from these low-\nquality sources (5 .8%), followed by incidental (5 .0%), algorithmic\n(4.5%), and targeted exposure (2 .5%). The differences are statistically\nsignificant (Pearson\u2019s chi-squared [ 42];\ud835\udc5d<0.001), and hence, it\nseems that users are more likely to expose themselves to sources\nknown to spread misinformation than be exposed through their\ncommunities (i.e., incidental exposure) or platform\u2019s algorithms (i.e.,\nalgorithmic exposure). This is a new and intriguing observation.\nDespite the prevalence of misinformation, on average, 63%of\nnews users receive are from factual news sources. Incidental, se-\nlective, and algorithmic exposures have higher rates of posts from\nmostly factual sources (66%, 64%, and 64%, respectively) compared\nto targeted news exposure (52%). On the other hand, 13%of news\nreceived by users are from under-the-radar news sources. Targeted\nexposure has the highest rate of posts from under-the-radar news\nsources ( 32%), followed by selective (16%), algorithmic (12%), and\n2375\nWWW \u201924, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore Salim Chouaki, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Oana Goga, and Savvas Zannettou\nAll\nnews postsTargeted\nnews postsSelective\nnews postsIncidental\nnews postsAlgorithmic\nnews posts\n83 .8% 70 .7% 47 .0% 81 .5% 71 .0%\nTable 2: Fraction of users with diverse news diets, who were\nexposed to posts from both left and right-biased sources.\nincidental exposure (7%). This indicates that targeted advertising is\nthe main driver that exposes users to under-the-radar content and\nmay represent a threat to the quality of news diets.\n3.3 Diversity of Social Media News\nAn important question that has captured attention is whether users\u2019\nonline news exposure is politically diverse. Prior works have pre-\nsented conflicting evidence, uncovering both the presence and ab-\nsence of so-called \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d [ 37,49]. We revisit this question\narmed with information about actual news exposure of users, in con-\ntrast to prior works\u2019 reliance on approximations: user surveys [ 41],\nweb browsing histories [ 5,49], or the social network (e.g., tweets\nfrom accounts followed by a user) [10].\nWe attempt to provide a realistic diversity landscape as our data\ncollection includes (i) a complete and precise list of the news posts\nusers have received/seen on Facebook, and (ii) reliable labeling for\nnews sources\u2019 political leanings provided by Media Bias Fact Check\nand News Guard (see Appendix C.4 for details). 86% of all news\nposts in our dataset were published by or with landing URLs to\nestablished news sources having the corresponding political leaning\nlabels. We only consider these posts for our analyses. Furthermore,\nfor each category of news posts, we only consider users who have\nreceived at least 10 news posts, resulting in 232, 351, 140, and 145\nusers for selective, incidental, targeted, and algorithmic news posts\nrespectively (414 users if we consider all categories).\nSimilar to [ 19], we use two different metrics to measure political\ndiversity. The first metric is diversity which captures whether\na user has been exposed to news sources from both sides of the\npolitical spectrum (left and right). It is a binary metric, taking the\nvalue of 1 if a user received at least one post from a left-leaning\nnews source and at least one post from a right-leaning news source.\nThe second metric, termed balance, focuses on the ratio of left vs.\nright-leaning sources (or right vs. left-leaning sources, if the latter\nis higher) that a user encounters. It is a measure of the proportion\nof posts from left sources compared to right sources (or vice versa)\nto which a user was exposed. It varies between 0 and 1, where\n0 signifies that a user did not receive any posts from one of the\npolitical leanings (left or right), 0.5 indicates that a user received\ntwice as many posts from one leaning vs. another, and 1 indicates\nthat a user received an equal number of posts from both sides.\nWe calculate the values for these metrics for each user, consid-\nering all categories of news posts together and separately. Table 2\npresents the proportion of users with diverse news feeds. We ob-\nserve that 83.8%of users received at least one post from both sides\nof the political spectrum. When considering targeted, incidental,\nand algorithmic news posts separately, most users have received di-\nverse news for these categories. However, for selective news posts,\nmore than half of users did not encounter even a single story from\nthe other side. These results indicate that users mainly subscribe to\nsources of the same political leaning (selective exposure) but get\nOverall T argeted Selective Incidental Algorithmic0.00.20.40.60.81.0Balance\nFigure 2: Distribution of balance: fraction of news posts from\nleft vs. right-leaning sources (or right vs. left if the latter is\nhigher) per user.

We observe that algorithmic and targeted news\ndiets are the most balanced ones, followed by incidental news di-\nets, while selective news diets are the least balanced ones. If we\nconsider a news diet to be well-balanced when the balance metric\n\u22650.5(i.e., at least one-third of posts are from each ideological\nleaning), we find that 28% and 22% of users have well-balanced\nalgorithmic and targeted news diets, while only 17%and 13%of\nusers have well-balanced incidental and selective news diets. These\nobservations are consistent with \u201cdiversity\u201d results supporting that\nalgorithmic, targeted, and incidental news exposure leads users to\nmore balanced news diets than selective exposure alone.\n3.4 Consumption of Social Media News\nCheckMyNews captures how users interact with news posts, in-\ncluding the time a post was visible on users\u2019 screens, whether they\nread the corresponding news article, checked the publisher\u2019s page,\nand commented, liked, or shared it with their friends.\n3.4.1 Visible vs. hidden interactions. There are two types of inter-\nactions: visible and hidden. Visible interactions are actions visible to\nother Facebook users (including a user\u2019s friends), such as comment-\ning, sharing, or liking a post. Hidden interactions are interactions\nthat are not visible to a user\u2019s friends, such as clicking on the post to\nvisit the actual article, clicking on the page of the publisher, clicking\non the image of the post, saving, reporting, or hiding the post. We\nmake this distinction because users might behave differently when\ntheir actions are visible to their friends (e.g., they might click on a\nnews post but may not want their friends to know). Interestingly,\nwe find that users performed visible interactions on only 2.6%and\nhidden interactions on only 2.8%of the news posts they received \u2013 a\ntiny minority of news they get exposed to on Facebook. We further\nexamined instances where users performed both hidden and visi-\nble interactions on the same posts. Our findings show that users\nperform both types of actions on only <0.5%of posts, suggesting\nthat hidden and visible interactions mostly occur on distinct sets\nof posts. In fact, we find that users accessed the landing URLs of\nonly 14%of the news posts they have shared. It is a very surprising\nfinding hitherto unreported in any prior work.\n2376\nWhat News Do People Get on Social Media?

To account\nfor cases where a user has moved away while a Facebook post is\nvisible on their screen, we use the interquartile range to exclude\nlarge values. In addition, CheckMyNews collects the visibility times\nof non-news content to use them as a reference point. We classify\nnon-news content into non-news ads (i.e., posts with a \"Sponsored\"\ntag) and non-news posts (from friends or communities). We find that\nthe visibility time of news posts on user\u2019s screens (median 5.6seconds)\nis higher compared to the visibility time of non-news ads (median\n4.0seconds) and non-news posts (median 4.1seconds) (Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov [ 9];\ud835\udc5d<0.001). While we can quantitatively measure how\nlong a post was visible, we do not know if users spend more time\non news posts because they find them more interesting or if the\ncognitive load of reading a news post is higher than the cognitive\nload of other posts. Nevertheless, even though users do not click or\nreact to most news posts, they do see them for an amount of time\nlonger than other posts. Hence, this raises an important question\nfor future work: to what extent does reading a news post without\ngoing to the landing URL affect a user\u2019s beliefs and knowledge, and\nhow long do users need to look at a post to remember it?3.4.2 Effect of the type of exposure. We next investigate whether\nusers interact differently with selective, incidental, algorithmic, and\ntargeted news posts. Figure 3 shows the fraction of news posts on\nwhich users make visible and hidden interactions as well as the\nmedian visibility time of news posts on user\u2019s screens. The figure\nshows significant differences in how users interact with selective,\nincidental, algorithmic, and targeted news posts (Pearson\u2019s chi-\nsquared;\ud835\udc5d<0.001for both visible and hidden interactions, and\nKolmogorov-Smirnov; \ud835\udc5d<0.001for visibility time). While the\nfraction of visible and hidden interactions is similar for selective\nand incidental news posts; the fraction of hidden interactions is\n1.8 to 6 times higher than visible interactions on algorithmic and\ntargeted news posts. It may be possible that users perceive the\nunderlying mechanisms through which the news posts appear in\ntheir feeds differently, and this might inhibit visible interactions\non algorithmic and targeted news posts (e.g., users might avoid\nsharing an article that was recommended to them by Facebook\u2019s\nalgorithms, while they will share more freely an article that comes\nfrom their friends). We leave a causal validation of this hypothesis\nthrough a randomized controlled trial as future work.\n3.4.3 Impact of news source quality. Next, we investigate whether\nusers interact differently with news posts from sources of vary-\ning quality. We split news posts into three categories: (a) news\nposts from established sources that News Guard and Media Bias\nFact Check consider to be factual, (b) news posts from established\nsources that these two agencies consider to be repeatedly spreading\nmisinformation, and (c) news posts from under-the-radar sources.\nFigure 3 presents the consumption statistics for factual, misin-\nformation, and under-the-radar news posts. The figure shows that\nnews posts from misinformation news sources have a longer visi-\nbility time (median: 6.7 seconds) than news posts from factual news\nsources (median: 6.0 seconds) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov; p < 0.001).\nThis result is intriguing and raises questions on whether a different\ncognitive process gets triggered when faced with misinformation (e.g.,\nthey spend more time to be sure about the factuality). We leave the\nanalysis of the root cause of this observation as future work. Ad-\nditionally, users generally pay less attention to news posts from\nunder-the-radar news sources (median: 5.3 seconds). Furthermore,\nwhile the fraction of visible and hidden interactions is not signifi-\ncantly different for posts from factual and misinformation sources,\nthe fraction of visible interactions on under-the-radar posts is sig-\nnificantly lower than the fraction of hidden interactions.\n3.4.4 Impact of concurrence in political ideology. Finally, we in-\nvestigate how users interact with posts with similar or opposite\npolitical leaning. In our survey, we asked users about their political\nleaning (Republican, Lean Republican, Independent, Lean Demo-\ncrat, Democrat, or Other). We consider four sets:\n(a) posts from right-leaning sources received by Democrats,\n(b) posts from right-leaning sources received by Republicans,\n(c) posts from left-leaning sources received by Democrats, and\n(d) posts from left-leaning sources received by Republicans.\nFigure 3 shows the consumption behavior. When considering\nviewing time, we do not observe statistically significant differences\nbetween these four scenarios, however, the difference begins to\nemerge when we consider visible and hidden interactions (Pearson\u2019s\n2377\nWWW \u201924, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore Salim Chouaki, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Oana Goga, and Savvas Zannettou\nchi-squared; p < 0.001). The figure expectedly shows that users per-\nform more visible interactions on posts published by sources with\na matching political ideology (Republicans interact with 3.1%of\nposts from right-leaning sources vs. 1.8%from left-leaning sources;\nDemocrats interact with 3.9%of posts from left-leaning sources\nvs.3.1%from right-leaning sources). However, when it comes to\nhidden interactions, users interact more with posts from sources\nwith the opposite political ideology (Republicans on 4.1%of posts\nfrom left sources vs. 2.3%from right sources; Democrats on 2.9%of\nposts from right sources vs. 2.4%from left sources). This provides\na hopeful insight into users\u2019 online behavior, which attests to their\nwillingness to engage with opposing views, albeit in stealth mode.\n4 CONCLUDING DISCUSSION\nIn this work, we attempted to provide a realistic view of users\u2019\nnews exposure and consumption on Facebook. Our methodology\nconsists of building a non-invasive monitoring tool that can allow\na large number of Facebook users to donate data on the news posts\nthey receive on Facebook and how they interact with them. We\ncould provide a realistic, fine-grained, and broad representation\nof users\u2019 exposure to news and their consumption behavior by\ncapturing the actual news users are exposed to on Facebook and\nprecisely what users see on their screens. Overall, our measurement\napproach provided immensely valuable data on news exposure that\nonly online platforms have had access to until now and no outside\nresearcher could have the opportunity to avail.\nOf course, implementing such measurement infrastructure is\ntechnically challenging. First, we had to ensure that the data collec-\ntion was reliable and did not miss data due to the variability in how\nonline platforms serve their content. Second, we had to ensure the\nprivacy and safety of the data collection and storage. Our codebase\nis publicly available to help other groups adopt such methodology\nand encourage developing infrastructure to study news exposure\nand consumption on other social media platforms [58].\nImplications of results. Our research offers a unique opportunity\nto delve into users\u2019 precise exposure and engagement with news-\nrelated content, allowing us to reliably measure the prevalence of\nmisinformation and the political diversity within Facebook news\ndiets. We highlight three noteworthy aspects of our findings:\nMechanistic perspective on news exposure and consumption. We\nfocused on investigating news exposure and consumption patterns,\nspecifically considering how news articles appear in users\u2019 feeds\nbased on the underlying mechanisms. We found statistically signif-\nicant distinctions in diversity, quality, and consumption behavior\nwithin four exposure categories: selective, algorithmic, incidental,\nand targeted. For instance, we observed that incidental exposure\nleads to more balanced and factual news consumption, while users\nare less inclined to share targeted news posts. These differences\nhighlight the importance of adopting a mechanistic lens when at-\ntempting to model and understand dissemination and consumption\nof news on social media platforms.\nTransparency for targeted news exposure. Recent research works\nhave shown a significant shift from using targeted advertising as a\nway to promote products to a way to promote information [ 2,50,55].\nFor the subcategory of ads with political messages, such powerful\ntargeting is now being regarded as a danger, and many lawmakersare proposing to regulate such practices through increased trans-\nparency and targeting restrictions (e.g., Digital Services Act [ 15],\nEuropean Democracy Action Plan [ 14]). However, news organiza-\ntions are currently exempted from such obligations and restrictions.\nWe believe that malicious actors can easily leverage AI-driven tar-\ngeting technologies to promote news-related posts that leverage\nuser\u2019s data to deceive and manipulate them, by targeting news that\nresonate with each user [ 29,48,54]. Our results show that expo-\nsure to targeted news is a general phenomenon and represents an\nimportant fraction of users\u2019 news exposure. Therefore, we believe\nthat the same levels of transparency for targeted news should be\nimposed similar to political advertising.\nNews consumption behavior. Our study uncovered a number\nof hitherto unknown and intriguing news consumption patterns:\nusers engage significantly less with targeted and algorithmic news-\nrelated posts; they tend to spend more time reading content from\nmisinformation sources compared to factual news sources; and\nshare news-related posts without reading the actual articles. We\nalso found evidence that users engage with posts from sources with\nopposing political ideologies through hidden interactions.\nScaling data donation. Installing monitoring tools on personal\ncomputers can be unsettling for many users. It\u2019s understandable, as\nsuch tools could potentially exploit users\u2019 trust, jeopardizing their\nsecurity and privacy. To address this concern, we take a transparent\napproach by making our code publicly available for auditing by\nanyone. Nonetheless, it is essential to emphasize the significance\nof data donations in uncovering risks with current technologies\nand promoting this practice more widely. While we acknowledge\nthat achieving perfect representativeness may be challenging, we\nmade efforts to reach out to Prolific users from diverse backgrounds,\nincluding various U.S. states and ethnicities. We are aware that the\npresence of a monitoring tool on users\u2019 computers might influence\ntheir behavior, potentially leading to altered usage patterns. This\nissue is not uncommon and has been encountered in previous re-\nsearch analyzing browsing histories. However, by requesting users\nto keep the tool installed for an extended period, we anticipate that\ntheir behavior will stabilize over time.\nFuture work. We believe that our paper can trigger a plethora of\nfuture research works seeking to understand the underlying fac-\ntors and implications of these consumption behaviors. Some of the\npotential research questions include: Does targeted and algorith-\nmic exposure exert a lesser impact on users\u2019 opinions compared\nto selective and incidental exposure? To what extent does merely\nseeing a news post without reading the source article influence the\nuser\u2019s opinion on a particular topic? Do interactions with posts\nfrom sources holding opposing political ideologies reinforce or\nprompt users to question their own political preferences? Address-\ning these questions could shed further light on the complexities of\nnews consumption patterns on social media, the role of exposure\nmechanisms, and their effects on users\u2019 opinions.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.\nThis research was supported in part by the French National Re-\nsearch Agency (ANR) through the ANR-21-CE23-0031-02 and ANR-\n22-CE38-0017 grants and by the EU 101041223 and 101021377 grants.\n2378\nWhat News Do People Get on Social Media?

Incidental Exposure to Online\nNews. Proceedings of the 73rd ASIS Annual Meeting on Navigating Streams in an\nInformation Ecosystem - Volume 47, Article 22 (2010), 8 pages.\nA MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY\nA.1 Types of Facebook posts collected\nWe collect information about three types of user posts on Facebook:\n1.News posts \u2013 news posts (or news-related posts) include Face-\nbook posts that fall into two categories. First, posts published by\npages listed in our list of Facebook pages associated with news\nsources (Established Facebook Pages list orUnder-the-Radar\nFacebook Pages list), and second, posts that contain a landing\nURL directing to one of the news domains in our lists (Established\nNews Sites list orUnder-the-Radar News Sites list). These\nposts can be targeted (i.e., ads), suggested by Facebook, and have\ndifferent privacy settings, ranging from private (visible to a limited\ngroup of users) to public (visible to all users).\n2.Non-news targeted posts \u2013 Posts advertisers pay Facebook to send\nto specific groups of users [ 2]. Note that CheckMyNews detects the\nnews posts before detecting the targeted ones. Hence, all the posts\nit collects as targeted posts are not news-related.\n3.Non-news public posts \u2013 All non-targeted and non-news posts.\nThey are shared by users, groups, or Facebook pages and set as\npublic by the publishers, making them visible to anyone.\nWhile non-news targeted and public posts do not meet our cri-\nteria for being news-related based on the filter we applied during\nthe data collection, their inclusion was valuable in expanding our\nlists of news domains and their Facebook pages. By analyzing the\nFacebook pages from which we collected these public and targetedposts, we identified 404additional news domains associated with\n449Facebook pages with the \"News Media\" category.\nA.2 Reliability of the monitoring tool\nHaving a reliable monitoring tool that does not miss any post a\nuser sees on Facebook is necessary to have correct and coherent\nmeasurements. To ensure the tool works well for all users during the\ndata collection, we have implemented several tests at the extension\nlevel to detect when our collection functions do not work correctly\n(e.g., the user is on Facebook, but we do not detect any post for\nmore than 120seconds). We send error messages to the server,\nand we have developed a monitoring page that we consult daily to\ncheck for aggregate and per-user statistics and consult the error\nmessages. The targeted posts are more challenging to detect because\nFacebook renders them using complex changing HTML objects\nthat sometimes differ between users. To cope with this, we first\nmake sure that the targeted posts we miss are collected as public\nposts (that are simpler to detect). We then manually check users\nfrom whom we have collected only public posts and investigate\nhow targeted ones are rendered for them. We finally updated our\nextension to detect the targeted posts rendered in this new way.\nOverall, the monitoring tool can easily be installed by users,\nworks silently in the background, has a minimal impact on browser\nperformance, and does not affect the user experience.\nA.3 Compliance with ethical principles\nWe use various strategies to minimize user security and privacy\nrisks and sought the necessary approvals from Data Protection\nOfficers and Ethical Review Boards. The personal data we collect\nis handled following the EU General Data Protection Regulation\n2016/679. Personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and in a trans-\nparent manner. To ensure privacy, we took the following measures:\n(a)Data minimization : The tool collects information about the con-\ntent users receive and not the content they share. Additionally, we\nonly collect the landing URLs or private news posts.\n(b)Pseudonymization: We do not send our servers any personally\nidentifiable information of users (e.g., email, name, phone number).\nNo summary data is disclosed that would allow inference about an\nindividual\u2019s personal or private data. Each user is identified by a\nrandom identifier generated at each new tool installation.\n(c)Explicit consent: Every user installing our tool is shown a page\ndescribing precisely the data given and the use of this data. We ask\nfor the user\u2019s explicit consent to donate data and participate in the\nresearch study. The consent form is submitted (electronically) for\neach user installing the tool, and we keep proof of this consent.\n(d)Detailed privacy and security risks assessment: We passed a se-\ncurity homologation from our institution and wrote a detailed\ndocument that analyzes security and privacy risks at every level of\nthe data transfer and worked with network and system engineers\nfrom our University to secure the application at every level.\n(e) To use our tool, users must confirm being at least 16years old.\n(f)Data removal/leaving the study: We informed the participants of\ntheir right to access, correct, request portability, and delete personal\ndata, and we gave them the contact details of our Data Protection\nOfficer (DPO) to exercise their rights. Participants could leave the\nstudy at any moment and ask for their data to be removed.\n2380\nWhat News Do People Get on Social Media?

To compen-\nsate the participants for their time in installing and answering the\nsurvey questions, we offered them an initial payment right afterthe installation and a bonus payment at the end of the six weeks if\nthere was a minimum required activity level. Only 720successfully\ninstalled the extension, and only 580logged into Facebook after\ninstalling it. Finally, only 472users kept the tool active for a long\nperiod and respected the minimum Facebook activity condition\n(at least 30 minutes); we do our analysis only on these 472users.\nWe consider that users have dropped out of our study when we\nstop collecting their activity. We do not know whether they have\nuninstalled/disabled the browser extension or stopped using the\ncomputer or the browser on which they have installed it. Though\nthe initial study was launched over six weeks, we extended our\ndataset to include data over three months (until February 15, 2021)\nsince we had many users who kept running the extension.\nB.2 User representativeness\nOur users are 65%males and 35%females (compared to 45%males\n55%females for U.S. users on Facebook [ 51], and 49%and 51%for\nthe U.S. population [ 53]) and live across 48states in the U.S. The\nusers are part of different ethnic groups: 74%White, 11%African\nAmerican, and 11%Asian (compared to 76%, 13%and 6%for the U.S\npopulation [ 52]). Figure 4 presents the age distribution of our users,\ncompared to the overall U.S. population [ 43] and the Facebook U.S.\nusers [ 2]. More than half of them are between 20and 40(54%).\nHence, our database has more young users than the normal U.S.\npopulation, but we have users of all age pools. According to the\nsurvey, 76%of users consider themselves Democrats, while 16%are\nRepublicans and 6%are Independents.\nC DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING\nC.1 News exposure and consumption data\nOur dataset includes 889,438 Facebook posts received by 472users;\n143,129 (16%) posts are news-related, 205,469 (23%) are non-news\ntargeted and 548,152 (61%) are non-news public. Out of all the news-\nrelated posts, 108,659 posts have a link to one of the news domains\nin our lists (Established News Sites list orUnder-the-Radar\nNews Sites list) and 85,066 were published by pages in our lists\nof Facebook pages (Established Facebook Pages list orUnder-\nthe-Radar Facebook Pages list). Figure 5 represents the number\nof news posts, targeted posts, and public posts received by users.\nA median user received 125(\ud835\udc65=435,\ud835\udc60=855) targeted posts, 58\n(\ud835\udc65=303,\ud835\udc60=789) news posts, and 387(\ud835\udc65=1,161,\ud835\udc60=2,266) public\nposts. We have also collected a total of 37,300 user interactions with\n24,486 different posts: 9,804 are visible interactions while 27,496\nare hidden interactions. Figure 6 presents the number of actions\nperformed by each user on all news posts. We can see that a median\nuser performed 20interactions ( \ud835\udc65=79,\ud835\udc60=189).\nC.2 Unexpected user behavior and bot detection\nConsidering the relevancy of the research questions we address\nin this study, it is crucial to ensure that none of the participants\nused bots during data collection. Figure 7 presents the median and\nmaximum times spent on Facebook per day, over all active days\nfor each of the 472participants. The figure shows that an average\nuser spent 0.06hours (3.6minutes) on Facebook on a day with\nmedian activity and 0.53hours (32 minutes) on the most active\nday. Furthermore, the figure reveals that 10users spent more than\n2381\nWWW \u201924, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore Salim Chouaki, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Oana Goga, and Savvas Zannettou\n50001000015000\nNumber of news posts\n09/11 223/11 47/12 621/12 84/1 1018/1 121/2 1415/2\nWeek0204060Median proportion of posts (%)\nT argeted news posts\nSelective news posts\nIncidental news posts\nAlgorithmic news posts\nFigure 8: Median proportion of selective, incidental, algo-\nrithmic, and targeted news posts received by users by week.\nAbove: weekly number of collected news posts.\n7hours on Facebook on their busiest days. Upon investigating\nthe posts collected from these users, we found no evidence of bot\nactivity. Our analysis suggests that these users have left Facebook\nopen on their browsers without actively browsing on the platform.\nC.3 Distinguishing news posts categories\nOur monitoring tool collects all news posts on users\u2019 Facebook\nfeeds. This section presents how we technically divide these posts\ninto targeted, selective, incidental, and algorithmic news posts.\nSelective news exposure : We select posts originating from the official\nFacebook pages of news media sites (Established Facebook Pages\nlist andUnder-the-Radar Facebook Pages list). We then check\nwhether these posts contain a landing URL that directs users to their\nrespective news media website. For instance, if the Facebook page of\nCNN\u2013https://www.facebook.com/cnn\u2013publishes a post that links\nto an article on cnn.com\u2013https://edition.cnn.com/...), we consider it\nas selective exposure. However, when a news media Facebook page\nshares a post containing a link to a news article from an external\nsite, we do not consider it selective exposure. In such cases, the\nuser\u2019s exposure to the external site\u2019s content does not result from\ntheir explicit following of the external site\u2019s Facebook page.\nTargeted news posts : This category includes all targeted posts that\npromote articles from news media sites, irrespective of the Facebook\npage that promotes them. While such posts are rendered similarly\nto regular Facebook posts, they include a \"Sponsored\" tag. We use\nseveral HTML and CSS selectors to identify this tag.\nAlgorithmic news posts : This category includes Facebook news-\nrelated posts that Facebook suggests to users. Such posts have the\n\"Suggested for you\" tag that we detect using CSS selectors. We\nanalyze the HTML objects of all identified news-related posts and\nconsider algorithmic exposure all news posts that include this tag.\nIncidental news posts : For each news post, we extract the landing\ndomain and the Facebook page\u2019s ID. We then verify if one of the\nfollowing conditions is met: (a) the page\u2019s ID is not in our list of\nFacebook pages (Established Facebook Pages list andUnder-\nthe-Radar Facebook Pages list), but the landing domain is among\nour list of news sources (Established News Sites list andUnder-\nthe-Radar News Sites list), or (b) both the page\u2019s ID and the\nlanding domain are present in the respective lists, but the Facebook\npage belongs to another source.\nOur dataset contains a total of 143,129 news posts; 62,434 are\nselective, 60,529 are incidental, 11,566 are targeted, and 8,600 are\nalgorithmic. Figure 8 illustrates the changing proportion of inciden-\ntal, selective, targeted, and algorithmic news posts by week, duringour data collection period. Our dataset is available at: https://github.\ncom/CHOUAKIsalim/Facebook_News_Related_Posts_Dataset\nC.4 Metadata on news outlets\nTo assess the quality of Facebook news diets, we measure the pro-\nportion of posts originating from (a) mostly factual news sources\nand (b) sources spreading misinformation, fake news, and conspir-\nacy theories. We also evaluate the political diversity of Facebook\nnews diets by measuring the proportion of news posts from sources\nacross the political spectrum. We assign quality (factual, misinfor-\nmation, or mixed) and political bias (left, center, or right) labels at\nthe source level for each news domain. All posts originating from a\nspecific domain inherit these labels. We do not make any judgment\non the quality and political bias of news domains. Instead, similar\nto previous work [ 12], we rely on evaluations provided by Media\nBias Fact Check and News Guard.\nMetadata on misinformation. News Guard describes whether\na news source has a history of sharing misinformation in the \"Top-\nics\" column of their data file, while Media Bias Fact Check provides\nit in the \"Detailed\" section of their website\u2019s source evaluation.\nThough the two agencies used different terminology to capture the\nfull spectrum of misleading news practices, they always included\nthe terms \"Conspiracy,\" \"Fake News,\" or \"Misinformation.\" Conse-\nquently, we flagged a source as spreading misinformation if one of\nthese terms was used to describe it. The two data providers agreed\non this measure; only 33 domains were the subject of disagreement.\nWe resolved these disagreements by applying the misinformation\nlabel. Overall, we labeled 456news sources associated with 467as\nspreading misinformation.\nMetadata on factualness. News Guard assigns a credibility\nscore (between 0 and 100) and Media Bias Fact Check provides a\nfactual_reporting text label for each news publisher. We apply filters\nto both fields: (a) News Guard scores of 75 or higher (indicating\nthat a news source has high credibility or is generally credible ),\nand (b) a positive Media Bias Fact Check factual reporting (High,\nVery high, or Mostly factual). If a news publisher has ratings from\nboth agencies, we consider it factual only if both consider it factual.\nIf a news publisher has an evaluation from only one agency, we use\nthat rating alone. Overall, we have labeled 2,942 news sources as\nfactual, corresponding to 3,074 Facebook pages.\nMetadata on news sources political bias. News Guard provides\nthe political leaning for 2,939 different news sites (Far Left, Slightly\nLeft, Center, Slightly Right, Far Right) and Media Bias Fact Check\nfor 1,711 different news sites (Extreme Left, Far Left, Left, Left\nCenter, Center, Right Center, Right, Far Right, Extreme-right). We\nnormalize the evaluations from both sources by considering (a)\nFar Left, Slightly Left, Extreme Left, and Left Center as Left and\n(b) Far Right, Slightly Right, Extreme Right, and Right Center as\nRight. We have 41domains for which we have different evaluations\nfrom the two sources; we prefer to use the values of Media Bias\nFact Check for these. In total, from the 4,149 news sites in the\nEstablished News Sites list, we have the political leaning for\n4,107 of them (99%). 64%of them are rated as Center, 20%as Left\n(7%Far-Left + 13%Slightly-Left), and 17%as Right (10% Far-Right +\n7%Slightly-Right).\n2382", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "What News Do People Get on Social Media?", "author": ["S Chouaki", "A Chakraborty", "O Goga", "S Zannettou"], "pub_year": "2024", "venue": "NA", "abstract": "Understanding how exposure to news on social media impacts public discourse and  exacerbates political polarization is a significant endeavor in both computer and social sciences."}, "filled": false, "gsrank": 511, "pub_url": "https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:5468fec2-8314-432d-80e2-b16596000f87", "author_id": ["", "21oQO9oAAAAJ", "re_squoAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?hl=en&q=info:6r3JUTvVEIAJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=510&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3D%2522mediabiasfactcheck.com%26hl%3Den%26start%3D510%26as_sdt%3D0,10&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=6r3JUTvVEIAJ&ei=Y7WsaL-9EJXUieoPmrax2A8&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:6r3JUTvVEIAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22mediabiasfactcheck.com&hl=en&as_sdt=0,10", "eprint_url": "https://repository.tudelft.nl/file/File_65086792-d11a-4525-ae66-44be39139702"}}, {"title": "SENS-HEAD: A Machine Learning Framework for Sensationalism Detection in News Headlines Using Linguistic and Semantic Features", "year": "2025", "pdf_data": "                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n1 \n SENS -HEAD: A Machine Learning \nFramework for Sensationalism Detection in \nNews Headlines Using Linguistic and \nSemantic Features  \n \nPo-Hsuan Chang  1, Akshi Kumar1*, Saurabh Raj Sangwan2  \n1School  of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London, London, United Kingdom  \n2 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, G \nL Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management, Greater Noida, India  \n*Akshi.Kumar@gold.ac.uk  \n \ndoi: https://d oi.org/10.37745/bjmas.2022.04909                                                                     Published June 01 , 2025  \n \nCitation : Chang  P., Kumar  A., Sangwan SR (2025) SENS -HEAD: A Machine Learning Framework for \nSensationalism Detection in News Headlines Using Linguistic and Semantic Features, British Journal of \nMultidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31 \n \nAbstract: The proliferation of sensationalized news headlines has raised concerns about media \nintegrity, necessitating automated approaches for detecting sensationalism beyond traditional clickbait \nclassification. This study presents SENS -HEAD, a novel dataset compr ising over 30,000 annotated \nheadlines labelled  for sensational content and emotional arousal. Employing Natural Language \nProcessing (NLP), we extract a diverse set of linguistic and semantic features, including sentiment \npolarity, syntactic complexity, pun ctuation distribution, and stop word ratio, to systematically \ndistinguish sensational from non -sensational headlines. We implement ensemble learning models \u2014\nXGBoost, CATBoost, and Random Forest  achieving a balanced F1 -score of 0.66. To enhance \ninterpretabil ity, we integrate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), unveiling key predictive markers \nsuch as stop word frequency, headline length, and sentiment extremity. The findings not only advance \nexplainable AI (XAI) for sensationalism detection but also provide  practical applications in automated \njournalism, content moderation, and media ethics regulation. By strengthening computational \nlinguistics with ethical AI, this research delivers actionable insights for policymakers and promotes \ntrustworthy news dissemin ation in the digital era.  \n \nKeywords: Sensationalism detection, linguistic features, NLP, machine learning, news headlines, XAI \n \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nIn the digital age, news headlines play a critical role in capturing readers' attention and driving \nengagement. The transition from traditional print media to online platforms has intensified competition \namong news outlets, incentivizing the use of sensationalism to attract more clicks and boost traffic. \nSensationalism, characterized by emotionally charged, exaggera ted, or dramatic language, is designed \nto provoke strong reactions from readers. While sensational headlines are effective in increasing click -\nthrough rates (CTR), they often distort the reality of events by prioritizing engagement over accuracy  \n[1]. This practice raises ethical concerns about the dissemination of information and its long -term \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n2 \n impact on public perception. Despite these concerns, the detection of sensationalism in news headlines \nhas been underexplored, with most research focusing on clickbai t detection.  \n \nTo address this gap, this paper presents an automated system for detecting sensationalism in news \nheadlines using a linguistic feature -based approach. The foundation of this study is the SENS -HEAD \ndataset, a novel resource developed specifica lly for the task of sensationalism detection. The dataset \nwas recreated from existing clickbait data1, meticulously annotated to focus on sensationalism rather \nthan simply misleading content. Comprising over 30,000 annotated headlines, SENS -HEAD serves as \nthe basis for training machine learning models to classify sensationalism in headlines based on linguistic \npatterns.  The motivation for this research is driven by ethical concerns surrounding the rise of \nsensationalism in media and its influence on public perception. While clickbait has been widely studied  \n[2, 3] , sensationalism represents a broader issue that extends beyond simple click -maximization \nstrategies. Sensational headlines often manipulate readers' emotions by appealing to curiosity, fear, or \nexcitement, shaping the way audiences perceive events in ways that may not reflect the true content. \nUnlike clickbait, which focuses primarily on luring readers into clicking through misleading cues, \nsensationalism engages deeper emotional responses by using specific linguistic strategies  [4, 5] . \nTherefore, detecting sensationalism is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of news reporting.  \n \nConsider the example of a headline like \"Shocking! Man Survives Lightning Strike for the Third Time.\"  \nThe use of the word \"shocking\" and the exclamation mark conveys a sense of drama and surprise, which \nheightens emotional engagement. In contrast, a non -sensational version might simply state, \"Man \nSurvives Third Lightning Strike.\"  Both headlines present the same f actual information, but the \nsensational version is crafted to provoke a stronger emotional response, thus drawing more attention. \nSimilarly, a headline like \"World \u2019s Best Athlete Breaks Record!\"  uses a superlative and exclamation \nmark to exaggerate excitem ent, while a more factual version, \"Athlete Breaks Record in \nChampionship,\"  provides the information without evoking unnecessary drama. These examples \nhighlight how subtle linguistic choices, such as exaggerated adjectives and punctuation, can \nsignificantl y influence reader engagement and emotional reaction.  \n \nThis research adopts a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning framework to analyze \nand detect sensationalism based on these linguistic patterns. Various features, such as sentiment \nanalysis, readability scores, punctuation usage, and syntactic complexity, are extracted from headlines \nto form the input for machine learning models. The models used in this study \u2014XGBoost, CATBoost, \nand Random Forest \u2014are known for their robust performance in classification tasks. To further enhance \ninterpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [6] analysis is applied to understand the \ncontribution of each linguistic feature to the model's predictions, identifying the most influential \nmarkers of sensat ionalism.

By focusing on the \nstructural and emot ional components of language, we can identify patterns that signal sensationalism \nmore effectively than superficial metrics such as headline length or engagement statistics. Additionally, \nexisting research on clickbait detection, while related, does not fu lly account for the emotional and \npsychological manipulation inherent in sensationalism. Clickbait detection primarily examines intent  \nwhether the headline misleads the reader into clicking  whereas sensationalism goes beyond intent, \ntargeting emotional eng agement and altering how readers perceive the world. Addressing these \ncomplexities not only fills a gap in current literature but also offers practical applications in content \nmoderation and media regulation.  \n \nBy utilizing advanced machine learning models and SHAP analysis, this study offers a transparent and \ninterpretable framework for detecting sensationalism. SHAP allows us to understand how individual \nlinguistic features, such as sentiment polarity or punctuation patterns, influence the model's predicti ons. \nThis interpretability is crucial for applying the findings in real -world settings, where ethical \nconsiderations must balance attention -grabbing headlines with responsible reporting.  \n \nIn summary, this research provides a comprehensive approach to sensa tionalism detection, offering \nvaluable insights for journalists, editors, and regulators. It not only builds upon existing knowledge of \nheadline detection but also paves the way for future applications in automated journalism and media \noversight.

This is followed by a literature review that provides context from past studies, positioning the \npaper  within the existing body of research.

Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of results, limitations, and \ndirections for future work.  \n \nLITERATURE REVIEW  \n \nSensationalism in headlines has long attracted interest from both linguistic and  psychological \nresearchers due to its significant influence on public perception and emotional engagement. Over time, \nstudies have evolved to explore how sensationalism is communicated through language, employing \nvarious methods from rhetorical analysis to  machine learning -based approaches. This section reviews \nthe key literature on sensationalism, tracing its development from early studies to the most recent \nadvances in 2023 \u20132024. The review highlights existing gaps and lays the foundation for the current \nresearch.  \n \nEarly research, such as that by Molek -Kozakowska [4], examined how sensational headlines use \nrhetorical strategies, including hyperbole, exaggeration, and dramatic language, to elicit strong \ncognitive and emotional responses from readers. Molek -Kozakowska analyzed the linguistic devices \nthat amplify a story \u2019s emotional resonance, such as the use of extreme adjectives or verbs, \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n4 \n demonstrating how these features shape readers \u2019 perceptions of events. Similarly, Kleemans and \nVettehen [7] linked sensationalism to evolutionary theory, arguing that the human brain has adapted to \nscanning for information related to survival and reproduction. This explains the long -standing appeal \nof sensationalism in news stories, as such content resonates with insti nctual human responses to threats \nand opportunities.  \n \nThe methodological focus on sensationalism detection shifted with the growing popularity of Natural \nLanguage Processing (NLP) techniques and the application of machine learning in text analysis. Biyani \net al. [8], in 2016, introduced a novel approach by utilizing linguistic markers, such as superlative \nadjectives and specific punctuation (e.g., exclamation marks), in their clickbait detection models. Their \nstudy highlighted the reliability of certain lin guistic features in identifying sensational content. Brown \net al. [9] explored sensationalism as a broader concept, often tied to emotional appeal and shock value, \nand examined how it affects audience engagement on social media across various countries. \nAdditionally, Montejo and Adriano [10] analyzed how Philippine news headlines use linguistic \nstrategies, such as evaluative language and references to elite figures, to sensationalize stories and \nreflect media ideologies. Their use of Fairclough \u2019s Critical D iscourse Analysis (CDA) framework \nrevealed that sensationalism in headlines is frequently achieved through emotionally charged language, \nsuperlatives, and references to well -known figures to capture attention.  \n \nIn 2019, Xu et al. [11] introduced a novel ap proach for sensational headline generation using \nreinforcement learning, proposing an Auto -tuned Reinforcement Learning (ARL) mechanism that \ndynamically balances maximum likelihood estimation with reinforcement learning. This innovation \noptimized both sens ationalism and fluency in generated headlines without requiring labeled data. \nMour\u00e3o and Robertson [12] examined fake news as a form of discursive integration, analyzing the \ngenre -blending of traditional journalism with misinformation, sensationalism, and clickbait across 50 \nsites. They found that moderate sensationalism and partisanship, rather than outright fabrications, drive \nengagement on social media. Arbaoui and Van der Brug [13], in 2020, provided a comparative analysis \nof sensationalism in news cove rage across 14 television systems, revealing significant variations in \nsensationalist reporting patterns across different media contexts. In the same year, Naeem et al. [14] \npresented a deep learning framework for clickbait detection on social networks, co mbining a Part of \nSpeech Analysis Module (POSAM) with an LSTM classifier, achieving a classification accuracy of \n97%.  \n \nThe COVID -19 pandemic saw a significant increase in sensationalism in media coverage across various \nregions. In 2021, Allen and Ayalon [1 5] critically analyzed how residential care during the COVID -19 \npandemic was portrayed in leading American newspapers. They uncovered how sensationalist language \nand the exclusion of residents' voices perpetuated narratives of fear, danger, and distrust to ward long -\nterm care facilities. Similarly, Wasserman et al. [16] analyzed South African newspaper coverage of \nCOVID -19, finding that alarmist and sensationalist reporting predominated, with nearly half of the \nfront -page reports using alarmist narratives. T his sensationalist framing amplified public anxieties and \noften failed to provide actionable health information, ultimately exacerbating public fears. Ottwell et \nal. [17] emphasized the prevalence of sensational media reporting about COVID -19 therapies, de tection \nmethods, and vaccines, often exaggerating the potential benefits without supporting clinical data.  \n \nIn the same year, Liepukhova and Shcherbak [18] examined lexical and semantic strategies used in \nGerman -language media headlines to create sensation alism. They highlighted how expressive \nvocabulary and stylistic devices such as metaphors, allusions, and antithesis were employed to evoke \nstrong emotional responses. In 2023, Esparza et al. [19] demonstrated the effectiveness of BERT -based \nclassifiers in  detecting sensational health -related headlines in Spanish, achieving up to 94% accuracy \nand F1 -Score on nearly 2,000 Mexican newspaper headlines.

Khawar and Boukes [21] analyzed sensationalism in news promotion on Twitter (now X), \ncomparing legacy new s outlets (e.g., USA Today) with online -native outlets (e.g., BuzzFeed). Their \nstudy revealed that online -native outlets employed more sensationalist features, positively correlating \nwith higher user engagement, particularly in the form of likes and retwee ts. \n \nDespite significant advances in sensationalism and clickbait detection, much of the research has focused  \nprimarily on clickbait, with limited efforts dedicated to sensationalism detection specifically. \nFurthermore, while there have been quantitative s tudies on media sources concerning sensational news, \nno comprehensive language or discourse analysis has been conducted to systematically examine \nsensationalism as a distinct phenomenon. Studies by Biyani et al. [8] and Brown et al. [9] enhanced \nunderstand ing of the linguistic markers of sensationalism, yet these efforts lacked a robust framework \nthat distinguishes sensationalism from other forms of emotional manipulation, such as clickbait. With \nthe rise of deep learning and explainable AI models, the need  for a focused dataset and methodologies \naddressing sensationalism in a more detailed and structured way has become evident. The paper by \nZhang and Kejriwal [22], offers critical insights into the challenges of sensationalism detection in \ndynamic news envi ronments, particularly highlighting the phenomenon of concept drift. Our work \nbuilds on these insights, offering a more comprehensive and interpretable framework with broader \ndomain coverage and improved generalizability.  \n \nMETHODOLOGY  \n \nTo accurately detec t and analyze sensationalism in news headlines, a methodologically sound and data -\ndriven approach is critical. The methodology employed in this research is designed to systematically \ncapture the nuances of sensationalism by leveraging linguistic features t hat trigger emotional arousal i n \nreaders. This approach not only ensures that the classification models are robust but also provides \nexplainability, allowing us to understand the underlying factors contributing to sensationalism. The \ndecision to adopt this  feature -based NLP approach stems from the need to go beyond surface -level text \nanalysis and delve into the structural and emotional components of language, which are essential for \nidentifying sensational content.  Figure 1 illustrates the workflow of the m ethodology adopted.  \n \nFig.1.

It combines diverse sources of clickbait and \nnon-clickbait headlines, enabling a nuanced analysis of sensationalism across journalist ic contexts. The \ndataset incorporates headlines from clickbait platforms (e.g., BuzzFeed, Upworthy, ViralNova, \nThatScoop, ScoopWhoop, and ViralStories) and traditional outlets (e.g., WikiNews, The New York \nTimes, The Guardian, and The Hindu). This diversit y represents the two extremes of sensationalism , \nthe exaggerated, emotion -driven content of clickbait versus the factual, balanced reporting of traditional \njournalism. By capturing these variations, the dataset allows for the development of a comprehensive  \nclassification model that reflects the entire spectrum of sensationalism tactics.  \n \nThe SENS -HEAD dataset consists of 30,424 rows, reduced from the original 32,000 after removing \n117 rows with conflicting sensation indicators and 1,459 rows with inconsiste nt annotations. This size \nensures robustness by providing sufficient examples for training machine learning models, improving \ntheir ability to generalize to unseen data and achieve reliable statistical significance. The mix betwee n \nclickbait and non -clickb ait examples was carefully balanced to ensure fair representation of both \nclasses, reducing bias in training and enhancing the model's ability to distinguish sensationalism \neffectively.  \nCreating the SENS -HEAD dataset involved several challenges:  \n\uf0b7 Conflictin g Annotations:  Resolving inconsistencies in annotations required careful analysis and \nrefinement of scoring criteria.  \n\uf0b7 Subjective Interpretation of Sensationalism:  Sensationalism often depends on context and \nperception, necessitating clear guidelines to ensure consistent labelling.  \n\uf0b7 Balancing Strategies:  Maintaining a balanced dataset required ensuring equal representation of \nboth sensational and neutral headlines, e ven as outliers were removed to improve quality.  \nDespite these challenges, the resulting dataset provides a high -quality resource for developing reliable  \nand interpretable models for sensationalism detection.  \n \nAnnotation Process  \nTo ensure high -quality anno tations, the dataset was processed using OpenAI \u2019s GPT -4 model, \nconfigured for advanced text analysis. The annotation task involved scoring headlines for \nsensationalism and emotional arousal based on a 5 -point Likert scale [2 3], where 0 indicated \"Not at al l \nsensational\" and 4 indicated \"Very sensational.\" The model was guided using a few -shot prompting \ntechnique, which involved providing annotated examples to inform subsequent predictions. Human \noversight was employed to review and validate the annotations,  ensuring consistency and minimizing \nerrors. Each headline was scored according to the following Likert scale:  \n(0): Not at all sensational (0 -0.75)  \n(1): Not too much (0.76 -1.50)  \n(2): Somewhat sensational (1.51 -2.25)  \n(3): Fairly sensational (2.26 -3.25)  \n(4): Very sensational (3.26 -4) \n \nThe process was automated and conducted in batches of 10 headlines with a 5 -second delay between \nbatches to manage API limitations and maintain uniformity. This automation significantly enhanced \nefficiency, enabling the consiste nt evaluation of all 30,424 headlines for both sensationalism and \nemotional arousal. During the annotation process, special care was taken to handle ambiguous headlines \nand conflicting annotations. A set of rules was developed to ensure that the model \u2019s predictions aligned \n                                                \n2 SENS -HEAD.xlsx   \n \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n7 \n with linguistic markers and contextual cues indicative of sensationalism, such as hyperbolic language, \nexclamatory punctuation, and emotionally charged phrases.  \n \nData Fields  \nThe SENS -HEAD dataset consists of 10 detailed columns, each repr esenting a specific attribute \nassociated with the headlines.

Sourced from Kaggle's \noriginal clickbait dataset.  \nClickbait \nStatus  Classified each  headline as either clickbait or non -\nclickbait based on its source. Clickbait platforms were \nlabelled as clickbait, while traditional sources were \nlabelled as non -clickbait.  Sourced from Kaggle's \noriginal clickbait dataset.  \nSensation \nScore  Assigned a scor e from 0 to 4 for sensationalism, \ndetermined using linguistic markers like hyperbole, \nsuperlatives, and emotionally charged phrases.  Annotated using OpenAI \u2019s \nGPT -4, reviewed by \nhuman annotators.  \nSensation \nReason  Provided the rationale behind the sensation  score based \non elements such as exaggerated claims, emotional \ntriggers (e.g., fear, excitement), and rhetorical devices.  GPT -4 annotation with \nhuman oversight.  \nEmotion  The primary emotion evoked, categorized into fear, \nanger, shock, excitement, or curios ity. Emotion \ndetection models and GPT -4 were used for final \nclassification.  GPT -4 assisted, human \nreview for accuracy.  \nArousal  Represents the emotional intensity, from low to high, \ntriggered by the headline, based on linguistic features \nlike exclamations,  urgency, and charged adjectives.  Annotated using OpenAI \u2019s \nGPT -4, reviewed by \nhuman annotators.  \nArousal \nScore  Numeric score (0 to 4) indicating arousal intensity. \nCalculated using text analysis algorithms that assess \nsentiment strength and emotional impac t. Calculated using NLP \nmodels and GPT -4, \nmanually verified.  \nArousal \nReason  Justifies the arousal score based on language intensity, \nword choice, and rhetorical devices that increase \nemotional impact.  Manually annotated with \nhuman verification, \nsupported by GPT -4. \nArousal \nCategory  Categorized the type of arousal (e.g., curiosity, fear, \nexcitement, anger) based on emotional analysis.  GPT -4 for categorization, \nmanual review for \naccuracy.  \nHeadline \nCategory  The subject matter (e.g., politics, sports, entertainment, \nhealth), identified using topic modelling (LDA) for \ntopical classification.  Topic modelling using \nLatent Dirichlet Allocation \n(LDA ) [24] \n \nThe inclusion of emotion, arousal, and headline categories allows for deeper insights into how \nsensationalism operates within different contexts and across various emotional triggers.  \n \n \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n8 \n Dataset Characteristics  \nThe SENS -HEAD dataset offers a balanced mix of sensational and neutral headlines, crucial for training \nmodels capable of unbiased predictions . The distribution ensures that the models can effectively handle \nboth extremes of sensationalism. Headlines span a wide array of topics, including politics, health, \nsports, and entertainment. This diversity ensures that the dataset is representative of re al-world media, \nmaking the findings applicable across multiple domains. By incorporating sources from tabloid -style \noutlets and traditional journalism, the dataset captures a variety of writing styles and sensationalism \ntactics, providing a rich training g round for machine learning models.  \n \nSteps were taken to reduce potential biases in source selection and annotation. For instance, clickbait \nand non -clickbait sources were carefully curated to represent different journalistic practices, ensuring \nthat the da taset does not overly favour one style. The current dataset focuses on English -language \nheadlines. Future iterations could include multilingual data to account for cultural differences in \nsensationalism, as well as multimedia elements (e.g., images, videos ) to capture non -textual cues that \namplify sensationalism.  \n \nNecessity of the SENS -HEAD Dataset  \nExisting datasets, such as the News Clickbait Dataset [11] and similar resources, provide valuable \ninsights into clickbait detection but fail to address sensationalism as a distinct phenomenon. Clickbait \nprimarily focuses on misleading cues designed to dri ve clicks, often overlooking the emotional arousal \nand linguistic exaggeration central to sensationalism. Sensationalism goes beyond click -maximization \nstrategies to evoke deeper psychological responses, shaping public perception and trust in media. Most \navailable datasets have a limited scope, emphasizing clickbait without explicitly labelling or analyzing \nsensationalism. Additionally, they lack detailed annotations for emotional intensity and arousal \ncategories, which are crucial for a nuanced understandi ng of sensationalism. Few datasets provide \nfeatures suitable for explainable AI approaches, such as detailed reasoning for label assignments or \ninterpretable linguistic features.  \n \nThe SENS -HEAD dataset was specifically created to address these gaps and pro vide a comprehensive \nresource for sensationalism detection. Unlike existing datasets, SENS -HEAD focuses on emotional and \nlinguistic patterns by including fields such as Emotion, Arousal, and Sensation Reason, enabling a \ndeeper exploration of the psychologi cal triggers used in sensational headlines. Furthermore, the dataset \nsupports explainable AI approaches with features like Sensation Reason and detailed annotations, \nenhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of models built using this data. Its br oad coverage \nacross diverse domains, including politics, health, entertainment, and sports, makes it more \nrepresentative of real -world media compared to other domain -specific datasets. Additionally, SENS -\nHEAD ensures a balanced representation of sensationa l and neutral headlines, promoting unbiased \ntraining and robust model performance across different classes. By addressing these limitations, the \nSENS -HEAD dataset offers a unique and essential resource for advancing the study of sensationalism \nand bridging  the gap between clickbait detection and broader emotional and linguistic analysis in news \nheadlines.  \n \nFeature Extraction  \nSensational headlines are often crafted to evoke strong emotional responses or curiosity, using \nexaggerated language, informal tones, and certain types of punctuation. By focusing on these linguistic \nelements, we can develop models capable of identifying sensational content, helping to address issues \nrelated to misinformation, clickbait, and ethical news dissemination. In this study, fea ture engineering \nplays a critical role in detecting sensationalism in news headlines by extracting a variety of linguistic, \nsyntactic, and semantic features  as depicted in figure 2 .  \n \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n9 \n  \nFig.2. Sensationalism Feature Wheel  \n \nThese features are designed to capture different aspects of the language used in headlines, ranging from \nsimple lexical patterns to more complex syntactic structures and emotional tones. By analyzing these \nfeatures, the model can differentiate between sens ational headlines and more neutral ones. The \nfollowing sub -section breaks down the different categories of features used in the study and explaining \ntheir significance in detecting sensationalism.  \n \nLexical Features  \nLexical features focus on individual word s and phrases within the headlines, providing insight into the \nlanguage \u2019s simplicity or complexity, as well as the presence of exaggerated or sensational terms.  \n \n\uf0b7 Number of Words in Headline : The total word count in each headline was extracted to \ndetermine the length. The total word count is important because shorter, punchier headlines \ntend to be more sensational. For example, \"Shocking! You Won't Believe What Happened!\" \ncontains fewer words but is highly attention -grabbing compared to a more neutral, fact -based \nheadline like \"Survey Results Released on Public Opinion.\"  The word count was calculated by \ntokenizing the headline and counting the tokens.  \n \n\uf0b7 Stop Words and Ratios : The ratio of stop words (e.g., \"the,\" \"is\") to content words (e.g., nouns, \nverbs) he lps identify whether the language is more informal or simplified. Sensational headlines \noften use simpler language to appeal to a wider audience. For example, a headline like \"This Is \nWhat You Need to Know\"  uses more stop words than a more complex version,  such as \"Key \nFindings in Latest Research Report.\"  A predefined list of stop words was used for this purpose.  \n \n\uf0b7 Superlative Word s: Superlative adjectives and adverbs (e.g., \"best,\" \"most amazing\") are \nfrequently used in sensational headlines to exaggerate the importance or appeal of an event or \nproduct. For example, \"The Best Strategy You'll Ever Find!\"  is clearly designed to entice  clicks \nthrough exaggeration, compared to a more factual version, \"Effective Strategies for Time \n\n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n10 \n Management.\"  The Superlative Lexicon consisting of 594 words, was created. These  words \nwere extracted from multiple sources, including internet lists and five key NLTK corpora: \nBrown, Gutenberg, Movie Reviews, Reuters, and Webtext.  \n \n\uf0b7 Hyperbole (Extreme Case Formulation) : Hyperbole is another common tactic used to \nsensationalize headlines, often through extreme language. For example, \"The Worst Day in \nHistory!\"  uses hyperbole to amplify the emotional impact, compared to \"A Challenging Day \nfor Many.\"  A custom lexicon of 160 hyperbolic terms was created to detect exaggerated or \nextreme language, which is commonly found in sensational headlines. These terms were \nextracted using regular expressions to identify exaggerated claims.  \n \nSyntactic Features  \nSyntactic features focus on the structure of sentences and the use of parts of speech, which can signal \nthe formality or informality of the language. Sensational headlines often rely on informal, simple \nsyntactic structures.  \n \n\uf0b7 Formality Measure (F -measure) : This feature helps distinguish between formal and informal \nlanguage by analyzing the frequency of different parts of speech. For example, formal headlines \nlike \"Government Enacts Comprehensive Legislation\"  typically contain more nouns, \nadjectives, and prepositions. In contrast, informal, sensational headlines like \"You Won't \nBelieve What They Did!\"  rely more on pronouns and verbs, making the language more dynamic \nand casual.  This feature measures the degree of formality in a headline by calculating the \nfrequency of different parts of speech. Formal language typically uses more nouns, adjectives, \nprepositions, and articles, while informal language relies on pronouns , verbs, adverbs, and \ninterjections. The F -measure is calculated using the Heylighen and Dewaele [25] formula which \nis given as follows:  \n \n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66\n= (\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e +\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e +\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e +\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e )\u2212(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e +\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e +\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e )+100\n2 \n \nwhere,  \no Noun Frequency (nounfreq):  Higher noun frequencies are associated with more formal \nlanguage as nouns provide specific information and descriptions.  \no Adjective Frequency ( adjectivefreq):  Higher adjective frequencies add more detail and \nspecificity, which is also characteristic of formal language.  \no Preposition Frequency (prepositionfreq):  Prepositions contribute to sentence structure \nand complexity, making the language more f ormal.  \no Article Frequency (articlefreq):  Articles (e.g., \"the,\" \"a,\" \"an\") mark the definiteness \nof noun phrases and are common in formal writing.  \n \nThe negative components lower the formality score:  \no Pronoun Frequency (pronounfreq):  Pronouns are more common in informal language \nas they replace specific nouns, making sentences less detailed.  \no Verb Frequency (verbfreq):  Simple verbs are typically used in informal language as \nthey make sentences more dynamic and concise.  \no Adverb Frequency  (adverbfreq):  Adverbs often modify verbs and express emotions, \ncontributing to a conversational tone.  \no Interjection Frequency (interjectionfreq):  Interjections (e.g., \"Wow!\", \"Oh no!\") are \ncommon in spoken, informal language.  \n \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n11 \n The inclusion of the constant  100 and division by 2 ensures that the score is within a \nreasonable range, typically between 0 and 100, making it easier to interpret and compare across \ntexts.  \n \n\uf0b7 Elongated Words (EW) : Elongated words, such as \"soooo amazing,\"  are often used to convey \nempha sis in sensational headlines. They indicate informal language designed to amplify \nemotions. For instance, \"This Is Sooo Cool!\"  is more sensational than \"This Is Cool.\"  \n \n\uf0b7 Punctuation Marks (PUNC) : Sensational headlines frequently employ punctuation to \ndramat ize their message. For example, exclamation marks or ellipses are often used to create \nsuspense or urgency, as in \"Breaking News: Market Crash Looms!\"  or \"You Won't Believe What \nHappened Next \u2026\" \n \n\uf0b7 Capital Letters (CL) : Headlines that use capital letters to e mphasize certain words often \nappear more sensational. For instance, \"INCREDIBLE OFFER!\"  grabs attention far more \naggressively than \"Incredible Offer.\"  \n \nSemantic Features  \nSemantic features  focus on the meaning and emotional tone of the headlines. Sensational headlines \noften convey strong emotions or subjective opinions to provoke reactions from readers.  \n \n\uf0b7 Sentiment Analysis : Sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, and compound) were \ncalculated to assess the emotional tone of each headline. Headlines that evoke strong positive \nor negative emotions are more likely to be sensational. For example, a headline like \"Horrific \nTragedy Strikes!\"  contains highly negative sentiment, compared to a  neutral, fact -based \nheadline like \"Accident Reported on Highway.\"   Sentiment analysis tools were used to extract \nthis information.  \n \n\uf0b7 Sentence Subjectivity and Objectivity Evaluation : This feature evaluates whether a headline \nis subjective (opinion -based) or objective (fact -based). Sensational headlines are typically more \nsubjective, aiming to provoke emotional responses. For example, \"The Best Product You Must \nTry!\"  is subjective, while \"New Product Released in Stores\"  is objective.  \n \nReadability Features  \nReadability features measure the linguistic complexity of headlines. Sensational headlines are often \nsimpler to make them more accessible to a broader audience.  \n \n\uf0b7 Informality (Flesch -Kincaid Readability)  [26]: This feature measures the degree of \ninformality  in the headline \u2019s language. Sensational headlines typically aim for a conversational \ntone, such as \" Find Out How This Hack Can Save You Time!\"  compared to \"Time -Saving \nTechniques Explained.\"  \n \n TF-IDF Features  \nTF-IDF features [27] measure the importance of  individual terms in the context of the entire corpus of \nheadlines, helping to identify sensational terms that appear frequently in sensational headlines but rarely \nin neutral ones.  \n \n\uf0b7 TF-IDF with Stop Words : By including stop words, this feature helps captu re frequently used \nphrases that contribute to sensationalism, such as \"the best\"  or \"you won \u2019t believe.\"  \n \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n12 \n \uf0b7 TF-IDF without Stop Words : Excluding stop words refines the analysis by focusing on \ncontent words that are more meaningful and indicative of sensationalism.  \n \nTopic and Content -Based Features  \nTopic -based features help identify whether the content of the headline relates to sensational topics like \ncrime, disasters, or scandals.  \n \n\uf0b7 Sensational Story Content : Headlines related to crime, disasters, an d scandals are often \nsensational by nature. For example, \"Massive Earthquake Destroys City!\"  is more likely to be \nsensational compared to \"City Experiences Minor Earthquake.\"  \n \nThis comprehensive set of features was extracted and processed using various NLP  techniques and \ntools, which are outlined in the following table along with the specific tools used for each feature:  \n \nTable 2.

WordNet, Regular \nexpressions  \n \nModel Training  \nThe model training process was designed to be an incremental, multi -stage approach to ensure that the \nmost significant features were identified and used effectively. Each stage aimed to improve the model \u2019s \nability to detect sensationalism in headlines by refining the feature set and employing ensemble ma chine \nlearning models to enhance classification accuracy.  The process involved three key stages: assessing \nthe contribution of individual features, determining an optimal threshold using Principal Component \nAnalysis (PCA)  [28], and training various ensembl e models on all features to identify the best -\nperforming algorithm.  \n \nStage 1: Train with Individual Features  \nThe first stage focused on training the model using each feature individually. By evaluating each feature \nin isolation, we were able to assess its individual contribution to detecting sensationalism. This step \nhelps to identify the most significant features that impact model performance before moving to a more \ncomplex, multi -feature approach.  Training with individual features allows us to gain insigh ts into which \nfeatures are most predictive of sensationalism. Some features, such as sentiment analysis and \npunctuation usage, may have a more direct impact on the classification of sensational headlines than \nothers like the number of words or readability scores. Evaluating features in isolation ensures that we \ncan identify and prioritize features that provide the most significant improvement in model \nperformance.  \n \nEach of the following features was trained individually to assess its impact on the overall m odel's ability \nto detect sensationalism. The Number of Words feature was used to evaluate the effect of headline \nlength, while the Number of Stop Words captured the presence of common words that typically \ncontribute to simpler, more accessible language. Th e Ratio of Stop Words to Content Words was \ncalculated to measure the balance between stop words and meaningful content words, providing insight \ninto the complexity of the headline's language structure. The Flesch -Kincaid Readability score was used \nto asses s the linguistic complexity of the headlines, and the Subjectivity and Objectivity feature \nevaluated whether the headline appealed to emotions (subjective) or reported factual information \n(objective). To further capture emotional tone, Sentiment Analysis w as performed, generating scores \nfor negative, neutral, positive, and compound sentiments. Additionally, the Elongated Words feature \ntracked exaggerated word forms (such as \"sooo\") commonly used in sensational content. The \nPunctuation feature analyzed the p resence of dramatic punctuation marks, including exclamation marks, \nquestion marks, ellipses, and currency symbols, which are often employed to amplify the headline \u2019s \nimpact. Lastly, TF -IDF with Stop Words measured term importance by including stop words, while TF -\nIDF without Stop Words refined this measure by excluding them, helping to highlight the most \nmeaningful words related to sensationalism.  \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n14 \n This phase was crucial in isolating which features had the greatest impact on classification accuracy. \nBy trai ning with these individual features, we developed a clear understanding of which attributes of \nheadlines were most likely to indicate sensationalism.  \n \nStage 2: Calculate Optimal Threshold for XGBoost  \nOnce the most impactful individual features were identif ied, the next step was to enhance the model by \nusing Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was applied specifically to the emotion data to reduce \nthe dimensionality and focus on the most significant components.  PCA helps in simplifying the dataset \nby tra nsforming the emotion features into principal components. This transformation retains the most \ncritical information while reducing complexity, making it easier for the model to interpret and classify \nthe data. PCA is especially useful when dealing with hig h-dimensional data like emotion scores, where \nthere might be correlations between variables.  The st eps in Stage 2  included : \n \n\uf0b7 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) : PCA was applied to the emotion column to identify \nthe most significant components that contributed to classifying headlines as sensational or non -\nsensational. This step helped reduce noise in the data by focusing on the key features that had \nthe most impact on the classification.  \n\uf0b7 Combine Sensation and Arousal Scores : After applying PCA, the sensation score and arousal \nscore were combined with the principal components. These scores represent the intensity of \nsensationalism,  and the emotional arousal evoked by the headline, respectively. By combining \nthese scores, we created a more comprehensiv e feature set that captured both the sensational \nand emotional aspects of headlines.  \n\uf0b7 XGBoost Baseline Model : The combined features (sensation, arousal, and PCA components) \nwere then used to train an initial XGBoost classifier  [29]. XGBoost  is a gradient boosting \nalgorithm known for its robustness and efficiency in classification tasks. The optimal threshold \nfor classification was determined based on this model \u2019s performance, allowing the model to \nmake more accurate predictions when classify ing headlines as sensational or non -sensational.  \n \nStage 3: Train Final Models  \nIn the final stage of the training process, the focus was on combining the most relevant features into a \ncomprehensive feature set to maximize model performance while reducing co mputational complexity.  \nBefore concatenating all features for model training, we optimized feature selection by applying a \nvariance threshold of 0.001 to remove constant or near -constant features. This step effectively reduced \nthe feature set from 52,190 to 1,236 features, eliminating those that contributed little to the model's \npredictive power. This process not only minimized the risks of overfitting but also conserved \ncomputational resources and improved model interpretability by narrowing the focus to m ore \nmeaningful features. By concatenating all selected features (except for TF -IDF without stop words), we \ncreated a complete and representative dataset for training. The objective was to leverage this enhanced \nfeature set to explore and compare the perfor mance of multiple ensemble machine learning models, \neach offering unique strengths in handling complex data structures.  \n \nEnsemble learning, a powerful technique that combines predictions from multiple models, was central \nto this stage. By incorporating mod els such as XGBoost, CATBoost, AdaBoost, and Random Forest, \nwe aimed to boost predictive accuracy through the complementary nature of these algorithms. Ensemble \nmethods are known for their ability to reduce overfitting and enhance generalization by combini ng the \nstrengths of individual models into a more robust final prediction. This diverse set of models allowed \nus to exploit various aspects of the data, including linguistic, syntactic, and semantic features, ultimately \nproducing more reliable results in d etecting sensationalism in news headlines.

It focuses on correcting the \nmistakes of previous models, improving overall performance in \ndetecting sensational headlines.  \nCATBoost  Another gradient boosting algorithm, CATBoost is particularly efficient \nfor handling categorical data and is a faster alternative to XGBoost \nwithout sacrificing performance. Trained on all features.  \nRandom Forest  A traditional ensemble method, Ra ndom Forest builds multiple decision \ntrees and averages their predictions to improve classification accuracy \nwhile reducing the risk of overfitting. It was trained using all available \nfeatures.  \nCATBoost on Test \nSet In the final evaluation step, CATBoost  was tested on the test set to \nmeasure its performance in detecting sensationalism in unseen data, \nproviding insights into the model's generalization capabilities.  \n \nBy following this methodical approach, we ensured that the model was not only capable of a ccurately \ndetecting sensationalism but also robust against noise and less impactful features.  Each model was \nevaluated for its ability to classify sensational headlines accurately, and the most effective model was \nselected for further analysis.  \n \nModel Impl ementation and Evaluation  \nIn this section, we detail the steps taken for model implementation and evaluation, aiming to detect \nsensationalism in news headlines. We selected XGBoost  as the baseline model due to its robustness and \nefficiency in handling structured data, making it ideal for our dataset. To compare performance, we also \nemployed other ensemble models such as AdaBoost, CATBoost, and Random Forest. These models \noffer disti nct advantages in handling complex, high -dimensional datasets, making them valuable for \nbenchmarking.  We chose not to experiment with contextual embeddings and stacked models in this \nstudy to prioritize explainability, computational feasibility, and alignm ent with our research objectives. \nAdvanced techniques like BERT and stacked models, while powerful, often reduce interpretability, \nwhich is critical for practical applications in media ethics and policymaking.  \n \nGiven the computational constraints and the high dimensionality of the feature space, we opted for \nRandom Search instead of Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. To ensure consistent performance \nacross different subsets of the data, we used 5 -fold cross -validation (n_splits = 5).

This metric provides a comprehensive \nevaluation of the model \u2019s ability to detect both sensational and non -sensational headlines accurately. \nThe model implementation followed a structured approach. First,  we split the dataset into training and \nvalidation sets to assess the models' performance on unseen data. Each model was then trained using \nthe optimized feature set and hyperparameters, with evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and \nF1-score calcu lated for both the sensational and non -sensational classes. Finally, the best -performing \nmodel was further tested on a separate test set to assess its generalization capabilities, ensuring it \nperformed well beyond the validation data.  \n \nTable 4 below summar izes the key hyperparameters used across the four ensemble machine learning \nmodels. While these models share common parameter types such as the number of estimators, learning \nrate, tree depth, and feature subsampling, each model's implementation varies sli ghtly. For example, \nwhile XGBoost and CATBoost use regularization and subsampling techniques, Random Forest relies \non bootstrap sampling and does not use a learning rate. AdaBoost, on the other hand, uses different \nalgorithms (SAMME, SAMME.R) to adjust its  boosting approach.  This table highlights the similarities \nand differences in parameter configurations across the models, illustrating how each model was fine -\ntuned to address performance and computational efficiency in our experiments.  \n \nTable 4 : Hyperpara meter tuning parameters for ensemble models.  \nParameter Type   XGBoost   AdaBoost  CATBoost  Random Forest  \nNumber of \nEstimators  'n_estimators': \n[100, 300, 500]  'n_estimators': [100, \n300, 500]  'iterations': [100, \n300, 500]  'n_estimators': \n[100, 300, 500]  \nLearning Rate  'learning_rate': \n[0.01, 0.1, 0.3]  'learning_rate': [0.01, \n0.1, 0.3]  'learning_rate': \n[0.01, 0.1, 0.3]  N/A \nTree Depth  'max_depth': [3, \n6, 9] 'base_estimator__ma\nx_depth': [3, 6, 9]  'depth': [3, 6, 9]  'max_depth': [3, \n6, 9] \nMin Samples \nper Spl it 'min_child_weig\nht': [1, 3]  'base_estimator__mi\nn_weight_fraction_le\naf': [0, 0.1]  'l2_leaf_reg': [1, \n3] 'min_samples_lea\nf': [1, 3]  \nFeature \nSubsampling  'colsample_bytr\nee': [0.8, 1.0]  'base_estimator__ma\nx_features': [0.8, 1.0]  'colsample_bylev\nel': [0.8, 1.0] 'max_features': \n[0.8, 1.0]  \nRow \nSubsampling  'subsample': \n[0.8, 1.0]  N/A 'subsample': [0.8, \n1.0] 'bootstrap': [True, \nFalse]  \nRegularization  'gamma': [0, 0.1]  N/A 'random_strength\n': [0, 0.1]  'min_impurity_de\ncrease': [0, 0.1]  \nModel -Specific \nParameters  N/A 'algorithm': \n['SAMME', \n'SAMME.R']  N/A N/A \n \nModel Performance and Evaluation  \nTo evaluate the effectiveness of each model, we analyzed the performance metrics using the validation \nset.

However, \nthe nearest works in the field provide valuable comparisons for contextualizing our contributions.  \n \nZhang and Kejriwal [22] relied on linguistic features such as part -of-speech tags, punctuation \nfrequency, sentence length, and polarity/subjectivity scores, uti lizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) \nclassifier for sensationalism detection. Their study focused on U.S. political news headlines from 2017 \nand 2019, sourced from MediaBiasFactCheck.com, with an emphasis on concept drift. While their \nmodels achieved a pr ecision of 0.91 and recall of 0.93 on 2017 data, their performance declined \nsignificantly on 2019 data, highlighting challenges in generalizability due to evolving linguistic trends.  \n \nIn contrast, our study introduces a novel approach, leveraging advanced ensemble models like \nXGBoost, CATBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, enriched with domain -specific features such as \nSensation Score, Emotion, and Arousal. Using the SENS -HEAD dataset, which spans diverse domains \nbeyond politics, including health, entertainment, and sports, our models demonstrated higher stability \nand broader applicability. CATBoost emerged as the most consistent model, achieving an F1 -score of \n0.68 for both sensational and non -sensational classes, while XGBoost with optimized thresholds \nreached an F1 -score of 0.66 for the sensational class, indicating robust performance across classes.  \n \nSimilarly, Gonz\u00e1lez Esparza et al. [31] focused on Spanish health -related headlines u sing deep learning \nmodels like Multilingual BERT, BETO, and XLM -RoBERTa. Their models achieved impressive \nresults, with F1 -scores reaching 0.94, and XLM -RoBERTa showing strong recall (96%). However, their \napproach was limited to a single domain and languag e, and it lacked the interpretability mechanisms \ncentral to our SHAP -based analysis. Our framework balances performance and explainability, making \nit more adaptable for real -world applications across multiple domains.  \n \nThe integration of SHAP analysis in o ur study provides critical transparency, enabling the identification \nof influential features such as headline length, stop word frequency, and sentiment polarity. This \napproach not only enhances model interpretability but also ensures practical applicabili ty for content \nmoderation and ethical journalism.  This comparative analysis underscores that while prior works have \nmade strides in related areas, our study uniquely combines linguistic features, explainable models, and \nbroad domain coverage to advance sen sationalism detection.

One of the most effective explainability \ntechniques is the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [6] framework, which provides global and \nlocal explanations for individual predictions. SHAP assigns an importance value to each feature in a \nway that the sum of the feature contributions equals the difference between the actual and the baseline \nprediction. SHAP is grounded in cooperative gam e theory and uses Shapley values to explain the \ncontribution of each feature. This is important in applications such as sensationalism detection, where \nunderstanding why the model identifies a headline as sensational can inform future improvements in \nmedia  ethics and content regulation. In this context, SHAP values provide transparency, helping to \npinpoint which linguistic features most heavily influence the classification of headlines as sensational \nor non -sensational.  \n \nThe SHAP analysis was conducted to i nterpret the machine learning model \u2019s predictions and assess the \nsignificance of different features in detecting sensationalism in news headlines. SHAP is particularly \nsuited for explaining the contribution of various lexical, syntactic, and semantic featu res used in this \nstudy.  The SHAP Feature Importance Summary in Figure 10 provides a clear visualization of the most \ninfluential features driving the model's predictions in detecting sensationalism.  \n \n \nFig. 10. SHAP Feature Importance Summary  \n \nThe SHAP feature importance summary shows the average impact of each feature on the model's output \n(sensation detection). Here, the number of stop words and number of words in the headline emerged as \nthe most influential features, suggesting that shorter, simpler h eadlines with fewer content words tend \nto be more sensational. Negative sentiment and compound sentiment scores also contributed \nsignificantly to the model \u2019s predictions, indicating that headlines with strong negative emotions or a \nmix of emotions were mor e likely to be classified as sensational.  From this summary, we selected the \ntop seven features \u2014number of stop words, number of words in the headline, negative sentiment \n\n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n24 \n (num_neg), compound sentiment (num_compound), neutral sentiment (num_neu), contracted word \nforms, and double quotes count \u2014to create detailed SHAP dependence plots.  \n \nSHAP dependence plots help visualize the relationship between individual features and the model \u2019s \noutput, allowing us to see how the feature's value affects the prediction. Impo rtantly, these plots also \nreveal interactions between features that may not be obvious from feature importance alone. The SHAP \nDependence Plot in Figure 1 1 highlights the relationship between the number of stop words and their \nimpact on model predictions for sensationalism.  \n \n \nFig. 11. SHAP Dependence Plot for Number of Stop Words  on Test Set  \n \nThis dependence plot highlights the relationship between the number of stop words in a headline and \nthe SHAP value. The plot shows a positive correlation, where headlines with more stop words (above \n0.2 on the x -axis) are more likely to be predicted as sen sational. The breakthrough point occurs around \n0.4, where the model becomes increasingly confident in predicting a headline as sensational. The colour  \ngradient also shows how the number of words in the headline interacts with this feature.  \nThe SHAP Depende nce Plot in Figure 1 2 illustrates how the number of words in the headline influences \nthe model's predictions for sensationalism.  \n \n \nFig.12.

As the number of words increases, the model starts assigning higher SHAP values, especially \nin the range of 0.3 -0.4, indicating a higher likelihood of the headline being classified a s sensational. \nThe interaction with stop words further emphasizes how shorter, pithy headlines with fewer content \nwords tend to be more sensational.  \n \n\n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n25 \n The SHAP dependence plot in figure 13 highlights the relationship between compound sentiment scores \nand th e model's predictions. Compound sentiment captures the overall emotional tone of the headline, \nranging from extremely negative to extremely positive. The U -shaped curve indicates that both highly \npositive and highly negative headlines tend to be classified  as sensational, with neutral headlines \nshowing a lower likelihood of being classified this way. The interaction with the neutral sentiment \nscores (num_neu) further emphasizes that headlines with stronger emotional tones, whether positive or \nnegative, are more likely to be considered sensational.  \n \n \nFig. 13 .

The color gradient representing neutral sentiment \n(num_neu) reinforces this, showing that highly negative headlines are less neutral and, thus, more \nlikely to  evoke stronger emotional reactions, contributing to their sensational classification.  \n \n \n Fig. 14 . SHAP Dependence Plot for Negative Sentiment on Test Set  \n \nThe SHAP dependence plot for contracted word forms in Figure 15 demonstrates the relationship \nbetween the use of contractions (e.g., \"won't,\" \"can't\") and the likelihood of a headline being classified \nas sensational. As the count of contracted word forms increases, the SHAP value also rises, suggesting \nthat headlines with more contractions are more  likely to be sensational. This trend becomes prominent \naround a contracted word count of 0.2 -0.3, where the SHAP values show a sharp increase. The colour \ngradient representing the number of stop words further highlights that higher numbers of contracted \nforms and stop words both positively contribute to sensationalism detection.  \n \n\n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n26 \n  \nFig. 15 . SHAP Dependence Plot for Contracted Word Forms Count on Test Set  \n \nThe SHAP dependence plot for double quotes count in Figure 16 illustrates the relationship between \nthe use of double quotation marks and the model's classification of sensational headlines. As the count \nof double quotes increases, the SHAP value rises, indicating that headlines with more quoted text are \nmore likely to be considered sensational. This relati onship becomes evident around a double quote \ncount of 0.3, where the SHAP values show a sharp increase. The interaction with stop words, shown by \nthe colour gradient, further emphasizes the role of simple, quoted phrases in sensational headlines.  \n \nFig. 16 . SHAP Dependence Plot for Double Quotes Count on Test Set  \n \nIn this analysis, we can observe the importance of various categories of linguistic features \u2014lexical, \nsyntactic, semantic, and readability \u2014in detecting sensationalism. Lexical features, like the n umber of \nstop words and word count, emerged as key predictors of sensationalism, reflecting simpler language \nand shorter headlines' tendency to grab attention. Semantic features, such as sentiment (negative and \ncompound scores), further highlight the emoti onal appeal present in sensational content. Additionally, \nsyntactic features, like the use of contracted word forms and punctuation (e.g., double quotes), \ncontribute significantly by pointing out informal or dramatic sentence structures. These diverse feat ure \ncategories work together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the linguistic strategies \nused in crafting sensational headlines.  \n \nLimitations  \nWhile this study has made significant strides in detecting sensationalism through linguistic featur e \nanalysis and the use of explainable machine learning models, several limitations must be acknowledged:  \n\uf0b7 Bias in Data Sources : The dataset used in this study primarily consists of headlines from well -\nknown online news sources. This introduces potential bias, as these outlets may follow specific \neditorial standards that affect the tone, language, or level of sensationalism in their headlines. \nSmaller, regional, or niche media outlets, which may exhibit different sensationalism patterns, \nwere not included,  potentially limiting the generalizability of the results.  \n\n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n27 \n \uf0b7 Granularity of Annotation : Sensation and emotion annotations rely heavily on linguistic \nmarkers and Likert scale ratings. While OpenAI \u2019s GPT -4 assisted in the annotation process, \nthese models are t rained on existing patterns, which may not capture more subtle variations in \nsensationalism. Additionally, human oversight, though incorporated, may introduce subjective \nbias in interpreting and categorizing sensational content, especially with borderline cases.  \n\uf0b7 Simplification of Sensationalism : The study simplifies sensationalism by focusing on lexical \nand syntactic features, leaving out cultural, contextual, and psychological factors that may \ninfluence the perception of sensationalism. Sensationalism is o ften context -dependent, and the \nsame headline might be considered sensational in one context but not in another. The model \ndoes not account for these variations, limiting its effectiveness in understanding the full \nspectrum of sensationalism.  \n\uf0b7 Language and Cultural Limitations : The dataset is predominantly in English, which may limit \nthe applicability of the findings to other languages or cultural contexts. Sensationalism can \nmanifest differently across languages and cultures, with unique stylistic and rhetorical devices \nthat are not captured in this study. Extending the dataset to include multilingual sources could \nimprove the model's robustness in global news contexts.  \n\uf0b7 Limitations of Sentiment and Readability Analysis : While sentiment analysis and read ability \nmetrics (like Flesch -Kincaid) are useful indicators, they have their shortcomings. For instance, \nreadability metrics may label emotionally charged but grammatically simple headlines as highly \nreadable, without considering the emotional complexity o f the content. Similarly, sentiment \nanalysis tools like VADER may not accurately capture nuanced or sarcastic sentiments, \npotentially leading to misclassifications of sensational content.  \n\uf0b7 Real -World Applicability : Implementing this model in real -world appl ications, such as content \nmoderation systems or journalistic ethics platforms, poses challenges. The dynamic nature of \nonline news, where language trends and styles evolve rapidly, may require frequent retraining \nof the model to stay effective. Additionall y, the system \u2019s effectiveness in contexts where \nmultimedia elements (images, videos) accompany headlines has not been addressed.  \n\uf0b7 Overreliance on Textual Features : The study relies exclusively on textual features to detect \nsensationalism, which may overlook  multimodal signals like images, videos, or layout, often \nused to amplify the sensational impact of news stories. In many cases, sensationalism is \nconveyed not only through text but through visuals and presentation style, which this model \ndoes not capture.  \n\uf0b7 Computational Complexity : The use of SHAP for model interpretability, while valuable for \nunderstanding feature contributions, introduces significant computational overhead. SHAP \nvalues, especially when calculated for large datasets, require substantial co mputational \nresources, making real -time implementation of sensationalism detection challenging, \nparticularly in resource -constrained environments like mobile devices or real -time journalism \nplatforms.  \n\uf0b7 Lack of Human -Centred Evaluation : While the study evalu ates model performance through \nmetrics such as precision, recall, and F1 -score, it does not consider user studies or human -\ncentred evaluations. Sensationalism detection systems would benefit from feedback from \njournalists, readers, and regulators to ensure  the model aligns with human expectations and \nethical standards in news reporting.  \n\uf0b7 Feature Selection and Dimensionality : Although steps were taken to optimize the feature set, \nthe high -dimensional nature of textual data still presents challenges. Some pote ntially valuable \nfeatures may have been overlooked or insufficiently explored due to the complexity of natural \nlanguage and the necessity of dimensionality reduction.  \n \nDespite these limitations, the study provides a solid foundation for future research to address these \nchallenges and further enhance the model's performance and applicability.  \n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n28 \n  \nMitigation Strategies  \nTo address the identified limitations, several mitigation strategies can be implemented to enhance the \nmodel \u2019s robustness, applicability, and pra cticality. First, the issue of bias in data sources can be \nmitigated by expanding the dataset to include headlines from smaller, regional, and niche media outlets. \nThis would provide a more comprehensive view of sensationalism patterns across diverse edito rial \ncontexts. Additionally, incorporating multilingual and culturally diverse headlines can address the \nlanguage and cultural limitations, ensuring the model captures the stylistic and rhetorical variations of \nsensationalism across different regions.  \n \nFor improving the granularity of annotation, advanced annotation techniques, such as semi -supervised \nlearning and active learning, can be employed to refine the labelling process and reduce reliance on \nsubjective human judgment. These methods, coupled with im proved training datasets, can help capture \nsubtle variations in sensationalism that may be missed in the current approach. Regular audits of \nannotated data with diverse reviewers can also help minimize subjective biases.  \nThe simplification of sensationalis m to lexical and syntactic features can be mitigated by integrating \ncontextual, cultural, and psychological factors into the analysis. This could involve incorporating \nexternal knowledge sources, such as sentiment lexicons specific to different cultures or  psychological \nstudies on media impact, to build a more nuanced understanding of sensationalism. Incorporating \ndomain adaptation techniques could also help tailor the model to context -specific interpretations.  \n \nTo overcome limitations in sentiment and read ability analysis, more advanced tools, such as fine -tuned \nBERT -based models for sentiment detection, can be utilized to better capture nuanced or sarcastic \nsentiments. Additionally, readability metrics could be enhanced to account for emotional complexity \nalongside grammatical simplicity, providing a more comprehensive analysis of sensational content. The \nchallenge of real -world applicability can be addressed by designing dynamic models capable of periodic \nretraining to adapt to evolving language trends. Fu rthermore, incorporating multimodal analysis that \nconsiders images, videos, and layout alongside text would significantly enhance the detection of \nsensationalism. This approach would provide a holistic view of how sensationalism is conveyed in \nmodern media . \n \nTo mitigate the computational complexity of SHAP, alternative interpretability techniques that balance \nefficiency and explainability, such as integrated gradients or LIME (Local Interpretable Model -\nAgnostic Explanations), can be explored. Developing lightweight versions of SHAP tailored for real -\ntime applications could further reduce computational overhead and facilitate practical deployment in \nresource -constrained environments. Finally, introducing human -centred evaluations, such as user \nstudies invo lving journalists, readers, and regulators, would ensure the model aligns with real -world \nexpectations and ethical standards. Feedback from these stakeholders can guide refinements to the \nsystem, making it more practical and impactful. By implementing thes e mitigation strategies, the \nframework can be significantly improved to address its current limitations and broaden its applicability \nin detecting sensationalism across diverse media contexts.  \n \nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  \n \nThis research has successfully developed a robust framework for detecting sensationalism in news \nheadlines through the integration of linguistic feature analysis and advanced machine learning models. \nThe creation of the novel SENS -HEAD dataset, featuring o ver 30,000 annotated headlines, provided a \nrich resource for exploring sensationalism. By leveraging features such as the number of stop words, \nsentiment polarity, readability, and syntactic patterns, we trained ensemble models, including XGBoost, \nCATBoost , and Random Forest, achieving balanced F1 -scores across both sensational and non -\n                                British Journal of Multidisciplinary and Advanced Studies ,6(3)1 -31, 2025  \n                                                                                                 Engineering and Technology                                                                                                            \n   Print ISSN: 2517 -276X   \n                                                                                                     Online ISSN: 2517 -2778  \n                                                                             https:// bjmas.org/index.php/bjmas/index                                                                                             \n29 \n sensational categories. The application of SHAP analysis enabled greater transparency, offering \ninterpretability into how specific features influenced the model's predictions . The results demonstrated \nthat certain features, such as the frequency of stop words and headline length, consistently played a \ncritical role in predicting sensationalism. SHAP values highlighted that these features exhibited non -\nlinear relationships with  model output, indicating that shorter, simpler headlines with emotionally \ncharged language were more likely to be classified as sensational. In terms of performance, CATBoost \nand XGBoost emerged as the most effective models, with F1 -scores nearing 0.66 fo r both classes. The \nintegration of superlative adjectives and an optimal threshold further refined model performance, \nillustrating the value of fine -tuning feature engineering in detecting exaggerated language commonly \nassociated with sensationalism.  \n \nThe policy impact of this research is significant, particularly in the realms of media regulation, ethical \njournalism, and content moderation. The insights derived from this study can inform policymakers and \nregulators on the prevalence and characteristics of sensationalism in news content, aiding the \ndevelopment of standards and guidelines to curb misleading or exaggerated reporting. The explainable \nnature of our framework also ensures alignment with ethical AI principles, allowing regulators and \nindustry stak eholders to adopt transparent tools for moderating sensational content. By promoting \naccountability in media practices, this research contributes to fostering trust in news and mitigating the \nadverse societal impacts of sensationalism.  \n \nGiven the computati onal demands and added complexity of contextual embeddings, our study \nprioritized creating a scalable and interpretable framework, with future work planned to explore these \nadvanced methods. We also aim to expand the dataset to include multilingual and reg ion-specific \nheadlines, addressing cultural biases and enhancing model applicability. Incorporating multimodal \ndata\u2014such as images, videos, and user interaction metrics  could further refine predictions by capturing \nvisual and interactive cues tied to sensa tional content. Future efforts will focus on developing efficient \nreal-time explainability techniques for practical deployment in settings like newsrooms. Additionally, \ninvestigating the psychological and societal impacts of sensationalism through longitud inal studies and \ndesigning personalized detection systems tailored to user preferences will promote ethical media \nconsumption and AI transparency. Real -world evaluations and collaborations will be key to ensuring \npractical usability and ethical alignment i n future advancements. By bridging the gap between research, \npractice, and policy, this study lays the groundwork for more responsible media practices and supports \nthe broader goal of creating an informed and ethically aware media ecosystem.  \n \nStatements an d Declarations  \nConflict of Interest: The Authors have no competing interests related to the work submitted for  \npublication.  \nFunding: No funding was received for this research.  \nData Availability Statement: A dataset will be made available on request  \nUse of Generative AI:  ChatGPT and Grammarly to assist with improving sentence ordering, reducing \nword count, and enhancing grammar.
