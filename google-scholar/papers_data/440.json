Using the LIWC\nframework to quantify these linguistic dimensions in a 5.5\nmillion tweets dataset covering 1,553 news publishers and\ncapturing over 480 million tweet interactions, we perform and\npresent a category-based analysis that captures the relative\nimpact that such features have on the user engagement rates\nassociated with different political bias and reliability cate-\ngories. While highly biased and unreliable publishers saw in-\ncreased engagement for clout and risk language, confirming\naudience biases, the least biased ones benefited more from\nanalytical language. Perception language, on the other hand,\nuniformly reduced engagement. These insights not only fur-\nther our understanding of persuasion tactics but also have im-\nplications for curbing misinformation by aligning recommen-\ndations with audience veracity and impartiality preferences.\n1 Introduction\nIn the evolving landscape of news consumption, Twitter has\nemerged as a primary source, with 53% of its users re-\nlying on it for their news, surpassing other platforms like\nFacebook (43%), Reddit (38%), YouTube (32%), and In-\nstagram (34%), according to a 2023 Pew Research Center\nstudy (Walker and Matsa 2023). However, the reliability and\nbias of news on Twitter vary, necessitating a closer exami-\nnation of the factors that influence users\u2019 exposure and en-\ngagement with different content.\nPrevious studies have highlighted the pivotal role of user\nengagement in shaping content visibility (Ksiazek, Peer, and\nLessard 2016), a sentiment echoed by Twitter\u2019s recent algo-\nrithm release (Twitter 2023), and examined factors affecting\nnews engagement, including emotions (Molina et al. 2023),\nnegativity (Kumar et al. 2018), cognitive inhibition (Bron-\nstein et al. 2021), and analytical thinking (Pennycook and\nRand 2020). However, the impact of the rhetorical attributes\nof the news posts themselves is less understood.\nTo address this void, in contrast to these works, we\nfocus specifically on how four linguistic dimensions af-\nfect user engagement with different categories of news.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.The four studied dimensions are analytic, clout, perceptual,\nand risk language. Encapsulated by the Linguistic Inquiry\nand Word Count (LIWC) framework, used by many prior\nworks (Jaidka et al. 2020; Khalid and Srinivasan 2020; Beel\net al. 2022), these attributes (see Sec. 3) represent credibil-\nity, authority projection, sensory grounding, and emotional\nprovocation, respectively. For example, analytic language\nreflects logic, evidence, and critical analysis, all conveying\ncredibility, appealing to rationality. Clout language denotes\nconfidence and expertise for projecting credibility. Percep-\ntual language grounds content in sensory observations rather\nthan abstractions. Finally, risk language plays to emotions\nusing defiant, shocking rhetoric, potentially increasing vis-\nceral appeal. Due to their important psychological effects,\neach of these dimensions has been the focus of other stud-\nies (Markowitz 2023; Mahmud, Chen, and Nichols 2014;\nCatherine A. Cherrstrom and Sherron 2023). However, no\nprior work has studied their effect on user engagement with\ndifferent categories of news on social media platforms.\nMotivated by the need for a nuanced understanding of\nhow these linguistic attributes engage diverse ideological au-\ndiences, we address the following Research Question (RQ):\nWithin audiences with different political bias and relia-\nbility preferences, how does the usage of certain forms\nof rhetoric shift engagement rates compared to baseline\nlevels without those attributes?\nBy engagement rate, here we refer to the number of interac-\ntions divided by impressions (views). Capitalizing on Twit-\nter\u2019s recent release of impressions statistics for all tweets\n(not available until Dec. 2022), we first compiled a unique\nand comprehensive dataset covering 5.5 million tweets (re-\nsponsible for 80.6 billion impressions and 483 million in-\nteractions) from 1,553 labelled U.S. news publishers over\na six-month period. Using this dataset, which we annotate\nwith LIWC rhetorical attributes, we then investigate how an-\nalytic, clout, perceptual, and risk language dimensions dif-\nferentially engage audiences from distinct bias and reliabil-\nity classes. Furthermore, by differentiating between Misin-\nformation andNon-Misinformation audiences and adopting\na granular five-tier bias taxonomy\u2014Left, Left-Center, Least\nBiased, Right-Center, and Right \u2014we capture several inter-\nesting dynamic effects in the modern media landscape, in-\ncluding the differentiated effects based on the reliability of\nthe news sources, polarization effects based on both the level\nProceedings of the Nineteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2025)\n1246\nof bias and the political alignment of the publisher.\nOur analysis uncovers new insights, challenging common\nassumptions about the influence of rhetorical dimensions.\nFor example, we find that analytical language typically re-\nduces engagement, especially among more partisan groups.\nConversely, inflammatory risk language disproportionately\nboosts engagement for unreliable and biased publishers.\nThese findings have theoretical implications for understand-\ning persuasive forces and practical applications for improv-\ning content legitimacy and balance. Beneficiaries include\npolicymakers crafting anti-misinformation regulations, plat-\nform designers refining algorithms, journalistic institutions\noptimizing content strategies, and behavioural scientists un-\nraveling drivers of political polarization and engagement in\nmodern democracies.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The first two sections\ndescribe related work (Sec. 2) and the selected language\ndimensions (Sec. 3). The following sections describe our\ndataset (Sec. 4) and detail the metrics and statistical tests\nused to measure and compare distribution shifts in engage-\nment rates (Sec. 5), before Sec. 6 presents our analysis and\nkey insights. Finally, we present our conclusions (Sec. 7).\n2 Related Works\nWhile prior research has explored engagement differences\nacross platforms and information types, no prior work has\ninvestigated how engagement with different classes of news\nis affected by the rhetoric of social media posts.\nEngagement with Different News Classes: Several stud-\nies have compared interaction levels on mainstream, parti-\nsan, and unreliable content on different platforms, includ-\ning on Facebook (Edelson et al. 2021; Hiaeshutter-Rice and\nWeeks 2021), Twitter (Spinde et al. 2023; Aldous, An, and\nJansen 2022; Mohammadinodooshan and Carlsson 2024;\nV osoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018), and Reddit (Weld, Glen-\nski, and Althoff 2021). As an example, Weld et al. (2021)\nshow that Reddit is more resilient to low factual content than\nTwitter; e.g., receiving 20% fewer upvotes for extremely bi-\nased and low factual content. Our work differs from this\nline of research as we focus on how rhetorical tactics en-\ncoded through analytic, clout, perceptual, and risk language\ndimensions affect user engagement across different bias and\nreliability audience categories.\nFactors Impacting User Engagement: Other re-\nsearchers have focused on factors affecting user engage-\nment. For example, focusing on Twitter, Salehabadi et al.\n(2022) and Beknazar et al. (2022) show how toxicity in\ntweets can affect user engagement, and Antypas et al. (2023)\nshow the positive effect of negativeness on the virality\nand spread of tweets, with similar results reported on Tik-\nTok (Cheng and Li 2023) and Facebook (Rathje, Bavel,\nand van der Linden 2021), while some earlier research have\nreported a reverse trend (Trilling, Tolochko, and Burscher\n2017) in that they observe that upbeat material tends to be\nmore widely shared than negative material. Among the most\nclosely related to our work are the works by Bellovary et al.\n(2021) and Aldous et al. (2019). Using tweets from 44 news\norganizations, Bellovary et al. show that negativity impact\nboth the left- and right-party affiliated publishers, whereasAldous et al., using data from 53 news organizations, study\nthe impact of topics on engagement with news posts. Nei-\nther of these works considers the rhetoric of the posts or the\nreliability of the publishers.\nImpact of Rhetorics: Others have explored the rhetori-\ncal impact of LIWC features on engagement rates. For ex-\nample, Mahmud et al. (2014) considered multiple dimen-\nsions, including perception, finding a significant (similar to\nour work) but positive effect on user engagement. Compar-\ning with the consistently negative impact of perception in\nour context (c.f. Figure 7) suggests genre-specific influences\n(news-specific in our case). Lee et al. (2023) demonstrate\nthe impact of anxiety, anger, and informal language from\nthe LIWC dimensions on engagement with misinformation\ntweets. Others have highlighted the positive effect of the cer-\ntainty language LIWC dimension on consumer engagement\n(Pezzuti, Leonhardt, and Warren 2021) or the usage effect of\ndifferent pronouns (Hu, Farnham, and Talamadupula 2021).\nGetting back to the news domain, Robertson et al. (2023)\nuse the LIWC sentiment analysis to study the effect of nega-\ntive language on news consumption. Somory et al. (2020)\nstudy the effect of different LIWC dimensions, including\nsentiment, use of pronouns, social words, cognitive mech-\nanisms, perception, and time. Aldous et al. (2022) study the\neffect of nine emotions (anger, anticipation, anxiety, disgust,\njoy, fear, sadness, surprise, trust) extracted using LIWC on\n133,487 posts by eight news organizations. Candia et al.\n(2022) study the link between the moral language dimension\nof LIWC and social news engagement. None of the above\nworks have considered the impact of the four rhetorical fea-\ntures in our study on different (bias and reliability) classes\nof news posts.\nOur research differs from prior studies (aggregate rhetor-\nical effects) by considering how different groups of audi-\nences (by controlling the impressions variable) from differ-\nent bias and reliability preferences (differential responses)\nengage with four important (as we discuss in the next sec-\ntion), yet, underpresented LIWC dimensions.\n3 LIWC and Selected Language Dimensions\nLIWC: Lexicon-based analysis is a well-established\nmethod for quantifying psychological and linguistic at-\ntributes in text. Among existing lexicons, the Linguistic\nInquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework stands out\nfor its alignment with psychological and sociological the-\nories (Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010), as well as its ex-\ntensive validation and widespread use in prior ICWSM re-\nsearch (Jaidka et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2021; Beel et al. 2022;\nHaworth et al. 2021). In this study, we use the recently\nreleased LIWC2022 version, which includes a rebuilt pro-\ncessing engine and an expanded dictionary better suited to\ninformal netspeak and social media language (Boyd et al.\n2022b).\nDimension Selection: LIWC supports two groups of lin-\nguistic dimensions: (1) the standard dimensions, which pro-\nvide the keywords on one specific psychological dimension\nof the text (e.g., sad word groups), and (2) summary di-\nmensions, which is a broader measure of a particular lin-\nguistic or psychological construct. Due to space constraints,\n1247\nwe chose to focus on the two dimensions in each group\nthat we deemed most relevant to the language used in news\nposts associated with different news categories: analytic and\nclout from the summary dimensions, and perception andrisk\nfrom the standard dimensions. While this set differs from\nthose studied (in other contexts) by prior work, the criti-\ncal importance of studying these dimensions is supported\nby classic theoretical frameworks such as Media Richness\nTheory (Daft and Lengel 1986) and Social Presence The-\nory (Short, Williams, and Christie 1976).\n1) Analytic: This summary dimension reflects logical and\nformal thinking, aligns well with the cognitive dimension of\ncommunication, and is of special interest in environments\nlike news engagement, where the accuracy and depth of con-\ntent are valued. For example, the Elaboration Likelihood\nModel (ELM) (Petty and Bri \u02dcnol 2011) suggests that ana-\nlytical language facilitates the central route of processing,\nwhere audiences are more likely to engage deeply with the\ncontent, leading to more stable attitude changes. Here, we\nstudy to what extent this applies to social media news en-\ngagement and (more broadly) shed light on how the presen-\ntation of logical arguments and information affects user en-\ngagement with different news on Twitter.\n2) Clout: This summary dimension encapsulates lan-\nguage that conveys expertise, confidence, and leadership.\nBeing indicative of expertise and authority, it resonates with\nthe concept of authority bias (Cialdini 2006), which refers to\nthe tendency of individuals to attribute greater accuracy and\ncredibility to the opinions of authority figures. In the context\nof social media news, clout language can trigger this bias,\nleading users to engage more with content that demonstrates\nauthority and expertise. When news sources use language\nthat conveys confidence, leadership, and knowledge, users\nmay perceive the information as more trustworthy and valu-\nable, even without critically evaluating the content itself.\n3) Perception: This standard dimension combines fea-\ntures, aggregating sensory descriptors pertaining to visual,\nspatial, kinesthetic, and auditory observations. With media\nrichness theory arguing that richer media, capable of con-\nveying more sensory information, are more effective for\ncomplex message delivery, we ask whether perception lan-\nguage, which often includes sensory details (making news\nstories more vivid and engaging) potentially lead to higher\nreader involvement (e.g., due to emotional response).\n4) Risk: This standard dimension measures defiance\nof norms and conventions through daring, shocking, rule-\nbreaking rhetoric designed to grab attention. Previous re-\nsearch supports the fact that risk language, which often in-\ncorporates elements of danger or uncertainty, can signifi-\ncantly heighten engagement with news content as audiences\nare drawn to assess threats and risks (Rozin and Royzman\n2001). Accordingly, we wanted to measure this effect among\ndifferent groups of news followers.\n4 Dataset Compilation\nWe start by outlining our multi-step methodology used for\ndata collection and labelling.\nPublishers Selection (Step 1): We selected to use\nthe list of U.S publishers provided by Media Bias FactCheck (MBFC 2023), as gathered in Feb. 2023. To focus\non the original publishers, we removed any news aggrega-\ntion websites (such as alternativenews.com) from the list by\nexamining the description page provided by MBFC for each\npublisher. After this exclusion, the dataset consisted of 4,109\noriginal news publishers.\nWhile there are other independent organizations assessing\nand labeling news publishers, including NewsGuard (News-\nGuard 2023), Adfontes Media (Ad Fontes Media 2023), and\nAllsides (AllSides 2023), we have chosen to primarily use\nMBFC for the following reasons. (1) MBFC is used by nu-\nmerous academic studies (Sharma, Ferrara, and Liu 2022;\nPapadogiannakis et al. 2023). (2) The more than 4K news\npublishers in the dataset allow a reliable statistical analysis.\n(3) Both the bias and the reliability dimensions are evalu-\nated. (4) Ratings are up-to-date and freely accessible, allow-\ning others to more easily and accurately replicate our results.\n(5) Employ a transparent methodology for their labeling pro-\ncess, detailed in (MBFC 2023). (6) Lin et al. (2023) have re-\ncently demonstrated a strong correlation between their rating\nand other ratings, including NewsGuard (which is not free).\nAs a delimitation, our study does not include \u201csocial me-\ndia only\u201d news channels that might elude traditional media\nwatchdog groups, as we could not find a comprehensive list\nof these outlets. This limitation may result in an underrep-\nresentation of the prevalence of synthetic or algorithmically\ngenerated news articles.\nAugmenting Bias Labels (Step 2): Like many prior\nworks (Edelson et al. 2021; Husz \u00b4ar et al. 2022) we utilize the\nBias labels typically provided by MBFC (from left-to-right):\nLeft, Left-Center, Least Biased, Right-Center, and Right.\nFor publishers already having one of these labels as their\nmain bias label, we utilized the corresponding label. How-\never, some publishers have one of the following main labels:\n\u201cPro-Science\u201d, Conspiracy-Pseudoscience\u201d, and \u201cQuestion-\nable Source\u201d. In these cases, similar to other works (CITAP\n2022), we use one of the five main bias labels if such label\nis included in the descriptive text, tags, or bias-meter icons\nfor the publishers (manually identified by visiting each pub-\nlisher\u2019s MBFC page). For the 304 publishers without explicit\nbias classifications, we utilized Robertson et al.\u2019s (2018) bias\nscores alongside MBFC labels to construct non-parametric\nKernel Density Estimator (KDE) models for each of the five\nbias groups. Gaussian kernel functions were fitted, and the\nbandwidth hyperparameter was optimized using Silverman\u2019s\nrule and 5-fold cross-validation across 50 values. The tuned\nKDEs were employed to infer bias labels for unclassified\npublishers. For the remaining cases, the same approach was\napplied using (Ad Fontes Media 2023) bias scores. The ef-\nficacy of KDEs in capturing bias stratification (with an av-\nerage 0.78 macro-averaged F1-score over the cross valida-\ntions), is demonstrated in Figure 1(a), with 112 publishers\nexcluded due to uninferrable bias labels.\nAugmenting (Mis)information Labels (Step 3): The iffy\nindex (Josef Verbanac 2023), widely used in scholarly stud-\nies (Pierri et al. 2023; Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2023;\nBroniatowski et al. 2023), is a prominent method for as-\nsigning reliability labels to publishers. Leveraging this in-\ndex, which relies on MBFC labels, we adopted a consistent\n1248\n\u221220 0 20\nBias Score0.00.20.4DensityLeft\nLeft-Center\nLeast Biased\nRight-Center\nRight(a) Bias\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nReliability Score02DensityMisinformationNon-misinformation (b) Reliability\nFigure 1: Tuned KDEs.

Given the gap between their latest\nupdate and our Feb. 2023 MBFC data collection, we repli-\ncated their methodology. Publishers marked as \u201cConspira-\ncy/Pseudoscience\u201d and \u201cQuestionable Source/Fake News\u201d\nwith a \u201cLow Credibility\u201d rating by MBFC were classified\nas misinformation (\u201ciffy\u201d). For publishers lacking some of\nthese labels, we employed a training KDE approach on re-\nliability (PC1) values from (Lin et al. 2023) to infer their\nreliability class. Figure 1(b) visualizes these KDEs.\nTwitter Accounts Mapping (Step 4): We next identified\npublishers Twitter accounts (mainly by visiting their web-\nsite) and discarded 407 publishers without a Twitter account.\nTweets, Engagement and Followers Data Collection\n(Step 5): We recorded the number of followers for each ac-\ncount in our publisher set as of Mar. 2023. Next, we ex-\ncluded accounts with less than 10K followers. This decision\nwas made because these smaller accounts have dispropor-\ntionately skewed statistics and generally generate minimal\ninterest compared to the \u201caverage\u201d account (with 562,663\nfollowers). For the remaining 1,553 accounts, we collected\nall tweets from Dec. 15, 2022 to June 2023 and their im-\npressions and interactions statistics. Dec. 15, 2022, was se-\nlected as starting point since it is the earliest date from which\ntweets are accompanied by view count statistics (crucial\nmetric for our analysis), and we were able to collect data\nfor all publishers to June 2023, providing us a comprehen-\nsive dataset spanning six months for all publishers. Through-\nout this period, the impressions and interactions statistics for\neach tweet were collected simultaneously, ensuring a consis-\ntent and synchronized dataset for our analysis. By ensuring\nthat there was at least one month delay between the post-\ning dates and the retrieval of data for each tweet, we en-\nsure that most totals have converged. Prior research has also\nshown that 95% of tweets cease to receive additional impres-\nsions after 24 hours of posting (Pfeffer, Matter, and Sargsyan\n2023).\nTable 1 provides a statistical summary of our final dataset,\ncategorized based on bias and reliability categories. For each\ncategory, the table shows: (1) the number of outlets (N ), (2)\nthe aggregate number of tweets in the dataset (Twts.), (3) the\ncombined sum of all interaction types in the dataset (Ints.),\nincluding likes, retweets, quotes, and replies, and (4) the\nnumber of impressions recorded in each category (Imprs.).\nOverall, our dataset consists of 483 million interactions from\n5.5 million tweets across 1,553 news outlets, which are fol-\nlowed in total by 874 million users.

Finally, considering all the publishers (last row),\nwe note an overall engagement rate of 0.6% (483M\n80.6B), near to\nwhat Twitter\u2019s CEO (Musk 2022) has reported.\nCompiling the LIWC Values (Step 6): Using\nLIWC2022, for all tweets in our dataset, we then computed\nthe LIWC features for the four dimensions of interest.\nThe code and supplementary materials of this study are\npublic at: https://github.com/alireza-mon/liwc-news.\n5 Metrics and Statistical Tests\n5.1 Measuring Publisher-Level Effects\nTo assess the influence of each of the LIWC-determined\nlinguistic features on user engagement of different publish-\ners, it is important to quantify variations in the engagement\nrates related to each specific LIWC feature. For example,\nwhen considering the effects of using analytical language\nfor a publisher such as @nytimes, one needs to quantita-\ntively compare the engagement distribution of the subset of\n@nytimes tweets that exhibit higher levels of analytical lan-\nguage with the overall engagement distribution of @nytimes\ntweets.\nChallenges with Related Metrics: While various meth-\nods, such as Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)-based\nor information theory-based approaches, exist for compar-\ning distributions, they each present limitations in our con-\ntext. Traditional methods like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nlack directionality, hindering the interpretation of linguistic\nfeature impact on engagement. Information theory-based ap-\nproaches, such as Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence, lack intuitive\ninterpretability. Additionally, tests like the Mann-Whitney\nU test are sensitive to the range of values, potentially bias-\ning results across publishers with varying engagement rates.\nEmphasizing maximum differences, as seen in, for example,\nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, may overlook other signifi-\ncant aspects of distribution differences. Moreover, methods\nlike the Paired t-test may not be suitable for the long-tail\nnature of social media engagement data.\nMedian Percentile Shift (MPS): To overcome the above\nchallenges, we define and utilize \u201cMedian Percentile Shift\u201d\n(MPS ) as our chosen metric. MPS is direction-sensitive, in-\ntuitively interpretable, less influenced by the range of orig-\ninal values, and emphasizes central tendencies over ex-\n1249\n0.001 0.002 0.003\nEngagement Rate0.00.20.40.60.81.0CDF @nytimes (all tweets)\n@nytimes (analytical tweets)\n@foxnews (all tweets)\n@foxnews (analytical tweets)Figure 2: Distribution of the engagement rates for all tweets\npublished by @nytimes and @foxnews and their analytical\ntweets. We limit the x-range to provide a better resolution.\ntreme differences. Its applicability to long-tailed distribu-\ntions makes it suitable for equitable comparisons across pub-\nlishers, irrespective of their baseline engagement rates.\nConsider the illustrative example in Figure 2. Here, solid\nlines show the overall user engagement rate distributions\nacross all tweets associated with @nytimes and @foxnews,\nand the dashed lines show the corresponding distributions\nover only the analytical tweets. By analytical tweets, we\nrefer to the ones that have an analytic score (according to\nLIWC) higher than the median in our dataset. Interestingly,\nwhile @nytimes sees right-shifted distributions signifying\nengagement boosts, @foxnews exhibits left-shifts denoting\ndeclines. This polarization underscores analytic rhetoric\u2019s\nfickle relationship with audience engagement.\nNow, let us try to quantify this shift, marked as a black tri-\nangle in the figure, for @nytimes. Here, we first determine\nthe median engagement rate of @nytimes tweets classified\nwithin the high-analytic feature subset. This median is then\nlocated within the total engagement distribution for @ny-\ntimes, culminating in a percentile rank. Here, the median of\nthe high-analytic tweets falls at the 55.8thpercentile of the\ntotal distribution. Finally, to calculate the MPS for @nytimes\nconcerning the analytic feature (MPSanalytic\n@nytimes) we report\nthe difference from the median percentile (50%), resulting\nin an MPS of 5.8. In simpler terms, MPSanalytic\n@nytimes= 5.8.\nMore formally, for each publisher (twitter account) aand\nLIWC feature F, we calculate the MPS as follows. (1) Let\nSF\narepresent the engagement rates of publisher a\u2019s tweets\nscoring high on feature F. The rest are considered in the low\ncategory. (2) Let the median of SF\nabe denoted as MSF\na. (3)\nLetSadenote the full set of engagement rates for publisher\na(encompassing both the high and low groups). Finally,\nthe \u201cMedian Percentile Shift\u201d for feature Ffor publisher\nais calculated as: MPSF\na=\u0000\nPSa(MSF\na)\u221250\u0001\n, where\nPSa(MSF\na)is the percentile rank of MSF\nawithin Sa.\nBy design, MPS values always fall within a normalized\nrange between \u00b150%, regardless of the original magnitude\nof the engagement rate, making it agnostic to the origi-\nnal engagement levels. This facilitates equitable compari-\nson across publishers with vastly different engagement rates.\nPositive MPS values indicate increased engagement relativeto the publisher\u2019s baseline for the feature (e.g., analytic lan-\nguage), while negative values indicate reduced engagement.\nThreshold Selection and Validation: To define high fea-\nture scores, we adopt a robust measure of central tendency.\nWhile LIWC norms exist for general tweet domains (Boyd\net al. 2022a), they are not tailored to the news-specific con-\ntext of our dataset. Given the skewed distribution of en-\ngagement rates, we use the median (rather than the mean)\nas a more representative threshold. Therefore, tweets with\nscores above the median for feature Fare classified as high\nin that feature. This choice helps mitigate the influence of\noutliers, common in skewed distributions. We also validated\nthis approach by testing alternative thresholds (e.g., 50\u201370th\npercentiles in 5% steps) and the results remained consis-\ntent. We also validated the MPS approach by varying per-\ncentile thresholds (Appendix A), observing consistent effect\ndirections. Robustness checks across topics and time (Ap-\npendix B) further confirmed the stability of our findings.\n5.2 Statistical Tests\nIn social media, including for our MPS distributions, pro-\nnounced skewness and deviation from normality, includ-\ning long tails, are common. Therefore, to compare distri-\nbution locations across multiple groups, we leveraged the\nnon-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, which quantifies dis-\ncrepancy in median (and also distribution) trends. Through-\nout the paper, when comparing a set of distributions, we\nuse a significance threshold of 0.01 and conduct post-hoc\nDunn tests on all pairwise couplings in the cases where\nthe omnibus Kruskal-Wallis metric flagged significant dif-\nferences. Following the same reasoning (i.e., accounting for\nnon-normal, skewed distributions), for the case when we\ncompare distributions against a constant (baseline) value, we\nuse the Wilcoxon signed rank test.\n6 Results and Discussions\nUsing the MPS metric, we next analyze the effect of each\nLIWC feature on the user engagement rates.\n6.1 Analytic Language\nThe analytic dimension within the LIWC framework pro-\nvides a lens through which cognitive processes in commu-\nnication can be examined. This dimension focuses on the\npresence of language indicative of higher-order thinking, in-\ncluding aspects like analysis, reasoning, and use of evidence.\nHigh analytical scores are typically reflective of texts that\nnot only delve into a subject with depth but also demonstrate\nintellectual rigour in their structure and content.\nThe Effect of Analytic Language on Engagement\nRates: To see how users engage with analytical language\nin tweets, Figure 3 shows the distribution of the Median Per-\ncentile Shift (MPS ) values Danalytic\ncategory for different categories\nof publishers (e.g., Left), where Danalytic\ncategory consists of the set\nof{MPSanalytic\nai}for all publishers (accounts) aibelonging\nto the category of interest. Here, we include results for all\nfivebias categories, the two reliability categories, and for\nthe full set of publishers calculated across Allpublishers (ir-\nrespective of their bias and reliability category).\n1250\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.All\u22127.5\u22125.0\u22122.50.02.5Median Percentiles ShiftMedianFigure 3: Analytical language effect on engagement rates:\nnegative values indicate that analytical posts inversely affect\nengagement rates.\nThroughout the paper, each class is shown as a boxplot,\nwith horizontal markers indicating the median MPS values,\nboxes representing the interquartile ranges, and whiskers ex-\ntending to the 20thand 80thpercentiles. Outliers beyond\nthese percentiles are omitted to enhance the visual resolution\nand a reference line at the zero mark is included to aid in a\ncomparative analysis of the distributions. In general, nega-\ntive values in the distributions of each class (lower than this\nbaseline) show the negative effect of the analytical language\non the tweets of the publishers belonging to that class.\nSeveral observations can be drawn from Figure 3. First,\nfocusing on the rightmost boxplot, showing the distribution\nofMPS over all 1,553 publishers when considering the us-\nage of the analytical language feature (Danalytic\nAll ), we observe\na clear negative effect on user engagement rates when ana-\nlytic language is used. Although this distribution is biased\nby the number of samples in each bias and reliability cate-\ngory (e.g., the Non-misinformation has more samples than\ntheMisinformation class) it offers insights into the news do-\nmain landscape without selection bias in publisher choice.\nFurthermore, the central tendency of Danalytic\nAll is notably\nbelow zero, with a median of \u22120.9. The negative me-\ndian is statistically significant, confirmed by a p-value of\n2.9\u00d710\u221242using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In fact, this\nnegative effect of using analytical language on the users en-\ngagement is statistically supported for all categories consid-\nered, irrespective of bias or reliability category. The largest\n(least significant) p-value here belongs to the Left-Center\ngroup which has a p-value of 2.4\u00d710\u22126, which also has the\nsmallest absolute deviations from 0 (median of -0.4). The\nlargest deviations belong to the Right andMisinformation\nclasses, with medians of -2.2 and -1.8, respectively. Finally,\nwe should mention that the difference between the left party\n(combining the two left classes) and the right party (combin-\ning the two right classes) is also significant at the p-value of\n1.4\u00d710\u22123according to the Kruskal-Wallis test, indicating\nthat right-aligned publishers (as an aggregate) see relatively\nlower user engagement when using analytic language.\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.2030405060Percentage\nMean MedianFigure 4: Percentage of tweets with analytical language con-\ntent across various categories.\nKey Observation: Analytical language negatively\nimpacts user engagement rate across all classes, with\ntheRight andMisinformation groups exhibiting the\nstrongest declines, and the Left-Center demonstrat-\ning the least pronounced effect.\nNeed for Studying the Prevalence: To better understand\nthe pronounced negative impact of analytical language on\nengagement, especially pronounced within the Right class,\nfor example, we must explore how frequently it is used. The\nscarcity principle, derived from the \u201cnovelty effect\u201d theory\nin communications, suggests that users may exhibit height-\nened responsiveness to content that is less prevalent within\ntheir typical information ecosystem. To further our under-\nstanding of the interplay between this linguistic style, its\nprevalence, and audience interaction, and to distinguish the\npotential impact of the \u201cnovelty effect\u201d from other engage-\nment drivers, we next analyze the prevalence of analytical\nlanguage. If a type of content is already prevalent among a\ncertain class of publishers, its (positive) impact on engage-\nment might be less attributed to its novelty and more to other\nfactors. The inverse case also holds.\nPrevalence of Analytical Language: Figure 4 shows the\ndistribution of (highly) analytic tweet percentages across\ndifferent publisher classes. These distributions are obtained\nby calculating, for each publisher, the percentage of tweets\nclassified as using analytic language, and then aggregating\nthese percentages for all publishers within a class.\nBefore comparing the categories against each other, we\nshould point out a notable distinction in distribution char-\nacteristics when compared to the engagement rate distribu-\ntions. While engagement rates typically exhibit long-tailed\ndistributions, the prevalence distributions for most groups\nconform to normality tests (the means are marked for all dis-\ntributions). This contrast in distribution shapes is significant,\nsuggesting that the use of analytical language (and the other\nfeatures) across different publishers is more evenly spread\nand less skewed than the engagement patterns observed.\nThe figure reveals several interesting key trends and pat-\nterns. First, we note the marked and statistically signifi-\n1251\ncant disparity in the prevalence of analytical language be-\ntween the Misinformation andNon-misinformation classes.\nNotably, the median prevalence of analytic tweets for Mis-\ninformation publishers is 30.7%, while Non-misinformation\noutlets exhibit a higher median of 47.0%. This discrep-\nancy suggests that misinformation sources are less likely to\nuse analytical language, potentially favoring emotive or as-\nsertive rhetoric over analytical depth. This trend aligns with\nthe commonly recognized tactics of misinformation sources,\nwhich often prioritize persuasion over analytical rigour.\nSecond, turning our attention to the bias classes, a\nKruskal-Wallis test (p-value of 2.6\u00d710\u221284) and subsequent\npost-hoc Dunn tests, reveals that almost all pairwise com-\nparisons between the bias classes to be statistically signif-\nicant, with the only two exceptions being between (1) Left\nandRight and (2) Least Biased andRight-Center. This ob-\nservation suggests a correlation between the level of bias in\npublishers and their use of analytical language. Specifically,\npublishers exhibiting the highest levels of bias, regardless\nof their political orientation, tend to use analytical language\nless frequently. Conversely, the Least Biased publishers are\ncharacterized by a higher rate of analytical language usage.\nThis inverse relationship may reflect a strategic choice by\nhighly biased publishers to engage their audience with more\nideologically driven content over analytical discourse.\nDiscussion and Combined Insights: Considering the\ntrends observed in Figures 3 and 4, interesting insights\nemerge regarding the interplay between the frequency of\nanalytical language and user engagement across different\nclasses. For example, while Right publishers feature less fre-\nquent use of analytic tweets, their followers concurrently ex-\nhibit the least engagement with such content. This pattern\neffectively negates the \u201cnovelty effect\u201d. Instead, it suggests\na congruence between the publisher\u2019s content strategy and\ntheir audience\u2019s preferences. The followers of Right publish-\ners, it appears, are less inclined towards engaging with an-\nalytic content, possibly favoring narratives that align more\nclosely with their ideological stances or emotional appeal.\nSimilarly, in the realm of reliability, Misinformation pub-\nlishers and comparing to the Non-misinformation publish-\ners, despite their infrequent use of analytic tweets, do not\nsee an increase in user engagement when such language is\nemployed. This observation again counters the \u201cNovelty Ef-\nfect\u201d theory. Instead, it indicates that the audience of misin-\nformation sources might be less influenced by the scarcity\nof analytic content, perhaps due to a predisposition towards\nnarratives that confirm pre-existing beliefs or biases, rather\nthan those offering analytical depth.\nKey Observation: Misinformation publishers use\nanalytical language notably less compared to Non-\nmisinformation outlets. In terms of political bias,\nhighly biased publishers demonstrate lower analyt-\nical language usage than their least biased coun-\nterparts. This trend, negating the \u201cnovelty effect\u201d,\nshows the interest of audiences of Right andMisin-\nformation publishers favoring less analytic content.6.2 Clout, Perception, and Risk Language\nWe next look closer at three additional LIWC dimensions,\neach offering complementing insights to our observations\nregarding the prevalence and effects of analytic language.\nThe Effect of Clout Language: The clout dimension\nquantifies linguistic markers of authority, assertiveness, and\ninfluence. Specifically, the prevalence of clout language in\nsocial media spans expressions of institutional authority to\npopulist rhetoric resonating with the reader\u2019s experiences.\nTo assess the impact of clout language on user engage-\nment, Figure 5 shows the MPS distributions across different\npublisher categories. Several key observations are notable,\nhere split into three types. First, when contrasted with ana-\nlytic language, clout language exerts a less distinct impact\non the composite engagement rate (All category) and most\nof the individual categories. For example, whereas the me-\ndian of Danalytic\nAll for analytic language was \u22120.9, the median\nofDclout\nAllfor clout language is \u22120.2. This shift, while less\npronounced, remains statistically significant with a p-value\nof2.8\u00d710\u22128, as affirmed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank\ntest. This finding indicates that the clout language retains\na salient influence on user engagement, albeit to a varied ex-\ntent across different classes.\nSecond, when comparing the bias categories, a more gran-\nular assessment reveals a heterogeneous response to clout\nlanguage among the publisher classes. For example, the\nRight class again stands out and demonstrates a positive me-\ndian shift in engagement rates with Dclout\nRight having a median\nof 1.3 percentiles, implying that such language positively\nresonates with the user base of these publishers. Conversely,\nthe left party publisher classes (Left andLeft-Center ) exhibit\nnegative effect with Dclout\nLeft-Center andDclout\nLeft having median\nvalues of -0.6 and -0.5 percentiles, respectively. Although\nsmall, these deviations from the baseline are statistically sig-\nnificant, with the least significant p-value (8 \u00d710\u22124) found\nin the comparison between the Leftclass and the baseline.\nIn summary, the positive engagement shift in the Right\nclass may suggest a preference for assertive and dominant\ncontent, aligning with conservative rhetorical styles. The\nnegative shift among the LeftandLeft-Center classes might\nindicate a skepticism towards authoritative discourse.\nThird, turning our focus to the reliability factor, the differ-\nential impact of clout language on user engagement is strik-\ning. The Misinformation class demonstrates a significant\nincrease in engagement rates when (news-related) tweets\nuse clout-themed language, a trend not seen in the Non-\nmisinformation class. For example, the medians of the clout\ndistributions for the two classes are 1.2 and \u22120.3percentiles,\nrespectively. These observations suggest that audiences en-\ngaging with Misinformation sources may be particularly re-\nceptive to, or even seeking, content that projects confidence\nand authority, characteristics often associated with clout lan-\nguage. This inclination could reflect a cognitive bias wherein\nassertive content is perceived as more credible. Conversely,\nthe smaller but still significant negative shift within the Non-\nmisinformation class may indicate a preference for more nu-\nanced or less assertive communication, aligned with a more\ncritical engagement with content.\n1252\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.All\u2212505Median Percentiles ShiftMedianFigure 5: Clout language effect on engagement rates: mixed\neffects on engagement rates when using clout language.\nKey Observation: The clout dimension exerts a\nmore differentiated impact on user engagement than\nthe analytic one: positively influencing the Right and\nMisinformation classes, suggesting their audiences\u2019\npreference for assertive content, while eliciting a\nnegative response from the left party classes.\nThe Prevalence of Clout Language: Figure 6 shows the\nclout prevalence distributions associated with the different\nclasses. When considering the bias classes, we observe sig-\nnificant differences in the use of clout language between the\ndifferent groups (validated using the Kruskal-Wallis test).\nTheRight-Center class exhibits a significantly lower median\nusage of clout language compared to the other four classes,\nsuggesting that Right-Center publishers might adopt a more\nmoderated or less assertive tone in their content. Another in-\nsight emerges when we combine the extreme classes (Right\nandLeft) and compare them as a single entity against the\nother three less biased classes. In all comparisons, the ex-\ntreme classes demonstrate higher use of clout language, with\nthe largest p-value being 0.06. This observation indicates\nthat publishers with more pronounced political biases tend\nto use clout language more frequently.\nThe Effect of Perception Language: Next, we focus on\nthe dimension of perception. The perception category within\nthe LIWC framework encompasses language pertaining to\nsensory and physical experiences, spatial orientation, and\nmotion. It is a linguistic marker of how content is grounded\nin the tangible and observable world. Our goal in analyzing\nthe prevalence of perceptual words in tweets is to provide\ninsights into how sensory-rich language influences user en-\ngagement across various types of publishers followers.\nThe mediated effect of perceptual language is visualized\nin Figure 7, depicting MPS distributions for different groups.\nNotably, the median of Dperception\nAll at\u22121.0indicates a signif-\nicant downward shift in engagement when tweets are more\nperceptually descriptive (p-value: 3.1\u00d710\u221262). Perception\nlanguage shows a more pronounced correlation with reduced\nengagement compared to analytical (2.9 \u00d710\u221242) or clout\n(2.8\u00d710\u22128) language. This suggests potential user pref-\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.2530354045PercentageMean MedianFigure 6: Percentage of tweets belonging to clout language\nalong different classes.\nerences for abstract or narrative-driven content on Twit-\nter, questioning the integration of sensory language (which,\nwhile enriching, could lead to higher cognitive load) within\nthe fast-paced environment of social media.\nTurning attention to the impact of perception language on\nengagement across various classes, significant shifts from\nbaseline rates are observed for all classes (p-values ranging\nfrom 7.8\u00d710\u221232forLeast Biased to2.8\u00d710\u22124forLeft).\nThis statistical underpinning confirms the pervasive influ-\nence of perceptual language across publisher biases. De-\ntailed examination of bias classes, in comparison to the ana-\nlytic and clout dimensions (Figures 3 and 5), reveals a uni-\nform effect on engagement rates. Unlike clout and analytical\ndimensions, the Kruskal-Wallis test does not reach signif-\nicance, suggesting homogeneity in how perceptual content\naffects user engagement (compared to analytic and clout lan-\nguage), irrespective of political orientation.\nAdditionally, the test does not substantiate a significant\ndifference between reliability classes\u2019 distributions (Misin-\nformation vs.Non-misinformation), aligning with visual ob-\nservations. This lack of distinction implies that perception\nlanguage universally affects user engagement without intro-\nducing biases based on the publisher\u2019s perceived reliability.\nThese insights suggest that, while perception language\nuniformly decreases engagement across publisher classes,\nthe reasons behind this phenomenon may be more related to\ncontent style preferences and processing behaviours rather\nthan to political or reliability classifications. This encour-\nages a deeper exploration of how sensory language is used,\nwhich we shall expand upon next.\nKey Observation: Perception language consis-\ntently decreases user engagement across all classes\nof publishers, with statistically significant while uni-\nform shifts regardless of political bias or reliability.\nThe Prevalence of Perception Language: Figure 8 of-\nfers a comprehensive view of the use of perception language\nacross different groups, leading to several insights. First, the\nKruskal-Wallis test statistically confirms the notably lower\n1253\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.All\u22124\u2212202Median Percentiles ShiftMedianFigure 7: Perception language effect on engagement rates:\nnegative values show that perception-related posts have an\ninverse effect on engagement rates.\nuse of perception language of the Misinformation class (me-\ndian of 39.7%) compared to the Non-misinformation class\n(median of 49.5%). This pronounced difference indicates\nthat the perception language is more frequently employed by\nNon-Misinformation publishers. This trend might suggest a\nstrategic emphasis on concrete, experiential content in cred-\nible news sources as opposed to the potentially abstract or\nemotionally driven narratives in misinformation outlets.\nSecond, examining bias classes, Kruskal-Wallis test con-\nfirms significant variations, with the Dunn tests highlighting\nsignificant differences between the less biased classes and\nthe more biased classes. For example, the pairwise compar-\nisons with the Least Biased class (showing the highest preva-\nlence of perception language) are all significant. Addition-\nally, a statistically significant higher prevalence is observed\nin the Right-Center class compared to Right, and a similar\npattern is observed between Left-Center andLeft. The shift\ntowards increasing usage for the less biased classes is also\nobserved on the median percentages (from Left to Right):\n42.4%, 48.5%, 52.1%, 49.9%, and 39.5%. This gradient sug-\ngests that more centrist classes are more likely to use percep-\ntion language, indicating a preference for tangible, relatable\ncontent in less ideologically extreme publications.\nIn summary, the varied use of perception language across\npublisher classes reveals nuanced content strategies. No-\ntably, less biased publishers, especially the Least Biased\nclass, employ more perceptual language while others choose\nalternative narrative styles.\nCombined Prevalence Observations: While Figure 8\nshows that the usage of perception language is less frequent\nin both Misinformation and highly biased classes, Figure 7\nreveals that these ones yield similar levels of engagement\nwhen employing perception language as other classes. This\nobservation suggests that, despite the lower prevalence of\nsensory and tangible language in Misinformation and highly\nbiased content, its impact on user engagement does not dif-\nfer significantly from other classes. This, combined with the\n\u201cnovelty effect\u201d, suggests that followers of these classes may\nengage less with perception-related content.\nThe Effect of Risk Language: The linguistic attributes\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.4050Percentage\nMean MedianFigure 8: Percentage of tweets belonging to perception lan-\nguage along different classes.\nexplored thus far - analytic reasoning, clout authority, and\nperception - represent pillars of credibility, social influence,\nand connection with observable reality. However, the pres-\nsure to attract attention and shape beliefs may also incen-\ntivize publishers to employ sensational rhetoric that defies\nthese very attributes, instead playing on emotions and iden-\ntities. The risk category within LIWC encapsulates such lan-\nguage, words that express defiance, rule-breaking, daring,\nand extremism. By quantifying the engagement with risk\nlanguage, we aim to understand the extent to which differ-\nent groups respond to such provocation and whether distinct\ndynamics underlie these responses.\nFigure 9 shows the MPS distributions of risk language\nacross various publisher classes. First, considering the ag-\ngregate effects across all 1,553 publishers (right-most box-\nplot), risk language only moderately boosts engagement\nrates. The distribution Drisk\nAllhas a median of 0.7, indicating a\n0.7 percentile increase in the median engagement rate. This\neffect is the smallest among the studied dimensions, sup-\nported by a non-significant p-value of 0.03 compared to the\nbaseline. However, similar to clout language, the observed\neffects vary substantially among the classes, emphasizing\nthe importance of class-specific analysis.\nSecond, starting with the reliability classes, we observe\nbig differences, with Drisk\nMisinformation andDrisk\nNon-misinformation hav-\ning medians of 3.0 and 0.6, respectively. These differences\nare supported by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p-value of 0.01),\nsuggesting that Misinformation sources benefit more from\nthe use of risk language and that the use of such language\nmay help them obtain increased user engagement. This ef-\nfect may potentially be due to its alignment with sensation-\nalized content that reinforces pre-existing beliefs or biases.\nThird, considering bias, a correlation emerges between\nthe degree of bias\u2014regardless of political orientation\u2014and\nMPS values. Highly biased Left andRight classes show\nthe highest MPS values, indicating receptivity to risk lan-\nguage aligned with the extremity of their positions. Con-\nversely, the Right-Center andLeft-Center classes exhibit\na non-significant deviation from the baseline. Specifically,\nhighly biased Right andLeftclasses statistically benefit from\nrisk language, with medians of 3.0 and 3.5 and p-values of\n1254\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.All\u2212505Median Percentiles ShiftMedianFigure 9: Risk language effect on engagement rates: posi-\ntive values show that risk-related posts positively increase\nthe engagement rates.\n2.0\u00d710\u22126and7.5\u00d710\u22127respectively. In contrast, the Least\nBiased class shows a statistically significant negative effect,\nwith a median shift of \u22120.3and a p-value of 6.8\u00d710\u22125.\nThis suggests that extreme publishers\u2019 audiences are drawn\nto risk language, while audiences of Least Biased publishers\nprefer more measured and less sensational content.\nThe Prevalence of Risk Language: Our attention now\nturns to the prevalence of risk language across different pub-\nlishers, as depicted in Figure 10. This analysis reveals sev-\neral key observations. First, compared to the other linguistic\ndimensions there is no statistically significant difference in\nthe prevalence of risk language between the different groups\n(e.g., p-value of 0.87 when comparing the Left-Center and\ntheRight-Center with medians of 8.6% and 10.1%).\nSecond, we observe greater variations (e.g., inter-quartile\ndifferences) in the distribution of risk language usage for the\nmore biased classes (Left andRight ), suggesting that pub-\nlishers in these categories possibly may apply more diverse\neditorial strategies when it comes to using risk language.\nIn contrast, the Least Biased andRight-Center groups see\nsubstantially smaller variations, suggesting that publishers\nwithin these groups may use more homogeneous strategies\nregarding their use of such language.\nCombined Risk Language Observations: Now, by fac-\ntoring out the influence of the \u201cNovelty Effect\u201d, and com-\nparing these insights with the engagement patterns seen in\nFigure 9, an intriguing narrative emerges. While the more\nbiased publishers exhibit higher engagement with risk lan-\nguage, and Misinformation sources similarly see greater en-\ngagement shifts, the relatively uniform prevalence of risk\nlanguage suggests that engagement spikes are not driven by\nits rarity. Instead, this indicates that the audiences of more\nbiased or misinformation-leaning publishers might have a\nparticular affinity for content that incorporates elements of\nrisk, regardless of its frequency of use.\n6.3 Robustness of Findings and Interplay\nbetween Dimensions\nTo ensure robustness of our findings, we performed tests\nwith alternative percentile thresholds and conducted addi-\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.5.07.510.012.515.0Percentage\nMean MedianFigure 10: Percentage of tweets belonging to risk language\nalong different classes.\ntional analyses examining the potential confounding effects\nof topic coverage and temporal variations on the observed\npatterns. These analyses, detailed in Appendix A and Ap-\npendix B, respectively, showed that the main conclusions of\nour study were supported using other percentile thresholds\nand across a diverse range of topics, and remained consistent\nover time, strengthening the validity of our findings.\nFinally, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the\ninterplay between analytic and risk language, as detailed in\nAppendix C. While this paper\u2019s focus is on the individual\nfactors, these results suggest that the interplay between an-\nalytic and risk language yields diverse effects on user en-\ngagement across different publisher categories, opening the\ndoor for interesting follow-up work studying the combined\neffects of multiple dimensions.\n7 Conclusion\nThis work took a LIWC-based approach to uncover how\nrhetorical attributes in tweets affect audience engagement,\nspecifically investigating analytical, clout, perceptual, and\nrisk language usage by news publishers across the political\nspectrum. We derived several key findings.\nFirst, analytical language typically decreased engage-\nment, especially among right-leaning and less reliable pub-\nlishers. Combined with lower analytic tweets prevalence for\nthese groups, this nullifies the novelty effect and confirms\naudience biases favoring ideologically aligned narratives\nover analytic discourse. Second, assertive clout language\nresonated more positively with right-leaning and unreliable\npublishers, suggesting a preference for authoritative rhetoric\nfor these groups. Third, concrete perceptual language con-\nsistently reduced engagement across the categories, suggest-\ning its effects stem more from perceptual style preferences\nindependent of partisan bias or reliability.\nFinally, sensational risk language increased engagement\nfor politically extreme and unreliable publishers, indicative\nof inflammatory content confirming biases. Yet, uniform\nprevalence hinted that rarity was not the underlying driver.\nWhile these insights can assist publishers, including those\nin misinformation, in strategically targeting audiences for\nhigher engagement, the benefits of scientifically quantify-\n1255\ning these dynamics outweigh the potential downsides. Our\ngranular analysis provides valuable intelligence for multiple\nstakeholders to shape ethical and responsible content strate-\ngies. Policymakers can derive directives to prioritize miti-\ngating provocative appeals for vulnerable groups. Platforms\ncan align algorithms to nourish credibility. Publishers can\ncompete fairly by tailoring public discourse to constructive\npreferences. Most importantly, these findings highlight path-\nways for redirecting individual users through cognitive tar-\ngeting, fostering truth-aligned recommendations resistant to\nmanipulation. Overall, despite risks of misuse, decoding the\nintricate science of persuasion has profound potential to ad-\nvance personal agency and digital public welfare.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank the reviewers and the associate editor\nfor their insightful comments that helped improve the pa-\nper.

While MPS is a useful metric for compar-\ning the central tendencies of engagement rate distributions, it\nhas some inherent limitations. First, MPS focuses solely on\nthe median, which may not capture other essential aspects of\nthe distribution, such as variance or skewness. Second, MPS\nassumes that the compared distributions have similar shapes,\nwhich may not always be the case. Finally, MPS is a descrip-\ntive metric and does not provide information about the statis-\ntical significance of the observed differences. To overcome\nthese limitations and validate the reliability of the insights\npresented based on MPS, we performed supplementary anal-\nysis using Average Percentile Shifts (APS ) across alternative\npercentiles. Specifically and using the definitions in Sec. 5.1,\nfor each candidate threshold p\u2208 {10,20, ..., 90}, we com-\nputed: (1) The pthpercentile of the high feature group\u2019s\nengagement rates (SF\na). (2) Its percentile rank within the\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.All\u22124\u221220Average Percentiles ShiftMedianFigure 11: Analytical language effect on engagement rates\ncomputed using the Average Percentiles Shifts (APS ).\noverall rates (S a). (3) The deviation between the percentile\nrank from Step 2 and the original threshold p. Finally, we\naveraged these deviations to obtain the APS as follows:\n1\n9P\np\u220810,...,90\u0002\nPSa\u0000\npercentile\u0000\nSF\na, p\u0001\u0001\n\u2212p\u0003\n.\nAPS confirms the validity of all observed MPS trends pre-\nsented in this paper. As an example, we plot these distribu-\ntions for the analytic language effect in Figure 11. Compared\nto Figure 3, we see the same trends repeating here with some\nvariation in magnitudes. For example the median of Danalytic\nAll\nhas decreased from \u22120.9to\u22120.78here. This consistency\ndespite using alternative percentile calculations, affirms the\nreliability of our methodology and findings.\nB Robustness Against Topic and Time\nTwo potential concerns or confounding factors that could in-\nfluence the observed patterns for the four linguistic dimen-\nsions are that maybe a few topics within those dimensions\naffect the patterns, not the actual linguistic dimensions, and\nsecond, the temporal variations in the dataset. To address\nthese concerns, we conducted a series of robustness checks\nusing topic modeling techniques and temporal segmentation.\nTopic-based Analysis: For the topic analysis, we em-\nployed BERTopic. It was selected for its superior perfor-\nmance in extracting coherent and meaningful topics, as well\nas for its ability to handle the unstructured and brief nature\nof tweets effectively (Egger and Yu 2022). For each lin-\nguistic dimension (e.g., perception), we followed a four-step\nprocess:\n1. We selected a subset of tweets belonging to each linguis-\ntic dimension (e.g., perception tweets).\n2. We applied BERTopic to these subsets, using default em-\nbedding computations and allowing it to automatically\ndetermine the optimal number of topics, to identify the\nunderlying topics within that dimension.\n3. For each identified topic, we created a new dataset con-\nsisting of tweets related to that specific topic and tweets\nnot belonging to the linguistic dimension under consid-\neration (e.g., for a topic in the perception dimension, the\n1259\ndataset would include tweets related to that topic and all\nnon-perception tweets).\n4. We computed the Median Percentile Shift (MPS) (the\nsame metric as our main analysis) on this dataset to as-\nsess the robustness of our original findings.\nThe results of our topic modeling analysis revealed that the\nobserved patterns for each linguistic dimension were not\nlimited to a one or small number of specific topics. Notably,\nfor all four dimensions, we found that at least 7 out of the\ntop 10 topics (sorted by the number of tweets they cover)\nsupported the original findings1, indicating a high degree\nof consistency across a diverse range of subjects. This sug-\ngests that the engagement patterns are driven by the broader\nlinguistic characteristics captured by each dimension, rather\nthan a narrow set of topics.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that the topics\nidentified within each linguistic dimension may collectively\nplay a role in shaping user engagement. While individual\ntopics may not solely account for the observed patterns, the\ncombination of topics falling under the umbrella of a given\nlinguistic dimension may contribute to the overall effect.\nTo illustrate this, let us consider some concrete examples.\nIn the analytic language dimension, we identified a clear cli-\nmate change topic (with top keywords: \u201cclimate\u201d, \u201cenergy\u201d,\n\u201csolar\u201d, \u201ccarbon\u201d, \u201cfossil\u201d) among the top 10 topics. How-\never, we also found more general topics, such as the largest\ntopic in this group, which was food-related (with keywords:\n\u201crestaurants\u201d, \u201cmenu\u201d, \u201ccream\u201d, \u201cfood\u201d, \u201cflavor\u201d)2. Notably,\nboth of these topics, along with 7 out of the top 10 topics,\nsupported most of the patterns observed in the overall ana-\nlytic language (Figure 3).\nSimilarly, in the perception dimension, we found event-\nrelated topics like (\u201cmusic\u201d, \u201cband\u201d, \u201cconcert\u201d, \u201ctour\u201d, \u201cfes-\ntival\u201d) as the 3rd largest topic. Surprisingly, an initially un-\nexpected topic about pets (\u201cdog\u201d, \u201cpet\u201d, \u201canimal\u201d, \u201cpuppy\u201d,\n\u201cadoption\u201d) emerged as the largest topic in this group. Both\nof these topic categories supported most of the patterns in\nthe overall perception language (Figure 9).\nFinally, it is worth noting that many of the topics in each\ngroup aligned with the expected news-related topics for that\ndimension. For example, we found topics related to abor-\ntion in the analytic dimension, COVID-19 in the risk dimen-\nsion, the TikTok (ban) in clout, and music in the perception\ndimension. This consistency across multiple topics within\neach dimension suggests that the observed patterns are not\nlimited to a small subset of specific topics.\nTime-based Analysis: Time is another potential con-\nfounding factor that could influence the observed patterns.\nTo study the generalizability of our findings with regard to\nthe time window studied, we divided our data collection pe-\n1This holds true when we relaxed the significance level of the\np-values (from 0.01) to 0.1.\n2While initially unexpected, our manual analysis revealed that\nnews tweets involving these keywords often tapped into current so-\ncietal interests and lifestyle choices. Specifically, discussions about\n\u201crestaurants\u201d and \u201cfood\u201d can reflect community engagement and\npublic interest, highlighting the cultural relevance of these topics\nin the context of current events.riod (from Dec. 15, 2022, to June 2023) into three buckets\nand evaluated the tweets in each bucket individually. Us-\ning three buckets allowed the results to remain significant,\nwhereas using more buckets led to a number of samples in\nsome buckets becoming too small, compromising the signif-\nicance of those results.\nTo assess the stability of the linguistic dimensions over\ntime, we first computed the percentage of tweets belonging\nto each dimension relative to the total number of tweets in\neach bucket. Interestingly, we observed no significant differ-\nences between the percentages in the buckets and the overall\ntimeline. The percentage of tweets containing analytic lan-\nguage was consistently between 46-47% across all buckets,\nwhile perceptual language was present in 49% of tweets in\neach bucket. Similarly, the percentage of tweets containing\nrisk language remained stable at 9% across all buckets, and\nthe percentage of tweets with clout language ranged from\n32-33%. These findings suggest a consistent prevalence of\nthe four linguistic dimensions over time.\nSecond, we investigated whether the patterns observed for\neach of the four dimensions in the original analysis held true\nwhen limiting the timeline of the study to each bucket. To ac-\ncount for the reduced sample size in each bucket, we relaxed\nthe significance level of the p-value (from 0.01) to 0.1. No-\ntably, the main findings of the paper (reported in Figures 3-9)\nremained statistically significant for all four dimensions in\nall three buckets. This indicates that the observed relation-\nships between the linguistic dimensions and user engage-\nment are robust and persist over time, even when consider-\ning shorter time periods.\nThe results of our time-based analysis provide strong ev-\nidence for the stability and consistency of the observed pat-\nterns across the four linguistic dimensions. The fact that\nthe prevalence of each dimension remains relatively con-\nstant over time and that the main findings hold true in each\ntime bucket suggests that the relationships between language\nuse and user engagement are not significantly influenced by\ntemporal factors. This robustness to time-based variations\nstrengthens the validity of our conclusions and highlights\nthe enduring nature of the language-engagement dynamics\nwe have uncovered here.\nC Exploring the Interplay Between Analytic\nand Risk Language\nWhile our main analysis focused on the individual effects\nof the four linguistic dimensions (analytic, clout, percep-\ntual, and risk language) on user engagement, it is also in-\nteresting to consider the potential interplay between these\ndimensions. As a starting point, we chose to study the com-\nbined effect of analytic and risk language. For example, an-\nalytic language is associated with logical and rational think-\ning, while risk language is often characterized by emotional\nand provocative content. Investigating the interplay between\nthese two seemingly opposing dimensions can provide valu-\nable insights into how their combination influences user en-\ngagement across different publisher categories.\nThe results of our analysis when combining these dimen-\nsions are shown in Figure 12. When considering the individ-\n1260\nLeft\nLeft-CenterLeast Biased Right-CenterRight\nNon-misinfo.Misinfo.All\u221210010Median Percentiles ShiftMedianFigure 12: Combined Analytic and Risk language effect on\nengagement rates.\nual effects of these two dimensions, as seen in Figure 3 (ana-\nlytic language effect) and Figure 9 (risk language effect), we\nobserve that they have an inverse effect on most groups. For\nexample, while risk language increases engagement among\nfollowers of biased and misinformation publishers, analytic\nlanguage decreases it.\nInterestingly, when we examine the combined effect of\nanalytic and risk language, we observe a diverse set of ef-\nfects on different groups. Notably, this combination appears\nto cancel out the individual effects of both dimensions for\ntheRight group. In other words, risk language that also con-\ntains analytic themes does not significantly affect the en-\ngagement of Right followers. The same pattern is observed\nfor the Non-misinformation group and when considering all\npublishers (the Allgroup).\nThe most pronounced effect of this combined language is\nseen in the Misinformation group, with a median effect of\n2.62 percentiles, followed by the Leftgroup, with a median\neffect of 1.63 percentiles. These results suggest that the com-\nbination of analytic and risk language resonates differently\nwith various audience segments. For the Misinformation and\nLeft groups, the presence of both dimensions seems to am-\nplify engagement, possibly by making topics appealing to a\nmix of rational and emotional triggers.\nThe findings from this preliminary analysis highlight the\ncomplex interplay between linguistic dimensions and their\nimpact on user engagement. The fact that the combination of\nanalytic and risk language produces different effects across\npublisher categories underscores the importance of future\nwork also considering the interaction between dimensions.\nFuture research can extend this analysis to other combi-\nnations of linguistic dimensions, such as the interplay be-\ntween clout and perceptual language or the interaction of all\nfour dimensions. Additionally, investigating the psycholog-\nical mechanisms underlying these combined effects could\nprovide a deeper understanding of how language influences\nuser engagement and how these dynamics vary across dif-\nferent audience segments.\n1261", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "Successful Rhetorics: How Do Linguistic Dimensions Affect User Engagement with Different News Categories on Twitter?", "author": ["A Mohammadinodooshan", "N Carlsson"], "pub_year": "2025", "venue": "Proceedings of the \u2026", "abstract": "This paper analyzes how different rhetorical attributes in news tweets, specifically analytical,  clout, perceptual, and risk language, influence user engagement across publishers with"}, "filled": false, "gsrank": 695, "pub_url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/35871", "author_id": ["CiyNDzoAAAAJ", "Qd-5OWMAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?hl=en&q=info:JNH8hn_zQuwJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=694&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3D%2522mediabiasfactcheck.com%26hl%3Den%26start%3D690%26as_sdt%3D0,10&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=JNH8hn_zQuwJ&ei=g7WsaJn-LZXUieoPmrax2A8&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:JNH8hn_zQuwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22mediabiasfactcheck.com&hl=en&as_sdt=0,10", "eprint_url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/download/35871/38025"}}, {"title": "A reality check on context utilisation for retrieval-augmented generation", "year": "2024", "pdf_data": "arXiv:2412.17031v2  [cs.CL]  29 May 2025A Reality Check on Context Utilisation for\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation\nLovisa Hagstr\u00f6m\n Sara Vera Marjanovi \u00b4c\nHaeun Yu\n Arnav Arora\n Christina Lioma\nMaria Maistro\n Pepa Atanasova\n Isabelle Augenstein\nChalmers University of Technology\n University of Copenhagen\nlovhag@chalmers.se\nAbstract\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps\naddress the limitations of parametric knowl-\nedge embedded within a language model (LM).\nIn real world settings, retrieved information can\nvary in complexity, yet most investigations of\nLM utilisation of context has been limited to\nsynthetic text. We introduce DRUID (Dataset of\nRetrieved Unreliable, Insufficient and Difficult-\nto-understand contexts) with real-world queries\nand contexts manually annotated for stance.\nThe dataset is based on the prototypical task\nof automated claim verification, for which au-\ntomated retrieval of real-world evidence is cru-\ncial.

We show that synthetic datasets ex-\naggerate context characteristics rare in real re-\ntrieved data, which leads to inflated context\nutilisation results, as measured by our novel\nACU score. Moreover, while previous work\nhas mainly focused on singleton context char-\nacteristics to explain context utilisation, correla-\ntions between singleton context properties and\nACU on DRUID are surprisingly small compared\nto other properties related to context source.\nOverall, our work underscores the need for real-\nworld aligned context utilisation studies to rep-\nresent and improve performance in real-world\nRAG settings.\n1 Introduction\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can be\nused to alleviate problems arising from imperfect\nparametric knowledge of language models (LMs),\nwhich may encode limited and potentially outdated\ninformation (Gao et al., 2024; Vu et al., 2024).\nHowever, the benefits of RAG are only realised if 1)\nthe retrieval module retrieves helpful information\nand 2) the generative model successfully leverages\nthe retrieved information.

Hence, little is understood about 1)\nthe characteristics of retrieved contexts and 2) their\nimpact on LM context usage. Most notably, studies\nof LM context usage have leveraged controlled\ndatasets using synthesised context to emulate a\nlimited set of context characteristics (see Figure 1,\nleft). For example, CounterFact and its variants\nare template-based, lending a controlled albeit very\nartificial and simplistic setup (Yu et al., 2023; Du\net al., 2024). ConflictQA, on the other hand, is\nbased on a mix of generated and retrieved contexts\nto study context usage in a more realistic setup\nwith coherent and convincing contexts (Xie et al.,\n2024). Nevertheless, the scenarios described by\nthese datasets are not representative of real-world\nRAG scenarios, as the context types do not reflect\nthe diversity and complexity of the ones returned\nby an actual retriever present in RAG (Longpre\net al., 2021; Ravaut et al., 2024; Ortu et al., 2024).\nThis work studies context usage for RAG in real-\nworld scenarios with real-world queries and con-\ntext, as opposed to artificial samples. To this end,\nwe focus on the prototypical information-seeking\ntask of fact verification, where retrieving and util-\nising real-world information is vital. For the task,\nan agent is provided with a statement about the\nworld \u2013 a claim \u2013 and needs to decide whether it\nis true or false using context retrieved from an ex-\nternal source \u2013 evidence (Guo et al., 2022). We\ntake real fact-checked claims as \u2018queries\u2019 and the\nretrieved evidence as \u2018context\u2019 to evaluate RAG in\nthis real-world setting, which naturally facilitates\nour goal of studying real-world context properties\nin RAG (Samarinas et al., 2021; Atanasova et al.,\n2022; Chrysidis et al., 2024; Glockner et al., 2024).\nIn particular, this work makes three main con-\ntributions. First, we introduce DRUID (Dataset of\nRetrieved Unreliable, Insufficient and Difficult-to-\nunderstand context) with real-world (query, con-\ntext) pairs to facilitate studies of context usage\nand failures in real-world scenarios (\u00a73). Sec-\nond, we introduce a novel context-usage mea-\nsure, ACU , which rectifies issues in previous mea-\nsures. Thirdly, we highlight major differences be-\ntween popular synthetic datasets and real-world\ndata ( DRUID ): both in over-arching characteristics\n(\u00a74), as well as how the provided context is used\nacross different popular LMs (\u00a75).\nWe show that synthetic datasets oversell the\nimpact of certain context characteristics (e.g.\nknowledge conflicts), which are rare in retrieved\ndata. Furthermore, synthetic data exaggerates the\n\u2018context-repulsion\u2019 seen for LMs, as we rarely see\nthis behaviour in realistic data. Finally, we show\nthat there is no singleton context characteristic (e.g.\ncontext length or perplexity) indicating RAG fail-\nure in real-world settings. Altogether, our work\nprovides a reality check on LM context usage and\npoints to the need for real-world aligned studies\nto fully understand and improve context utilisation\nfor RAG. We also provide tools and resources to\nfacilitate such studies.1\n2 Related Work\nClaim Verification Datasets Claim verification\ndatasets typically measure an LM\u2019s ability to assess\n1https://github.com/copenlu/\ncontext-utilisation-for-RAGthe veracity of a claim based on retrieved context\n(evidence ). Importantly, the information require-\nments of this task can be challenging, resulting in\nretrieved evidence that is noisy (Samarinas et al.,\n2021; Atanasova et al., 2022; Fajcik et al., 2023;\nChrysidis et al., 2024; Glockner et al., 2022; War-\nren et al., 2025). Furthermore, as LMs fine-tuned\nfor claim verification have been shown to ignore\nevidence (Schuster et al., 2019, 2021), it is im-\nportant to understand the causes of this behaviour.\nTherefore, with DRUID , we are the first to collect\nannotations for a range of \u2018noisy\u2019 characteristics\nof retrieved real-world contexts to assess how they\naffect LMs. Furthermore, unlike concurrent claim\nverification datasets, which either present artificial\nsamples or a limited or less realistic scenario for\ncontext retrieval (Thorne et al., 2018; Augenstein\net al., 2019; Diggelmann et al., 2020; Schlichtkrull\net al., 2023), DRUID includes contexts automatically\nretrieved from the web to assess their impact on\nRAG, leading to a wide diversity of context prop-\nerties including insufficient andleaked evidence.\nNo other existing fact-checking datasets fulfil all\nof these properties (see Table 4 in the Appendix).\nDatasets for Context Usage Investigations Two\npopular datasets used for context usage investiga-\ntions are CounterFact and ConflictQA (Meng et al.,\n2022; Xie et al., 2024). These datasets contain syn-\nthesised queries based on fact triplets from LAMA\n(Petroni et al., 2019) (e.g. Thomas Ong-citizen of-\nSingapore) for which some contexts have been syn-\nthesised to induce knowledge conflicts by promot-\ning answers in conflict with the parametric memory\nof the studied LM (e.g. \u2018Pakistan\u2019 as opposed to\n\u2018Singapore\u2019). The datasets have found widespread\nuse for work on mechanistic interpretability and\nthe evaluation of context utilisation (Meng et al.,\n2022; Geva et al., 2023; Ortu et al., 2024).\nSimilarly to CounterFact and ConflictQA, DRUID\ncontains queries and corresponding contexts to-\ngether with gold labels to facilitate evaluations of\ncontext utilisation. The main difference between\nDRUID and the two other datasets lies in how the\nqueries and contexts were produced. For Counter-\nFact and ConflictQA, the queries have been auto-\nmatically synthesised based on WikiData subject-\nrelation-object knowledge triplets (e.g. \u27e8George\nLarkin, occupation, lawyer \u27e9to produce \u201cGeorge\nLarkin is a lawyer.\u201d) and the contexts have either\nbeen synthesised based on an edited knowledge\ntriplet or generated by an LLM prompted to pro-\nduce alternative context supporting some edited\nknowledge triplet. This makes it easy to infer the\ngold labels for the synthesised contexts, while it\nis not representative of a real-world context usage\nscenario. DRUID, on the other hand, is based on\nqueries sampled from naturally occurring claims\nand contexts from the web, retrieved by automated\nretrieval methods representative of a real-world\nRAG setup.\nImpact of Context Characteristics for RAG\nWork in information retrieval and RAG has iden-\ntified several qualities in retrieved or synthesised\ncontexts that impact context utilisation by humans\nand/or LMs. Retrievers typically provide overly\nlong or corrupted text, which are difficult to un-\nderstand , and impact LM output (Gao et al., 2024;\nVladika and Matthes, 2023). Similarly, typos (Cho\net al., 2024) and high perplexity (Gonen et al.,\n2023) have been identified as potential disruptors\nfor RAG systems. Furthermore, implicit contexts,\nlacking an explicit connection to the query, have\nbeen identified as a prevalent failure cause in RAG\n(Li et al., 2024b). For automated retrieval situa-\ntions, the rate of implicit contexts can be high due\nto chunking of text (Wang et al., 2024a). Instead,\nLMs have been shown to prefer context with high\nquery-context similarities (Wan et al., 2024).\nMost studies on RAG have focused on open-\ndomain question answering (Kasai et al., 2023; Wu\net al., 2024). Yoran et al. (2023); Shi et al. (2023)\nfound that LMs are fragile to irrelevant informa-\ntionin the context, harming performance. Further-\nmore, in the case of knowledge conflicts , when\ncontext conflicts with parametric knowledge, LMs\nhave been shown to ignore the conflicting context\n(Longpre et al., 2021), while other studies show\nthat models prefer contextual information, as long\nas it is coherent and convincing (Xie et al., 2023).\nSun et al. (2025) also connect knowledge conflicts\nto prediction uncertainty in fact-checking settings.\nRecently, Xu et al. (2024) have proposed more\ngranular categories for knowledge conflicts, using\ncontext-memory conflict to denote the aforemen-\ntioned phenomenon, and inter-context conflict to\nrefer to different contexts contradicting each other.\nMarjanovic et al. (2024) further study real-world\nknowledge conflicts caused by dynamic facts, find-\ning that RAG struggles the most with these.\nUnreliable contexts have been studied by Chry-\nsidis et al. (2024) in a fact-checking setup, for\nwhich misinformation is prevalent.

References to external sources\nmay convince a human reader of the credibility\nof some context, yet LMs seem to be impervi-\nous (Wan et al., 2024). However, expressed cer-\ntainty/uncertainty in text and its impact on LM\ncontext usage has recently been studied by Du et al.\n(2024), where assertive contexts are found to be\nmore convincing.\nIn our creation of DRUID we combine all these\naforementioned insights to annotate naturally oc-\ncurring context characteristics of interest.\n3 DRUID\nPrevious studies of context utilisation leverage syn-\nthetic datasets with synthesised claims and con-\ntexts, ignoring the retrieval part in RAG (Yu et al.,\n2023; Xie et al., 2024). We develop the datasets\nDRUID (5,490 samples) and DRUID+ (48,517 sam-\nples) to enable studies of context utilisation for\nreal-world scenarios. To this end, we collect real-\nworld claims from fact-checking sites and use au-\ntomated retrieval to fetch corresponding evidence\nfrom the web .DRUID is a high-quality subset of\nDRUID+ manually annotated for evidence relevance\nand stance. A DRUID sample consists of a \u27e8claim,\nevidence, labels \u27e9triple. More details on the dataset\ncan be found in Table 1 and Appendix C.\n3.1 Claim Collection\nWe sample claims verified by fact-checkers using\nGoogle\u2019s Factcheck API.2We only sample claims\nin English. The claims are collected from 7 diverse\n2https://developers.google.com/fact-check/\ntools/api/reference/rest .\nfact-checking sources, representing science, pol-\nitics, Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka, the US, India,\nFrance, etc. All claims have been assessed by hu-\nman fact-checkers. Further details on the claim\ncollection can be found in Appendix D.\n3.2 Evidence Collection\nFor each claim in DRUID andDRUID+ , we retrieve\nup to 5 and 40 snippets of evidence, respectively.\nFirst, a gold-standard evidence document is re-\ntrieved from the original fact-checking site, which\nis the \u2018summary\u2019 of the fact-checking article writ-\nten by the author of the article. For the remaining\nsnippets of evidence, we use an automated retrieval\nmethod (Appendix D). We collect the top 20 search\nresults for each of the Google and Bing search\nengines. The found webpages are then chunked\ninto paragraphs and reranked by the Cohere rerank\nmodel.3Evidence corresponding to the top-ranked\nchunks is included in DRUID .\n3.3 Relevance and Stance Annotation\nSince the evidence is collected using automated re-\ntrieval, as opposed to controlled synthesis, we need\nto assess the relevance of the retrieved information\nto the claim, and, if it is relevant, what stance it\nrepresents (Wang et al., 2024c). For this, we crowd-\nsource evidence-level annotations using Prolific4\nand Potato (Pei et al., 2022). Each evidence piece\ninDRUID is double annotated for relevance (rele-\nvant ornot relevant ) and stance to the claim ( sup-\nports ,insufficient-supports ,insufficient-neutral ,\ninsufficient-contradictory ,insufficient-refutes orre-\nfutes ). More details on the annotation, guidelines\nand examples from the annotation interface can be\nfound in Appendix M.\nThe annotator compensation was approximately\n9 GBP/hour (the compensation was fixed for each\ntask while the annotator completion time varied).\n4 Context Characteristics\nTo understand the gap between the context pro-\nvided in current diagnostic datasets for context us-\nage and real RAG scenarios, we compare the char-\nacteristics present within our real-world dataset\nDRUID to the synthetic datasets CounterFact (Ortu\net al., 2024) and ConflictQA (Xie et al., 2024). By\nvirtue of their controlled setup, these and similar\n3rerank-english-v3.0 from https://docs.cohere.\ncom/v2/docs/rerank-2 .\n4https://www.prolific.com/datasets have seen much use for the study of con-\ntext utilisation and mechanisms thereof (Jin et al.,\n2024; Du et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2024; Kortukov\net al., 2024).\nTo ensure adequate comparison, we recast all\nsamples in CounterFact and ConflictQA to a claim-\nevidence format (see Appendix E). This can be\ndone without loss of information as all datasets\nrepresent a binary task for the LM (answer in align-\nment with the evidence or not). Furthermore, we\nshow in Appendix F that the analysis of context util-\nisation and mechanisms thereof are unaffected by\nthe format of the task being either answer comple-\ntion or claim verification \u2013 the reformatting leads\nto no change in the mechanism employed by the\nmodel and its manipulation results.\nIn addition to the aforementioned datasets, we\nalso present the characteristics of DRUID+ to better\nunderstand the impact of only collecting the top-\nranked evidence for DRUID .\n4.1 Detection of Context Characteristics\nSeveral context characteristics impacting context\nutilisation by humans and/or LMs have been iden-\ntified by previous work (Section 2). As opposed to\nsynthesising contexts with certain properties, we\ndetect those in existing datasets. Along with man-\nual annotation of relevance and stance, we lever-\nage automated methods. We experiment with two\ntypes of automated detection methods to assess\ncontext characteristics: 1) rule-based methods and\n2) prompt-an-LLM methods. For the latter we zero-\nshot prompt the Cohere Command R+ model.5\nInitial trials leveraging human annotations of\ncontext characteristics showed high annotator dis-\nagreements, potentially due to the subjective na-\nture of some of the characteristics, and were con-\nsequently abandoned. Instead, we opted to op-\nerationalise the properties, as we further describe\nbelow. This allows us to explore more model-based\nmeasures of context characteristics, which can be\nexpected to have a greater impact on model context\nusage vis-a-vis subjective human perception of the\nsame characteristics.\nRelevance and stance ForDRUID , we use the\nmanual relevance and stance annotations. For\nCounterFact and ConflictQA we infer those as fol-\nlows. CounterFact contains counterfactual claims,\nfor which the evidence is either the claim repeated\n(supports) or the claim but with the correct object\n5command-r-plus (chat-only mode)\nrestored (refutes). For each ConflictQA entry, we\nhave a model-generated claim and two types of ev-\nidence \u2013 parametric memory aligned (supports) or\ncounter memory aligned (refutes).\nClaim-evidence similarity This is measured us-\ning Jaccard similarity (see Appendix G), which\noutputs values between [0,1], where 1 signifies\nmaximum similarity. The overlap of claim words\nwith evidence words, scaled by the number of claim\nwords (\u2018Claim-evidence overlap\u2019) is also measured.\nIn addition, we detect if the evidence repeats the\nclaim verbatim (\u2018Repeats claim\u2019).\nDifficult to understand We measure the Flesch\nreading ease score, claim length (number of char-\nacters), evidence length (number of characters) and\nmodel context perplexities for our studied mod-\nels (Llama 3.1 8B and Pythia 6.9B) to proxy how\n\u2018difficult to understand\u2019 is the context. Generally,\nwe may consider samples that correspond to high\nmodel perplexities to be confusing to the model.\nImplicit We detect named entities (NEs) in the\nclaim and measure the overlap with entities found\nin the evidence (\u2018Claim entity overlap\u2019). spaCy\nen_core_web_trf (based on RoBERTa-base) is\nused for the NE detection. Values are \u2208[0,1]\nwhere 0 means that no NEs reappear in the evidence\n(maximum implicitness) and 1 means that all NEs\nwere found in the evidence.\nRefers to external source Command R+ is\nprompted to tell whether some evidence contains a\nreference to an external source or not (\u2018Detection\nby LLM\u2019). Initial evaluation results show this detec-\ntion method to align well with human annotations\nof the characteristic.\nUncertain We use a lexicon-based approach pro-\nposed by Islam et al. (2020) to detect hedge words\nand hedging discourse markers in the evidence to\nproxy \u2018uncertain\u2019 (\u2018Contains hedging\u2019 and \u2018Con-\ntains hedging discourse\u2019). If a hedge word or hedg-\ning discourse marker is detected in the evidence, it\nis marked as \u2018uncertain\u2019 according to that method.\nUnreliable We use manually curated lists by Me-\ndia Bias/Fact Check6(MBFC) to automatically de-\ntect whether the evidence piece originates from a\nweb page marked as using questionable sources,\npromoting conspiracy/pseudoscience or being a\nsatire site (\u2018Unreliable source\u2019). However, due to\n6https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the sparsity of the MBFC lists, we are unable to\ndetect unreliability for all evidence in DRUID and\nDRUID+ , lacking results for 26% and 34% of the\nsamples, respectively. For CounterFact and Con-\nflictQA there are no evidence sources to analyse.\nAdditional characteristics We check whether\nthe evidence can be seen as directly pointing out\na verdict by measuring whether the evidence con-\ntains the word \u2018True\u2019 or \u2018False\u2019. For the DRUID\nandDRUID+ datasets, we also record whether the\nevidence was published after the claim was made,\nas this allows to measure the occurrence of and\neffects of leaked information (\u2018Pub after claim\u2019)\n(Schlichtkrull et al., 2023). Similarly, we mea-\nsure whether the evidence comes from a fact-check\nwebpage as this can be expected to contain addi-\ntional leaked information (\u2018Fact-check source\u2019) and\nwhether it comes from the original fact-checking\nsite summary (\u2018Gold source\u2019).\n4.2 Analysis of Context Characteristics\nRelevance and stance Relevance and stance an-\nnotations for all datasets are shown in Tables 8\nand 9 in the Appendix. Most contexts are annotated\nas relevant; however, given the more ambiguous\nnature of real-world queries, especially in claim\nverification, there is more variety in the kinds of\nstances presented by the context provided in DRUID :\nthe majority of the automatically retrieved contexts\n(50%) do not have a clear stance or are not suffi-\ncient for addressing the query. This is the conse-\nquence of using automated retrieval, for which not\neven state-of-the-art methods based on commercial\nsearch engines and Cohere modules are capable of\nconsistently retrieving \u2018gold standard context\u2019. Ad-\nmittedly, the retrieval setup is used in a zero-shot\nfashion and performance may improve somewhat\nwith additional fine-tuning, while it would not solve\nall insufficiency issues stemming from automated\nretrieval. Conversely, synthesised samples always\nassume sufficient context. Our results show a clear\ndiscrepancy between synthesised and real-world\ndatasets, proving the need for real-world aligned\ndatasets for studies of context usage.\nDRUID in comparison with other RAG datasets\nThe detected context characteristics for the syn-\nthetic datasets and DRUID are shown in Figure 2.\nMore detailed results can be found in Appendix I.\nThe synthetic CounterFact dataset has the highest\nFlesch reading ease scores, significantly shorter ev-\nidence lengths, frequent repetitions of the claim in\nFigure 2: Average values for the context characteristics\nin CounterFact (Yu et al., 2023), ConflictQA (Xie et al.,\n2024) and DRUID datasets. The characteristics and their\ndetection are described in Sections 2 and 4.1, respec-\ntively.\nthe evidence, significantly higher Jaccard similarity\nvalues and very few uncertainty markers relative\nto the other investigated datasets. CounterFact was\ndesigned to showcase simple knowledge conflict\nscenarios, causing much greater perplexity for both\ninvestigated LMs. In general, CounterFact is tai-\nlored to a specific type of context usage that is not\nindicative of real, retrieved context, as shown by\nthe comparison to DRUID . The generated evidence\nfor ConflictQA has characteristics more similar to\nthose of DRUID . However, we can see that DRUID\nhas much longer claims and evidence than seen in\neither of the other datasets; furthermore, there are\nmore uncertainty markers and a greater degree of\nimplicitness in the naturally occurring context in\ntheDRUID dataset.\nMemory conflicts are less prevalent in real-\nworld scenarios. We measure context-memoryconflicts by comparing the parametric model pre-\ndiction (no context or evidence provided) with the\nstance of the provided evidence. We have a conflict\nif the prediction and stance are either \u2018Refutes\u2019 or\n\u2018Supports\u2019 and do not align. For Llama 3.1 8B we\nrecord memory conflicts on 97.41% of the support-\ning evidence from CounterFact and on 71.16% of\nthe refuting evidence from ConflictQA. For DRUID ,\nwe identify memory conflicts for 58.09% of the sup-\nporting evidence. Evidently, the rate of memory\nconflict is lower in real-world scenarios compared\nto artificial scenarios. More detailed results and the\nresults for Pythia can be found in Table 21.\n5 Context Utilisation\nWe aim to assess the transferability of insights\nbased on synthesised scenarios to real-world sce-\nnarios. To this end, we evaluate and compare LM\ncontext utilisation results on synthetic datasets to\nresults on DRUID .\n5.1 Method\nWe measure the context utilisation of Pythia 6.9B\nand Llama 3.1 8B, two models from two model\nfamilies widely used in RAG-evaluation studies\n(Biderman et al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Ortu\net al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2024), on the\nCounterFact, ConflictQA and DRUID datasets. To\nmeasure context utilisation, the models are evalu-\nated in two modes: 1) without evidence and 2) with\nevidence. In both modes, the models are prompted\nto assess the veracity of a given claim (True, False,\nor None), without and with evidence respectively.\nMore details on the prompting can be found in Ap-\npendix J. We evaluate context utilisation using the\nsoftmaxed model logits, which we describe further\nin the next section. In the main paper, we only\nshow results for supporting and refuting evidence;\nbehaviour for all forms of \u2018insufficient\u2019 evidence\n(where \u2018None\u2019 is the expected model output) can\nbe found in Appendices K and L.\n5.2 Evaluation\nThere is no consistent measure for context usage\nacross similar work; many studies look simply at\nchanges in overall output distributions (Du et al.,\n2024; Marjanovic et al., 2024), which does not\nguarantee that the change is relevant to the pro-\nvided context. Works in mechanistic interpretabil-\nity often rely on logit differences for a specific\ntoken given evidence (Ortu et al., 2024; Yu et al.,\n2023), which are not normalised, do not factor in\ndesired change, and limit comparisons. Due to\nthese issues, we introduce a novel measure ( ACU ),\nwhich 1) uses softmax-normalised probabilities,\nto ensure meaningful comparison, 2) focuses on\nprobabilities of specific tokens, to ensure relevant\nchange, and 3) scales these values by the amount\nof possible increase in probability. To measure\ncontext usage for a model M, we consider the\nre-scaled difference in salient token probability\nt\u2208T={True,None,False}for a claim Cbe-\ntween settings with and without evidence E, as\nfollows.\n\u2206PM(t|C, E) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3PM(t|C,E )\u2212PM(t|C)\n1\u2212PM(t|C)\nifPM(t|C,E )\u2265PM(t|C),\nPM(t|C,E )\u2212PM(t|C)\nPM(t|C)\notherwise.(1)\nHere, PM(t|C)andPM(t|C, E)denote the output\nprobabilities for token t\u2208Tby model Mgiven a\nclaim Cand evidence E, respectively. The rescal-\ning ensures that our metric is less sensitive to the\noriginal P(t|C)value. We expect high positive\nvalues of \u2206PM(t|C, E)fortthat align with the\nstance of Eand the opposite for tthat conflict with\nthe stance. For example, given an evidence piece\nwith the stance refutes we should ideally measure\na high value for \u2206PM(False|C, E)and low values\nfor\u2206PM(True|C, E)and\u2206PM(None|C, E).\nWe define a score of accumulated context usage\n(ACU) per sample {C, E}with stance SEfor a\nmodel Mas follows.\nACU( C, E, S E, M) = (2)\n=1\n|T|X\nt\u2208TD(t, SE)\u2206PM(t|C, E)\nD(t, SE)denotes the desirable change in \u2206PMfor\nmaximum context usage, which is either {-1,1},\ndepending on the annotated stance of the evidence.\nFor example, D(False ,refutes) = 1 , whereas\nD(True ,refutes) = D(None ,refutes) = \u22121.\nThis limits the range of ACU between [\u22121,1].\n5.3 How do LMs utilise real-world retrieved\ncontext compared to synthesised context?\nWe inspect the context usage behavior of Pythia\nand Llama on CounterFact, ConflictQA and DRUID\nto understand how LMs utilise real-world context\ncompared to synthetic contexts. Accumulated con-\ntext usage scores (Equation (2)) can be found in\nCounterFact ConflictQA DRUIDrefutes supports refutes supports refutes supports0.4\n0.2\n0.00.20.40.60.8ACUmodel\nLlama\nPythiaFigure 3: ACU (Equation (2)) for each model and\ndataset. The error bars indicate the standard devia-\ntion. Negative ACU values indicate \u2018context-repulsion\u2019:\nchanges in probability away from the annotated evi-\ndence stance. The dashed horizontal lines indicate aver-\nage ACU scores for each model and dataset.\nFigure 3. See Appendix K for more granular con-\ntext usage results. We structure the analysis around\na set of main findings, listed below.\nSynthetic datasets suggest an over-preference\nof supporting evidence. While we see varia-\ntions in model behaviour for our two synthetic\ndatasets, ConflictQA and CounterFact, there are\nalso some over-arching similarities: context utili-\nsation is much greater for supporting evidence. In\nthe case of refuting evidence, we often see neg-\native ACU scores, indicating \u2018context-repulsion\u2019,\nchanges in probability away from the stance of the\nprovided context, which indicates low robustness;\nthis is strongest for ConflictQA, which also has the\ngreatest ACU scores for supporting context. This\nmay be the consequence of the ConflictQA claims\nhaving been generated by Llama 2 7B and some of\nthe supporting contexts having been generated by\nChatGPT (they are aligned with parametric mem-\nory, which has been shown to increase context utili-\nsation (Xie et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2024)). However,\nthis preference for supporting evidence is also seen\nin CounterFact, which is surprising as the refuting\nevidence should align with LM parametric mem-\nory. This may be explained by the synthetic and\nconfusing nature of CounterFact samples, leading\nto high model perplexities (See Figure 2.)\nWe see a different behaviour with our real-world\ndataset DRUID : we rarely see context repulsion, and\nwe see reduced ACU scores for supporting evi-\ndence. These lower ACU scores for supporting evi-\ndence may stem from the lack of generated context\n(vis-a-vis ConflictQA), and the increased ACU for\nrefuting evidence may be due to the lower perplex-\nities of the context (vis-a-vis CounterFact). This\nhighlights the need for real-world contexts for stud-\nies of context utilisation: automatically generated\ncontexts, by automated template-filling or LLM\ngeneration, inevitably induce properties that inter-\nfere with studies of context utilisation.\nDifferent models show different context usage.\nNotably, Llama and Pythia behave very differently\non all datasets studied. Potentially, this owes to\nCounterFact having been designed to elicit knowl-\nedge conflicts in Pythia and ConflictQA having\nbeen based on claims generated by Llama 2 7B.\nHowever, DRUID has not been customised to a spe-\ncific model and results on this dataset clearly show\nhow context usage varies across models. More-\nover, we find that Llama on average is more faith-\nful to the contexts of all datasets (and demonstrates\nless context-repulsion), yet remains understudied\nin context-utilisation studies (Ortu et al., 2024; Du\net al., 2024). These results are further corroborated\nin Hagstr\u00f6m et al. (2025), for which multiple LMs\nof different model family and size are benchmarked\nfor their context utilisation.\n5.4 Does LM context usage depend on\ncharacteristics of the evidence/context?\nWe evaluate the influence of different context char-\nacteristics (see \u00a74.1) on model context usage. For\nthis, we calculate Spearman correlations between\neach context property and our context usage met-\nric, ACU (Equation (2)), stratified by the evidence\nstance for each dataset. The results for Llama are\nshown in Figure 4. Results for Pythia, insufficient\nevidence from DRUID and additional fine-grained\ncorrelation results can be found in Appendix L.\nWhile we see a limited effect of any one character-\nistic, we highlight overarching findings below.\nContext from fact-check sources have greater\nACU scores. Llama and Pythia are more likely to\nbe faithful to refuting context from a fact-checking\nsource. Most likely, this general property captures\na characteristic not fully captured by the more fine-\ngrained detection methods. Previous manual in-\nspection of fact-check articles indicates a higher\nrate of assertive and to-the-point language, which\nmay explain these observations.

Significant correlation values\n(p-value < 0.05) are marked in bold .\ncheck articles are more likely to directly discuss\nthe claims in a one-hop manner with multiple argu-\nments, possibly making them more convincing to\nthe LM. We hypothesise that a similar case holds\nfor \u2018Pub. after claim\u2019 and \u2018Gold source\u2019. Simi-\nlar results are observed for Pythia. The restricted\ngeneration process of the synthetic datasets makes\nsimilar investigations impossible.\nPrevious studies of context utilisation have fo-\ncused on the effects of singular context character-\nistics in isolation. Our work hints at the relevance\nof including aggregates of features in the analysis,\nas these may better explain context utilisation in\nreal-world scenarios. For example, contexts from\na certain source, like fact-checking articles, may\nexpress aggregates of features.\nReferences to external sources show low corre-\nlations with ACU. We measure low correlations\nwith whether the evidence refers to an external\nsource on both ConflictQA and DRUID . Our results\non ConflictQA and DRUID show slightly greater\nimportance of references for supporting contexts,\nwhile the values measured are fairly low. Using\na synthetic dataset, Wan et al. (2024) found LM\ncontext usage to be insensitive to references to ex-\nternal sources. Our results on the real-world DRUID\ndataset support this conclusion.\nCorrelations with claim-evidence similarity\nproperties are low for DRUID .For ConflictQA\nwe measure the highest correlation with context us-\nage for claim-evidence overlap for supporting con-\ntexts. The same does not hold for DRUID . Previous\nwork by Tan et al. (2024) on controlled context-\nconflicting datasets found LMs to prioritise con-\ntexts with high similarities between query and con-\ntext. Our results indicate that real-world queries\nand contexts come with a greater complexity for\nwhich context usage cannot be predicted solely\nbased on query-context similarity.\nLMs are less faithful to long contexts. Llama is\nless likely to be faithful to long refuting contexts\non both DRUID and ConflictQA. We note how the\nresults do not generalise to CounterFact, which\nmight be explained by the more synthetic nature of\nCounterFact compared to ConflictQA.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this work, we ground studies of context utili-\nsation to real-world RAG scenarios. We develop\nDRUID and compare it to synthesised datasets previ-\nously used to study context-utilisation. DRUID is a\nclaim-verification dataset which contains naturally\noccurring claims and manually annotated evidence\nautomatically retrieved from the web. We find fun-\ndamental differences in dataset characteristics be-\ntween DRUID and synthetic datasets (CounterFact\nand ConflictQA). We also introduce a novel ACU\nscore to consistently measure context utilisation\nacross LMs and datasets. On DRUID , correlations\nbetween singleton context properties and ACU are\nsurprisingly small compared to other properties\nrelated to context source (e.g. contexts coming\nfrom specific types of websites). We hypothesise\nthat, rather than singleton features, this owes to\nan aggregation of several characteristics contribut-\ning to context usage. This suggests the common\nfactors impacting RAG success are broader than\npreviously expected, and further work needs to be\ndone to identify fine-grained causes of RAG failure.\nFurthermore, given the use of synthetic datasets to\nidentify mechanistic components of context usage\n(Ortu et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023), our results call\ninto question the generalisability of the findings.\nWith DRUID , we provide resources that better facili-\ntate mechanistic and behavioural studies of context\nusage in real-world scenarios.7 Limitations\nOur work leverages claim verification as a vehi-\ncle for studies of realistic context utilisation. It is\nnot fully clear whether insights related to context\nutilisation on this task will transfer to other RAG\ntasks, such as question-answering, which is overly\nrepresented in RAG evaluations. However, claim\nverification is a complex information-seeking task\nand we expect other tasks to have a large overlap or\nsubset of properties with it. For example, as seen\nin this work, the QA format for CounterFact and\nConflictQA is easily recast as a claim verification\ntask. Furthermore, we show that intervention meth-\nods developed for QA tasks easily transfer to the\nsame datasets when recast to a claim-verification\nsetting in Appendix F. This suggests that some\nfindings can be generalisable across tasks. Future\nwork could expand on this work to incorporate\nother RAG-specific tasks to better understand the\ngeneralisability of context utilisation behaviours.\nIn our creation of DRUID we leverage an au-\ntomated retrieval method based on commercial\nsearch engines and the Cohere Rerank model.\nWhile this method builds on state-of-the-art de-\nvelopments within the field of information re-\ntrieval, there are many other methods and tools we\ncould have chosen, which could impact the context\ncharacteristics and model behaviour (Wang et al.,\n2024b; Katsimpras and Paliouras, 2024; Chen et al.,\n2024). A comprehensive comparison of different\nretrieval methods and their impact on context utili-\nsation would be an interesting direction for future\nwork.\nIn our creation of DRUID , we ensure to source\nclaims from many different fact-checking sites to\nincrease the representation of our dataset to the\nentire English-speaking world. However, it is not\na uniform distribution, and the amount of context\ngathered per claim as well as the inter-annotator\nagreement for the context stances differs across\nclaim sources. This could be due to unintentional\ncultural biases within our retrieval system or our an-\nnotators. Future work could investigate the impact\nof these cultural biases in the retrieval process on\nmodel output .DRUID , given its wide distribution of\nclaim and evidence sources, would be an excellent\ndataset for such an investigation.\nDRUID is based on a fact-checking task, meaning\nthat it covers a limited set of domains. This may\naffect the conclusions based on the dataset, com-\npared to other datasets situated in different domains.\nMeanwhile, it is worth noting that no dataset is free\nof this problem \u2013 both CounterFact and ConflictQA\nhave a limited scope by only focusing on WikiData\ntriplets. DRUID is in comparison to these datasets\nbetter at covering different domains. Other more\nrealistic datasets would also be limited by the char-\nacteristics of the domains they are situated in. For\nfuture work it would be interesting to investigate\nwhether one can control for and disentangle do-\nmain effects on context utilisation , something the\nDRUID dataset should be useful for.\nWhile we investigate the impact of many char-\nacteristics on context utilisation, it is not exhaus-\ntive. Future work could look into the impact of\nother context characteristics on context utilisation .\nFor example, our study and dataset omit interest-\ning context characteristics related to propaganda,\nsimplified or manipulated content, anecdotal, mix\nof languages, multimodality, multi-hop reasoning,\npreciseness etc. (Piskorski et al., 2023; Wan et al.,\n2021; Jiang et al., 2020; Dufour et al., 2024). These\nproperties would be relevant to study in future\nwork.\nIn this work, we study the context utilisation be-\nhaviours of Llama 3.1 8B and Pythia 6.9B, two pop-\nular LMs used for RAG-evaluation studies. With\nthis selection, we represent two families of mod-\nels and can already reveal great disparities in con-\ntext utilisation between synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. For future work, it would be interesting to\nfurther investigate the context utilisation of more\nmodel families and different model sizes . All fu-\nture studies are well-facilitated by the dataset and\nevaluation framework we introduce in this work.\nWhile we include a comprehensive correlation\nanalysis to identify the dependence between our\nstudied characteristics and context usage, it does\nnot give any information about causality. Future\nwork could include a more comprehensive causal\nanalysis . A causal analysis is necessary to fully\nunderstand the effects of different context charac-\nteristics on context utilisation (Feder et al., 2022).\nGiven that our findings indicate that context utilisa-\ntion cannot be predicted by one singleton character-\nistic, there are likely many potential confounders\nwithin DRUID , and all real, retrieved text. Future\nwork on this could take inspiration from the studies\nby Gui and Veitch (2023). While our work provides\na good starting point for RAG evaluations of con-\ntext characteristics, our findings show that more\nwork is needed to fully understand the complex\nbehaviours governing context usage.8 Ethical Considerations\nOur work concerns the evaluation of RAG-based\nmodels on veracity prediction in a real-world set-\nting. In the creation of the dataset, while we tried\nto maintain representativeness of the real world by\nincluding sources of data from different parts of the\nworld, we introduced biases by selecting only En-\nglish language sources. Consequently, our results\nonly stand for claims and corresponding evidence\nsentences in English. For the annotation tasks, we\ndo not retain any information about the annotators\nand pay them a fair wage as determined by the an-\nnotation platform. We also informed the annotators\nabout how their data would be used and received\ntheir consent. However, for ease of understand-\ning the subject matter and increasing chances of\nagreement, we screened the annotator pool to only\ninclude participants with at least an undergraduate\ndegree, English fluency, no language-related disor-\nders, and UK, US or Irish nationality. While this\nhelped achieve higher-quality annotations, it limits\nthe perspectives embedded in the dataset and may\nreinforce cultural biases, which we acknowledge\nas a potential risk.\nOtherwise, we do not foresee any pressing po-\ntential risks with this work. We performed founda-\ntional research focused on evaluation, which should\ncome with few implications for malicious use, en-\nvironmental impact, security violations, etc.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was co-funded by the Euro-\npean Union (ERC, ExplainYourself, 101077481),\nby the Pioneer Centre for AI, DNRF grant number\nP1, as well as by The Villum Synergy Programme.\nViews and opinions expressed are however those\nof the author(s) only and do not necessarily re-\nflect those of the European Union or the European\nResearch Council.

Association for Com-\nputational Linguistics.\nA Computational resources\nAll models are evaluated without fine-tuning on\none A40 Nvidia GPU per evaluation. The total\ncomputational budget for the evaluation was about\n100 GPU hours.\nB Use of AI assistants\nAI assistants like Copilot and ChatGPT were in-\ntermittently used to generate template code and\nrephrase sentences in the paper, etc. However, no\ncomplete paper sections or code scripts have been\ngenerated by an AI assistant. All generated content\nhas been inspected and verified by the authors.\nC DRUID\nDataset statistics for DRUID+ can be found in Ta-\nble 2 and statistics for claims with inter-context\nconflicts can be found in Table 3. Inter-context con-\nflicts are measured based on the annotated stance\nof each evidence piece; if we find evidence pieces\nwith different stance (\u2018Refutes\u2019 or \u2018Supports\u2019) for\nthe same claim, we mark the claim as having con-\nflicting evidence.\nA comparison of DRUID to other fact-checking\ndatasets can be found in Table 4. FEVER is marked\nassynthetic and not representative of realistic sce-\nnarios for context retrieval as the samples in the\ndataset have been artificially generated by the fol-\nlowing process: 1) take a random sentence from\nWikipedia, 2) give this sentence to an annotator\nand ask them to make up a set of claims based onthe sentence, 3) ask annotators to produce addi-\ntional mutations of the claims and 4) fetch match-\ning contexts mainly from the matching Wikipedia\npages. This process is not representative of a re-\nalistic use case for context augmentation, as the\nclaims do not match real information needs and the\nevidence is sourced from nearly perfect Wikipedia\npage matches.

(2024a)\nThe method for sampling the claims is adapted to\nbalance out the precedence of False and US-centric\nfact-checked claims. To this end, we sample the\nclaims to ensure, to the extent possible, (1) an even\ndistribution across the 7 fact-checking sources, (2)\nan even distribution across True, False and Half-\ntrue claims, and (3) an even distribution of claims\nposted before and after 2023 (to ensure we also\nobtain claims and evidence unlikely to be present in\nthe assessed LM\u2019s training data). For the sampling,\nwe first prioritise (1), followed by (2) etc. Due\nto a shortage of some claims, we cannot achieve\ncompletely uniform distributions.\nWe remove all claims that mention a \u2018photo\u2019 or a\n\u2018video\u2019 to limit fact-verification to a single media.\nD.2 Claim veracity mappings\nWe map the claim veracity labels to \u2018True\u2019, \u2018False\u2019\nor \u2018Half-true\u2019 as shown in Table 5.\nD.3 Automated evidence retrieval\nGiven a claim, the method is as follows:\nUse search engines to search the web for relevant\nweb pages. Fetch the top 20 search results for the\nclaim from the Google and Bing search engines,Our label Incoming label\nTrue True\nTRUE\nACCURATE\nACCURATE WITH CONSIDERA-\nTION\nCorrect\nMostly accurate\nAccurate\nHalf-true Half True\nPARTLY TRUE\nCorrect But...\nMostly_Accurate\nPartially correct\nFalse False\nFALSE\nMISLEADING\nMisleading\nInaccurate\nIncorrect, Flawed_Reasoning\nINACCURATE\nINACCURATE WITH CONSIDERA-\nTION\nTable 5: The claim veracity label mappings used for the\ncreation of DRUID andDRUID+ . Claims corresponding\nto verdict labels not listed in the table are dropped.\nrespectively.7The results are de-duplicated as they\nmay overlap. From this step on, no regard is paid\nto the search engine ranks, while they are stored\n7We used their respective APIs customsearch.\ngoogleapis.com/customsearch/v1 and api.bing.\nmicrosoft.com/v7.0/search . Search results were retrieved\nin October 2024.\nfor potential future use cases.\nChunk the content of each web page. The\nsearch results consist of full web pages, for which\nnot all page content can be expected to be immedi-\nately useful for the claim verification. Similarly to\nDiggelmann et al. (2020) we use an extractive ap-\nproach based on chunking to get concise evidence\nthat fits into the model context window. Each para-\ngraph on the web page forms a chunk if it contains\nfewer than 200 words. Paragraphs longer than 200\nwords are split into multiple chunks of up to 200\nwords. This approach is based on manual tuning\nand inspection of some retrieved evidence.\nGet reranker scores for the chunks. The search\nengines provide a quite coarse filter for relevant in-\nformation with high recall but low precision. More-\nover, the search engines cannot extract the rele-\nvant snippets from the search results. To get more\nprecise and accurate retrieved contexts we use a\nreranker (Diggelmann et al., 2020). Specifically,\nwe use the Cohere Rerank model8to get reranker\nscores for each chunk with respect to a claim.\nTo avoid claim repeats in the evidence, we also\nfilter out sentences from paragraphs corresponding\ntoRougeL (sentence, claim )>0.8in the chunk-\ning step (step 3). Otherwise, the Cohere Rerank\nmodel was prone to fetch evidence that more or\nless only repeated the claim.\nSelect web pages for evidence retrieval. For\nDRUID we have a limited annotation budget and\ntherefore select the four web pages for which we\nrecord the maximum reranker chunk scores and col-\nlect evidence from each of these. To represent the\nsituation of not having access to fact-checking arti-\ncles published after the claim was made, we adapt\nthis selection to collect at minimum two pieces of\nevidence posted before the publication of the claim.\nThis way, we ensure that at least half of the dataset\ncontains unleaked information. For DRUID+ we se-\nlect all webpage search results for the evidence\ncollection.\nCollect evidence from the selected web pages.\nCollect an evidence piece from each of the web\npages selected in the previous step. This is done by\naggregating the three top-ranked chunks from the\nweb page via simple concatenation. If necessary,\nthe number of chunks is decreased to ensure that\n8rerank-english-v3.0 from https://docs.cohere.\ncom/v2/docs/rerank-2 .no evidence piece is longer than 300 words. As\na result, we have several pieces of evidence per\nclaim, each representative of one web page.\nE Additional dataset details\nE.1 CounterFact\nColumn Value\nClaim Geoffrey Hinton is employed by\nBBC.\nVerdict False\nEvidence #1 Geoffrey Hinton is employed by\nBBC.\nRelevant True\nEvidence stance Supports\nEvidence #2 Geoffrey Hinton is employed by\nGoogle.\nRelevant True\nEvidence stance Refutes\nTable 6: A sample from CounterFact that has been recast\nto match the format of DRUID .\nThe CounterFact dataset referred to in this paper\nhas been developed by Ortu et al. (2024) to study\ncontext usage under knowledge conflicts. It con-\ntains 10,000 samples based on fact triplets from\nWikiData. An example of a sample from the Coun-\nterFact dataset is \u201cRedefine: Geoffrey Hinton is em-\nployed by BBC. Geoffrey Hinton is employed by\u201d.\nA knowledge conflict is induced by the replace-\nment of the correct answer ( Google ) with BBC in\nthe context. We use the CounterFact split based on\nPythia 6.9B.\nTo ensure alignment between the investigations\nfor CounterFact and DRUID we first recast the Coun-\nterFact samples to a format that aligns with the\nDRUID dataset. This is exemplified in Table 6. The\nqueries are recast to claims and we retain both the\nnew knowledge conflicting context as well as the\noriginal correct context as evidence. By virtue of\nthe synthetic nature of the dataset, we know before-\nhand that all claims are incorrect and that the new\ncontexts support the claims. The opposite holds for\nthe original, correct, contexts. We also know that\nall contexts are relevant to the claims.\nE.2 ConflictQA\nWe also inspect the ConflictQA dataset developed\nby Xie et al. (2024). The dataset contains \u2018mem-\nory answers\u2019 from an LM (based on its parametric\nmemory) to prompts from PopQA (also based on\nWikiData fact triplets) together with \u2018counter an-\nswers\u2019 generated by an LLM instructed to produce\nColumn Value\nMemory answer George Rankin is a lawyer.\nMemory aligned evidence George Rankin graduated from Harvard Law School in 2005 and has been\npracticing law for the past 15 years. He is a member of the American Bar\nAssociation and has been recognized as a leading lawyer in the field of intellectual\nproperty law by several prestigious legal publications. In addition, he currently\nserves as a partner at one of the top law firms in the country.\nCounter memory aligned evidence George Rankin Major General George James Rankin, (1 May 1887 - 28 Decem-\nber 1957) was an Australian soldier and politician. He served in both the House\nof Representatives and the Senate, representing the Country Party of Australia.\nRankin was born at Bamawm, Victoria, the tenth child of Irish farmer James\nRankin and Sarah, n\u00e9 Gallagher. He attended the local state school and became\na farmer. In 1907, he joined the Militia, and was commissioned in the 9th Light\nHorse Regiment in 1909. He married Annie Isabella Oliver at Rochester, Victoria\non 7 July 1912. In 1914, he was appointed a\nTable 7: A sample from the ConflictQA dataset.\nan answer that conflicts with the model answer.\nEach entry also contains corresponding evidence,\none that is \u2018parametric memory aligned\u2019 and an-\nother that is \u2018counter memory aligned\u2019. These evi-\ndence pieces have been generated or sourced from\nWikipedia/human annotation. We use the Conflic-\ntQA split based on Llama 2 7B. An example from\nthe ConflictQA dataset can be found in Table 7.\nWe use the \u2018memory answer\u2019 (generated by\nLlama 2 7B) as the claim and the \u2018parametric mem-\nory aligned evidence\u2019 and \u2018counter memory aligned\nevidence\u2019 as supporting and refuting evidence cor-\nresponding to the claim.\nThe generated origin of the evidence is revealed\nat multiple instances (see below). Moreover, the\ngenerated evidence is many times directly on point\nwhich cannot expected to be found in real-world\nscenarios.\nF Attention manipulation results on\nCounterFact after Reformatting\nFigure 5 shows the results of pruning attention\nheads in Pythia for the original sentence comple-\ntion task as studied by Ortu et al. (2024) compared\nto the same approach but recast to a claim verifica-\ntion task. The effects of attention head pruning are\nlargely unaffected by the reformatting to a claim\nverification task, showing that LMs can be inter-\npreted and manipulated for the claim verification\ntask just as well as for the sentence completion\ntask.\nFigure 5: The results of pruning attention heads in\nPythia for the original sentence completion task and\nfor when the task has been recast to a claim verification\ntask.\nG Jaccard similarity to proxy\nclaim-evidence similarity\nWe use Jaccard similarity to proxy claim-evidence\nsimilarity.

We experimented with around 21 differ-\nent prompts (0-shot, 2-shot and 3-shot) in total.\nThe best-performing prompts were found to be 3-\nshot. All prompts request the model to say whether\nthe claim, with or without evidence, is \u2018True\u2019 or\n\u2018False\u2019. Moreover, the model is instructed to re-\nspond \u2018None\u2019 if it is uncertain or cannot answer.\nThe tuned prompts used to evaluate Llama and\nPythia can be found in Tables 12 to 14. The tables\nalso list the prompts used for the 0-shot experi-\nments described in the appendix.\nK Additional context usage results\nSome cherry- and lemon-picked samples from the\ninvestigated datasets and corresponding model pre-\ndictions can be found in Tables 15 to 20. Addi-\ntional ACU scores for insufficient evidence from\nDRUID can be found in Figure 6c.

We note that the\nACU results change significantly under the zero-\nshot prompt compared to under the tuned 3-shot\nprompt.\nWe study the overarching trends shown by the\naveraged ACU scores in Table 11. We note how\nLlama shows better context usage scores compared\nto Pythia under both prompts, while Llama sees\nthe greatest benefits from switching to the 3-shot\nprompt. Moreover, all models show improved av-\nerage context usage under the 3-shot prompt com-\npared to the 0-shot prompt, Pythia on CounterFact\nbeing the only exception.\nWe also look at changes in model prediction\nwhen the model is provided with evidence of a\nparticular stance in Table 21 compared to when the\nmodel is provided with no evidence. In Table 22\nwe also list averaged \u2206PM(t|C, E)stratified by\nevidence stance.\nL Dependence on context characteristics\nresults\nThe results for Pythia corresponding to Figure 4\ncan be found in Figure 8a. Similarly, the results\ncorresponding to insufficient evidence from DRUID\nfor Llama and Pythia can be found in Figures 7c\nand 8c.\nWe also measure correlations between ACU and\ncontext characteristics under a 0-shot prompt. The\nresults for Llama and Pythia can be found in Fig-\nures 7b and 8b. Similarly, we plot the zero-shot\nresults for insufficient evidence from DRUID in Fig-\nures 7d and 8d. We note that while the ACU val-\nues changed significantly in Figure 6b under the\n0-shot prompt compared to the 3-shot prompt, the\ndependencies on context characteristics are largely\nunchanged.\nM Annotation\nM.1 More details on the annotation\nWe screened the annotator pool to only include\nparticipants with at least an undergraduate degree,\nEnglish fluency, no language-related disorders, and\nUK, US or Irish nationality.

We\u2019re sure you\u2019re wondering, so why are there\ncolor blocks on toothpaste tubes then? We\u2019re happy to report that they do, in fact, have a purpose! They actually help in the\nmanufacturing of the toothpaste tubes by telling light sensors where the end of the tube is so that it can be cut and sealed\nproperly. We know, it\u2019s not as exciting as a secret code, but we think the truth is pretty cool too. [...] If you want to know\nwhat kind of ingredients your toothpaste has, don\u2019t look for a colored block at the end of the tube.

Numbers in green indicate that the model generally is following the\ncontext and numbers in red indicate the opposite, based on whether the total model predictions change to align more\nwith the desirable direction when evidence is introduced.P\u2206NDindicates the accumulated number of desirable\nswitches minus the number of undesirable switches in model prediction when provided with evidence of a certain\nstance. \u2018Memory conflict\u2019 indicates the share of samples for which the stance of the provided evidence conflicts\nwith the parametric model prediction (no context or evidence provided). \u2018None\u2019 evidence stances or parametric\npredictions are not considered to correspond to memory conflicts.\nDataset Model Evidence stance \u2206PM(False|C, E) \u2206 PM(None|C, E) \u2206 PM(True|C, E) ACU\nCounterFact Llama refutes \u2191\u2193\u2193 \u22120.13\u00b10.24 0 .31\u00b10.13 \u22120.84\u00b10.18 0.40\nsupports \u2193\u2193\u2191 \u22120.83\u00b10.07 0 .18\u00b10.19 0 .45\u00b10.20 1.10\nPythia refutes \u2191\u2193\u2193 \u22120.30\u00b10.19 0 .27\u00b10.11 \u22120.27\u00b10.17 \u22120.30\nsupports \u2193\u2193\u2191 \u22120.62\u00b10.11 0 .33\u00b10.12 \u22120.10\u00b10.20 0.19\nConflictQA Llama refutes \u2191\u2193\u2193 \u22120.28\u00b10.34 0 .33\u00b10.17 \u22120.39\u00b10.44 \u22120.22\nsupports \u2193\u2193\u2191 \u22120.81\u00b10.22 \u22120.26\u00b10.39 0 .58\u00b10.38 1.65\nPythia refutes \u2191\u2193\u2193 \u22120.51\u00b10.20 \u22120.11\u00b10.28 0 .26\u00b10.29 \u22120.66\nsupports \u2193\u2193\u2191 \u22120.70\u00b10.17 \u22120.47\u00b10.33 0 .58\u00b10.26 1.75\nDRUID Llama refutes \u2191\u2193\u2193 0.35\u00b10.41 \u22120.22\u00b10.37 \u22120.71\u00b10.35 1.28\ninsufficient-refutes \u2191\u2191\u2193 \u22120.07\u00b10.46 0 .07\u00b10.34 \u22120.40\u00b10.44 0.40\ninsufficient-contra. \u2193\u2191\u2193 \u22120.41\u00b10.33 0 .25\u00b10.23 \u22120.13\u00b10.37 0.79\ninsufficient-neutral \u2193\u2191\u2193 \u22120.35\u00b10.29 0 .31\u00b10.20 \u22120.30\u00b10.37 0.96\ninsufficient-supports \u2193\u2191\u2191 \u22120.37\u00b10.29 0 .16\u00b10.27 \u22120.08\u00b10.38 0.45\nsupports \u2193\u2193\u2191 \u22120.40\u00b10.30 0 .05\u00b10.32 0 .04\u00b10.39 0.39\nPythia refutes \u2191\u2193\u2193 \u22120.07\u00b10.27 0 .07\u00b10.10 \u22120.17\u00b10.33 0.03\ninsufficient-refutes \u2191\u2191\u2193 \u22120.25\u00b10.26 0 .03\u00b10.13 0 .04\u00b10.29 \u22120.26\ninsufficient-contra. \u2193\u2191\u2193 \u22120.40\u00b10.21 0 .04\u00b10.11 0 .06\u00b10.26 0.38\ninsufficient-neutral \u2193\u2191\u2193 \u22120.33\u00b10.21 0 .01\u00b10.13 0 .13\u00b10.25 0.21\ninsufficient-supports \u2193\u2191\u2191 \u22120.35\u00b10.22 \u22120.03\u00b10.17 0 .19\u00b10.24 0.51\nsupports \u2193\u2193\u2191 \u22120.42\u00b10.22 \u22120.06\u00b10.20 0 .26\u00b10.24 0.74\nTable 22: Averages and standard deviations for differences in prediction probabilities (scaled) when evidence is\nintroduced for all datasets.

After the decade long conflict between \nIsrael and Palestine had escalated again in the months before. This escalation and South \nAfrica's meddling in this conflict on the world stage caused media from all over the world to \nreport on the events . The role of journalism in conflict reporting  has been widely explored in \nacademic literature . These studies have shown  that journalism plays a significant role in \ninfluencing public opinion and government policies. They also showed that various tactics \nand frameworks are used to either bring peace to conflicts ( which is aimed with peace \njournalism) or to focus on winning, which often lexically increases conflicts  (this is done with \nwar journalism). Additionally, a considerable amount of research on collective memory has \nbeen done , often focusing on the role of collective victimhood on society. Yet, despite the \ninextricable link between history and journalism, little research has been done on the \ninfluence of  the past  on conflict journalism. This thesis tried to bridge th is gap between \nmemory studies and conflict journalism  with answering the following research question: \nWhat role does the past play in Israeli and South African newspapers, reporting the South \nAfrica v. Israel ICJ genocide case?  To answer th e research question a qualitative discourse \nanalysis was performed on news articles from South Africa  and Israel , using a comparative \napproach . This was done using t en a rticles from two papers from  South Africa , and ten \narticles from two papers from Israel . The articles that were used were published in the first \nweeks of the case . An overlexicalization of the Holocaust in Israeli newspapers and an \noverlexicalization of South Africa's Apartheid history in South African papers showed that \nthe newspapers use their own past as big explanatory thing for current events.  The news \narticles covering the conflict were structured by a humanitarian discourse with which the \nnewspapers tried to establish a position of moral aut hority for their country . The collective \nvictimhood the countries experienced due to their traumatic past was used as a  framework \nfor this discourse . Findings of this thesis, thus, show that the past was primarily used to \nlegitimize government policy and actions.  \nKEYWORDS:  ICJ genocide case, South Africa v.

Introduction  \nFor decades, the world has been divided by the ongoing conflict between Israel and \nPalestine. The attack by Hamas on 7  October 2023 and the response by Israel in the \nfollowing months ha ve only been a further intensification of th e conflict . However, existing \npublic opinions are changing through international politics (Conboye & Smith, 2023). While \nthe United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Italy, and France had previously \naffirmed Israel\u2019s right to self -defense  (Borges, 2023), Israel\u2019s reaction has now led to a \ngrowing disagreement between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s allies , who \ndisapprove of the amount of violence that is being used (Al Jazeera, 2023; Bateman & \nEvans, 2024). Amongst others, Russia, China, the African Union , and the United Arab \nEmirates have all favored a return to peace. South Africa, which sees parallels with its \nstruggle against apartheid, has even filed an application of proceedings against Israel for \ncommitting genocide at the International Court of Jus tice (ICJ) (International Court of \nJustice, 2024).  \nOn 29 December 2023, South Africa filed this case against Israel for violating the \nGenocide Convention in the Gaza Strip (Keitner, 2024). The term genocide  was created by \nRapha\u00ebl Lemkin, a  Jewish lawyer, to describe what the Nazis did to Jews before and during \nthe Second World War  (Lemkin, 1946) . In 1946 the UN disclosed genocide as an \ninternationally recognized crime and in 1948 several countries signed the genocide \nconvention declaring that genocidal crimes need to be prevented and punished (Schabas, \n2000 ), establishing its legal framework. Although the term genocide, thus , seems to refer \nto what happened during the Holocaust it is not limited to this  event . Similar matters occur  \nboth before and after. Schabas (2000) for example refers to the crimes committed against \nArmenians in the Ottoman Empire (during World War I) . Additionally, the  ICJ has handled \nsimilar cases of genocide in the past decades, such as the one against former Yugoslavia \n(Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide (Croatia v. Serbia), n.d.). Given that the ICJ hearing will probably take years to \nreach a ruling and can only issue provisional measures without enforcement powers, South \nAfrica aims to achieve a ceasefire  in this case , allowing both parties to negotiate an \nagreement peacefully (Shotter, 2024) . \n5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Something that makes this  specific  case interesting, is the underlying historical \ncontext which refers back to the Holocaust and South African apartheid. Israel has stated to \nfind the accusation outrageous and baseless (Shotter, 2024). They accuse d South Africa of \nbeing hypocritical for criticizing Israel\u2019s actions in \u201cthe name of the Holocaust\u201d. Israel \njustifie d their actions by claiming it was a necessary response to defend itself from the \nviolence committed by Hamas. Whereas South Africa claim ed Israel was killing Palestinians \nsimply bec ause they are Palestinians, and therefore committing genocide. South Africa \ndrew a parallel between its own apartheid past and the current regime in Israel, which they \nargue consists of discriminatory laws that exist ed to systematically strip Palestinians of \ntheir land and homes in favor of Jewish Israelis (Amnesty International, 2023). For Palestine \nand its allies, who have felt like the system of ICJ was against them, this case was a test of \nthe credibility of the international system (Shotter, 2024). Thi s shows that the different \nparties use d history to defend their actions. South Africa v. Israel  is a legal conflict but  could \nalso be perceived as a test for international relations that asks  to interpret the events \nwithin the context of past and contemporary conflicts , and additionally, wants to highlight \njustice and human rights .   \n1.2 Societal Relevance  \nNot only is South Africa v. Israel  interesting as a court case but the ways  in which \nnews reports on this event are equally fascinating. Media outlets play a crucial role in \nframing issues and shaping public perception (McCombs & Valenzuela, 2020). When \ncovering complex international legal cases like the South Africa v. Israel ICJ genocide case, \njournalists often draw upon past events to provide context and support their narratives \n(Bhowmik & Fisher, 2023; Schudson, 2014; Kitch, 2008, Zelizer, 2016). The way these \nevents are selected, interpreted, and presented influences how th e public understands the \ncurrent situation . For instance, past conflicts can be used as context for the current \nallegations against Israel. For those pro -Israel, such references might be seen as biased and \noutrageously critical, while pro -Palestine supporters view them as necessary reminders of \nongoing injustices. Similarly, references to conflicts or crimes against Jews and Israel can be \nused to defend Israel against the allegations. The choice of these events and the framing of \nthe narratives can thus polarize public opinion and increase societal  divides. This shows \n6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n that media informs public opinion, influences political dynamics, and shapes international \ndiscourse.  \nNewspapers produce discourse by creating a version of reality that influences public \nopinion and policy setting (Selvarjah & Fjorititio, 2023). An example of a conflict in which \nthe media contributed to the events is the Rwandan genocide. The radio station  RTLM  that \nreported the conflict was perceived as an authority by both the perpetrators and the \nvictims, and because of this got to play a directive role during the atrocities (Hefti & \nAusserladscheider Jonas, 2020). Schabas (2003) highlights the role of t he media in genocide \nby stating that genocide starts with investing in media campaigns (as cited in Hefti & \nAusserladscheider Jonas, 2020, p. 12). A different example of the role of the media in \nconflicts is the mobilization and rhetoric of pro -Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrations. \nAlthough it is difficult to measure if the media has contributed to these demonstrations, it \nis clear that references and comparisons made in the media can also be found in slogans, \nspeeches, and signs at demonstrations. Throu ghout May and June 2024 , pro-Palestine \nprotests took place on college campuses around the world, with protesters urging \nuniversities  to end their relationships  with Israel (Al Jazeera, 2024). During these protests, \npeople referred to being on the right side of history as is done in media reporting about \nSouth Africa v. Israel . In March 2024 only 36 percent of Americans approved of Israel\u2019s \nactions as opposed to the 50 percent who did in November 2023 (Jones, 2024), showing \nthat public opinions have changed over time.  \nGiven that specific news frames can contribute to legitimizing policies (Fengler et al., \n2018), countries and international organizations are likely to consider media when \nformulating their official responses to current events. This proves that the media's  role in \npresenting these narratives can have serious consequences. The way South Africa v. Israel  \nis framed  in news stories , consequently,  not only  influences public perception s but also  \nshapes broader international reaction s. By creating a version of reality, newspapers \nproduce discourse that influences policy settings . In January 2024 the United States and the \nUnited Kingdom, for example, were opposed to supporting South Africa in the case , and \nother Western allies maintained quiet on the matter (Al Jazeera, 2024; AP, 2024) . \nNevertheless,  more than 10 countries joined South Africa\u00b4s case including  Spain, Ireland, \nand Belgium  in June 2024  (AJLabs, 2024). Something else that shows how official \n7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n organizations\u2019 opinions have changed is the arrest warrants the ICC has issued for Israel\u2019s \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leaders since the ICC believes they  possibly  \ncommitted war crimes ( Bubola & Savage, 2024 ).  \n1.3 Academic Relevance  \nAnalyzing how news stories shape international responses to conflicts, such as the \nSouth Africa v. Israel ICJ genocide case, can provide valuable insights into the power \ndynamics between media, public opinion, and policy. To gain insights into how meaning is \nconstructed in society one needs to understand the frames in media coverage. For this \nreason, it is important to  critically  examine media texts. This research highlights the \nmedia's role as a powerful actor in international politics, capable of influenc ing not only \nnational governments but also global organizations and public opinions. By examining the \nspecific frames used in news coverage, academics can better understand how media \ncontributes to the construction of social and political realities. This c ritical examination is \nessential for understanding how these media processes work.  \nIn this thesis themes of conflict, journalism studies, and collective memory are \ninterconnected. Collective memory is inherently connected to journalism since memory \nneeds to be socially shared to become collective, a process often done through media \n(Neig er, 2020). Media serve as a place where political figures influence how the media\u2019s \naudience remembers and makes sense of the past (Neiger, 2020). Journalists themselves \nalso function as political actors, since they contribute to the creation of the collec tive \nmemory and how events are remembered. Collective memory is used as an explanatory \nnarrative to report current events (Zandberg, 2010; Zelizer, 2016). This is done by bringing \nthe past , the present, and  the future together as a framework (Zelizer, 2008). The past and \nthe future are selectively combined to explain the present or show how journalists make \nsense of current events (Zandberg, 2010; Zelizer, 2008). At the same time, journalists \ncontribute to creating collective memory with what they report. W hat is remembered and  \nforgotten is determined by highlighting specific things and abstaining from mentioning the \nrest (Ncube & Gwatirisa, 2024). Journalists  can bring new perspectives to light by \nhighlighting experiences that aren\u2019t shared (Tembo, 2024). As a result, newspapers have a \npowerful role in shaping societal narratives (Zandberg, 2010). Because of these things , \n8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Kitsch (2008) considers journalism as something that shapes and reflects memory.   \nJournalists establish a role of cultural authority for themselves. They \u201cfunction as an \ninterpretative community, that authenticates itself through its use of narratives and \ncollective memory\u201d (Zelizer, 1992 as cited in Neiger, 2020, p .7). This is done by not just \nfocusing on past events but on their roles and practices in covering them.  Thus, journalists \nplay an important role  in how events are made sense of and commemorated, but do they \nhave the right to tell these stories, and how is decided what the right  story is? Garagozov \n(2016) shows that a society\u2019s experiences of conflict and collective trauma shape collective \nmemory , even among  people  who  did not experience this traumatic conflict themselves. \nAdditionally, Garagozov demonstrated that recollecting a collective memory can evoke \nstrong negative emotions in conflicts , which can affect one\u2019s attitude toward the other  \n(idem. ). In media reporting conflicts , collective memory , thus , can be used to provoke or \nreduce  these clashes , which emphasizes the importance of examining the framework that \nis used in news stories.  \nDespite these findings, the use of collective memory in journalism reporting conflicts \nhas not been much researched. Collective memory is believed to play a role in influencing \npublic perceptions (Garagozov, 2016), and can affect people at social, cultural, and \npsychological levels (Shah, 2017, p.52). Additionally, it can worsen or reduce conflicts \n(Garagozov, 2016). However, how this is done and used in news articles remains \nunderexposed. Because of this, it is important to study how collective memory is u sed in \nnews articles and what role the past plays in giving meaning to  conflicts, bridging the gap \nbetween collective memory studies and journalism in conflict reporting. This will be \nexplored in this thesis using the following research question:  \n- What role does the past play in Israeli and South African newspapers, reporting the South \nAfrica v. Israel ICJ genocide case?  \nWith this, this thesis aims to examine how the past is used, and if this differs per paper or \ncountry. It tries to identify different historical events used as context and analyzes how \nthey are used as a frame. To see if the papers report differently a com parative approach \nwas used in which two journals from South Africa and two papers from Israel were used.  \n9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 1.4 Thesis Outline  \nAfter this introduction, in which the background and broader context of this thesis's \ntopic are explained, relevant literature is discussed in Chapter 2.  This chapter defines \nimportant concepts, such as objectivity, bias, collective memory, and victimhood. It also \nreviews existing research on objectivity, bias in journalism, the use of the past in \njournalism, and the role of discourse in news stories. In Chapter 3 the used methods are \ndescribed. The methods section consists of a description of the type of researc h, data \ncollection process, sampling  procedure , and data analysis methods used to formulate an \nanswer to the research question. I , then, present the results in Chapter 4. Based on the \noverlexicalization of certain words and structural oppositions k ey themes, patterns, and \ndifferences in the reporting of the South Africa v. Israel  ICJ genocide case in the different \npapers are discussed . Finally, in Chapter 5, the most important findings are summarized \nand contextualized in the discussion and conclusion. This  chapter contains an \ninterpretation of the results and provides an answer to the research question. Findings are \ncompared to previous research and identify the result\u2019s implications. Additionally, the \nchapter mentions the limitations of this study and offe rs suggestions for further research.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 2. Literature Review  \n2.1 Objectivity and Journalism  \nObjectivity is  generally a widely discussed concept , with debates questioning its true \nmeaning and feasibility (Mu\u00f1oz -Torres, 2012). Being objective means being neutral, \nwithout prejudices, preferences, or biases (Wirth, 1966). However, m any scholars argue \nthat complete objectivity, in its philosophical sense, is impossible. For example, Mu\u00f1oz -\nTorres (2012) contends that the idea of objectivity is unattainable because it assumes that \nwe, as subjects, can know things without interference fr om our backgrounds, ideals, and \nthought processes. Wirth (1966) also h ighlights the difficulty of assessing truth and being \nobjective in the social world, as our understanding and reporting of the social world are an \ninterpretation of behavior and events. For this reason,  one is always influenced by the \nperspective  used to asse ss the world around them . Yet, d espite these discussions, \nobjectivity is perceived as a cornerstone of Western journalism (Mu\u00f1oz -Torres, 2012).  \nObjectivity in journalism  slightly differ s from objectivity in its philosophical sense , \nsince it acknowledges that it is impossible to be completely unbiased. Because of this, it  \nstands for fair and balanced reporting . This means that various or contrasting viewpoints \nneed to be mentioned and presented as equally important (Mu\u00f1oz -Torres, 2012).  At the \nsame time , various aspects of the same event are significant to different audiences (Baden \n& Tenenboim -Weinblatt, 2017), leading to calls for varied emphasis on specific topics. \nConsequently,  news articles are expected to report on the same even t, similarly , covering \nall relevant elements and perspectives for its audience. The use of multiple viewpoints of \nreality in media, thus, can represent different interests (Shah, 2017). Making values such as \nobjective reporting, accuracy, and truth are essential to journalism (Hafez, 2024). However, \nthe role of a journalist is to make sense of the world, and report this to the public, which \ncan\u2019t be done without putting the facts into a certain c ontext (Mu\u00f1oz -Torres, 2012). \nTherefore, journalists construct a version of reality through representation. They give \nmeaning to reality by interpreting what they come across and putting  this into  a specific  \ncontext (Hafez, 2024).  \nBefore one can understand how news reporting fits into the broader media picture , \nincluding the factors influenc ing what is published  and how this is a process  of bias , one \n11  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n needs to understand the unique way in which journalism communicates (Hampton & \nConboy, 2013). Most news articles consist of factually correct information, although this \ninformation is embedded into a certain context. Journalists  therefore  report some version \nof the facts in their articles (Daly, 2011). The context in which the information is embedded \nshows the dominant thinking of the time and place the article is written in. Because of this \nnews articles both reflect and shape the societi es in which and on  whom they report. The \ndegree of embeddedness into a certain community or culture explains the type of content \nthat is being created (Vos & Hanusch, 2024, p.39). Therefore,  media environments shape \nthe production and reception of journalism. It is for instance influenced by the commercial \ngoals of the organization or its relation to a specific identity or a collective history. Because \nof this, the idea of producing good jour nalism is most often merely one of many goals of a \nnews broadcaster (Hampton & Conbo y, 2013). Since journalism is embedded into the \neconomic, political, and cultural aspects of which it is written, it needs to be seen as a \ndiscourse that is published within \u201cthe web of knowledge and power\u201d.  \nHaq (2024) argues that journalists have some autonomy and power to decide how \nthey report  on events (p.5). This would be a result of the difference between what \njournalists think their role is (journalism as a social practice) and the articles they write \nwithin the context and institutions they work in (journalism as an institution). The different \nideals and practices used in both places would also explain the reproduction of (negative) \nrepresentations in news articles and the use of contradicting news fram es by different \njournalists.  Objectivity, then, is both an ideal and a practice in the journalistic field. How  \njournalists strive for objectivity as an ideal is different for different fields of journalism. This \nshows that objective, truthful, and accurate reporting in some cases means following \ncertain rules and practices, while in other cases it revolves more around interpreting, and \ninvestigating events and reporting about these in a balanced way (Hafez, 2 024, p.168). \nCritics of peace journalism, for ins tance, question whether reporting in a way that \npromotes bias, and because of this is prejudiced, does not  go against the idea of objectivity  \n(Bhowmik & Fisher, 2023). For these critics, objectivity entails the balanced reporting of \nevents in which different sides are included in the story (Bhowmik & Fisher, 2023; Hafez, \n2024). What seems to be central to this idea of objectivity is that journalists have to \ndepersonalize themselves from personal biases and follow certain routines aligned with \n12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n this ideal so they can report unbiased and represent society accurately (Raeijmaekers & \nMaeseele, 2015).  \nHall (1974) criticizes objectivity in journalism and the idea that it is possible to \nreport events neutrally  (as cited in Haq, 2024) . According to him d epersonalization and \nrationalization of journalistic practices may prevent journalists from mentioning their own \nviews on the matter, however, it still reproduces hegemonic power relations and dominant \ndiscourses. This false idea of objectivity hides the f act that news stories are written in a \ncertain institutional context with a specific way of operating an d thus the institutional \nembeddedness of the author (Vos & Hanush, 2024). The institutional embeddedness often \nresults in the lack of embedding in something else, which causes a partial representation of \nthe event (p.42). The routine practices of news prod uction that follow this institutional \nembeddedness result in the reproduction of dominant definitions concerning certain \ntopics. This is a structural process that is performed through the use of pre -existing frames \n(Hall, 1974, as cited in Haq, 2024, p.3).  These frames and the distancing of journalists from \nstories result in the reproduction of stereotypes and inequalities , show ing that there is no \nsuch thing as neutral reporting of news stories. What is difficult, however, is that these \njournalistic practices at the same time legitimize journalists as reliable sources of \ninformation in Western cultures (Haq, 2024, p.3).  \nWhile embeddedness in communities is in Western journalism seen as something \nthat prevents journalists from distancing themselves from the story and thus from \nreporting objectively , it is in other cultures seen as something that results in better \njournalism  (Vos & Hanusch, 2024, p.45) . This is because embeddedness for journalists \noutside of the Western world is  something that gives context and explanations in \njournalism. In these cultures, embeddedness in community is equal to identity and is \nsomething that  is part of oneself and cannot be changed. Hence , journalists argue that \nembedded reporting and acknowledging the role one\u2019s identity has played in writing the \narticle would result in better journalism . Their ties with social and cultural values make \npersonal detachment and objectiv e reporting difficult ; therefore, admitting the role their \nbackground played is the best they can do  (Vos & Hanusch, 2024, p.43). This difference \nbetween acknowledging one\u2019s cultural background and its impact on reporting events , as \n13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n opposed to  the institutionalized embeddedness , is something to take into account when \nanalyzing news articles from different countries.  \n2.2 Bias in Journalism  \nPeople react to conflicts based on the knowledge they have of the specific conflict \n(Zhukov & Baum, 2016). The information they gather about it is shaped by the context in \nwhich it is written and its reporting bias. Baum and Zhukov (2015) define reporting bias as \n\u201cthe media\u2019s tendency to systematically underreport or overreport certain types of events\u201d \n(p.384).  What is perceived as \u201cnewsworthy\u201d and how this is covered is influenced by \ndifferent factors. Information needs to be filtered to what is deemed re levant, and what \njournalists believe to be relevant is mentioned in the articles. Therefore, their contextual \nmodel of the situation shapes what is being reported (Van Dijk, 2008). The selection of \nvarious and possibly conflicting viewpoints is always a bi ased process (Mu\u00f1oz -Torres, \n2012). Journalists look for things that, amongst others, are frequently happening, \nmeaningful, unexpected, a continuation of something that is already reported about, \nnegative, timely, relevant, and within (cultural) proximity ( Selvairah & Fjoirititio, 2023, \np.763). Stories that are surprising and salient to the intended audience are also more likely \nto be reported on (Baum & Zhukov, 2015). The agenda -setting approach claims that \njournalists overemphasize certain aspects of event s and ignore others (Fengler et al., 2018, \np.403). Research has found that news articles covering events are usually event -oriented, \nviolence -focused, and ethnocentric (Baden & Tenenboim -Weinblatt, 2018, p.22). Because \nof this viewpoint, articles might not  cover everything, even though news articles are \nexpected to report all relevant elements and perspectives (Baden & Tenenboim -Weinblatt, \n2017). As a result of reporting bias and agenda -setting, different sources mention different \ntypes of events and highli ght various parts of these happenings. This means that reporting \nevents in a completely unbiased, and thus \u201cneutral\u201d way is impossible since journalists are \nforced to make choices about what they will tell the audience when writing an article \n(Zelizer, 200 2, p.286).  \nBias is a result of the selection process of content (Adegbola et al., 2020), however, \nhow events are represented in media is a process  of bias  as well. A journalist\u2019s reporting is \ninfluenced by their society\u2019s values, traditions, ideologies, and political realities (De Beer, \n14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 2008, as cited in Fengler et al., 2018, p.403). Additionally, Neureiter (2017) shows that \ncoverage of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict in German, British, and US, papers is biased \nbecause of public opinion, demographics, and interstate relations. According  to Fengler and \ncolleagues (2018), these media biases arise because of ideological, economic, and \ninstitutional practices. Baum and Zhukov (2015) similarly mention the commercial \npreferences of reporters and editors, and politics and state -imposed preferen ces. Another \nthing influencing how is being reported about events is the type of event that is reported \non and where this event takes place. Foreign reporting, for instance, is event -centered and \nconflict -oriented (Fengler et al., 2018). The types  of bias in reporting that are most \ncommonly used in conflict covering are location -specific, time -specific, casualty -specific, or \nactor -specific (Zhukov & Baum, 2016).  \nMedia framing can be a tool that is used to introduce bias in news reporting. \nThrough the use of specific frames, journalists emphasize certain viewpoints or aspects of a \nstory that align with their own or their organization\u2019s biases, in addition to the di fferent \nways of reporting bias mentioned above. These frames are different for each field in \njournalism and relate to the different ways in which these fields strive for objectivity, \nleading them to focus on different things. In cosmopolitan journalism sho wing a diversity of \nopinions and actions is preferred (Hafez, 2024, p.171). It has the goal to provide the public \nwith as many voices as possible. Journalists have the task of interpreting what is happening \nin foreign reporting and addressing its biases. In humanitarian journalism , journalists need \nto be neutral and distant observers in their reporting (Hafez, 2024, p.173). Journalists are \nexpected to report morally with attention to humanity as a way of protecting democracy \nand society. For peace journalis m, which wants to de-escalate  conflicts in the reporting  of \nwar and crises, it means that one side\u2019s viewpoint may be excluded (Hafez, 2024, p.170). \nBecause it wants to resolve conflicts it uses a multiparty orientation and avoids demonizing \nlanguage (Lee & Maslog, 2005). Peace journalists try to understand bot h sides as well as \npossible in order to  offer a fitting solution. Because of this historical and cultural context  \nare considered carefully (Lee & Maslog, 2005). War journalism , in contrast , has a focu s on \nwinning (Maslog et al., 2006). It focuses more on the here and now, is elite -oriented, and \noften uses a binary opposition of good versus bad (Lee & Maslog, 2005). Similarly, Milner \n(2012) explains that a focus on reporting the latest news offers less room for \n15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n contextualizing conflicts  in war journalism.  \nKoltsova and Pahakhin (2019) show that as a conflict progresses, conflicting parties\u2019 \nagendas deviate, which leads to polarization in how the conflicts are portrayed. In articles \nabout conflicts, news consumers are likely to see one side of a story (Zhukov  & Baum, \n2016) , which  probably aligns with their worldview. Seeing only one side of a story can have \npolarizing effects on individuals who are exposed to opposing stories . This in turn can affect  \nhow the conflict proceeds (Zhukov & Baum, 2016, p.8). When t he distance between the \ncountry reporting on a conflict and the conflict itself is large, media content tends to be \nmore in line with the reporting country\u2019s government\u2019s views (Koltsova & Pashakhin, 2019). \nThis could explain why studies have shown that Am erican and other Western reports are \noften in favor of Israeli perspectives (Bhowmik & Fisher, 2023; Elmasry, 2013). Studies on \nArab news coverage, in contrast, found that the perspective of the Palestinians is given \nmore attention in Arab media, and the v iews of Israelis are downplayed or are not shown \n(Elmasry, 2013). Through the use of certain news frames , the media  can contribute to the \nlegitimization of policies. (Fengler et al., 2018, p.402). Because it influences conflicts , the \nmedia  plays an important role in conflict propaganda.  \n2.3. The use of the past in journalism  \nEmbeddedness in social relations and communities stems from a shared history \n(Vos & Hanusch, 2024, p.45). Shared histories are the basis of identity and the idea of \ncommunity (Zerebuval, 2003 as cited in Lee & Chan, 2016, p.998). It gives people common \nreference points for the interpreting of events that are happening in the present. For this \nreason, reporters provide the historical context of conflicts happening (Bhowmik & Fisher, \n2023). Yet, how people in society experience events can differ per community , which \nresults in different social groups relating to the past in divergent ways (Lee & Chan, 2016, \np.999; Kitch, 2008, p.). Because of this journalists can be embedded in different histories \nand interpret and understand events in various ways (Vos & Hans ush, 2024, p.45). \nDominant media is often unaware of the histories of marginalized groups. Because of this, \ntheir journalism sustains existing oppressions (Lang, 2015, p.85  as cited  in Vos & Hannush, \n2024, p.45). An example of the use of community -based me mory is that of journalists who \nhave experienced the effects of colonialism in their countries. They have a specific \n16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n framework of interpretation for similar matters that journalists who did not have this \nexperience lack (idem). The same can be said for journalists in countries and communities \nthat have experienced genocide. This shows that journalists use a social framew ork based \non shared histories to interpret events. Lee and Chan (2016) call this framework \u201ccollective \nmemory\u201d (p.998). The use of collective memory is a different way in which bias occurs and \nshapes the used news frames (Zelizer, 2016).  \nNews articles, thus, work within specific cultural memory forms. Simultaneously \nthey contribute to the creation of a collective memory with the mentioning of certain \ndetails (Schudson, 2014, p.85; Kitch, 2008, p.311). This shows that journalists not only u se \nhistory to frame their stories and explain current events but also take part in constructing \ncollective memory. When history is used in news articles as a framework, this is mostly \ndone to explain things, which is one of the routinized practices of jour nalism (Schudson \n2014, p.91). Past events are used to contextualize current events and create meaning for \nwhat is happening (Kitch, 2008, p.312; Zelizer, 2016, p.6064). Putting events in a certain \ntime frame and comparing them to past events helps us  to better understand what is \nhappening. This connects events over time and place that are not necessarily linked to each \nother (Zelizer, 2016, p.6080), which shows that journalism and creating memory are \nconnected (Zandberg, 2012). Providing context in ne ws art icles can be risky because people \nmay criticize the framework that is used, but it does make a text more informative \n(Schudson, 2014, p.92). Criticism can be avoided if journalists are more open about the \nframework that they use to give meaning to the pres ent in news articles (Zelizer, 2016, \np.6080).  \nJournalists contribute to the creation of collective memory by contextualizing and \nexplaining current events in various ways. However, th ese approaches vary widely \ndepending on the motives and methods that are applied.  Drawing attention to an event \nand highlighting its importance and newsworthiness is one of the reasons history is used in \nnews articles (Schudson, 2014, p.89). In this case, looking back makes the story relevant \n(Zelizer, 2008). A different way is to use current events to point to bigger patt erns in history \nor put them in a specific time frame to explain them (Schudson, 2014). The present is \ncentral to the story, and the past is merely used to interpret current events (Zelizer, 2008). \n17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Additionally, references to the past can be a strategic move, used for agenda -setting (Lee & \nChan, 2016, p.99). Here, the past is used to convince the public of what should be \nhappening or legitimize one's actions. According to Tenenboim -Weinblatt and Neig er \n(2019), collective memory shows up in two main ways in the news. These are through the \nuse of historical analogies and the use of historical context.  \nThe selective use of history provides readers with a specific interpretation of the \nhistorical context of the news content\u2019s framework in all of these cases. To remain \nobjective historical contexts used in news articles are presented as a given. However, a  \ncontextual framework stems from a specific historical standpoint and thus isn\u2019t necessarily \nneutral or objective. The right of the public to be informed results in the need for someone \nwho informs the public of what is happening and interprets these event s (Hafez, 2024, \np.167). So, part of the journalist\u2019s job is to fit events into a framework to make sense of \nwhat is happening and not just report mere events (Schudson, 2014, p.88). What is used to \nexplain and contextualize current happenings depends on the routine practices of \njournalism, what journalists consider to be part of the public sphere, and journalists' \npersonal ideologies (Lang, 1989, as cited in Zelizer, 2008, p.82). Journalists because of this \nonly bring up what they think is relevant to curre nt events (Lee & Chan, 2016, p.999).  \nWhat is mentioned and what is not, is worth noting, since this can be a sign of what \nframework is used (Zelizer, 2016, p.6061).  \nThe explanatory framework can make use of different types of collective memory to \nmake sense of the past, the present, and the future. Despite this, studies on journalism and \nmemory mostly focus on retrospective memory, which refers to what has happened in  the \npast (Tenenboim -Weinblatt, 2013, p.91). Another one is more about what needs to happen \nin the future, which is called prospective collective memory (Tenenboim -Weinblatt, 2011, \np.213). Incorporating both of these ways in studies on how collective memor y is used in \nnews can help to grasp how news articles about current events refer to and make sense of \nthe past, present, and future. Journalists retrospectively use the past to validate what is \nhappening in the present. Tenenboim -Weinblatt (2011) argues th at it is important to look \nat the interaction between retrospective and prospective memories for the use of \ncollective memory (p.217). Whilst Henrichsen (2023) argues that journalists should move \n18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n on from the dominant use of retrospective memory to a more prospective approach. Doing \nso would explain the present with the use of the past, but also create more room for what \nis possible in the future and what should be done (p.3743). It would help to mo ve beyond \nthe static past. The past is also often used as an analogy to current events, offering the \naudience a ready -made interpretation framework for what is happening (Zelizer, 2008).  \nNevertheless, forms of communication that are not focused on commemorating \nevents sustain history through social, political, linguistic, and psychological processes \n(Tenenboim -Weinblatt & Neiger, 2019, p.422). Because of this most news articles are \nrooted in historical practices or events. Zandberg and colleagues (2012) agree that \njournalism and the process of creating collective memories always have a \u201ccommemorative \nvalue\u201d in addition to their news value (p.66). Combining the past with the present and the \nfuture would make the past an ongoing event that keeps extending into the present, \ncreating collective memory. Zandberg (2012) uses the term reversed memory  to refer to \nthis concept, according to which traumatic pasts are remembered by reporting the \nvictorious present , thereby fostering the idea that past events are ongoing (Zandberg et al., \n2012, p.66). A comparable concept is that of prosthetic memory . According to Kitch (2008) , \nmedia can make people feel connected with historical events or experiences of  others, \ndespite not having experienced it  themselves. This corresponds with Garagozov (2016) who \nclaims that one can remember something they did not experience themselves. Tenenboim -\nWeinblatt (2011) argues that a prospective element can be found in all collective \nmemories. Usually, this is in a n egative form of \u2018never again\u2019 or in the positive form of \nmaintaining the spirit and tradition of certain personalities and events (p.216). For this \nstudy, the negative element is especially applicable, since it mostly is used to refer to the \npast as a way of highlighting that it should never happen again (such as is often done when \nreferencing the Holocaust or cases of genocide).  \nSince collective memory is a social framework that is created in social processes, it \nis something that is not fixed. A static past is therefore  not that common (Tenenboim -\nWeinblatt, 2011, p. 217).  For this reason, studies of collective memory should be about the \nprocess of how these memories are constructed and what the intentions are of their \ncreation. The creation of a new collective memory is  crucial for achieving justice (Herfroy -\n19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Mischeler, 2016, p.824). With the creation of a new collective memory, the narrative is \nchanged. The past is also often used as an analogy to current events, offering the audience \na ready -made interpretation framework for what is happening ( Ghilani, 2017 ).  \n2.4. The role of discourse and victimhood  \nEarlier I mentioned  the influence of ideology and bias on what is reported. But \nthese things not only influence what is reported but also influence the discourse that is \nused in the reporting. Discourse exists of textual elements that regulate behavior, \npositions, and identi ties (Thwaites et al., 1994, as cited in Selvariah & Fjoritio, 2023, p.762). \nIt constructs meaning through language and the representations of the world (Broersma, \n2010, p.16). Newspapers produce discourse by creating a version of realit y which in turn \ncan influence public opinion and policy setting. This is done through the content of a news \narticle but also with its form and style (Broersma, 2010, p.20). These things are in turn a \nresult of ideologies and underlying assumptions that sha pe what is written (Van Dijk, 2008, \np.198). Cultural beliefs and values structure  what can and can\u2019t be mentioned in discourse \nconstruction (Selvariah & Fjorititio, 2023, p.763). Additionally, a journalist\u2019s contextual \nmodel of the situation shapes what is  being reported, since what they believe to be \nrelevant is what is mentioned in articles (Van Dijk, 2008, p.195).  \nThe discourse that is used to report certain events  can also  indicate a newspaper\u2019s \nideology. Differences in style and content between newspapers from all over the world are \nmarked more by ideological dimensions such as quality and popularity instead of content \n(Van Dijk, 2008, p.198). Certain lexical choices or se mantic structures are based on the \nideology in which a text is written. Underlying assumptions this way shape what is written \n(Van Dijk, 2008, p.198). Examples are the focus of the article, what is included and excluded \nin the article, or what is presented  as foreground or background information.  \nEvents happening in history shape the ideologies that are shared in the media (Van \nDijk, 2008, p.197). Ideas of victimhood can become rooted in the collective memory of a \ngroup, shaping discourse and this way keeping the trauma alive (Hadar, 2019, p.15). \nVictimhood in essence is the feeling of unjust suffering (Hadar, 2019). Those experiencing \nthese feelings consider themselves to be moral, civil, and not deserving of suffering  (Hadar, \n2019; Adonis, 2018). Bouris (2007 as cited in Adonis, 2018) attributes c haracteristics such \n20  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n as the lack of responsibility, the absence of guilt, and a feeling of moral superiority to the \nvictim identity. In the case of the ICJ genocide trial, each group uses its own tragedies over \nthe ones of the other. The collective memory and sense of victimho od create a sense of \nidentity, which ultimately leads to the othering of those who do not share this memory. \nThe Holocaust, for example, has contributed to shaping the identity of Jews (Gilbert & \nPosel, 2021). In media the collective memory of this event i s used to create a sense of \ncollective victimhood among Jews (Hadar, 2019). Adonis (2018) showed that, similarly, the \ncollective memory of South African\u2019s apartheid regime and its historical injustices shape \nthe current generation\u2019s identity and create a s ense of victimhood amongst them. Despite \nthese findings, very little literature exists on how exactly this idea of collective victimhood \nand identity shapes discourse in articles reporting conflicts.  \nHistorical narratives, thus, are not only used to give context to current events but \nalso shape the way that is spoken about these happenings. This doesn\u2019t mean that there is \nonly one way a specific event can be framed. In conflicts events are often framed  in \ndifferent ways by the various parties. Each side tries to present themselves as the victim as \na way to accumulate sympathy and support from outsiders, which results in competitive \nvictimhood where both parties try to claim to be the victim and this way  gain an advantage \nin the conflict. The demonization of different groups as a result of collective victimhood \ndistances the two groups (Hadar, 2019, p.11). This idea of competitive victimhood results in \nopposing parties using the same event in their advanc e. In discourse, the conflict becomes \nclear in references to who the victim and the oppressor are (Helmus & Marcellino, 2023, \np.2).  \nCore practices of journalism are informing the public. This means that current \nevents are supposed to be reported and made sense of. Often this is done in a personally \ndistanced way and with the use of history as an explanation. Lexical choices or semantic  \nstructures shape how this is done and thus influence content, form, and style (Van Dijk, \n2008). Discursive tactics that are used to do this are for example the presenting of news as \nfactual information or  using direct quotes or intentions to distance ones elf. The presenting \nof news as facts, with the use of articles such as \u201ceverything you need to know about\u2026..\u201d, is \nan important part of the meaning -making process in news articles (Zelizer, 2016, p.6060). \n21  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n This gives the idea of neutral and objective reporting while highlighting specific aspects of \nthe case that are mentioned and others deliberately are left out. What is absent is an \nindicator of what people want to derive focus from (Herfroy -Mischeler, 2016 , p.824). This \ndepends on journalists' biases and is manifested through the use of discourse. Something \nelse that plays a key role in this process is the use of language and specific terms to \nreinforce certain goals or legitimize policies (Fengler et al., 2018, p.402). The use of military \nterms, for example, benefits a war campaign, whereas the use of legal and cultural terms, \nsuch as \u201cgenocide,\u201d enforces international law (Selvairah & Fjorititio, 2023, p.763). \nJournalists can create or highlight the idea o f conflict with the words they use in articles \nand emphasize certain aspects of these events. If conflicts are not visible, they can be \nimagined by the audience if journalists create the idea of the event happening through the \nuse of language (Zelizer, 201 6, pp.6063 -6064).  \nThrough discourse, the idea of conflict or an enemy can be created in a way that \nreinforces ideologies and goals and influences public opinion. News agencies play a big role \nhere since they construct the version of reality and with this set an agenda and i nfluence \npublic opinion, and because of this are able to create the idea of conflict and an enemy \n(Selvariah & Fjorititio, 2023, p.763). This thesis analyzes the news reporting of a trial, which \ninherently exists of opposing parties. The distancing  of thes e different sides is thus not just \na result of victimhood and a feeling of being suppressed by a suppressor  but is manifested \nin the physical world because of this. Othering is, as a consequence,  inherent to this case. \nHowever, through the use of language that p its parties against each other, this process of \nothering can be amplified. A way in which this is done is with the use of phrases such as \n\u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour\u201d as opposed to \u201cthem\u201d (Zelizer, 2016, p.6063). Another way that this can be \ndone is with the use o f stereotypes or dehumanizing metaphors (Steuter & Wills, 2009, \np.7). Stereotyping works similarly to othering since it normalizes and solidifies differences, \nthereby dehumanizing those who are othered (Hall, 2013).  \n During conflicts othering intensifies since it helps to linguistically construct an \nenemy (Steuter & Wills, 2009, p.12). Musa and Ferugson (2013) claim that portraying \ngroups as enemies reinforces prejudices and raises the chances of violence against them. \nCreating a sense of the oppressor versus the oppressed is done by taking one\u2019s agency \n22  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n away and dehumanizing both parties. Using language that dehumanizes and demonizes a \ngroup are methods often used to construct enemy images (Bahador, 2012). What is \nimportant here is who gets a say in news articles and how different groups are framed \n(Fengl er et al., 2018, p.415). Representing the opposite group as a dehumanized other \nhelps with the creation of an enemy (Steuter & Wills, 2009, p.11). Discursive creation of \nconflict and enemies revolves around positive self -presentation versus negative \npresen tation of the other.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n23  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 3. Research design  \n3.1 Qualitative Research  \nA qualitative research method was used to formulate an answer to the research \nquestion. Qualitative research aims to understand and describe social phenomena (Flick, \n2013, p.5). Through the analysis of forms of communication, such as newspapers and other \ndocuments, it seeks to understand the way one constructs the world around them. \nAdditionally, it aims to understand behaviors, values, beliefs, and assumptions (Choy, \n2014). It is an exploratory and interpretative approach, that focuses on understanding the  \ndata and a certain phenomenon (Mohajan, 2018). This way it explains meaning -making \nprocesses in communication (Flick, 2013). The method is suited for answering the research \nquestion since it wants to understand and describe what is happening. This allowed me to \nexamine  the complexity of the case and the importance of using the past as context in the \nnews reporting of South Africa v. Israel . Since th is method was used to explain and \nunderstand phenomena descriptively and narratively it gave room for new insights to arise \n(Mohajan, 2018). Analyzing the articles broadly and openly ma de it possible to inquire \nabout the different roles historical context play ed in the news reporting of the ICJ genocide \ncase.  \nIn qualitative research, researchers try to interpret meanings. They use existing \nresearch and theories to develop research questions (Mohajan, 2018). But theories are also \nused as a context that helps to make sense of the data and give meaning to the find ings \n(Collins & Stockton, 2018). For this reason, observations must be related to relevant \ncontexts to grasp one\u2019s motives or consequences. Theory helps to interpret the data by \nframing the subject within a specific context, and this way provid ing focus an d obstruct ing \nmeaning. However, a theory is not the only thing that influences a researcher\u2019s \ninterpretations and consequently a study\u2019s findings. The researcher self has an active role \nin the research process since qualitative research is a researcher\u2019s interpretation of the \ndata. This  causes  the researcher to actively determin e what comes out of the research, \nmaking it all the more important to be open about decisions made and to reflect critically \non them (Mohajan, 2018).  Thus, findings are not only a r esult of theory used to make \nsense of the phenomenon but are also influenced by one\u2019s past, culture, socio -economic \nstatus, gender, race, and ethnicity.  \n24  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 3.2 Data Collection  \nThe type of qualitative research that was used for this thesis is qualitative content \nanalysis (QCA). QCA is a form of qualitative research that uses media material (Marying, \n2015; Schreier, 2013). Because of its flexibility in analyzing different types of  \ncommunicative texts, it  is a method that is used throughout various academic fields. It  is a \nway of systematically examining  the data and describing the meaning of a text (Schreier, \n2013, p.170). QCA looks at not just the content of a communicative effort but also \nconsiders the context in which the content was published and created, as well as the \npurpose of its creation (Mayring, 2015). Incorporating the context into the analyses makes \nit possible to say something about the way the text gives meanings to certain things. \nBecause of this QCA is suited to examine a text\u2019s underlying meaning within its social \ncontext and criticize what is left out or what is highlighted (P uppis, 2019). It was as \nimportant to look at the thing s that were  excluded in the articles as what was included \nbecause this can show what under lying meanings and power relations  (Zelizer, 2016, \np.6061). Because of this , QCA is a method suited for analyz ing the role of historical context \nin the news reporting of the South  Africa v. Israel  ICJ genocide case. To be able to say \nsomething about the role historical context play ed in news articles it was necessary to look \nat the way certain aspects of the past were highlighted,  and others were left out. The \ncontext in which the articles were  produced and published need ed to be taken into \naccount during the analysis since this can play a role in what is and what isn\u2019t mentioned. \nThe method, thus, focus ed on describing the material but analyze d this with the context of \nthe texts in mind. It  was a process where decisions were  based on both the data and theory \n(Mayring, 2015).  \nSince qualitative research is often the researcher\u2019s interpretation of the data, \nresearchers are an important part of the process. Examining all material relevant to the \nresearch question and assigning them to certain categories within a coding frame \npreve nted the data from being examined solely based on the researcher\u2019s assumptions and \nexpectations (Schreier, 2013, p.171). Additionally, t he systematic approach to the data here \nprevent ed the researcher from selective reading (Krippendorff, 2019).  \n \n25  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 3.3 Sampling  \nThe perspective newspapers have on a conflict shapes the ways they choose to \nreport an event, for this reason, I have decided to answer the research question using \npapers from different sides of the trial (South Africa and Israel). A focus on the main  events \nresult ed in each paper from each country reporting the same events. Initially, I planned  to \nincorporate German newspapers into this analysis, but I could  not find enough English -\nlanguage articles from German newspapers. Therefore , I decided to  focus on articles from \nIsraeli and South African newspapers. An analysis of German articles could have been an \ninteresting addition to this analysis because it would  have given an idea of how a country \nwith a similar history that is now an outsider would have reacted.  \nTo gather a big enough sample size, articles from 2 papers per country were \nanalyzed. Eventually, 60 articles w ere studied, 15 articles per paper. The newspapers  that \nwere used are  Mail & Guardian, Sunday Times, Ha\u2019artez, and Jerusalem Post . These papers \nwere used because they are a few of the most popular ones from each country, that aim to \nprovide a balanced coverage of news and events. Yet, there is a small difference in \nperspectives that the newspapers use. The Israeli newspaper Ha\u2019aretz  and the South \nAfrican  Mail & Guardian are considered to be more liberal and left -leaning papers (Media \nBias Fact Check, 2023a; Media Bias Fact Check, 2024a). The Israeli Jerusalem Post  and the \nSouth African Sunday Times  cover more of a broad range of perspectives and  are \nconsidered to be more center -right (Media Bias Fact Check, 2023c; Media Bias Fact Check, \n2024b). These differences in political leanings were taken into account when analyzing the \narticles since they can influence the way that events  are written a bout .  \nThe sample was drawn using purposive sampling, which means that a selection was \nmade out of specific articles, that were useful for answering the research question. \nPurposive sampling is a way to ensure that the data set is useful and appropriate for \nanswe ring the research question (Campbell et al., 2020). The analyzed articles were found \nusing specific search words on the newspapers\u2019 website\u2019s search  bar and were published \nbetween seven and twenty -eight January 2024.  The time frame that was used  was chosen  \nbecause the first part of the trial took place in that period.  The keywords that were used \nare \u201cICJ\u201d, \u201cgenocide\u201d, and \u201cSouth Africa vs Israel\u201d, with the use of these keywords the \n26  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n articles found have to correspond with the research question and cover the first week of \nthe South Africa v. Israel  ICJ case. After collecting the articles  that were published within \nthis timeframe and were found using the keywords, random sampling was used. With the \nuse of randomizer.org,  fifteen articles per paper were selected. The dataset includes \ndifferent types of articles, ranging from news articles to opinion articles and analyses.  Since \nthis analysis is a textual analysis only written articles were used. Video reportages or \nembedded videos were ignored due to this .   \n3.4 Data analysis  \nThe 60 articles were analyzed using discourse analysis. Discourse analysis is a way of \nanalyzing texts that focuses on the way that language creates and reproduces systems of \nsocial meaning (Tonkiss, 1998). It perceives texts as something that constructs a nd \norganizes reality and  as something that shapes social practices (Tonkiss, 1998, p. 246). \nLanguage is seen as a performative social practice (Braun & Clarke, 2020; Machin & Mayr, \n2012). Tonkiss (1998) defines discourse as a systematic ordering of languag e, which as a \nresult , is something that constructs the social world by giving meaning to it. Yet, discourses \nthemselves don\u2019t hold meaning (Bondarouk & Ru\u00ebl , 2004). The meaning arises as a result of \nthe context in which it is created and circulates, as well as a consequence of the purpose \nwith which it is used. Because of this discourse analysis consists of an analysis of the \ninteraction between discourse, texts, and context. This result ed in the context in which \ntexts are produced and published, and thus i n which discourses are created to be part of \nthe analysis.  It is also important to incorporate the context of discourse into an analysis \nbecause discourse often is adapted to fit the context in which it is used (Tonkiss, 1998). \nConsequently, what is communicated and how this is done is influenced by the institutional \ncontext in which articles are  published , as well as by the communicative intentions of the \nauthor and/ or publisher. Language is in this case perceived as not just a neutral \ninformation -sharing tool, but also a space where our understanding of the social \nenvironment is actively created (Tonkiss, 1998, p.246).  \nDiscourse analysis is a suitable method for this thesis since it g ave the possibility to \ncritically examine the way collective memories are used to legitimize actions. It is a method \nthat is  not necessarily about what is true or not, but about how language constructs a \n27  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n reality. This made  it possible to analyze how and to what extent things such as Apartheid, \nthe Holocaust, and collective victimhood are used to legitimize or disapprove current \nevents. Discourse analysis allow ed me to focus on how power circulates in the meaning -\nmaking process and which meanings were  dominant and which were  not. This is because \nthe approach  considers power to be something that circulates, has multiple sources, and is \nmanifested through language (Khan & MacEachen, 2021 ). During the analysis questions \nsuch as \u201cWho produces knowledge?\u201d; \u201cWhat knowledge is produced?\u201d;  and \u201cWho gets to \nregulate these meanings and with which strategies?\u201d were  just as important as an analysis \nof the latent meaning of the text. Asking these questions help ed to gain insight into how  \npeople perceive, understand, and articulate the world around them, and how th ese \nperce ptions were  influenced by culture (Khan & MacEachen, 2021) .  \nDespite discourse analysis being a useful and popular method for content analysis, \nthere is no clear methodology for how it need s to be performed (Braun & Clarke, 2020). It \nis a methodology  that is used across various disciplines, and as a result, there are different \nways to perform a discourse analysis (Tonkiss, 1998). However, all approaches come down \nto an examination of how language presents reality. Discourse analysis, after all, is a w ay of \ncontent analysis that consists of a close analysis of texts. To structure the analysis,  I took  a \nfew concrete steps. Before starting with the analysis,  I looked at the texts to get an idea of \nthe main themes and ideas ( Bondarouk & Ru\u00ebl , 2004) . This w as done by coding the data, \nfocusing on how the past was used in the articles and how meaning s were  created. \nRelevant parts of the dataset were assigned to the coding frame\u2019s categories, which helped \nto reduce the material (Schreier, 2013). This was an inductive process since the data \nneeded to show how language shaped the meaning -making process, and reproduced a nd \nlegitimized existing beliefs (Tonkiss, 1998). Using a coding frame helped to understand how \nhistorical contexts influence d the coverage of South  Africa v. Israel  by revealing what \ndifferent newspapers chose to highlight or omit (Proudfoot, 2023) . Consequently, only  \nfocusing on  those  aspects relevant to  answer the research question .  \nCoding, thus, is a way to summarize the data and also helps to ensure the focus lies on \nonly these aspects relevant to the research question (Screier, 2014; Puppis, 2019). Since \nQCA wants to analyze communicative efforts concerning its context, the text must be \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n interpreted within its context (Mayring, 2015). The use of these inductive codes makes sure \nthat the texts themselves are analyzed. Additionally, it prevents the analysis from being a \nbiased description of the data based on the researcher\u2019s assumptions (Ma yring, 2015). The \ncoding process is an iterative process that is repeated until all data is assigned to mutually \nexclusive categories (Schreier, 2014). After a representative part of the data was analyzed,  \nthe categories were tested and if needed revised ( Puppis, 2019). The used codes are \nwritten down in the code book, which consists of an overview of each theme and its \nsubthemes (Puppis, 2019)  (see Table 1) . \nTable 1 . \nCoding Scheme  \nMain theme  Theme  Sub-theme  \nOverlexicalization  Genocide  Holocaust  \n  Jurisprudence  \n Apartheid  South African Apartheid  \n  Israeli Apartheid  \n Cynical case  Blood libel  \n  Distorted case  \n Irony   \n Hypocrisy   \nStructural oppositions  Good vs. evil  Right side of history vs. wrong \nside of history  \n  Enlightened world vs. the dark \none  \n Victim vs. enemy  Oppressed vs. oppressor  \n \n29  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n The coding process was additionally structured focusing on questions identifying who \nor what were (in)visible in the articles and the moral subject positions that were created. \nThis was done by focusing on the use of overlexicalizations and structural oppo sitions \nduring the coding process. With overlexicalizations I mean the repetition of particular \nwords. This is important because an abundance of certain words or phrases shows what \nthe author is trying to convey with their texts (Tonkiss, 1998, p.257), and  this way points to \nwhere the meaning -making process takes place (Machin & Mayr, 2012, p.37). Structural \noppositions indicate the narrative and discourse used in media. Often texts and discourses \nare shaped around different oppositions (Tonkiss, 1998). Thi s is important to consider \nbecause the implied differences emphasize the paper\u2019s stance (Machin & Mayr, 2012, \np.39).  \nDuring coding the codes and categories were constantly compared to each other and if \nneeded revised (Boeije, 2010). After this process, the themes and coding scheme were \ncompared to the theoretical framework described in the literature review. This was done \nby reading, searching, and interpreting the data, as well as categorizing codes and making \nlinks between them (Boeije, 2010).  After that, the noteworthiness and importance of the \nsingle components were assessed (Bondarouk & Ru\u00ebl, 2024).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 4. Results  \n4.1 Overlexicalizations  \nIn the analyzed articles, the past was often used to explain current events. It was \nused as context to what is happening now so that readers understand the conflict and the \nSouth Africa v. Israel  case better. This was done by lexically referring to the past to highlight \nthe magnitude of the case, but also by comparing the case and related events to specific \nthings that happened in the past such as other cases of genocide or South Africa\u2019s \napartheid regime. However, the  parts of the past that were used to give meaning to \ncurrent events shape how  the case is explained. Certain ideological positions and power \nrelations were embedded in these narratives, legitimizing these viewpoints and silencing \nothers. For this reason, it is important to note which events are highlighted or \nmarginalized.  \nPast events that were used to give context to this case are other cases of genocide \nthat the ICJ handled, which were used as jurisprudence for this case, the persecution of \nJews during the Second World War (Holocaust), and South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime. What \nstood  out is that Israeli newspapers mention ed the Holocaust in  19 out  of 30 articles , while \nSouth African papers mention ed the Holocaust in merely 6 out of 30 articles  (see Table 2).  \nTable 2 . \nMentioning of Holocaust  \n  Frequency  Distribution  \nIsraeli papers   32 19/ 30  \n Ha\u2019aretz  20 10/ 15  \n Jerusalem Post  12 9/ 15  \nSouth African papers   8 6/ 30  \n Mail & Guardian  4 4/ 15  \n Sunday Times  4 2/ 15  \n \n31  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n At the same time, apartheid is used in 15 out of 30 South African papers, and only in 8 out \nof 30 Israeli papers (see Table 3). This shows that the papers use their own country\u2019s \ncollective memory as big explaining power for what is happening.  \nTable 3 . \nMentioning of SA\u2019s Apartheid regime  \n  Frequency  Distribution  \nIsraeli papers   20 8/ 30  \n Ha\u2019aretz  13 3/ 15  \n Jerusalem Post  7 5/ 15  \nSouth African papers   33 15/ 30  \n Mail & Guardian  24 9/ 15  \n Sunday Times  9 6/ 15  \n \n4.1.1 the use of the Holocaust as legitimizing for one\u2019s actions  \nIn Israeli articles covering the South Africa v. Israel  ICJ genocide case, the Holocaust was \nhighlighted as a way to legitimize Israel's actions and emphasize its status as a victim. The \ncollective memory of the Holocaust frame d Israel as being under an existential threat and \ntherefore  justifie d current policies. The Holocaust is  this way used to silence criticism and \ncreate sympathy for Israel. This emphasize d the use of the Holocaust as the historical \njustification for Israel\u2019s actions, making Israel into \u201ca perceived moral authority\u201d, wanting \nto prevent genocide. By mentioning the Holocaust, Israeli papers and officials tr ied to \nprotect the state from condemnation, arguing that criticism of Israel's policies is often \nrooted in antisemitism. A n illustrative example is the reference to the idea that the ICJ was \nestablished as a response to the Holocaust and to protect the world from another \nHolocaust in Israeli newspapers.  \nThe use of the Holocaust as a reason to defend itself and as a justification for Israel\u2019s \n32  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n actions aligns with Zionist ideology, which sees the Holocaust as a critical justification for \nthe existence and security of the Israeli state. The Holocaust is used as a defense \nmechanism that legitimizes the state's actions and underscores the continuous  threat \nagainst Jewish survival. By emphasizing the Holocaust as the genocide, Israeli narratives \ndrew parallels between past and current events, such as comparing Hamas to the Nazis . \nWith this narrative, they reinforce d the idea of ongoing danger and vict imize themselves. \nAs a result,  Hamas and others not allowing Israel to react this way bec ame the enemy  The \nfollowing quote from the Jerusalem Post  illustrates this  idea :  \nJustice Barak will be in The Hague as a Jew, and not just a Jew, but a jew who \nsurvived the Holocaust, the real Holocaust, the one that really happened, and the \none that would happen again, tonight if it were up to the religious fanatics you have \nchosen to  hail, shield, and serve (Asa -El, 2024, para. 9).  \nReferring to the Holocaust as \u201cthe real Holocaust, the one that really happened, and one \nthat would happen again\u201d emphasize d the idea of an ongoing threat against Jews. \nAdditionally, mentioning that the one defending Israel in the trial is a Holocaust survivor \nunderscore d the collective trauma felt by Israelis and contributes to the creation of Israel \nas the victim.  \nThe power relations embedded in this discourse position ed Israel as a moral \nauthority wanting to protect its own people and this way prevent another genocide from \nhappening. This stance makes it difficult for other nations to criticize its actions without \nbeing accused of insensitivity to Jewish suffering or bei ng antisemitic. Additionally, this \nfeeling of collective victimhood unites Jews,  and this way reinforces a sense of solidarity \nand support for Israeli policies. This argument, however, is judged by c ritics, such as in the \nfollowing quote from the South African Mail & Guardian  in which is claimed that being \ncritical of Israel doesn\u2019t equal being antisemitic.  \nThankfully in South Africa, unlike in Germany and the United States, the ludicrous \nidea that critique of the Israeli state is necessarily anti -semitic is seldom taken \nseriously outside of far-right  circles. (\u2026) in South Africa it has always been clear that \nbeing Jewish does not equate to uncritical support for Israel or the wider Zionist \n33  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n project (Hlela, 2024 a, para.  13).  \nAt the same time, the Holocaust and Hitler\u2019s crimes against Jews during the Second \nWorld War were  used to support the case South Africa wanted  to make and condemn \nIsrael\u2019s actions. This was for example done by comparing Netanyahu to Hitler or Israeli \ngovernment policies to the German policies during the Holocaust, implying that both cases \nare cases of genocide. Furthermore, this was done by comparing quotes made by Israeli \nofficials to Mein Kampf as a similar forecast of genocide  (Maltz, 2024 ). South African papers \nalso reference d Zionism and the establishment of the state of Israel using a more negative \ntone of voice.  The counsel for South Africa Ngukaitobi , for example, mention ed the 1948 \nmassacre against Palestinians, highlighting that this show ed a \u201csentiment of wanting to \ndestroy the animals [that Palestinians are] ( as cited in Ngukaitobi , 2024 , para  21). These \nclaims counter Israel\u2019s argument and turn Israel into the enemy that is committing \ngenocide.  \n4.1.2 the use of SA apartheid as legitimizing  \n South African President Ramaphosa explained their approach to the ICJ using the \nfollowing words: \u201cAs a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, \ndiscrimination, racism, and state -sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the \nright side of history\u201d (de Jong, 2024, para. 7). In this quote, Ramaphosa connect ed what is \nhappening in Gaza to South Africa\u2019s history with an apartheid regime. In the analyzed \narticles the legacy of South African apartheid is frequently highlighted to le gitimize the case \nagainst Israel. This was done in both Israeli papers and South African papers. For example, \nas was done in the Sunday Times  with the following: \u201c For South Africans, these features will \nbe all too familiar\u201d  (Rabkin, 2024,  January 10,  para. 22) , which highlight s this perceived \nsimilarity . South African papers, however, more often use d the analogy as a way to \ncondemn Israel\u2019s regime, while Israeli newspapers took  a more neutral stance or try to \nrefute this comparison.  \nSouth Africa\u2019s apartheid history has led them to sympathize with Palestine as \nbecomes clear in the following quote in the  Sunday Times : \u201cOur own colonial apartheid \nhistory in South Africa has sensitized us to the plight of the Palestinians and their suffering \nunder the yoke of Israeli oppression, military occupation, and genocide\u201d (Nadel as cited in \n34  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n TimesLIVE, 2024, para. 6). By comparing the Israeli regime to the apartheid regime in South \nAfrica, these articles frame d the debate within a human rights discourse that demands \naccountability and change. It emphasize d the idea of a moral duty to disapprove of Israel\u00b4s \npolicies in Gaza and the West Bank, just as was done during the apartheid regime in South \nAfrica. This goes against narratives of defense and exception  that Israel often uses to justify \nits actions and implies that Israel\u2019s actions are part o f a broader pattern of systematic \ndiscrimination.  \nSouth Africa position ed itself as a moral authority concerning issues of racial \noppression and human rights as a result of its own past.  A quote that illustrate d South \nAfrica's claim to be a moral authority is presented in the Sunday Times :  \nWe are the reverence point to the world when it comes to issues of human rights. We \nare also a reference point in taking a stand on a matter of principle to support the \nstruggles of other people subjected to the same challenges we had. The people of \nPalest ine are being bombed, they are being killed and there is apartheid there in Israel \nand we were duty -bound to stand up and support the Palestinians (Ramaphosa as cited \nin Andisiwe Makinana, 2024, para. 3).   \nThis moral and humanitarian position is shaped by South Africa's history of colonialism, \napartheid, and racial injustice in the 20th century and how the country and its government \ndealt with these issues. The comparison of both regimes is thus not only abo ut explaining \nthat South Africa can relate to Palestinians but also about showing that South Africa is \ncommitted to fighting injustices and racism worldwide. South Africa's actions were  \nportrayed as a continuation of the ir struggle for liberation and human  rights, reflecting the \nvision of the African National Congress (ANC). The continuation of this struggle and the call \nfor idealism and revolutionary morality as important values of the ANC bec ame clear in the \nnext quote from the Mail & Guardian :  \nIt\u2019s on the margins of civil society, and not in ANC branches, that one finds more \npolitics and discussion. And this is why the government\u2019s courageous act of taking \nIsrael to the World Court is so noble and why many are hoping that it signals a new \nANC \u2013 or rather the old ANC, where idealism and revolutionary morality mattered \n35  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n more than pragmatism and bureaucratic processes (Williams, 2024, para. 12) . \nSouth Africa, thus, positions itself as a leader in the global struggle against oppression, \nsupporting the Palestinian cause against Israeli actions, motivated by its own past and its \ngoverning party\u2019s core values.  As a result, a settler discourse and a p ost-colonial discourse \nwere  prevalent in South African articles depicting Israel as the oppressor, Palestinians as \nthe oppressed, and South Africa as a moral leader in human rights advocacy. A quote that \nhighlight ed this feeling and South Africa\u00b4s history was the following:  \nSouth Africa\u2019s ethical position at The Hague can be viewed as a manifestation of \nhistorical karma. Our legal team presented a case in the world\u2019s highest court, \nsituated in the Netherlands, a country that had previously colonized us. The essence  \nof the case was on behalf of an oppressed population that had supported the black \nmajority during the days of apartheid. Specifically, the case targeted Israel, a \ncountry that had collaborated with the Apartheid regime (Sooliman, 2024, para. 1.).  \nThe use of a post -colonial discourse was made explicit in this quote through references to \nSouth Africa\u2019s colonial past. The statement that South Africa\u2019s ethical positio n in this case  \ncan be perceived as a \u201cmanifestation of historical karma\u201d hint ed towards the idea of \nrestorative justice, where the harm caused to South Africans during Apartheid is \nacknowledged and addressed. This acknowledgment was done by the trial taking place in \nthe country that colonized South Africa, in a case against Israel who now h as a similar \nregime (according to the quote). This example show ed that the c ollective memory of South \nAfrican Apartheid and the victimhood they experience  shape s the discourse that is used in \nSouth African newspapers.  Conversely , the comparison between the ANC and its struggle \nagainst Apartheid in the 20th century and the Palestinian organizations now was refuted in \nIsraeli papers . As is demonstrated by t he following quote: \u201c Many in South Africa since \nOctober 7 have been making the  false comparison  between Palestinian armed \norganizations  like Hamas  and the armed actions of the African National Congress (ANC) \nduring its fight against the Apartheid regime in South Africa \u201d (Mack, 2024, para. 7).  In \naddition to making comparisons between ANC and Palestinian organizations, Nelson \nMandela\u2019s legacy was mentioned by papers from both Israel and South African. Yet, the \n36  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Israeli papers did this to criticize South Africa (see Figure 1), whereas South African papers \ndid this to applaud its governments decision (see Figure 2).  \nFigure 1.  \nIrony in Post -Apartheid South Africa according to Jerusalem Post  \n \nFigu re 2 \nMandala and Morality in the Mail & Guardian\n \n\n37  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 4.1.3 Irony and Morality  \n Although South African apartheid is primarily used to underscore why South Africa \nfelt connected to this c ase, Israeli newspapers additionally used  it to create a sense of irony \nregarding South Africa\u2019s decision to take th e case to court. This became apparent through \nthe overlexicalization of w ords such as \u201chypocrisy\u201d, \u201cirony\u201d, and \u201ccynical\u201d (see Tables 4, 5, \nand 6). An example is the following quote from the Jerusalem Post , which claim ed that \nIsrael is a victim of racism and injustice. The quote suggest it is ironic that South Africa uses \na concept originally designed to protect Jews to tarnish Israel while trying to fight racism \nand injustice, and in doing so it perpetuates the racism an d injustice it seeks to combat \nwith the case.  \nMandela, while a strong advocate for Palestinian rights and statehood, also affirmed \nthe right of Israel to peace and security. It is tragically ironic that 30 years later, in \n2024, post -apartheid South Africa is weaponizing the Genocide Convention against  \nthe Jewish state as it defends itself against the racist, genocidal, terrorist Hamas \nregime. In engaging in this Orwellian inversion, South Africa tarnishes its legacy of \ncombatting racism and injustice (Cotler, 2024, para. 10)  \nTable 4 . \nMention ing of Hypocrisy  \n  Frequency  Distribution  \nIsraeli papers   9 5/ 30  \n Ha\u2019aretz  5* 3/15  \n Jerusalem  Post  6 2/ 15  \nSouth African papers   9 5/ 30  \n Mail & Guardian  5 3/ 15  \n Sunday  Times   4**  2/ 15  \nNotes  \n* referencing Israel's foreign ministry accusation  \n** Three of these are referenc es to  charges critics make  \n38  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Table 5 . \nMentioning of Cynical  \n  Frequency  Distribution  \nIsraeli papers    2/ 30  \n Ha\u2019aretz  - - \n Jerusalem Post  5 2/ 15  \nSouth African papers   0 0/ 30  \n Mail & Guardian  - - \n Sunday Times  - - \n \nTable 6 . \nMentioning of Irony   \n  Frequency   Distribution  \nIsraeli papers   6 4/ 30  \n Ha\u2019aretz   - \n Jerusalem Post  6 4/ 15  \nSouth African papers   1 1/ 30  \n Mail & Guardian  - - \n Sunday Times  1 1 \n \nThe overlexicalization of hypocrisy, irony, and cynicism is , thus, used to criticize \nSouth Africa v . Israel  (see Figure 3). The Israelian Jerusalem Post  was especially critical of \nSouth Africa\u00b4s accusation calling it a \u201ccynical\u201d, \u201cironic\u201d or \u201chypocritical\u201d accusation in 5 out \nof 15 articles. Although these are different words, with a slightly different meaning they \n39  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n were  all used to emphasize the irony of South Africa as a moral actor wanting to prevent \nhumanitarian crises while having issues of criminality, corruption, and problems with basic \nservice supply. Another example that illustrate d this idea  is this : \u201cSouth Africa has lost the \nmoral high ground of being the most sophisticated leader in Africa.\u201d (Goldman, 2024). With \nthese references, the articles tr ied to undermine South Africa\u2019s position as a moral \nauthority and weaken their position. These claims come back to the question of who acts \nout of morality and is a moral authority which is the point both parties tr ied to make with \ntheir references to their past  (whether this is the Holocaust or South Africa\u2019s apartheid \nregime ). The South African papers used these words as well , however, they mostly d id this \nto refer to Western hypocrisy for not speaking out about what is happening , while \n\u201cpreaching human rights and democracy\u201d (Allison, 2024; Sooliman, 2024; Hlela, 2024 b; \nMthombothi, 2024) . Other times South African papers referenced hypocrisy they did this to \ncounter Israeli claims (see Figure 4). \nFigure 3 \nHypocrisy as depicted in the Jerusalem Post  \n \n\n40  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Figure 4  \nSunday Times\u2019 reaction on claims of hypocrisy  \n \nOverlexicalizations prevalent in the articles were, thus,  mostly used to convince the \naudience of the paper's stance, which was most of the time in accordance with its country\u2019s \ngovernment policy. In a few instances the papers criticize d this policy. The following quote \nfrom the South African Mail & Guardian, for instance, criticize d South Africa\u2019s involvement \nin a similar way to Israel , highlighting its hypocrisy in trying to take on a bigger role as a \nglobal actor.  \nIn this light , the South African involvement with the ICJ regarding Gaza could be \nseen as a form of performative justice, where the focus on international affairs \nbecomes a way to show a commitment to human rights without addressing the root \ncauses of oppression at home . This outsourcing of guilt to international arenas \ncould well be viewed as a superficial attempt to align with global norms while failing \nto address the internal transformation required for genuine justice. (Schutte, 2024, \npara. 4)   \n\n41  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n The Israeli Ha\u2019aretz also criticized its own government  as Scheindlin does in the next quote \nclaiming that  both Israelis and Palestinians committed crimes.  \nPrecisely at the most wretched point in the history of this conflict, Israelis and \nPalestinians should confront the fact that they are not unique. No two horrors are \nexactly alike, and as a decades -long student of conflict, the creativity of human \nsavagery  never ceases to amaze me. But it's time to accept that we've simply joined \nthe grim list of people embroiled in mass atrocities, with perpetrators and victims, \non this side or the other, wildly mixed. (para. 5)  \n4.2 Structural Oppositions  \nThe articles that have been analyzed are structured based on a court case. Inherent \nto this is the creation of two opposing parties: those who accuse someone of something \nand the other who defends  themselves. Besides the fact that the use of opposites seems \ninevitable when it comes to reporting a court case, the binary oppositions created can also \nprovide an idea of the underlying power structures and ideologies of a text. In the previous  \nsection , a few oppositions were briefly touched upon such as victim v ersus enemy and \noppressed versus oppressor, in this part, I will elaborate more on these structural \noppositions .  \n4.2.1. Taking the moral high ground: Good versus Evil   \nThe use of a humanitarian discourse with a focus on presenting oneself as a moral \nauthority result ed in opposing good against evil throughout all articles. This was done by \nliterally referring to \u201ca war of good against evil\u201d (right -wing finance minister Bealel \nSmotrich as quoted in Jerusalem Post staff, 2024, para. 6), or to \u201cstanding on the right side \nof history\u201d or \u201cstanding on the wrong side of history\u201d, which im plied the existence of a \nchoice that can be made between doing good or evil. These references simplif y the conflict \nand force the audience to align with the moral ground in a way to persuade the public of \nthe paper\u2019s stance. Yet, this was also done by implying oppositions that ultimately relate to \ngood and evil, such as was done with opposing terrorism and genocide versus peace and \nsafety. In both South African and Israeli papers, this was done to convince the public that \nthe government was acting in their best interest. An illustrative quote is the following from \nJerusalem Post : \u201cPost -Apartheid South Africa is weaponizing the Genocide Convention \n42  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n against the Jewish state as it defends itself against the racist, genocidal, terrorist Hamas \nregime.\u201d (Cotler & Lew, 2024, para 1). This show ed that Hamas is depicted as terrorists in \nIsraeli papers and that South Africa was on \u201cthe wrong side of history\u201d for choosing to \nsupport them. South Africa doesn\u2019t just choose the wrong side they use something good as \na weapon against Israel, making them an enemy as well.  \nHowever , South African papers us ed references to genocide and terrorism to \nillustrate the same but for Israel. As bec ame clear in the following quote from the Mail & \nGuardian : \u201cFor many the destruction of Gaza is an obvious continuation of the often \ngenocidal logic of Western colonialism\u201d (Hlela, 2024, January 11, para. 4). This quote  \nillustrated that colonialism inherently involves genocidal practices, framing Israeli actions in \nGaza as part of a larger historical pattern of oppression. Th e quote this way also refers to \nthe difference between the West and the global South, and its colonial past by using \ncolonialist ideologies in which the West perceives itself as superior to the rest of the world. \nThis historical  divide between the West and the Global South is something that was also \nillustrated by the next quote:  \nThe parallels between those who supported apartheid in South Africa and those \nsupporting apartheid in Israel persist. Colonial powers appear to subscribe to a \n\u201cback your buddy club\u201d. They believe that as long as they pretend that they are the \nforces of goo d and repeat the same, the lie will become a truth,  and everyone will \nconsider them as a civilised moral authority to aspire to.  \nGermany, a colonial power with its own historical baggage, is the first country to \nsupport Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case brought by South \nAfrica. This alignment suggests a continuity in the dynamics of international \nallianc es shaped by historical legacies and political interests. (Sooliman, 2024, para. \n3 and 4).   \nOpposing good against evil ultimately challeng es international relations and the divide \nbetween the West and the rest of the world , in addition to simplifying the conflict as a way \nto convince the public. This narrative was especially prevalent in South African newspapers , \nwhere the past was used as a reference point for how things can be different. Whereas  \n43  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Israeli papers  mention ed this less explicitly.  \n4.2.2. Dehumanizing both the victim and the enemy, and othering  \nIsrael, Hamas/ Palestine , and South Africa are all depicted as both the victim and \nthe enemy in the articles. What stood  out is that Israeli papers often refer to Hamas as the \nenemy and to themselves as the victim  (see Figure 5). \nFigure 5 \nIsraeli Victimhood in Ha\u2019aretz  \n \nSouth African papers refer less to Hamas and depict Israel as the enemy and Palestinians as \nthe victim. This became  apparent in how often Hamas is mentioned throughout the \nsample, where the Jerusalem Post  mentions Hamas more than both South African papers \ndo together (see Table  7). Israeli newspapers portray ed Hamas as \u201chuman animals\u201d or \n\u201cbarbarians\u201d whose actions  cause Palestinians to become \u201ccollateral damage\u201d (Rosensaft \nas quoted in Maltz, 2024, para. 4), rather than them being killed by Israel because t hey are \nPalestinians as such (which is how genocide is defined in the South African papers).  The \nIsraeli Ha\u2019aretz, for example, wrote  the following in an attempt to highlight Hamas\u2019 role : \n\u201cSouth Africa argued as if there was no Hamas and everything was Israel\u2019s doing\u201d (Maanit, \n2024 , January 13, para.  18). The dehumanization of Hamas by referring to them as \u201chuman \nanimals\u201d and \u201cbarbarians\u201d justifie d the violence that Israel uses against them. \nFurther dmore, it reinforce d negative stereotypes and biases, upholding existing prejudices \nand contributing to hatred.  \n\n44  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Table 7  \nMentioning of Hamas  \n  Frequency  Distribution  \nIsraeli papers   194 38/40  \n Ha\u2019aretz  69 18/20  \n Jerusalem  Post  125 20/20  \nSouth African papers   123 26/ 40  \n Mail &  Guardian   46 11/ 20  \n Sunday Times  77 15/ 20  \nThe difference between how often Hamas is mentioned in Israeli newspapers and \nSouth African ones, illustrates the different ways in which t he victim and enemy are \nrepresented in the papers. Israeli newspapers assign ed the victim role to themselves by \nportraying themselves as innocent and passive, which diminishe d their role in the conflict  \nand depicted Hamas as the enemy . Meanwhile, Palestinians were  represented as the \nvictims in South African media. They describe d them as a passive entity that need ed to be \nprotected, stripping them of their agency and individuality. Dehumanizing Palestinians in \nthis way highlight s their need for external help. This is a result of South African media \nwriting about the issue from a distanced South African perspective, which does  not give a \nvoice to Palestinians. A similar opposition to victim versus enem y was the one of the \noppressed versus the oppressor.  \nThese binary oppositions, which are amplified with the use of a dehumanizing \ndiscourse, sustain the othering process between the various parties reinforcing divisions \nbetween them and justifying the actions of one while demonizing the other. This results i n \npolarization, making it more difficult to create \u201cpeace and conflict resolution\u201d and \nperpetuate s the conflict.  \n \n45  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 5. Conclusion/ Discussion  \nThis thesis explored the role of the past in news reporting of the South Africa v. \nIsrael  ICJ genocide case. It showed that the past is often used to contextualize events. \nOverlexicalizations demonstrated that Israeli newspapers refer significantly more to the \nHolocaust than South African papers, while South African journals referred more to S outh \nAfrican Apartheid than Israeli ones did. The Israeli Jerusalem Post trie d to undermine South \nAfrica\u2019s position as a moral authority with the overlexicalization of the words irony, \ncynicism, and hypocrisy. Morality is another prominent theme, alongside the \noverlexicalization of the Holocaust, South African Apartheid, irony, cyni cism, and hypocrisy. \nThe results indicate that journalists mostly use their country\u00b4s past as the big explanatory \nthing, u sing it to critique others and thereby give meaning to what is happening.    \nReferences to the Holocaust and South African Apartheid make collective \nvictimhood a central theme in the articles. This feeling gives meaning to current events by \ncreating a moral framework. Each country\u2019s traumatic past is used to claim a position of \nmoral authority, with Israeli papers referencing the Holocaust and South African papers \nreferencing Apartheid . This framework  provid es a moral justification for each country\u2019s \ncurrent policies and actions. Due to the ethnocentric approach of this framework , each \ncountry views  its norms and values as superior  to the other and as a n explanation for its \nactions . The emphasis on national traumas cultivates a sense of superiority and pride. By \nportraying oneself as historical victim s, countries  thus  legitimize current events, often \nsidelining the responsibility for their role in ongoing conflicts. This shows that the past , \nadditionally, reinforces  national narratives and moral superiority, thereby influencing \nglobal perceptions and policies.  \nDue to the overlexicalization of morality, a humanitarian discourse was dominant \nthroughout the articles. With references to the country\u2019s traumatic past the papers \ndecriminilize its current actions and policies. In doing so the papers create the idea that \ntheir country is a moral authority and does what is best. The dominance of a humanitarian \ndiscourse in the articles highlights the essential role journalists play in covering cri ses. \nDespite the articles reporting a humanitarian conflict, not all articles  fit the humanitarian \nframe work . The results of this thesis show that the focus of the humanitarian frame was on \n46  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n how the paper\u00b4s country of origin would fix the conflict, despite this being something \ndifferent for both countries.   \nWith the use of overlexicalizations, the articles report on meaningful events that are \na continuation of something that is already reported on, relevant with a focus on violence, \nand ethnocentric, just as Selvairah and Fjoirititio (2023) and Baden and Tene nboim -\nWeinblatt (2018) argue. The articles are ethnocentric because of the references to each \ncountry\u2019s past, which is used to explain why one\u2019s culture, norms, and values are the best. \nThe results show that South Africa was superior (according to South Af rican newspapers) \nbecause it knew how to and had the duty to act morally based on its past. Israel was \ndepicted as superior (according to Israeli newspapers) because they had suffered so much \nin the past that they had proven to be moral and strong people. This also shows how the \npast is used as a framework in the conflict\u2019s media representation. The differences in \ndiscourse that were found among the different newspapers  corresponded with the \nnewspaper\u2019s political orientation, narrative style, and values. For example, t he Jerusalem \nPost , which is considered to be a more center -right paper , uses negative framing of the \nother. Similarly, it uses more personal language compared to the personally distanced tone \nfound in news articles from other papers.   \nThe most prevalent structural oppositions in the articles were the opposition of \ngood against evil and that of the victim against the enemy. South African papers, referred \nto their apartheid struggle as a way to condemn genocide resulting in illustrating I srael as \nbarbarian and the aggressor and this way created the opposition of good versus evil and \nthat of victim versus enemy. Israel referred to the Holocaust to compare Hamas\u2019 actions to \nwhat the Nazis did during the Second World War and this way depict o neself as the victim \nand Hamas as the enemy. The implicit references to the structural opposition between \nvictim to enemy, and oppressed to oppressor, highlighted the conflict in the articles. This \ncorresponds with Helmus and Marcellino\u2019s theory (2023) sta ting that conflicts can be \ncreated through words by opposing two parties.  \nOpposing good against evil can be explained as a consequence of the dominance of \na humanitarian discourse in which journalists depict their country as a moral authority. \nWith references to \u201cdoing good\u201d or \u201cacting morally\u201d one ultimately places oneself abov e \n47  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n everyone else who does not act the same way, depicting oneself as superior to the other. \nHammond (2000), similarly, argues that a humanitarian discourse is an excuse to make a \ndistinction between moral superiority and inferiority. This opposition  forces the audience \nto align with the paper\u2019s stance since it depicts the country the paper is from as the one \ntaking the moral high ground and everybody else as inferior. These processes of othering \njustify one\u2019s actions and simultaneously demonize the o ther, perp etuating the conflict. \nAdditionally, the conflict is simplified through these binary oppositions.  \nThe use of binary oppositions, such as good versus evil and victim versus enemy, is \nin line with tactics that are used for war journalism, such as the dehumanization and even \ndemonization of the other and  focusing on one\u2019s own suffering (which is predominantly \ndone by Israeli newspapers). Yet, results also contrast existing theories on war journalism. \nTenenboim -Weinblatt and colleagues (2016) stated that war journalism reports more on \ncurrent events, while  peace journalism often uses historical and social c ontext to explain \nthe possible motives and effects of the conflict. The reporting in the analyzed articles, thus, \ncorresponds with many characteristics of war journalism but simultaneously refers to \nhistorical context, which is a feature of peace journalis m. A possible explanation for this is \nthat the newspaper articles report on a court case rather than the conflict itself which \nallows South Africa to use its past to explain why they became involved , and how they are \ngoing to fix the conflict . Despite Isra el being involved since the beginning, they also use the \npast in a different way than is custom for peace reporting. They mainly refer to the past to \nportray themselves as victims , which is similar to competitive victimhood as Hadar (2019) \ndescribed . This suggests that war journalism uses references to the past to legitimize one\u2019s \naction  and this way obtain a superior position  in the conflict.  \nThe way Israeli victimhood is described is in line with characteristics Bouris (2007) \nattributed to the victim identity (as cited in Adonis, 2018).  In the articles, the responsibility \nfor the situation is not placed on Israel. By claiming that they are protecting their own \npeople and standing up for those in need, they create the idea of being morally superior \nand deny being guilty of committing crime s. Israeli newspapers use a settler discourse that \nrefers to an anti -Semitic world and  nazifies  the other. This is similar to observations Hadar \n(2019) made in research examining Israeli identities (p.16).  With Israel\u2019s frame of \n48  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n victimhood, history is sustained through linguistic processes just as Tenenboim -Weinblatt \nand Neiger (2019) argue, especially the implicit prospective element of never again is \nprevalent in the articles. The use of a discourse that refers to those who do n ot agree as \nanti-Semitic and the Nazification of the enemy reinforces this. South African papers \ndehumanize Palestinians by representing them as victims, making them helpless and \nhighlighting the need for help. In doing so they portray Palestinians as pass ive actors  that \nare free of guilt, which places them above Israel. At the same time , however, South Africa \nclaimed to be morally superior.  This shows the presence of competitive victimhood in the \narticles, despite South Africa imposing this victimhood on Palestine, leading to unequal \nrelations.  \nIn line with existing literature, these findings show that there is no such thing as \nneutral reporting (Mu\u00f1oz -Torres, 2012; Hafez, 2024; Daly, 2011; Vos & Hanusch, 2024; \nHampton & Conboy, 2013). Articles about the South Africa v. Israel  ICJ case are framed \nusing references to the past and overlexicalizations of irony, cynicism, hypocrisy, and \nmorality. The conflict is perpetuated through the use of structural oppositions. The \ncreation of these structural oppositions both highlights and s implifies the confli ct. The \ncollective memory and sense of victimhood that is referred to in the articles create a sense \nof identity, which ultimately leads to the othering of those who do not share this memory. \nIn the South African articles, a (post)colonial discourse is use d, that aims for more equitable \npower relations and peace. At the same time, the humanitarian discourse that is used in \nboth South African and Israeli newspapers perpetuates global divides and geopolitical \ntensions, since the choice that is implied by refe rring to good and evil tries to convince the \npublic of the paper\u2019s stance, ultimately placing both parties in direct opposition to each \nother.  \n5.3 Implications  \nAs discussed earlier, the articles make use of characteristics that are associated with \nwar journalism, humanitarian journalism, and even peace journalism. In the articles, \ndifferent discourses coexist. The use of structural oppositions creates  the idea of two \nopposing sides, which is inherent to a trial and is accompanied with the use of features \ntypical for war journalism. At the same time, South African papers try to aim for peace, \n49  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n despite not using tactics typical for peace journalism, which are an avoidance of \ndemonizing language and the use of a non-partisan  approach that Lee & Maslog refer to \n(2005). The results of this study, thus, contradict the claim made in the literature review \nstating that articles about the conflict used a frame of peace journalism since they aimed \nfor peace. Simultaneously, South Africa v. Israel  is about a humanitarian conflict. Articles \nreporting on this case consequently report facts of humanitarian cri ses on the Palestinian \nand Israeli sides, which is done as objectively as possible, corresponding to humanitarian \njournalism.   \nThis study aimed to bridge the gap between memory studies and journalism reporting \nconflicts. It has shown that collective memory is often used to legitimize a country\u2019s \ngovernment policies in journalism. In this case, collective victimhood that was a resu lt of \nboth countries\u2019 traumatic pasts played an important role in framing current events. The \ncollective memories of the Holocaust and South African Apartheid were used as the most \nimportant historical frames for giving meaning to the South Africa v. Israe l ICJ genocide \ncase in Israeli and South African newspapers. Journalists in this case worked as \ngatekeepers, shaping public perception and discourse through their editorial choices. The \nselective emphasis on the Holocaust by Israeli papers, and on its Apart heid history in South \nAfrican papers constructed a narrative in which each country\u2019s actions are justified by their \nhistorical victimhood. Repeatedly mentioning the Holocaust and South African Apartheid \nshows that collective memories of these events and t he accompanying feeling of collective \nvictimhood are used to establish a position as a moral authority and with this legitimize its \ncountry\u2019s actions. Opposing good versus evil and victim versus enemy reinforces this effect. \nAs a result of these strategies , a humanitarian  discourse is dominant in all articles.  \nResults showed that a blend of war journalism, humanitarian journalism, and peace \njournalism traits were used in the articles. While war journalism typically focuses on \ncurrent events, and peace journalism uses historical and social context more often to \nexplain the causes and consequences of conflicts, these articles combine both by using past \ntrauma to explain what is happening and justify actions. A humanitarian discourse was \napplied using the past as a framework that reinforced national narratives and m oral \nsuperiority. This confirms that reporting on international conflicts is influenced by \n50  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n nationalistic and ethnocentric biases, shaping how conflicts are made sense of. New \ninsights this thesis provides highlight the important role history plays in different types of \njournalism and is not limited to peace journalism.   \n5.4 Limitations  \nThis thesis used discourse analysis as a method to examine media coverage of the \nSouth Africa v. Israel  ICJ genocide case. While discourse analysis offers valuable insights \ninto the narratives and themes presented in media articles, several methodological \nlimitations should be considered. One notable limitation is the sample selection. The thesis \nanalyzed n ews- and feature articles published in Israeli and South African papers. A broader \napproach could have included articles from a distant nation with a sim ilar traumatic past \nsuch as Japan or Germany. Incorporating an analysis of journals from these countries would \nhave added an outsider\u2019s perspective to the comparative analysis, enriching the analysis \nwith diverse interpretations and potentially contrasting  discursive strategies. This would \noffer a more nuanced understanding of global media portrayal, enhancing the \ngeneralizability of the findings.  \nAnother limitation is the difference in the tone of voice  used  between news articles \nand feature articles. Journalists took on a more personal tone of voice in the feature \narticles that were analyzed . While, in the news articles they reported more distantly. The \ndistance was created by citing official sources and reporting on events \u2018without\u2019 \ninterpreting them. Perspectives from the public, citizens, or other viewpoints were \nexcluded . In the feature articles, different points of view were presented, despite this often \nbeing the author\u2019s opinion, which usually was in line with the paper\u2019s stance. Due to the \njournalists\u2019 distancing in the news articles, this study is, in part, an analysis  of how the case  \nwas discussed in court. To prevent this one could solely use feature articles in future \nresearch.   \nBecause South Africa v. Israel  is still an ongoing case, it was impossible to focus on \nthe media representation of the entire case. As a result, the scope of the analysis is limited. \nThe study solely focused on the media coverage in the first weeks of the case. As a result, \nthis thesis  overlooks how narratives evolved over time. As the case progressed the ICJ \ncalled for a ceasefire, for instance. Moreover, Western support for Israel declined, with \n51  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n several European countries (which are currently Spain, Belgium, and Ireland) announcing \ntheir intention to join the case in support of South Africa (United Nations, 2024). Such \ndevelopments can influence media narratives and public discourse, emphasizing t hat this \nthesis\u2019 findings are momentary recordings of the role of the past in the first weeks of the \ncourt case. Additionally, to get a better understanding of how newspapers reported on the \nmatter one could focus on articles covering the whole conflict.  \nFurthermore, the thesis used discourse analysis as a method, which exclusively \nexamines the construction of meaning through language and narrative structures. In doing \nso one misses the persuasive rhetorical approaches that are used to convince the audienc e. \nA rhetorical analysis of the persuasive tactics and strategic goals of the articles would have \ngiven more insights into how media frames are used to influence public perception and \npublic discourse. Despite these limitations, discourse analysis is a fit ting methodology to \nstudy underlying narratives and ideological frameworks within media representations and \nthis way show the role the past played in articles reporting South Africa v. Israel . Future \nresearch could address these limitations by broadening the sample and scope of the \nanalysis so that it includes more perspectives on the matter and a broader understanding \nof how the case is reported. Incorporating a different type of analysis wou ld also provide a \nbetter understanding of the role of the past in  media representation of the conflict.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n52  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n List of References  \nAdegbola, O., Gearhart, S., & Cho, J.

Jennifer L. Bonnet, & Judit h E. Rosenbaum, University of Maine \n \nOverview  \n In the fall of 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered universities and sent much of higher education online, a team of media and information literacy experts at the University of Maine sought meaningful ways to collaboratively teach news literacy from a distance.\n1 The result of \ntheir efforts was a weeklong virtual program, Friend, Enemy, or Frenemy? A News Literacy \nChallenge , open to anyone with an internet connection and an email address. This approach to \nremote learning scaffolded multiple literacies (critical media, news, and information) into five \ndays, as participants examined different aspects of news production and c onsumption. The \noverall objective of the challenge was to render participants more aware of how the news is \nconstructed and, subsequently, more critical of the news they consume and share.  \n We aimed for the Challenge to be engaging, fun, and accessible, and it proved popular, with \nover 700 registrants, including students (middle, high school, college, and graduate), educators, retirees, friend groups, and members of the general public. The program was a dual learning experience, for us and the participants. Evaluations revealed a clear enthusiasm for the program, with most participants saying that the length and format of the Challenge were good, and that they learned something new each day. An open- ended question about participants\u2019 \nexperiences with the Challenge revealed an appreciation for the informative content and the \nactivities (e.g., \u201cI liked the resources, but I thought the activities were most helpful. It made me \nthink through the concepts more carefully,\u201d and \u201cI liked the discussion and being able to see \nothers \u2019 responses. I also liked the quizzes. The resources were good and provided information \nfrom differing opinions to ensure that people of all views could relate.\u201d). We even received unsolicited emails from several educators who were taking  the Challenge and planning to use \nthe materials in their courses.  \n The following lesson plan details how the learning materials were delivered during the five days \nof the asynchronous experience. Each day, participants received new material around different \nnews media concepts and competencies, along with a formative assessment activity. Participants were expected to review the content and complete the activity at their own pace, either that day or later in the week.   As other educators consider adapt ing this material for their undergraduate classrooms, we \nrecommend an asynchronous experience, with material distributed either daily or weekly, with one module making up the work for each day or week. Each section is \u201ccomplete ,\u201d meaning it is \nready to  go for any self -directed learning space. Each module includes the content for that day: \n \n1 This team has been teaching face- to-face news literacy workshops for the campus community since 2018, and \nwas eager to continue this work, in spite of the pandemic.  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  3 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 links to media examples and case studies, suggestions for discussions for a synchronous class, \nadvice on adapting each module for different virtual learning environmen ts, and a detailed \ndescription of an activity with directions on how to carry this out asynchronously and synchronously.  \n Since we opened up the virtual challenge to learners outside the campus, we intentionally designed the program to be accessible to a general audience. However, we also approached the material through a framework of communication and media studies, with a particular emphasis on media and information literacy skills. Given that approach, we believe the lesson plan would be best adapted for introductory communication or media studies courses at the college level, or as an engaging way to meet media and information literacy requirements within a course. \nThe lesson plan could also be utilized in a high school setting, in l anguage arts or s ocial science \nclasses geared toward exploring the media.  \n \nRationale  \n This five -day, virtual experience evolved from previous iterations of a 90 -minute, on- campus \nworkshop. The unique situation presented by the pandemic, with most teaching a nd learning \nhaving migrated online, forced a reconceptualization of the program design and ways to engage learners. Instead of seeing this as a limitation, we found that moving the workshop online afforded us an opportunity to make improvements. Particular ly, we were able to spread \nengagement over several days, dividing the program into smaller, self -directed units. Remote \nengagement also allowed us to reach participants outside the campus community, expanding the program\u2019s impact and building a more divers e community of voices.  \n \nWe designed the program using a critical media and information literacy (CMIL) framework, \ndrawing on work by Brayton and Casey (2019) , who argue that an equitable convergence of \ncritical media literacy and critical information lit eracy is necessary in a digital media \nenvironment that blurs distinctions between media and information. In this sense, the news is the perfect lens for this approach as it intersects both information and media (Malik, Cortesi, and Gasser 2013). Our focus on the news has additional significance through the news\u2019 connection to civic engagement. Many scholars argue that the news and the ability of citizens \nto access and make sense of the news are essential to a healthy democracy (Vraga et al. 2015; \nMihailidis  and Viotty 2017; Buschman 2019). In the current media environment, however, the \nnews has become a source of skepticism and ground zero for political and cultural battles. Furthermore, the digital landscape is especially susceptible to the spread of misinformation and disinformation that is often disguised as news (Barton 2019). In recent years, many news literacy programs have emerged as a means of \u2018inoculating\u2019 citizens from the threat of so -called \nfake news (Brayton and Casey 2019). This kind of protecti onist approach is not enough, \nhowever. If the goal of news literacy is to \u201cachieve empowered citizens\u201d (Malik, Cortesi, and \nGasser 2013, 8), then a CMIL approach is necessary as it merges the lenses (media) and the \ntools (information) through which we expe rience and act upon the world (Livingstone, Van \nCouvering, and Thumin 2008) and, through its critical framework, empowers citizens \u201cto become their own gatekeepers\u201d of news media (Barton 2019, 1033).  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  4 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 Thus, the primary learning outcomes of the weeklong chal lenge were to engage participants in \nlessons, activities, and conversations that improved their news literacy, while also developing \ntheir critical understanding of the relationship between news media, information, audiences, and power structures. Specific ally, participants would:  \n\u25cf Understand the value of news and being well -informed;  \n\u25cf Be able to effectively evaluate and analyze news and information;  \n\u25cf Draw on strategies for identifying misinformation and disinformation;  \n\u25cf Recogniz e the critical implications of news stories as constructions, and the individual, \norganizational, and cultural influences on news production;  \n\u25cf Be able to identify the roles played by personal preferences in selecting and assessing \nnews stories.  \nThe challenge culminated with participants demonstrating the ability to create news and to \nmake choices that reflect a deeper, more critical understanding of the media environment.\n \n \nGeneral Timeline  \n We designed the workshop to last five days \u2014one schoo l week. While each day builds on the \nknowledge and activities from the previous day(s), it is possible to teach this five -part workshop \nover a longer period of time (addressing, for example, one part per week) or in a shorter period of time (over the cours e of two or three class periods as detailed above). We made the decision \nto teach the five -part workshop during Global Media Literacy Week (October 26 -30, 2020). This \nevent, as well as the subsequent U.S. election, provided an opportune moment to teach peo ple \nhow to approach the news more critically and to connect the news to civic engagement.  \n Each day, participants encountered a new \u201cchallenge\u201d. After we introduced them to an aspect \nof news production and consumption, as well as additional resources about the topic that they \ncould review on their own, participants applied their newly acquired knowledge to an activity. The separate challenges were built on different media theories, news concepts, and news literacy competencies. The program mo ved from the broad to the specific, and from \ncomprehension to critical analysis to creation.  \n Should an educator wish to facilitate a synchronous lecture or discussion, either in person or \nremote, they should plan to dedicate one class period to each unit.  Instructors should allot \napproximately 45 -50 minutes for each module in order to present that day\u2019s lesson, facilitate \neach activity, and discuss students\u2019 work. If instructors work with 75 -minute classes, they \nshould dedicate two class periods for the fi rst four modules, and use a third class period to go \nthrough what is currently the fifth day, giving students ample time to design one or more \nheadlines.   \n \nAn overview of the challenge can be found below:  \n    \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  5 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 Day 1: Does News Matter?  \n \nThis module centers on ideas of when and if news matters, addressing the news\u2019 potential to affect people\u2019s daily lives, inform users of topical issues, and familiarize people with dominant \nnorms and values. The primary objectives of this module are to develop a great er awareness of \nthe purpose s and functions of news media and to be able to identify and explain the salient \nattributes that make a story newsworthy.  \n \nDay 2: Fact or Fiction  \n This module explores strategies for evaluating news and information and then asks participants \nto determine the veracity of several colorful, catchy news stories. The primary objectives of this \nmodule are to understand one\u2019s own responsibility in accessing and evaluating news and \ninformation and to develop and apply strategies for determining the credibility and \ntrustworthiness of media content.  \n Day 3: Deconstructing the News  \n \nThis module introduces participants to the constructed nature of news media, including the \nchoices, influences, and constraints that affect which stories get to ld and how those stories are \ntold. The primary objectives of this module are to understand that news media are constructions shaped by many different interests and influences and to be able to identify and critically examine the interests and influences em bedded within a news story.  \n \nDay 4: Deconstructing Bias  \n This module focuses on two types of bias: the kind that is embedded in the news making process itself (introduced in Day 3), and confirmation bias, which draws on news consumers\u2019 personal attitudes a nd beliefs. The primary objectives of this module are to understand the role \nof bias in the production and consumption of news media and to develop and apply strategies for recognizing and addressing bias.  \n \nDay 5: Constructing the News  \n \nThis module is the grand finale and places participants in the role of news producer. Given a set of facts, participants are challenged to design a headline for a specific news outlet, select an accompanying photo, and describe the choices that went into their decision m aking. The \nprimary objective of this module is to creatively and analytically apply critical news media and information literacy skills.  \n \n[We recognize that the language is drawn from the original challenge for much of this, \nhowever, because it is now being adapted to the classroom this paragraph does not seem to match the spirit of a lesson plan, and, especially when it comes to days three and five, are very \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  6 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 interested in this lesson as cumulative. We thus feel this lesson works better without this \nparagraph.]       \n The detailed lesson plan below includes a description of how the content and activities were \ndelivered in our virtual challenge, an online, asynchronous learning event. We have, however, \nincluded recommendations on how to adapt each day fo r a hybrid or in -person synchronous \nsetting.  \n \nDetailed Lesson Plan  \n Day One: Does News Matter?  https://libguides.library.umaine.edu/newslit/day1\n  \n Overall goal  \nThe first day of the C hallenge aims to render participants aware of the role that the news plays \nin people\u2019s lives.   Learning outcomes  \n \n\u25cf Develop an awareness that different news stories serve different purposes;  \n\u25cf Understand the news provides people with information about their daily life, current \nevents, and dominant social norms;  \n\u25cf Identify the purpose (s) of a news story;  \n\u25cf Identify why a news story is newsworthy.  \n Content  \nThis day includes a video\n recorded by one of the workshop leaders, which can be provided to \nstudents as is (or re -recorded) within a self- directed asynchronous or hybrid learning space. The \ncontent can also be adapted into a lecture for a synchronous or face -to-face setting. The video \ntouches on the following points:  \n \n\u25cf News matters because it keeps people updated about things that are important to their daily lives (e.g., weather, new laws, and where to go vote) . \n\u25cf News also informs people about what one might call topical events. This is what most people think about when they think about \u201cthe news .\u201d These are breaking news events \nabout crimes, fires, floods, hurricanes, or election result s.  \n\u25cf The news plays a role in teaching about what is and is not acceptable behavior. In other words, the news socializes its users into understanding the dominant norms and values in society.  \n\u25cb News organizations have to make choices about what stories to include. And those choices are based on the premise of getting the highest ratings, clicks, or \nattention as possible.  \n\u25cb This means that the news will present stories that are out of the norm or most \nlikely to surprise or shock users, in an attempt to draw in as many people as possible.  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  7 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 \u25cb Because the news tends to emphasize stories that are out of the norm, the news \noften teaches about what is acceptable and what is not. We used several examples to explain this:  \n\u25a0 Murder is newsworthy because it is considered outsi de of the norm  and \nwe condemn killing people;  \n\u25a0 Absentee ballots are a big deal because discussions about voting and people\u2019s ability to vote, in spite of an ongoing pandemic, get at the heart of how we perceive American democracy to work. These stories r eflect \nthe American cultural value that every citizen should have the ability to \nvote and every vote should get counted.  \n\u25a0 On a smaller scale, why was it such a big deal when the Chicago Cubs \nfinally won a World Series Championship (Fine, 2016)? Because in the US, \nwe love it when an underdog comes out on top, we revel in stories where \nthe \u201clittle guy\u201d wins, and we believe that no matter the odds, hard work \nwill pay off.  \n\u25cf In conclusion, news matters not just because people learn important information about \ndaily life, but also because it socializes people into thinking about the world in a certain \nway.  What this also means though, is that the news, by consistently portraying certain \ngroups in certain ways (e.g., women as moms, people from Mexico or Honduras as  \nimmigrants, African Americans as athletes), reinforces existing stereotypes and can \ninfluence public perceptions of issues.  \n In a face -to-face setting, instructors could ascertain that students took away these main points \nthrough a Q&A or in -class discussion centering on these points.  \n \nActivity  \nThe activity associated with this day utilizes Padlet and asks participants to find and share a \nnews story that represents one or more of the functions introduced above. Participants are asked to explain what purpose (s) they think this story held and explain why they think the story \nis newsworthy.  \n In a face -to-face setting, participants can be asked to find a news story, and write a brief (100 -\nword) description that details the function of the story and why the story is newsworthy. Each participant can present their work to the class, and instructors can ask other participants for feedback on each analysis, further deepening students\u2019 understanding of the functions of the news.  \n By having participants apply their understanding of news functions to their own news media consumption, the goal is to render participants more critically aware of why news is considered news, instead of taking the label \u201cnews\u201d at face value.  \n \nDay Two: Fact or Fiction? https://libguide s.library.umaine.edu/newslit/day2  \n Overall goal  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  8 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 Day 2 introduces the idea of attention- grabbing headlines as a key strategy in news making. We \npresent headlines that educate and engage an audience with humor, as well those that co -opt \nthe structure of the news to mislead and/or misinform.  \n \nLearning outcomes  \n \n\u25cf Recognize one\u2019s own role in determining the reliability of a source;  \n\u25cf Identify strategies for evaluating online content;  \n\u25cf Recognize the superficial nature of headlines alone when determining the validity or \ntrustworthiness of a story (or source).  \n \nContent  \nOn Day 2, we present a typical scenario for the current era: The first thing we often see in our \nsocial media feeds or in our Google searches is an attention -grabbing headline. B ut, how \nreliable is the story behind the headline?  \n \nWe focus on the news consumer s\u2019 role in critically evaluating information, using the SIFT \nmethod (Caulfield 2019). This acronym points to the following key assessment strategies:  \n \n\u25cf Stop, and consider what you know (or don\u2019t) about the website or source of information \nyou\u2019ve encountered.  \n\u25cf Investigate the source. This includes the credentials, expertise, or insight the person or \norganization has who created this information, as well as their agenda.  \n\u25cf Find trusted coverage of the story\u2019s content by corroborating or cross -referencing \nsources wherever possible.  \n\u25cf Trace claims, quotes, images, and/or videos back to their original context. This approach often reveals that there is more to a situation than we first thought and can help us \ngather (and share) a more complete and accurate picture of the issue we\u2019re exploring.  \n To conclude the day, we point participants to our Guide to Fake News and Misinformation (Fogler Library n.d.) that includes tools and techniques for assessing false or misleading information.  \n In a face -to-face setting, we advise instructors to test students\u2019 understanding of the SIFT \nmodel by applying it to a range of headlines, from satirical to misleading to surprising to clickbaity, and engaging the class in a discussion about how to utilize  SIFT in these instances. \nSnopes.com and Politifact.com are useful resources for quickly finding problematic headlines and supposed news stories.  \n Activity  \nToday\u2019s activity is a four -question online quiz, with each question presenting a catchy news \nheadli ne and asking the participant to determine if the story behind the headline was real or \nfake. Participants are encouraged to  do some online research and use the SIFT method to make \ntheir determination. After each quiz submission, participants receive feedback on how to find \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  9 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 and evaluate each headline, and resources and strategies for identifying fake news and \nmisinformation. Note : Because a large number of educators took the challenge, we included \nrelevant research, lesson plans, and teaching tools from the Stanford History Education Group (n.d.), a group of academics at the forefront of scholarship on source evaluation and digital \nliteracy.  \n \nIn a face -to-face setting, the instructor can opt to present each headline to the entire class and \nask students to review and respond to each headline in small groups. Alternatively, the instructor can use a free polling software, such as Mentimeter.com or Polleverywhere.com, to have students indicate whether the story behind the headline is fake or real (or so mewhere in \nbetween). Reflection is key to this approach to learning, so we encourage instructors to engage \nthe class in a large -group discussion regarding the correct answers, as well as the strategies that \nthey can employ to better evaluate the credibilit y of headlines  \n \nThe purpose s of this activity are  to have participants learn how to apply SIFT as a strategy for \nevaluating news content and sources  and to become more capable at using this critical \napproach when encountering (and sharing) the news.  \n \nDay Three: Deconstructing the News https://libguides.library.umaine.edu/newslit/day3  \n Overall goal  \nDay 3 introduces the idea that the news is made up of stories. News stories, like all media, are constructions representing the many different choices, influences, and interests that affect which stories get told and how those stories are told. We then challenge participants to find and reflect on a news stor y that exemplifies the ways in which the news is constructed by \npeople, organizations, and culture.  \n Learning outcomes  \n \n\u25cf Understand the constructed nature of news stories;  \n\u25cf Identify the different influences and interests that shape news media;  \n\u25cf Practice deconstructing news stories and critically examining the choices, influences, \nand interests that shape a news story.  \n \nContent  \nWe preface Day 3 by questioning the commonly held belief that the news reflects reality and that journalists report the news objectively. The news is made up of stories, produced for particular purposes and for specific audiences, and often for profit. News stories are constructions of reality, determined and influenced by individual people, organizations, and the cultures in which they are produced.  \n We then break down those three major influences on the construction of news stories, providing context and linked examples that demonstrate the various concepts (please find a list \nbelow). These examples not only evinc e the ways in which news is shaped around specific \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  10 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 agendas, but also the ways in which journalists and news organizations rely on convenience as \nwell as routine, and fall back on traditional hierarchies of power and the representations they have always use d to tell those stories. As a result, they often leave out the voices of \nmarginalized populations, fail to hold to account people in positions of influence (like \npoliticians, and even news organizations themselves), ignore the consequences of \npredominantly  white newsrooms on stories about race and racism, and engage in ongoing \nattempts at drawing in audiences through an emphasis on surface over substance.  \n The list below covers the three major influences that shape what news stories look like: people, orga nizations, and culture. Each influence is accompanied by several links (the web addresses \ncan be found in the list of references at the end of this article) , which provide examples of how \nthis particular influence shapes the news and how news consumers m ight learn to recognize \nthis influence. Since these materials are quite detailed, instructors could ask participants to \nread or listen to one or more of the links for each influence before engaging with this day\u2019s \nmaterials.  \n \nFor a synchronous onl ine or face -to-face lecture, instructors may choose to use all or some of \nthese materials to frame the overall discussion, or to facilitate a discussion of each influence. If \ntime permits during the class meeting, instructors could break students into smal l groups to \nread through or listen to one or more of these materials and discuss how the example provides insight into the influence of people, organizations and/or culture on news stories.  \n \n\u25cf People  construct the news by selecting which stories get covered (WNYC studios, \nDecember 7, 2018); deciding the focus of the story (Hare 2020); and making choices \nabout how the story is told (WNYC studios, November 30, 2018).  \n\u25cb People who make the news (including producers, reporters, editors, camera people, anchors, and pundits) make choices based on their training, interests, routines, social environments, and their personal bias.  \n\u25cb Choices are made by everyone in the production of a news story from the reporter deciding who to interview and which questions to ask to the photographer deciding what to include and exclude from their frame.  \n\u25cf Organizations construct the news by setting news policies (WNYC studios, September 4, 2020); hiring the people who make the news (Grieco 2018) and deciding how to attract \nadvertisers and audience s (Pew Research Center 2019).  \n\u25cb There are many different outlets to get the news from and every news \norganization has its own policies, agendas, and audiences (Pew Research Center \n2020).  \n\u25cb Some news organizations operate as for- profit businesses, relying on advertisers \nand subscriptions, while others are not- for-profit or government- funded \norganizations.  \n\u25cb The ownership of national and local news organizations in the U.S. has become \nhighly concentrated among a small number of corporations and individuals, \nresulting in less variety of perspectives and more competition for audiences and \nadvertisers.  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  11 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 \u25cb Traditionally, news organizations maintain a separation between their corporate \ninterests and editorial interests, but sometimes those interests conflict.  \n\u25cb News organizations also rely on access to sources of information (WNYC studios, July 13, 2018), inclu ding the government, which may also influence the news.  \n\u25cf Culture constructs the news through:  \n\u25cb How stories are told, such as relying on traditional narratives, such as Us vs. Them (Wilson -Hunt 2018) or Humans vs. Nature, and emotional appeals. Those \nstories are also shaped by the different media forms (print, audio, video, digital) \nfor which the news is produced.  \n\u25cb Our cultural traditions, norms, and values, such as our always changing attitudes towards race (Pinsky 2019), gender, and class, our dominant political values \n(WNYC studios, July 27, 2018), and our need for sensationalism (Greene 2016).  \n \nWe conclude with links to On the Media\u2019s Breaking News Consumer\u2019s Handbook  (WNYC studios \nn.d.) and the Society for Professional Journalists\u2019 code of ethics for furthe r exploration (Society \nof Professional Journalists 2014).  \n \nIn a synchronous classroom, we recommend the instructor engage the class in a discussion of \none or two recent news stories (or two versions of the same story from different sources) and \nisolate how  the story is  shaped through the choices made by the reporters (e.g., camera angles, \nb-roll, whom to interview, whom not to interview), the organizational culture (e.g., is the news \noutlet known to have a particular political leaning? Who are the main sponsors /advertisers for \nthe news outlet?), and the overall culture (e.g., what story is being told here? Who is presented as \u201cthe good guy\u201d and who is presented as \u201cthe bad guy\u201d? How might other cultures present \nthis same story?). This approach can also be used in an asynchronous setting  as an additional \nactivity or in preparation for the main activity.  \n For both modalities, the Center for Media Literacy\u2019s (n.d.) five core concepts for understanding \nmedia messages and five key questions for deconstructing media messages are valuable tools  to share with learners ( a PDF is available online\n). We recommend instructors share these \nquestions with the participants prio r to engaging with the materials for this day.  \n  \n Five Core Concepts (Center for Media Literacy, n.d.):  \n1. All media messages are constructed.  \n2. Media messages are constructed using a creative language with its own rules.  \n3. Different people experience the same m edia message differently.  \n4. Media have embedded values and points of view.  \n5. Most media messages are organized to gain profit and/or power.  \n  Five Key Questions (Center for Media Literacy, n.d.):  \n1. Who created this message?  \n2. What creative techniques are used to attract my attention?  \n3. How might different people understand this message differently?  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  12 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 4. What values, lifestyles and points of view are represented in, or omitted from, \nthis message?  \n5. Why is this message being sent?  \n \nActivity  \nDay 3\u2019s activity asks participants to find and share a news story that reflects the ways in which \npeople, organizations, and/or culture construct the news. Participants share their story in a Padlet discussion board, along with short commentary about why they chose their story and how it reflects the influences and constraints explored in the day\u2019s content.  \n In a synchronous online or face -to-face setting, participants can be placed into small groups \nwhere they are asked to find a news story and prepare a brief presentation to discuss the various factors that shape the form and content of that particular story.  \n The learning objective for this outcome is for participants to apply their recently acquired knowledge about news construction to the news they consume. This will ultima tely lead \nparticipants to adopt a more critical attitude toward all of the news media they engage with, including their preferred news sources.  \n \nDay Four: Deconstructing Bias https://libguides.library.umaine.edu/newslit/day4  \n Overall goal  \nDay 4 aims to bridge participants\u2019 awareness of the agendas inherent in news stories (as presented in Day 3), with the personal biases that they as news consumers bring to their encounters with the news.  \n Learning outcomes  \n \n\u25cf Identify different perspectives that news consum ers and creators bring to , and shape \ntheir relationship with, the news ; \n\u25cf Recognize one\u2019s own confirmation bias when encountering and reacting to a story (or headline);  \n\u25cf Develop strategies for acknowledging and addressing bias.  \n Content  \nReferring to Day 3, we review the idea that news outlets create content for a particular audience, and that the messages in that content reflect the values of the people and \norganizations that produce the news. We also focus on the following:  \n \n\u25cf Messages e mbedded in news content can be interpreted differently by different \nviewers/listeners/readers, in large part because news consumers come to the news with their own subjective experiences and assumptions.  \n\u25cf We have a lot of information coming at us all of the  time. Our brains have a tendency to \nprocess that information as quickly as possible, which is why we sometimes use \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  13 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 shortcuts, like cognitive biases, to make sense of it all. The combination of news \nmessaging by news outlets, our own subjectivity and points of view, and the cognitive biases we hold contribute to how we experience and respond to the news.  \n \nWe then introduce confirmation bias, one type of cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to \nmore readily accept, and even value, information that match es what we already believe (or \ndismiss information that is contradictory ). Emphasizing that everyone has this tendency, \nregardless of our political beliefs or education level, we note that in order to address cognitive bias, we must first recognize wha t it looks like. Before diving into the activity, we point learners \nto additional insights into confirmation bias from the News Literacy Project (n.d.).  \n \nIn a synchronous setting, we recommend instructors have students identify their own beliefs \nabout spec ific current events to identify their positions or perspectives when consuming the \nnews. This can be achieved by presenting students with three different headlines for the same \nstory. Each headline should present a different political leaning or bias (a us eful starting point \nfor finding headlines is AllSides.com). Students then choose which headline they agree with the most  and are placed into groups with students who favored the other headlines. In their groups \nthe students are asked to discuss their bel iefs regarding the story and how their bias plays into \ntheir news preference.  \n Activity  \nParticipants are asked to do the following:  \n \n1. Look at these two headlines from 2019 (and feel free to click through to the stories \nthemselves).  \n\u25cf Cory Booker unveils \"bold\" plan to curb gun violence, from CBS News (Turman \n2019)  \n\u25cf Cory Booker: Americans should be 'thrown in jail' if they won't give up their guns, from Washington Examiner (Gage 2019)  \n2. Answer the following questions in a Padlet discussion board:  \n\u25cf Why are these two  headlines so different if they're on the same topic?  \n\u25cf How does your own confirmation bias affect your reading of these headlines?  \n \nParticipants are given further questions to consider:  \n \n\u25cf When can a point of view in the news be helpful?  \n\u25cf When can a point of view in the news be harmful?  \n \nIn a face -to-face setting, the first two questions can be answered anonymously using a polling \nsoftware, such as Mentimeter.com or Polleverywhere.com. Stude nts can then engage in the \ntwo additional questions using a think, pair, share model.  \n \nThe purpose of this activity is to teach participants how to recognize bias inherent in news \nstories as well as their own bias in interpreting news content.  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  14 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 We provide  additional viewing to further illustrate the challenging nature of confirmation bias, \nand possible tools for addressing potential blind spots.  \n \n\u25cf Watch Why Do Our Brains Love Fake News? (Above the Noise 2017) for more insight \ninto confirmation bias.  \n\u25cf Watch How News Feed Algorithms Supercharge Confirmation Bias (Big Think 2018).  \n \nDay Five: Constructing the News https://libguides.library.umaine.edu/newslit/day5  \n \nOverall goal  \nThe final day of the challenge aims to synthesize the previous four days through a creative \nactivity in which participants construct and share a headline for a specific news outlet. The \nday\u2019s challenge is wholly dedicated to the activity, which places participants in the role of news \nproducer. The activity addresses racial prof iling narratives within the context of a story that \nmay be framed in a variety of ways depending on the particular news outlet and audience.  \n \nLearning outcomes  \n \n\u25cf Construct a news headline appropriate for a particular news outlet;  \n\u25cf Synthesize and apply the various learning outcomes from the previous days, including:  \n\u25cb Demonstrate an understanding of the functions and purposes of the news and what makes a story newsworthy;  \n\u25cb Show an awareness of how the news is constructed for a particular audience with a particular worldview;  \n\u25cb Demonstrate an understanding of the various interpretations of world events;  \n\u25cb Recognize one\u2019s own bias and how this influences their decisions as a news consumer and producer;  \n\u25cb Be able to weigh the various ethical decisions that reporters fac e when working \non stories about race.  \n Activity  \nThe challenge for Day 5 tasks participants with constructing a headline for a specific news \noutlet based on a supplied set of facts. Participants share their headlines in a Padlet discussion board along with a breakdown of the choices they made and why.  \n Participants may not be familiar with the news outlets you assign them or may not have the tools to determine a news organization\u2019s particular characteristics, such as ownership, audience, economics, political bias, the gender and race of editorial and newsroom staff, or the outlet\u2019s particular headline style or use of images. Whether your students are familiar with a specific news organization or not, students should spend some time researching their assigned \noutlet.  A good place to start is by visiting the assigned news outlet online, reading through their \nheadlines and stories, and reading the \u201cAbout\u201d section on the website. Students may also want \nto look at the bios of some of the news outlet\u2019s staff. All Sides (n.d.) can be a useful tool in \ndetermining an outlet\u2019s relative bias, though students should be aware that media bias guides \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  15 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 like this tend to use a simple left/right binary to categorize news media outlets and may not \ncapture the full spectrum of po litical perspectives and worldviews represented across news \nmedia. Pew Research Center\u2019s (n.d.) \u201cState of the News Media\u201d produces yearly research on \n\u201cdata and trends about key sectors in the U.S. news media industry\u201d including many of the \ncharacterist ics identified above. Media Bias / Fact Check details their methodology (n.d.) for \ndetermining the bias of different news outlets, though they admit the task is highly subjective. \nParticipants may want to review Media Bias / Fact Check\u2019s methodology for us e in their own \ndeterminations, particularly the following categories and questions:  \n\u25cf Biased wording/headlines: Does the source use loaded words to convey emotion or to sway the reader? Do headlines match the story?  \n\u25cf Factual/sourcing: Does the source report factually and back up claims with well -sourced \nevidence?  \n\u25cf Story choices: Does the source report news from both sides or do they only publish one side?  \n\u25cf Political affiliation: How strongly does the source endorse a particular political ideology? In other words, how extreme are their views?  \n Given the focus of Day 5\u2019s activity, students should pay particular attention to the political bias of their assigned outlet and its audience and how the outlet frames issues related to race and the concerns of minority  communities, especially through their headlines and choice of images.  \n \nParticipants are given the following information about a potential news story:  \n \nBackground:  A neighborhood swimming pool has an ID scanner for entry. All residents living at \ncertain ad dresses in the vicinity of the pool can obtain an ID card from the homeowner\u2019s \nassociation in the neighborhood and use it to enter the pool. There is no one to monitor the \npool\u2019s use or ID access.  \n \n\u25cf White chair of the homeowner\u2019s association calls the police when he sees a Black mother and her child swimming at the neighborhood pool.  \n\u25cf Chair of the homeowner\u2019s association asks the mother to show her ID card.  \n\u25cf One police officer questions the mother abo ut the man\u2019s call and asks her to swipe her \nID card to prove her membership in the neighborhood.  \n\u25cf Another police officer separates the child from the mother while the other officer is talking with her.  \n\u25cf Both police officers speak with the chair of the homeo wner\u2019s association.  \n\u25cf Mother swipes her ID card and it is a valid ID.  \n\u25cf Mother asks the chair of the homeowner\u2019s association to apologize. He does not respond.  \n Participants are then asked to do the following:  \n \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  16 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 1. Review the information about a recent event bel ow2\u2014you can do this activity alone, or \nif you want to collaborate with others who are taking this challenge, feel free to connect \nwith them and do this as a group!  \n2. Use that information to create a headline for the outlet you are assigned and select a \nphoto to accompany your headline. If you don\u2019t know anything about your news outlet, \ndo some brief online searching to get a better sense of it. (Note: Participants were given a group of curated images to select from and they were assigned a news outlet based on their last name: A- C were assigned Fox News; D -F, National Public Radio; G -K, Huffington \nPost; L -R, The Wall Street Journal; and S- Z, The Onion).  \n3. Share your headline, your assigned media outlet, and the choices you made in the discussion board below. Include the image number you chose, and why.  \n4. Optional Bonus Challenge!  Pick a news outlet that you were not assigned, and create a \nheadline based on the same information above. In the discussion board, share the outlet you chose, plus your headline and photo , and discuss why you made the choices \nyou did. This bonus challenge provides an opportunity to consider how you might respond to this exercise when approaching it from a different point of view or agenda.  \n  \nThis activity can be delivered to students as is  within an asynchronous or hybrid setting (see the \nvirtual challenge linked above). In a face -to-face setting, the class can be split into small groups \nwhich are randomly assigned to one of the news outlets listed above. As a group, they design a headline and choose an image to accompany that headline. After completing the activity, each \ngroup then presents their work to the class, explaining the choices they made. The key to this activity is allowing the students the time and space to engage in a deeper co nversation around \nhow the news is constructed to serve specific agendas and specific audiences , which often \nconstrains the ability of news stories, and particularly headline -driven news, to present a story \nobjectively or to reflect all of the relevant pe rspectives and nuances within a story. The \nstudents should also reflect on the many choices they made in producing their headline and how the demands of the task and their own bias influenced those choices.  \n The purpose of this activity is to have participants acknowledge their own perspective on reality and understand how such perspectives influence what the news looks like and how they interpret the news.  \n As a way to reflect on the final activity, as well as the ways in which news organizations handle stories about race, we recommend instructors engage with students using the following \nprompts, either in small groups or as individual reflections:  \n\u25cf The Society for Professional Journalists has a code of ethics that all members are expected to adhere to, which includes four key goals: seek truth and report it; minimize harm; act independently; and be accountable and transparent. Look at the headline you just created. Does it reflect these goals? If not, how could you adjust the headline to align with these g oals more closely?  \n \n2 Please note, in the actual challenge, the description of the event was presented below the instructions.  \nR.A. Berry, J.L. Bonnet, & J.E. Rosenbaum  17 \n \n  Teaching Media Quarterly , Vol. 9 , No. 1 , 2021 \u25cf How do you think people of color will respond to your headline? Why? What might they \nlike to see different? How do you think white people will respond to your headline? Why?  \n\u25cf When you consider that reporters have a duty to serve \u201cthe public good,\u201d which \nheadline(s) do this the best? Which did it the least? Why?  \n\u25cf How does the journalistic principle of objectivity align with the notion of \u201cserving the \npublic good\u201d when it comes to stories about race?  \n In a synchronous online or face -to-face setting, these prom pts could be addressed in a class \ndiscussion. We recommend instructors have students return to their groups and discuss these prompts with their groups. Only when the groups have had ample time to consider all three \nquestions, should the instructor have students present their ideas to the class as a whole and \nencourage a discussion about the various opinions.  \n \nIf this activity is carried out online, the instructor can create a shared google doc and ask participants to respond to these prompts and to each other\u2019s comments. The instructor should also aim to interact with the students in this document themselves.  \n  \nSome Concluding Thoughts We conclude Day 5, and the overall challenge, with the following thoughts:  \n \n\u25cf Dig into the content/substance of a story (mov e beyond the surface).  \n\u25cf Be aware of your personal biases and the constructed nature of the news, and how both affect your experience(s) with a story.  \n\u25cf Be a thoughtful consumer (and sharer) of all media, including the media you love.  \n\u25cf Use tools and strategies to combat misinformation, like those on our Fake News and \nMisinformation guide (Fogler Library n.d.). Remember the SIFT Method for evaluating information (Caulfield 2019) (as we learned on Day 2!).  \n\u25cf Consider journalism codes of ethics as guidelines for what  to expect from the stories you \nencounter (as we learned on Day 3!).  \n Teaching Materials \nAll materials remain accessible at http://libguides.library.umaine.edu/newslit\n. \n \nAuthor Biographies  \n R.

Due\nto such openness, these platforms often endure manipulation\nand misinformation - leading to negative impacts. To prevent\nsuch harmful activities, platform moderators employ coun-\ntermeasures to safeguard against actors violating their rules.\nHowever, the correlation between publicly outlined policies\nand employed action is less clear to general people.\nIn this work, we examine violations and subsequent modera-\ntions related to the 2020 U.S. President Election discussion on\nTwitter. We focus on quantifying plausible reasons for the sus-\npension, drawing on Twitter\u2019s rules and policies by identifying\nsuspended users ( Case ) and comparing their activities and\nproperties with (yet) non-suspended ( Control ) users. Using a\ndataset of 240M election-related tweets made by 21M unique\nusers, we observe that Suspended users violate Twitter\u2019s rules\nat a higher rate (statistically signi\ufb01cant) than Control users\nacross all the considered aspects - hate speech, offensiveness,\nspamming, and civic integrity. Moreover, through the lens of\nTwitter\u2019s suspension mechanism, we qualitatively examine the\ntargeted topics for manipulation.\n1 Introduction\nSocial media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit\nhave become vastly popular in public discussion related to\nsocietal, economic, and political issues (Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Jung,\nand Valenzuela 2012). However, in the recent past, these plat-\nforms were heavily targeted for manipulation and spreading\nmisinformation relating to numerous civic issues across the\nworld (Bessi and Ferrara 2016), which is often referred to as\n\u201cComputational Propaganda\u201d (Woolley and Howard 2018).\nIn particular, the coordinated misinformation and in\ufb02uence\ncampaigns of foreign state-sponsored actors during the 2016\nU.S. presidential election were highly scrutinized - which\neventually led to the U.S. Congressional hearings and investi-\ngation by the U.S. Department of Justice (Congress-Hearing\n2017; Mueller-Report 2019).\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\nsocial platforms announced strict and improved platform\nmoderation policy (Facebook-Update 2017; Twitter-Update\n2018). However, these platform\u2019s moderation and suspension\npolicies have been largely debated and have faced severe\ncriticism from the political leaders and supporters about bias\ntowards their opposition (Bias 2016, 2020). Although these\nplatforms publicly outline their moderation policy, there is\nno third-party monitoring of their enacted moderation. More-\nover, social platforms like Twitter and Facebook employ ex-\nCopyright \u00a92021, Association for the Advancement of Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.tensive safeguard mechanisms that consider various aspects\nof user activities (coordinated activities, impersonation, etc.)\nto identify malicious behavior (Twitter-Safety 2021). There-\nfore, analyzing these suspended users\u2019 tweets and shared\ncontent might shed light on violators\u2019 targeted topics.\nIn the context of inadequate countermeasures against ma-\nnipulation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the\n2020 election was of paramount importance for platform op-\nerators to provide a safe and democratized public discussion\nsphere (Twitter-Policy 2021). The impact and importance of\nthese safeguard measures are not con\ufb01ned to this particular\nelection; instead, they bear cardinal implications for future\nonline political discussions exceeding all geopolitical bound-\naries. Therefore, it is requisite to assess these platforms\u2019 mod-\neration policy \u2014 to investigate the correlation between their\npolicies and actions, examine for potential political biases,\nand make general people aware of the targeted malice topics.\nIn this respect, we focus on analyzing the moderation\npolicy of popular micro-blogging site Twitter as a case-study\nby asking the following research questions:\n\u2022RQ1: What factors associate with Twitter account suspen-\nsion following the 2020 U.S. President Election?\n\u2022RQ2: How do political ideologies associate with the sus-\npended accounts?\n\u2022RQ3: What was the topic of discussion among suspended\nusers? What type of content these users shared?\nThis work. To answer these research questions, we collect\na large-scale dataset of 240M tweets made by 21M unique\nusers over eight weeks centering the 2020 U.S. President\nElection. Afterward, we identify 355K suspended users who\nparticipated in this election discussion. We draw upon Twit-\nter\u2019s rules and policies to examine plausible suspension fac-\ntors. To investigate the user activity that might lead to sus-\npension, we adopt the \u201ccase-control\u201d study design from\nepidemiology (Schulz and Grimes 2002). We consider the\nsuspended users as Case group and sample similar number\nof non-suspended users as Control group. We devise sev-\neral classi\ufb01cation techniques to quantify suspension factors\namong these two groups. We infer these users\u2019 political lean-\ning by utilizing the political bias of the news media outlet\nthey share. By employing a language differentiation tech-\nnique, we contrast the conversational topics and shared con-\ntent among Case andControl groups. Through the lens of\nTwitter\u2019s suspension policy, we passively infer the targeted\ntopics by platform violators and identify the online content\nplatforms utilized to sway the discussion.\nSummary \ufb01ndings. We \ufb01nd that across all suspension fac-\ntors, the Suspended users have higher (statistically signi\ufb01-\ncant) violation occurrences. Coherent with prior work, we\n\ufb01nd that Suspended users are short-lived, have fewer follow-\ners, and show more tweeting activity. We observe a higher\npresence of right-leaning users than left-leaning users among\nSuspended users. We \ufb01nd that Suspended users use more\ncurse and derogatory words and personally-attacking and\npropaganda related hashtags. We also notice that these users\nshare news content from heavily biased right-leaning news-\npropaganda sites. We discuss the implications and limitations\nof our work in the Conclusion.\n2 Related Work\nThere have been several works related to Twitter suspension,\nmost of which focused primarily on spam-related suspen-\nsions (Thomas et al. 2011; Amleshwaram et al. 2021). More\nrecently, Le et al. studied suspended users in the context of the\n2016 U.S. presidential election (Le et al. 2019), and Chowd-\nhury et al. examined a large group of suspended users related\nto a large-scale Twitter purge in 2018 (Chowdhury et al.\n2020). We refer readers to (Le et al. 2019; Chowdhury et al.\n2020) for a more comprehensive understanding of suspen-\nsion and moderation on online platforms. However, none of\nthese works quantify speci\ufb01c factors associated with Twitter\nsuspension. Additionally, political discussions and related\nmanipulation on online platforms have been thoroughly stud-\nied previously (Ferrara 2017; Im et al. 2020), mostly related\nto the 2016 U.S.presidential election (Badawy, Ferrara, and\nLerman 2018; Zannettou et al. 2019). These works primarily\nfocus on characterizing malicious users and inferring their\nmotivation and impact. Im et al.; Badawy, Ferrara, and Ler-\nman provide an extensive overview of this line of work (Im\net al. 2020; Badawy, Ferrara, and Lerman 2018). In contrast,\nwe focus on quantifying suspension factors and examining\nmalice topics related to the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n3 Data\nTo collect tweets related to the 2020 U.S. President Election\ndiscussion, we deployed an uninterrupted data collection\nframework utilizing Twitter\u2019s streaming API to \ufb01lter real-\ntime tweets based on given keywords. Similar to prior work\nthat collected speci\ufb01c theme or event-related tweets (Olteanu\net al. 2014), we initialize the keyword set with manually\ncurated election-related words and hashtags. To cover the\ncontinuously evolving election discussions and topics, we\nupdate the keyword set daily with new trending hashtags and\nwords from previous days collection, as employed in (Abu-\nEl-Rub and Mueen 2019; Olteanu et al. 2015). We provide\na list of all the keywords in the supporting website (Website\n2021). Our data collection time-period spans over around\nten weeks, centering the election date - from \u201cSeptember 28,\n2020\u201d to \u201cDecember 04, 2020\u201d. Approximately one month\nafter our data collection ends, on \u201cJanuary 01, 2021\u201d we\nstart probing Twitter for each of the participating users from\nour dataset to identify the suspended users. Twitter returns\nthe response code 63when requested user information\nfor a suspended user. In this process, we identify 355,573\nsuspended users from roughly 21M participating users. We\nprovide a summary descriptive statistics of our dataset in\nTable 1 and plot per user tweet count in Figure 1. We discuss\nthe limitation of our data collection framework in Section 6.\nEthical Concerns.

Hence, the accom-\nmodating academic institution\u2019s Institutional Review Board\nexempted this project after a formal review. Following Twit-\nter\u2019s terms of services guideline: (1) we use the Twitter API\nkey only for passive data collection purposes, (2) we do not\npublish user-speci\ufb01c information, (3) we do not redistribute\nthe data, and (4) we only share aggregated statistics and\nderived information to facilitate future work.\n4 Methods\nRQ1: Inferring Suspension Factors\nTwitter rules and policies. To infer the plausible factors\nthat explain suspension, we draw upon Twitter\u2019s rules, and\npolicies for free and safe public discussion (TwitterRules\n2021). Twitter outlines three speci\ufb01c categories \u2014 (1) safety,\n(2) privacy, (3) authenticity, each of which entails \ufb01ner sub-\ncategories on speci\ufb01c violating activities. We speci\ufb01cally\nfocus on \ufb01ve sub-categories that are more likely to be en-\nacted upon on election discussion: three from safety \u2014 (1)\nhateful conduct, (2) abuse/harassment, (3) terrorism/violent\nextremism; two from authenticity \u2014 (4) spamming, (5) civic\nintegrity. The rest are either not largely relevant (i.e., copy-\nright, nudity) or inferred from our data (i.e., impersonation -\nas we do not have user and tweet information for all the tweet,\nsensitive media content - as we do not crawl media content).\nHateful Conduct and Offensive Behavior. Several recent\nworks aim to identify hateful and abusive activities in online\nplatforms, which produced publicly available datasets and\ntrained models (Founta et al. 2018; Davidson et al. 2017).\nHowever, as the distinction between abusive and violent lan-\nguage is ill-de\ufb01ned, they uni\ufb01ed these categories. Similarly,\nwe combine both abusive and violent tweets into one cate-\ngory - offensive . We utilize an automatic hate speech and\noffensive language detection technique to detect hateful and\noffensive tweet, known as HateSonar (Davidson et al. 2017).\nHateSonar is a logistic regression classi\ufb01er that uses several\ntext features (i.e., TF-IDF of word-grams, sentiment, etc.),\nwhich has been trained on manually labeled tweet corpus. We\nuse a pre-trained HateSonar model to classify each tweet into\nthree categories: (1) hateful, (2) offensive, and (3) normal.\nCivic integrity. Twitter has established strict rules to prevent\nusers from \u201cmanipulating or interfering in elections or other\ncivic processes\u201d, including \u201cposting and sharing misleading\ncontent\u201d (Twitter-Integrity 2021). To infer such violation, we\nutilize the posted hashtags and shared news website URLs.\nWe curate a list of hashtags related to misinformation, pro-\npaganda, and conspiracy theories, borrowing from the work\nby (Ferrara et al. 2020), where they curated a list of conspir-\nacy related hashtags. Additionally, we compile a list of biased\nand propaganda-spreader news websites based on a publicly\navailable dataset from (FactCheck 2021; Politifact 2021). If\na tweet contains a hashtag or news article from our curated\nlist, we consider it a violation of civic integrity policy.\nSpam. Several previous works have identi\ufb01ed spamming on\nTwitter, most of which consider both tweet content and user\nattributes for user-level classi\ufb01cation. Here, we primarily\ninfer spamming violations at tweet-level based on tweet con-\ntent, for which we utilize a collection of spam keywords (Ben-\nevenuto et al. 2010). However, to quantify spammers at the\nuser-level, we also examine several account attributes (i.e.,\naccount age, tweet rate, etc.), which are most prominent for\nspammer detection (Thomas et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2020).\nWe note that the above-de\ufb01ned classi\ufb01cation techniques\nare no match to Twitter\u2019s actual countermeasure mechanism.\nRather, we posit these methods as high-precision approaches\n\u2014 which utilize language models and keyword matching to\navoid false-positives. The detected violations can be regarded\nas the lower-bound for actual ensued violations, only to in-\ncrease with more comprehensive approaches.\nRQ2: Political Ideology of Suspended Users\nWe infer political leaning based on the political bias of the\nshared media outlets in the tweets. Similar to previous work\non studying political ideology on Twitter (Badawy et al.\n2019), we curate a list of \u201cpolitically inclined\u201d media out-\nlets based on publicly available data from (AllSides 2021;\nMediaBias 2021). Additionally, if a user retweets one of the\npresidential candidates without adding a quote, we consider\nit as ideological endorsement (Ferrara et al. 2020).\nRQ3: Conversational topics and shared content\nTwitter employs extensive countermeasure tools that con-\nsider a multitude of factors, features, and algorithms (Twitter-\nMeasures 2018); which is beyond the scope of any third-party\nobserver to reproduce. However, through the lens of Twit-\nter\u2019s suspension policy, we can identify platform violators\u2019\ntargeted topics as a passive sensing mechanism for detecting\nonline malice. Towards that, we contrast the conversational\ntopics of Suspended andControl users. In particular, we\nconsider (1) top uni-grams and bi-grams \u2013 to infer the com-\nmonality of discussion language; (2) hashtags \u2013 which are\nused for signaling and discoverability purposes (Bruns and\nBurgess 2011) and have been instrumental in several politi-\ncal and social movements (Arif, Stewart, and Starbird 2018).\nAdditionally, Twitter is often used as an ampli\ufb01er and \ufb01shing\nplatform to disseminate news and multimedia content. Hence,\nwe also examine the shared URL-domains to examine the\nonline content platforms utilized by platform violators.\nTo examine the uniqueness across these dimensions, we\nuse a generative text modeling method known as Sparse Addi-\ntive Generative Models of Text, or SAGE (Eisenstein, Ahmed,\nand Xing 2011). We use SAGE as a text differentiation tech-\nnique where each class label or latent topic is endowed with a\nmodel of the deviation in log-frequency from a constant back-\nground distribution. We utilize SAGE to identify the highly\nused distinctive word-grams, hashtags, and URL-domains\nacross Suspended andControl user\u2019s tweet corpus.Measure Suspended Control d t KS\nSuspension rule (Safety)\nHateful (%) 0.78 0.43 0.05 77.73*** 0.003***\nOffensive (%) 6.45 5.21 0.05 91.62*** 0.01***\nSuspension rule (Authenticity)\nCivic Integrity (%) 0.40 0.30 0.02 31.46*** 0.001***\nSpam (%) 0.56 0.38 0.03 46.83*** 0.002***\nAccount Properties\nActive days 964.0 1972.9 -0.74 -151.77*** 0.24***\nTweets per Day 33.5 20.82 0.25 50.20*** 0.14***\nFollowers Count 1491.5 3337.2 -0.04 -8.54*** 0.11***\nFriends Count 1112.5 1263.7 -0.03 -6.74*** 0.11***\nPolitical Ideology (% Tweets)\nLeft Leaning 3.97 5.65 -0.08 -137.9*** 0.02***\nRight Leaning 7.25 6.00 0.05 87.21*** 0.01***\nTable 2: Summary of differences in quantitative measures\nacross Suspended andControl users. We report average\noccurrences across matched clusters, effect size (Cohen\u2019s d),\nindependent sample t-statistic, and KS-statistic. p-values are\nreported after Bonferroni correction (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01,\n***p<0.001).\n5 Results\nRQ1: Inferring Suspension Reason\nIn this subsection, we quantify the differences in the sus-\npension rules between Suspended andControl users. We\ncalculate effect size (Cohen\u2019s d) and use independent sample\nt-tests to evaluate statistical signi\ufb01cance in the differences.\nWe perform Koglomorov-Smirnov ( KS) test to test against\nthe null hypothesis that the distribution of suspension rules\nfor the Suspended andControl users are drawn from the\nsame distribution (Saha et al. 2021). We summarize these\ndifferences in Table 2.\nHateful Conduct and Offensive Behavior. Suspended\nusers are twice more likely to post hateful tweets than Control\nusers ( t=77.73, p<0.05). Also, Suspended users post more\noffensive tweet than Control users ( t=91.62, p<0.05). These\n\ufb01ndings are in coherence with Twitter\u2019s suspension policy.\nCivic Integrity and Spam. We \ufb01nd that Suspended users are\nmore likely to use hashtags related to conspiracy theories and\nshare news from media sites with questionable authenticity\n(t=31.46, p<0.05). Also, Suspended users are 50% more\nlikely to post spam-tweets ( t=46.83, p<0.05).\nAccount Properties. We \ufb01nd signi\ufb01cant difference in the\nactive days between Suspended andControl users ( t=-\n151.77, p<0.05). The Control users are, on average, roughly\nthree years older than Suspended users. Contrastingly, these\nshort-lived Suspended users post 50% more tweets compared\ntoControl users ( t=50.20, p<0.05). The Suspended users\nhave less follower count, on average 100% less than Control\nusers ( t=-8.54, p<0.05). However, both Suspended and\nControl users have similar friends count ( t=-6.74, p<0.05).\nThese \ufb01ndings resonate with previous works studying\nspamming and suspension on Twitter (Thomas et al. 2011;\nChowdhury et al. 2020), which identi\ufb01ed that the rules\nviolating users are generally short-lived, posts more tweet,\nand have a smaller follower base.\nRQ2: Political Ideology of Suspended Users\nIn Table 2, we observe 40% higher left-leaning tweets among\nControl users than Suspended users ( t=-137:9,p<0:05). In\nCategory Words\nControltransistion, health care, amy coney barrett,\n\ufb02ynn, senate, sidney powell, absentee, gra-\nham, judge, legal, rigged, mail, ballot, rudy\ngiuliani, fraudulent\nSuspendedtraitor, dumb, communist, biden family, idiot,\nseanhannity, fu*k, liar, stupid, breitbartnews,\nukraine, treason, terrorist, evil, leftist\nTable 3: Highly used \ufb01fteen distinctive words per user-group\nobtained using SAGE.\nCategory Hashtags\nControlpentagon, bigtech, corruptkelly, quidproquo,\ndoj, justicematters, climatechange, \ufb02ipthe-\nsenate, michiganhearing, cnntapes\nSuspendedstevebannon, bidenfamilycorruption, war-\nroompandemic, russia, hunterbidenemails,\nhunterbidenlaptop, democratsarede-\nstroyingamerica, bidencrimesyndicate,\nchinajoe, chinabitchbiden\nTable 4: Highly used ten distinctive hashtags per user-group\nobtained using SAGE.\ncontrast, we observe higher right-leaning tweets among Sus-\npended users than Control users ( t=87:21,p<0:05). Our \ufb01nd-\ning shows that both left-leaning and right-leaning users en-\ngaged in violating Twitter\u2019s rules and policies, with 100%\nhigher presence of right-leaning tweets among Suspended\nusers than Control users.\nRQ3: Conversational topics and shared content\nWord Usage. In Table 3, we present the top 15 most distinc-\ntive words used in per group\u2019s tweet as obtained from the\nSAGE technique. We observe that Control users distinctly\nused words relating to different event-driven election-related\ntopics (i.e., mail, ballot, rigged, fraudulent). However, we ob-\nserve a large presence of swear words (i.e., idiot, dumb) and\nsensitive words (traitor, treason, terrorist) among Suspended\nusers\u2019 unique words, which supports the higher hate-speech\ndetection among suspended users.\nHashtag Usage. Table 4 presents the top 10 most distinc-\ntively used hashtags by Suspended andControl users. Simi-\nlar to word usage, the unique hashtags among Control users\nwere related to speci\ufb01c events (i.e., cnntapes, corruptkelly,\netc) and general election issues (i.e., bigtech, climatechange).\nIn contrast, distinct hashtags from Suspended users were\nmostly related to the defamation of Democratic presiden-\ntial candidate Joe Biden (i.e., bidencrimesyndicate, chinajoe,\nchinabitchbiden) and issues related to his son Hunter Biden\n(i.e., hunterbidenemails, hunterbidenlaptops).\nShared Content. In Table 5, we show the top 10 distinct\nshared domain names per user group. Among the Control\nusers, we observe the presence of few moderately neutral\nnews outlets (i.e., nytimes.com, npr.org), independent\npolitical monitoring organization (i.e., democracydo-\ncekt.com, citizenforethics.org), and few left-leaning news\noutlets (theatlantic.com, motherjones.com). However, amongCategory Domain\nControldemocracydocket.com, buildbackbet-\nter.gov, www.infobae.com, latimes.com,\ntexastribune.com, citizensforethics.org,\ntheatlantic.com, motherjones.com, ny-\ntimes.com, npr.org\nSuspendedusfuturenews.com, trumpsports.org,\ntech\ufb01nguy.com, mostafadahroug.com,\novalof\ufb01ceradio.com, wuestdevelopment.de,\nqueenofsixteens.com, truenewshub.com,\neinnews.com, thefreeliberty.com\nTable 5: Highly shared ten distinctive URL-domain per user-\ngroup obtained using SAGE.\nSuspended users, we notice several heavily right-leaning non-\nmainstream news-propaganda sites (i.e., usfuturenews.com,\novalof\ufb01ceradio.com, trunewshub.com, thefreeliberty.com).\n6 Discussion and Conclusion\nImplications. Our study bears an implication in shedding\nlight on the transparency about Twitter\u2019s content moderation\npolicy. Although we cannot ascertain any quantitative esti-\nmation towards how far or through what means Twitter\u2019s\nrules followed, our study makes insightful \ufb01ndings of the\nstatistically signi\ufb01cant occurrences of hateful, offensive, and\nmisinformative content among the users whose accounts were\nsuspended after a while. These \ufb01ndings support theoretical,\nempirical, and anecdotal evidence about Twitter\u2019s moderation\npolicies (TwitterRules 2021), which had only gained signif-\nicant attention since January 2021 when Twitter suspended\nthe U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account owing to\ninciteful and unrest-provocative content (Trump-Ban 2020).\nLimitations and Future Work. Our Twitter data collection\nhas potential biases as we initialize our seed keywords man-\nually. While investigating plausible suspension reasons, we\nuse simple, interpretable, and high-precision approaches -\nwhich are no match to Twitter\u2019s complex and multi-faceted\nsafeguard mechanisms. We do not infer the exact reason for\nsuspension for individual users; rather, we quantify viola-\ntions at tweet level. Future research can use causal inference\nmethods like matching (Saha and Sharma 2020) to minimize\nconfounds and draw causal claims about why certain ac-\ncounts were suspended. Moreover, we utilize several publicly\navailable datasets that might suffer from biases.\nWe argue to situate our work as an initial step towards\nunderstanding malice, misinformation, and subsequent mod-\neration related to the 2020 U.S. presidential election on online\nplatforms. Our presented insights and the derived information\ncan instigate further in-depth examination. For example, the\nshared news articles\u2019 content can be analyzed to understand\nthe nature of propaganda news. To facilitate such research,\nwe make these news URLs publicly available and other sum-\nmary statistics (Website 2021). Similarly, future works can\ninvestigate the dynamics of propaganda hashtags and news\narticles unique to suspended users to understand their impact\nand in\ufb02uence. Additionally, interactions among suspended\nusers can be explored to identify potential coordination.\nConclusion. In this work, we perform a computational study\nto analyze Twitter\u2019s suspension policy situated in the context\nof the 2020 U.S. presidential election. We facilitate our work\nby collecting large-scale tweet dataset during the election\nperiod and subsequently identifying the suspended users. By\ndesigning a Case-Control experimental study and devising\nhigh-precision classi\ufb01cation approaches, we quantify asso-\nciated factors related to the suspension. Additionally, we ex-\nplore the political ideology and targeted topics of suspended\nusers. We aim to motivate more rigorous and in-depth future\nworks through our presented insights and shared datasets.\nReferences\nAbu-El-Rub, N.; and Mueen, A. 2019.

His campaign rhetoric was florid and \nstrong.  \nOne of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling -back years of disastrous \nregulations unilaterally imposed by our out -of-control bureaucracy.  \nRegulations have grown into a massive, job -killing industry \u2014and the \nregulation industry is one business I will put an end to.  \nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and \nregulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation \ncosts our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces househo ld \nwealth by almost $15,000 dollars.  \nI\u2019ve proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not \ncompelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all \nneedless and job -killing regulations now on the books.1 \n \n       *Rick Rose Distinguished Professor of Law, The University of Tennessee College of \nLaw.

However, \ngeneral promises of regulatory change, as well as other specific \nderegulation proposals and assurances, peppered candidate Trump\u2019s \ncampaign trail missives.6 \nIt often seems that campaign promises f all by the wayside after \ncandidates for elected office are, in fact, elected. Yet, after his election as \nU.S. President, Trump followed through on his deregulatory promises \nwith early executive orders and related initiatives. Business deregulation \nhas occu pied a central role in the Trump Administration\u2019s agenda. For \nthose of us who represent business clients on a regular basis or teach in \nthe business law area, this focus is of particular interest.  \nInformation about the current administration\u2019s business der egulation \ninitiatives is somewhat fragmented and its coverage in the media may be \nbiased or politicized. In general, the administration and others who rely \non simple success metrics present a rosy tale. The story line is easy to \nunderstand: deregulation is  being achieved since there are fewer \nregulations and there is less regulatory cost. These positive reports often \nsound like puffery.  \nResearch reports and related commentary generated by think tanks \nand other research organizations are a promising and less  partisan \n \n 2.

Yet these organizations have \npolitical agendas or policy biases of their own. Part II of this Essay offers \nsummary reports on the recent deregulation publications of some of these \nresearch institutions. Thei r deregulation assessments are decidedly \nmixed, even if not always split simply along political lines. Regulatory \nchange typically creates winners and losers; as a result, deregulatory \nreports often reflect the identity and bias of the reporter.  \nThis Essay  identifies and takes stock of the Trump Administration\u2019s \nderegulatory efforts as they impact business interests, with the thought \nthat even incomplete or biased information may be useful to \ntransactional business lawyering. What of significance has been d one to \ndate? With what articulated policy goals, if any? How may \u2014or how \nshould \u2014the success of the administration\u2019s business deregulatory plans \nand programs be judged? What observations can be made about those \nsuccesses? For example, who may win and lose in  the revised regulatory \nframework that may emerge? The Essay approaches these questions \nfrom a transactional business law perspective and offers related \nobservations.

These include both informal and formal means.

These include the \npresidential power to veto, make treaties, seek opinions from federal \nofficials, com ment on the state of the union, and participate in ensuring \nfaithful legal compliance.11 The Trump A dministration has employed \nthese tools in forwarding the business deregulatory program heralded by \nthe Trump presidential campaign.  \nFor example, candidate Tr ump vowed to take immediate action on \nderegulation as president, promising in one speech , \u201cUpon taking office, \nI will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. \u201d12 He \nkept this campaign promise by signing an Executive Order on Reducing \nRegulati on and Controlling Regulatory Costs in January 2017.13 In \nprincipal part, the order requires the elimination of two existing \nregulations for each new regulation adopted and mandates that \u201cthe total \nincremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed  regulations, \nto be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero.\u201d14 Following on \nthat initial executive order, in early February 2017, the Office of \nManagement and Budget\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \npublished a related guidance memo randum.15 An additional \nmemorandum was issued in April 2017.16 In February 2017, the \n \n 9.

Specifically, \nderegulatory success relates to the extent to which the desired outcomes \nof the deregulation have been achieved. Thus, under these metrics, \nsuccess is somewhat in the eye of the beholder; each observer has a \nperspective founded on its core policy mission that is reflected in its \nchoice of a success metric and mode of assessment.  \nYet, the impacts of business deregulation can be evaluated in several \nvalue -neutral ways. For example, one might ask whether the \nderegula tion results in positive changes in the regulated businesses and \nwhether these actual substantive deregulatory benefits exceed the \nattendant costs \u2014including specifically, transition costs and costs \nassociated with a loss of public trust. In this part of th e Essay, I reflect \nbriefly on these cost -benefit questions.  \nThose who favor deregulation for substantive operational reasons \n(including, in the business realm, to decrease the costs associated with \nmanufacturing or distributing goods or providing services)  may assume \nthat their deregulatory program always actually results in the expected \nsalutary effects. Yet, regulation may persist in the wake of deregulation, \nincluding at the firm level. There are a number of reasons for this.  \nFirm -level regulatory person nel may resist the return to a less \nregulated operational state. \u201cThe increased hordes of in -house regulators \nwill \u2018not go gentl[y] into that good night.\u2019 That is, they will attempt to \nfortify their influence within the firm regardless of deregulation  . . . . [I]n -\nhouse regulators have their own incentives and want to keep their jobs \neven in a deregulatory environment.\u201d119 \nMoreover, regulation that decreases the cost of production in the short \nterm may result in long -term harms in the form of increased litiga tion \nrisk or other losses. One observer notes the long -term effects of \nderegulating an aspect of building construction:  \nA few years back, California\u2019s then governor, Arnold Schwar tzenegger \n[sic], signed a bill easing fire prevention regulation during \nconst ruction of buildings that resulted in short -term savings for some \nbuilders.

Deregulation is especially prevalent, and it interacts \nin some cases in complex ways with increased regulation (for example, \nthrough the increase in tariffs and other international trade barriers an d \nrestrictions).132 These regulatory adjustments both reify and complicate \nthe business transactional lawyer\u2019s role: the lawyer is both essential and \nchallenged.  \nThe difficulty of the advisory context is exacerbated by an unclear \noverall reg ulatory/deregulat ory plan. The p resident\u2019s decisions on \nderegulation appear to be made individually and discretely. They are not \nexpressly connected to other applicable regulatory questions and systems \nor a uniform policy objective. The resultant uncertainty and \nunpredicta bility combine to put stress on the task of netting out \ntransaction costs and benefits. If legal counsel cannot accurately or \ncompletely assess the effects of applicable deregulation, parties may \nforego efficient transactions or enter into inefficient tran sactions. This \nadvisory environment puts the transactional business lawyer at risk for \nreputational harm and, in exceptional cases, malpractice claims.  \nProfessor Steven Schwarcz expanded on Professor Gilson\u2019s theory by \nidentifying specific ways in which tr ansactional business lawyers are \ncentral to transaction cost engineering.133 One of Professor Schwarcz\u2019s \ncontributions is of particular importance in a deregulatory environment: \nthe lawyer\u2019s role in identifying, assessing, factoring in, and minimizing \nlitiga tion risk.134 Litigation risk is a moving target when regulatory \nsystems are in transition. This observation does not change the lawyer\u2019s \nrole, but it does make it more difficult.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nThe Trump Administration has followed through on candidate \nTrump \u2019s promises to deregulate by using the informal and formal powers \nof the presidency to effectuate and catalyze specific deregulatory \ninitiatives. Reform projects are being undertaken. Both the Trump \nAdministration and interested third -party observers have begun to \nassess early successes. These commentators may, however, be missing \n \n 132. See supra  notes 35 & 36 and accompanying text.  \n 133. See Steven L. Schwarcz, Explaining the Value of Transactional Lawyering , 12 \nSTAN.

Both have an opportunity to evaluate and respond. Business \nclients may incur or anticipate short -term or long -term costs that can be \navoided or minimized with focused preparation or action. These clients \nwill, no doubt, need lawyers (including business transactional lawyers) \nto help ensure that they avoid or minimize these costs in operating and \ntransact ing. \nObservations made in this Essay may ultimately affect assessments of \nthe success of the Trump deregulation project, at least through the lens \nof the business transactional lawyer. On the positive side, transactional \nbusiness lawyers likely are getting  and will continue to get new business \nand generate fees from the regulatory changes. Clients who are repeat \nplayers in affected transactions will need new advice. To be competent to \ngive that advice, their lawyers will need to review, interpret, and proce ss \nthe application of the new rules resulting from the deregulatory \nmodifications. Those lawyers may then be in a position to suggest \nadjustments to business operations and create new contracts, forms, and \nother operating tools and market them to existing or new clients. \nSimilarly, a transactional business lawyer can use her knowledge of the \nderegulatory environment to promote new or different transactions to \npast, current, or new clients. In addition, transactional business lawyers \nmay be involved in compl iance enforcement actions under the new \nregulatory regime.  \nOn the negative side, uncertainty and unpredictability are likely to \nplague both the business client and transactional business counsel. The \nnature and trajectory of deregulation may be unclear. Mo reover, \noffsetting increases in regulation may complicate the lawyer\u2019s applied \nlegal analysis of transaction costs and regulatory and litigation risk in \nthe new and expected deregulation environments. Evaluations of \nderegulatory success should take these c osts and risks into account.  \nIn any event, as the Trump deregulatory experiment proceeds, \ntransactional business lawyers and their clients may sometimes find \nthemselves on the regulatory version of Mr. Toad\u2019s Wild Ride \u2014an \nuncertain and unpredictable excurs ion through uncharted and \nunfamiliar territory. Managing the adventure successfully will involve \nperseverance as well as competence and diligence. The road may be \nbumpy and the lawyer and client may end up off -roading at times. But, \nas with other significa nt changes that impact transactional business \nlawyering, deregulation in the Trump era is bound to provide healthy \n (HEMINWAY DO NOT DELETE ) 4/1/2019   2:02  PM \n614 MERCER  LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70 \nchallenges to transactional lawyering heuristics.

We \ncomplement this literature by examining the potential of strategic communication as  a \nreputational and regulatory strategy. Based on a reputational approach to public agencies, we \nassume agencies to strategically diversify between proactively or reactively engaging with \npublic concerns raised by their audiences, depending on whether a co re or evolving \ncompetency is at stake. We test these assumptions empirically by examining frame alignment \nbetween formal communication of the European Central Bank (ECB) and public concerns \nraised by ECB audiences.  Our analysis yields two key findings. Fi rst, our findings indicate \nexternal frame alignment signaling a strategic reactive strategy by the ECB to diversify its \ntiming in responding to concerns raised by its audiences. Second, we find a pattern of internal \nframe alignment between the ECB\u201fs core c ompetencies and evolving competencies, \nindicating strategic linkage of attention to various competencies. Our study demonstrates how \nanalyzing an agency\u201fs formal communication in tandem with public concerns of its audiences \nvia machine learning techniques can significantly improve our understanding of agency \nresponsiveness and yields significant insights into the democratic legitimacy of regulatory \nagencies.  \n \nKey words: Organizational reputation; Agency responsiveness; Machine learning techniques  \nPublic co mmunication; Central banking  \n \n  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n4 \n Introduction  \nA recently emerging literature points to the importance of strategic communication as an \nimportant instrument for regulatory agencies to foster their reputation and contribute to \neffective regulatory governance (Moshe 2020). Illustrative in this regard is the instrument of \nforward guidance in central banking. Forward guidance is a type of central bank \ncommunication about the likely path of future monetary policy and helps manage public \nexpectations. In the words of a central banker: \u201cAppropriately employed, forward guidance \ncan help the public to form more accurate expectations about the future path of monetary \npolicy and thus help promote stability in financial markets and the economy\u201d (Plosser 2013, \n2). Forward guidance is a form of strategic communication and can also be a powerful \nregulatory instrument when applied by a credible central bank (Morgan and Sheehan 2014). \nIndeed, recent studies show that what  a central bank communicates is important to protect \nand advance its reputation of credibility and independence, and hence its capability of \neffectively implementing monetary policy (Blinder et al 2008; Gilad et al 2015; Moschella \nand Pinto 2018).  \nThe exa mple of forward guidance illustrates the potential of strategic communication \nas a reputational and regulatory strategy (Carpenter 2010; Coenen et al 2017; Gilad et al \n2015). That is, it shows how communication can be employed by regulatory agencies as bot h \na strategy to advance their reputation and as a regulatory instrument to enforce compliance or \nguide market behavior. We add to the literature on bureaucratic reputation and the role of \nstrategic communication by explaining and assessing how patterns of strategic \ncommunication evolve over time in response to public concerns raised by the audiences of \npublic agencies. Examining both public agency communication and public concerns raised by \nagency audiences helps unravel the strategic nature of agency commu nication.  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n5 \n We contribute to the literature in two important ways. First, we advance theoretical \nexpectations regarding strategic communication as a regulatory and reputational strategy. A \nreputational account of public agencies assumes that they strategica lly communicate and \nengage with their manifold audience to advance or protect their reputation for distinct \ncompetencies. We advance a reputational account of agency communication by further \ntheorizing how and when such communication patterns are likely to  differ. We assume an \nagency to communicate more reactively or remain silent when its core competencies - \ncompetencies mandated to a public agency that provide it with a distinctive functional profile \n- are at stake (Reactive Agency Hypothesis). In contras t, we expect agencies to adopt a more \nproactive communication strategy when an evolving competency - competencies an agency is \nmandated to further develop or prefers to advance in addition to its core mandated tasks \u2013 is \nat stake (Proactive Agency Hypothes is).   \nOur second contribution is a novel methodology for assessing the strategic nature of \nagency communication by employing a longitudinal quantitative automated text analysis that \nincorporates both formal communication of a regulatory agency (i.e., stat ements, policy \ndocuments, and information an agency has officially published) and the public concerns \nraised by its audiences via media attention. Our method enables us to explicitly test the \ninteractive pattern of agency responses vis -a-vis public concern s raised by its audiences over \ntime. It thereby allows us to more directly assess its potential as a reputational and as a \nregulatory strategy. In doing so, we build on recent contributions that adopt similar \napproaches to study agency reputation (Anastaso polous and Whitford 2018, Busuioc and \nRimkute 2019; Moschella and Pinto 2018; Strauss and Vliegenthart 2017) but advance this \nnew approach in an important way by theoretically and empirically incorporating both agency \ncommunication and public concerns. So,  we fully take into account the interactive nature of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n6 \n organizational reputation, a process that essentially unfolds via back -and-forth \ncommunication between public agencies and their audiences.  \nWe proceed as follows. We first develop theoretical assumption s addressing the \nquestion of how reputational concerns explain patterns of strategic communication by \nregulatory agencies. We subsequently test our hypotheses based on a longitudinal study of \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) communication and public concerns ra ised by its manifold \naudience via media coverage during the full life span of the ECB. In doing so, we \noperationalize strategic communication as frames reflecting distinct ECB competencies in \nECB formal communication and via media attention.  \nOur analysis yields two key observations. First, we find that the ECB mainly \ncommunicates in a reactive way, but with varying intervals between the specific concerns \nraised by their audiences and its own response. It responds to media attention regarding \nevolving compe tencies and unusual measures quicker than to media attention regarding core \ncompetencies.  This pattern seems to signal a strategic response as the literature on regulatory \ncommunication suggests (Gilad et al 2013; Maor 2020; Rimkute 2019).  Second, we fin d a \npattern of internal frame alignment in ECB communication, i.e., attention to evolving \ncompetencies and unusual measures in times of crises often co -occurs with attention to its \ncore competency in monetary policy. This pattern of internal frame alignmen t seems to \nindicate strategic issue linkage, i.e., strategically linking attention to new and evolving \ncompetencies to established competencies. Such issue -linkage is in line with studies on \nstrategic framing and communication on central banking (Cross and  Greene 2019; Johnson et \nal 2020; Princen and Van Esch 2016), on evolving reputations and the importance of strategic \ncommunication more generally (Busuioc and Rimkute 2019; Maor 2020) as well as on the \nimportance of narratives as a strategy of institution al layering (Streeck and Thelen 2005; \nJohnson et al 2018; Shiller 2017). Overall, our findings yield important insights into agency Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n7 \n responsiveness to public concerns raised by their audiences and have important implications \nfor the democratic legitimacy of  regulatory agencies.  \n \nStrategic communication as linking pin between regulatory competencies and \nreputation  \nA recently emerging literature demonstrates that strategic communication constitutes an \nimportant strategy for regulatory agencies to advance their reputation and by doing so could \nserve as a regulatory strategy as well (Maor 2020; Gilad et al 2015; Rimkute 2019). A well -\nchosen communication strategy helps agencies signal their competencies, craft its reputation \nas a credible and highly reputabl e regulator and thereby influence market and citizen \nbehavior (and more specifically facilitate regulatory compliance). How strategic \ncommunication helps advancing a bureaucratic reputation and signaling regulatory \ncompetency is a complex mechanism involvi ng a close relationship between regulatory \ncompetencies and bureaucratic reputation and how communication can foster this \nrelationship.   \nFirst, the starting point for considering strategic communication as a reputational and \nregulatory strategy concerns a ctual regulatory competencies. Some conceptualize such \ncompetencies as general dimensions or features of a regulatory agency and distinguish \nbetween performative, technical or professional, legal -procedural and moral reputational \ndimensions, emphasizing di stinct features of regulatory agencies (Carpenter, 2010; Overman \net al 2020). Others apply a narrower focus by conceiving regulatory competencies mostly as \nfunctional areas, focusing instead on what agencies are capable of, rather than the more \ngeneral fea tures of an agency (Gilad, et. al 2015; Maor et. al 2013).   Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n8 \n We conceive of regulatory competencies as functional competencies, largely in line with \nthe literature on organizational competences, in which functional competencies are defined as \na set of capa bilities or traits of an organization geared towards a distinctive functional profile. \nSuch a distinctive functional profile has been argued to help firms obtaining a competitive \nadvantage in a market (Williamson 1999). Applied to public organizations, suc h a functional \nconceptualization of organizational competencies indicates the (perceived) capability of a \npublic organization to address particular tasks (Andrews et al 2016). As such, organizational \ncapabilities refer to a strategic management process by which the organizational leadership is \ncapable of marshalling and channeling adequate resources to address certain organizational \ntasks (Andrews et al 2016; Beck et al 2014, 443).  \nAn agency\u201fs leadership will consider some regulatory competencies as more i mportant \nfor its agency\u201fs performance and reputation than others. In the context of our analysis of \nregulatory agencies, the distinction between core and evolving competencies is relevant. We \nconceive of core competencies as competencies \u2013 tasks and activi ties \u2013 that have formally \nbeen delegated to the agency and render it an organizational entity with distinctive \nresponsibilities. Evolving competencies are those tasks and activities an agency prefers to be \nattributed with within its current legal mandate o r prefers to obtain to widen its mandate and \nexpand its functional scope.  \nAlthough the literature on organizational competencies and capabilities emphasizes \nfunctionally distinctive traits of an organization, it also signals the perceptional nature of \norganizational competencies by emphasizing how such functional capabilities are determined \nby a judgement of an organization\u201fs multiple audiences (Andrews et al 2016, 244). This \nimplies that the conceptualizations of organizational competencies and capabiliti es are \nclosely related to a reputational account of public organizations, given their emphasis on \nperceived performance by an organization\u201fs audiences (Overman et al 2020). So, regulatory Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n9 \n competencies and organizational, or more specifically, bureaucratic reputation are closely \nassociated and share a perceptional nature given the importance of audience assessment in the \nconceptualization of both aspects in the literature.  \nThis brings us to the second element of our argument on how strategic communication \nconstitutes both a reputational and regulatory strategy, namely the importance of bureaucratic \nreputation. Bureaucratic reputation is considered as a valuable organizational asset in the \nbureaucratic politics literature. It is often conceptualized in line w ith Carpenter\u201fs definition: \n\u201ca set of beliefs about the unique and separable capacities, roles and obligations of an \norganization, where these beliefs are embedded in audience networks.\u201d (Carpenter 2010: 45; \nCarpenter and Krause 2012: 26). Bureaucratic rep utation is seen as crucial for many aspects \nof agency performance, including the level of agency output (Maor and Sulitzeanu -Kenan \n2016), the quality of the policy information agencies provide (Krause and Douglas 2005), \nhow they assess risks (Rimkut\u0117 2017) , how they make decisions (Maor and Sulitzeanu -Kenan \n2013), or how they allocate their attention to multiple tasks (Gilad 2016). Reputation has also \nbeen demonstrated to influence agency responsiveness to external pressures from interest \ngroups (Arras and Braun 2017; Carpenter 2002, 2004), to public pressure exerted via the \nmedia (Carpenter 2002; Gilad et al 2015; Maor et al 2013), or the public warnings they \npublish (Maor 2011). Even more fundamentally, bureaucratic reputation has been argued to \ndetermine the autonomy of agencies altogether, as Carpenter noted: \u201cthe key prerequisite for \nbureaucratic autonomy is bureaucratic reputation\u201d (2001: 17).   \nGiven its perceptional nature, it follows that bureaucratic reputation is essentially crafted \nvia communicati on (Maor 2020) and engagement with its manifold audience, including \npolitical -administrative principals, regulatees, organized interests, citizens and the media \n(Carpenter and Krause 2012; Overman et al 2020). By implication, regulatory agencies are \nlikely  to respond differently to the multiple concerns raised by their audiences. Maor et al. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n10 \n (2013), for instance, demonstrate that agencies are inclined to keep silent in areas where they \nenjoy a strong reputation, and in areas that do not constitute the core competencies of the \nagency (cf. Rimkute 2019). Furthermore, they show that regulators are inclined to respond to \ncriticisms targeted at core functions for which their reputation is weak, or still evolving. In \ngeneral, agencies are demonstrated to have an o verall disposition to respond when media \ncoverage is very intense or contains negative opinions (Maor et al, 2013: 582). Gilad et al. \n(2015) demonstrate that agencies respond differently to various types of public allegations, \ndepending on the relative thr eat to their reputations.  \nGenerally, many studies of strategic communication as a reputational strategy show \nthat bureaucratic agencies often adopt a reactive communication strategy. That is, they \nstrategically choose to respond or remain silent after its  manifold audience has raised public \nconcerns about their performance, usually via the media (Maor et al 2013; Gilad et al 2015; \nRimkute 2019). In other cases, the entrepreneurial assumption underlying a reputational \napproach to public agencies, assumes, i f not implicitly, more proactive strategic behavior vis -\n\u00e0-vis stakeholders (McCubbins, Noll and Weingast 1989; Carpenter and Krause 2015; Wood \n2017). This entrepreneurial assumption implies that an agency emphasizes certain functional \nareas before  its audi ences raise concerns regarding such functional areas. Maor (2011), for \ninstance, argues that proactive public signaling might be necessary for agencies to maintain a \ncertain reputation.  Hence, agencies are expected to not only adopt a reactive strategy to  \nadvance or protect their reputation but are also likely to adopt a proactive communication \nstrategy. The latter refers to a strategy to either preempt concerns or emphasize certain \ncompetencies in advance of concerns raised by their audiences. Communicati on strategies are \nthus considered a fundamental part of crafting a bureaucratic reputation based on a portfolio \nof regulatory competencies and agency preferences to hide, foster or advance these individual \ncompetencies.  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n11 \n  \nStrategic communication as a reput ational and regulatory strategy  \nStrategic communication as a reputational and regulatory strategy essentially assumes that by \ncarefully crafting regulatory competence, a regulatory agency can foster and advance positive \nperceptions of such regulatory compe tencies and hence its reputation by its manifold \naudience via strategic communication. The perceptional nature of both competencies and \norganizational reputation implies that strategic communication cannot only serve a \nreputational strategy but a regulator y strategy as well. A reputation as a capable regulator will \nhelp facilitate regulatory compliance and influence market and citizen behavior more \ngenerally.   \nMore specifically, when considering strategic communication as a reputational and \nregulatory stra tegy, it follows that agencies use communication to protect or advance their \nreputation by emphasizing core competencies or preferences for evolving competencies, and \nthat they will do so via a differentiated communication strategy.  We assume that agencie s \nvary between reactive and proactive communication strategies depending on the type of \ncompetencies at stake. Agencies are more likely to employ a reactive communication strategy \nor remain silent when it concerns their core competencies for which they enj oy a strong \nreputation, or which they need to protect in order to remain being perceived as capable and \ncredible of fulfilling these tasks.  In addition, we expect that agencies are more likely to adopt \na proactive communication strategy when aiming to adv ance evolving competencies. These \nconsiderations result in the following concrete hypotheses.  \nH 1: Agencies are likely to adopt a reactive communication strategy regarding core \ncompetencies (Reactive agency hypothesis)  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n12 \n H 2:  Agencies are likely to adopt a  proactive communication strategy concerning \nevolving competencies (Proactive agency hypothesis).  \n \nResearch design  \nCase selection  \nWe test our research assumptions regarding strategic communication as a reputational and \nregulatory strategy with a case study of central bank communication. Central bank \ncommunication has both a reputational and regulatory component. Central banks a) \ncomm unicate about objectives and strategy, b) explain policy decisions, c) provide an \noverview of the economic outlook and d) signal future policy decisions (Blinders et al 2008). \nBeyond these policy goals they also communicate about financial stability, objec tives, and \nmacroprudential supervision (Cross and Greene 2019; Born et al 2012; 2014, Masciandaro \nand Romelli 2017). Central bank communication has been demonstrated to affect monetary \npolicy and financial market stability (Blinder et al 2008; Hansen et al  2019; Beaupain and \nGirard 2020) and is particularly effective in doing so during periods of unconventional \npolicy, exemplified by the instrument of forward guidance (Armelius et al 2020; Cieslak and \nSchrimpf 2019). At the same time, the potential of effec tively employing strategic \ncommunication as a regulatory instrument hinges on a central bank\u201fs credibility, and thus a \ncentral bank\u201fs reputation (cf. Moschella and Pinto 2018; Gilad et al 2015; Moar et al 2013). \nCentral bank communication therefore constit utes a likely case of strategic communication as \na reputational and regulatory strategy.  \n We further selected the European Central Bank to examine central bank \ncommunication. Compared to other central banks, the ECB has equivalent competencies in Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n13 \n terms of  monetary policy, albeit with a narrowly defined mandate mostly modelled on the \nGerman Bundesbank mandate (Bodea and Hicks 2015; Dietsch 2020; Fernandez -Albertos \n2015; Goodhart 2010). Yet, it is unique in being a pan -European central bank with a specific \norganizational and legal structure to balance both representation and expertise, signaling its \ndistinct multi -level and hence more politicized nature than some national central banks (Clark \n2015; Moschella and Diodati 2020; Van Esch and De Jong 2017). At th e same time, \ncomparative studies on central bank communication demonstrate equivalent importance of \ncommunication as policy and strategic instruments across different central banks, including \nthe ECB (Armelius et al 2020; Bron et al 2012, 2914; Cieslak and  Schrimpf 2019).  We will \ndiscuss the implications of our case selection for the external validity of our findings in the \ndiscussion and conclusion section.  \nTo examine ECB strategic communication as a reputational and regulatory strategy, \nwe examine ECB f ormal communication (in line with previous studies of central bank and \nregulatory agency communication; cf. Gilad 2015; Busuioc and Rimkute 2019). ECB\u201fs \nformal communication has been demonstrated to convey its policy agenda and priorities \n(Cross and Green 2019; Johnson et al 2018). By examining its formal communication, we are \nable to uncover how and when it emphasizes its core and evolving competencies. \nImportantly, to assess whether the ECB does so in response to, or in advance of, concerns \nraised by its audiences we additionally examine public concerns raised by ECB audiences via \nthe media. We assume the media to be a crucial venue for assessing how public agencies \nrespond to their audiences. More concretely, in  line with B\u00f6rang and Naurin (2015), we \nassume that agencies are attentive to political, policy and regulatory issues raised in public by \na variety of stakeholders and that these issues emerge as cumulative patterns of attention in \nthe media. This is in line with what Maor (2020, 2) concluded based on a meta -analysis of \npublic agency communication: \u201c [A]s an indispensable part of modern democratic life, the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n14 \n mass media plays a key role in channeling, and sometimes even structuring, interactions \nbetween agencies and audiences.\u201d  \n \nCase expectations  \nIn line with our theoretical framework on strategic communication, we expect the ECB to \ncommunicate in different ways about its core and evolving regulatory competences. Based on \na secondary document analysis of academic studies covering both the history and fu nctioning \nof the ECB in general, and ECB communication and transparency more specifically, we \nidentified three distinct competences that the ECB can be expected to actively promote and \ndefend.1  \nFirst, in line with the reactive agency hypothesis, a core co mpetenc y for the ECB is its \nrole in monetary policy, with an emphasis on setting short -term interest rates to achieve long \nterm, stable price levels. To uncover an emphasis on its core competency, we identified the \nterms \u201einterest rates\u201f, \u201eprice stability\u201f  and \u201emacro -economic outlook\u201f as key issues signaling \nECB\u201fs core competency . In the early stages of its lifespan, we expect the ECB to \ncommunicate more proactively regarding its core competence to establish a strong reputation \n\u2013 after all, the central bank  still needs to develop a reputation for these core competencies in \nthe early years. Afterwards, we expect the ECB to adopt a reactive communication strategy \nregarding monetary policy and price stability . The reasoning here is that after the bank has \nestab lished a reputation for core competencies, it needs to maintain this reputation vis -\u00e0-vis \nits audiences and will likely only react to challenges coming from these audiences.  \n                                                           \n1 studies that were consulted for t his assessment: Bodea and Hicks 2015; Vourlouris 2012, Fernandez -Albertos \n2015; Curtin 2017, Cour\u00e9 2017, Goodhart 2010; Fromage and Ibrido 2018, McPhilemy and Moschella 2019; \nOrphanides 2018, Weismann 2018, Blinder et al 2008, Cukierman et al 1992; Johnson  et al 2018; \u201et Klooster \nand Fontan 2019.  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n15 \n Second, in line with the proactive agency hypothesis on evolving competences, the \nliterature describes two additional relevant functional areas of central banking. Given the \nincreasing focus of the ECB\u201fs role to take on additional supervisory functions in addition to \nits main price stability and monetary policy functions, we identified the terms \u201emacro -\nprudential reform\u201f, \u201esupervisory board\u201f, \u201ebanking union\u201f as key terms indicating expanding \ncompetencies  as financial market supervisor. These competences can be called \u201eexpanding\u201f, \nsince the ECB is aiming to be able to implement these meas ures on a permanent basis, not \njust in times of crises. As the reputation for these competences is not developed yet, we \nexpect the ECB to adopt a proactive communication strategy regarding its potential role as \nfinancial market supervisor.  \nAnother set of competences relates to the very nature of central banking: operating in \nan environment of uncertainty and needing to address this uncertainty directly (Krause 2003). \nCentral banks operate in a complex environment characterized by political pressures, the \nchanging nature of the economy and key economic indicators that are sometimes difficult to \nmeasure and assess (Greenspan 2004). Coping with such uncertainty represents a core \ndilemma for a central bank: the effect of their communication depends on the predi ctability of \nthe signal. All things being equal, levels of economic and policy uncertainty will affect a \ncentral bank\u201fs communication and its proactive or reactive nature. We therefore expect a \ndistinct pattern of engagement with media attention to ECB cri sis management competencies, \nwhich constitute a separate set of competencies that is very typical for central banking and \nrelate to unusual measures . Based on the secondary document analysis, we therefore included \n\u201enon-conventional measures\u201f, \u201equantitative easing\u201f, \u201equalitative easing\u201f, \u201easset purchase \nprograms\u201f as terms indicating attention to unusual measures  in the wake of financial, \neconomic and e uro crises. Given the need to calm down the markets in times of crises, we Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n16 \n expect the ECB to pursue a proactive communication pattern regarding these unusual \nmeasures.   \n \nData collection and measurement  \nWe use quantitative text analysis to examine ECB forma l communication and media attention \nto the concerns raised by its audiences respectively, in line with recent studies adopting a \nquantitative, machine -learning approach to the study of organizational reputation \n(Anastasopolous and Whitford 2018; Busuioc an d Rimkute 2019; Moschella and Pinto 2018). \nMore specifically, we measure how the ECB addresses its competencies in its formal \ncommunication and concerns of its audiences via media attention by the occurrence of \nframes. We define frames as \u201eselected and hig hlighted features of reality\u201f (cf. Druckman \n1993, 91) , thereby following an approach common in the literature on stakeholder \nengagement and agenda -setting (B\u00f6rang et al 2014; De Bruycker 2017).  For the pur pose of \nour study, we operationalize frames as attention to particular regulatory competences. For the \npurposes of our analyses, we distinguish three frames:  1) ECB core frame  signaling core \ncompetencies in the area of monetary policy and price stability,  2) ECB expansion frame , \nindicating evolving competencies in the area of financial market supervision and 3) ECB \nunusual measures frame  signaling crisis interventions. Frames can be studied in several ways, \nranging from a word -based quantitative text analy sis, a manual or computer -assisted content \nanalysis approach, and via interviews to examine the amount of attention to distinct issues. \nWhile each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, they tend to yield equivalent \nframes (B\u00f6rang et al 2014). Fr ames are then measured as particular word -combinations \nconveying a certain competency. As such, our approach is in line with the established \u201ebag of \nwords\u201f approach, which treats words as independent observations (i.e., the order of words Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n17 \n does not matter f or our analysis) and clusters of words indicating frames or arguments \n(Kl\u00fcver and Mahoney 2015; Kl\u00fcver and Sagarzazu 2016; Quinn et al 2010).  \nBased on the nature of the two datasets that are used (formal ECB communication and \nnewspaper articles covering t he ECB, see below for further details), we adopt a unique \napproach that uses unsupervised topic models to construct frame dictionaries for the three \ncompetence frames in question (i.e., core, expansion, and unusual measures frames). Using \nthese dictionarie s, we measure how frequently the three frames appear in each document in \nour two databases (more information follows in the paragraphs below). The resulting frame -\noccurrence -per-document data is then used for a time series analysis that lets us test the \nchronological sequence of frame use between the ECB and the media.  \n \nData collection  \nThe data that is employed to test our hypotheses consists of two text corpora. The first text \ncorpus (\u201cNews dataset\u201d) is constructed to examine collective patterns of attention by \nstakeholders via news media. For the News dataset, we collected newspaper ar ticles in 3 \nmajor newspaper outlets reporting extensively on European Affairs (\u201cFinancial Times\u201d, \u201cThe \nGuardian\u201d, \u201cThe Wallstreet Journal\u201d) that were published between January 1997 until the \ntime of collection of the articles (June 2018), covering the full  life span of the ECB. The \nnewspaper outlets were selected both based on a search of which newspapers report most \nextensively on the ECB, but also based on the size of the readership and editorial bias of the \nreported content: While the \u201cFinancial Times\u201d i s generally perceived as a center -oriented \nnewspaper, \u201cThe Guardian\u201d and \u201cThe Wallstreet Journal\u201d tend to have a center -left and \ncenter -right bias respectively.2 By selecting major international newspapers, we ensured a \n                                                           \n2 While measurement of media bias is difficult and usually subjective, media -bias ratings can be retrieved from \nwebsites such as mediabiasfactcheck.com.  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n18 \n high coverage of ECB related issues and a focus on collective issue attention by the main \nstakeholders.3 We hand coded a subset of 100 randomly selected articles to verify that they \nindeed referred to actions by or opinions about the ECB. 94% of the articles fulfilled such \ncriteria, indicating a robust sampling strategy. After deletion of duplicates, the dat aset \ncontains 5546 newspaper articles. To capture only articles that on the one hand report \nspecifically about the ECB, but on the other hand capture the broadest possible set of topics, \nwe selected all articles that mention the words \u201cECB\u201d or \u201cEuropean Ce ntral Bank\u201d in the \ntitle. Furthermore, each article relates to European Union countries.4 After deletion of \nduplicates, the dataset contains 5546 newspaper articles.  \nThe second text corpus, (\u201cECB database\u201d) is constructed to examine ECB attention to \nits competencies over time for which we used all formal communication issued by the ECB \nduring its entire life span until June 2018. To construct the ECB database, all available formal \ncommunication was scraped from the ECB\u201fs website. After deleting duplicates,  short \nstatements, and publications in a language other than English, the ECB database contains \n4139 publications, including press releases, press conferences, speeches, and interviews. Our \nusage of formal communication channels of the ECB to examine issue  attention is in line \nwith existing research on ECB communication (Van Esch and De Jong 2017; Coenen et al \n2017). Figure 1 depicts the composition of both datasets based on the individual sources \n(different types of ECB communication channels and different  news media outlets \nrespectively).  \n                                                           \n3 We used the Google Natural Language Processing API on the Google Cloud Platform to detect entities in the \ntext and hand coded stakeholders that appear in more than 1% of the media articles by assigning them to \ndifferent stakeholder categories. The coverag e of collective issue attention during the entire period includes both \nmentions and statements of private banks (roughly 20 -25 percent) , national central banks (roughly 25 -30 \npercent), international organizations (5 -10 percent), EU institutions (10 -15 per cent) apart from ECB mentions \nand quotes (25 -30 percent) as well.  As such, our analysis of media attention speaks to the concept of external \naudience and collective issue attention given the appearance of the multiple stakeholders together constituting \nthe ECB\u201fs manifold audience.   \n4 We excluded articles about Cricket, as ECB is also the abbreviation for \u201cEngland and Wales Cricket Board\u201d.  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n19 \n  \n< FIGURE 1a HERE >  \n< FIGURE 1b HERE >  \n \nMeasurement of frames  \nOur strategy was to construct well -informed dictionaries that are based on topic models \ngenerated on the ECB corpus. We subsequently used the average word oc currence (in % of \noverall words) per month in both text corpora as input data for a time series analysis (VAR) \nto measure proactivity and reactivity in communicating these frames. After collecting the \narticles, several preparatory steps were required to co nduct the quantitative text analysis and \nmachine learning operations to measure frame alignment in ECB communication and in \nmedia coverage (e.g., stemming and stop word removal, see online appendix A -2 for details). \nFor conducting the frame measurement, th ere are two choices with different trade -offs: either \nwe construct dictionaries of our target frames and count the occurrences of the dictionary \nterms in our text corpora (e.g. Rimkut\u0117 2019) ; or run unsupervised topic models and select \nthe topics that most closely correspond to our target frames (e.g. Barber\u00e1 et al. 2019) . While \ndictionaries are easy to construct and applicable across texts of varying nature, they are very \nsensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of words, even when created by experts. Topic models \nin contrast are fitted very  well to the body of text, however, that makes them very sensitive \nwhen applied to previously unseen texts. Due to the different nature of our documents, this \nmade using them unfeasible.5 We therefore combined the positive aspects of both approaches \n                                                           \n5 We tried applying a topic model fitted to the ECB corpus to the News corpus, but the algorithm could only \nweakly fin d topics in the other text corpus.

This algorithm treats each document as a random \nmixture of multiple latent topics, with each topic constructed as a probability distribution of \nall contained tokens (in our case tokens are stemmed individual words, for details see online \nappendix A -3). This approach is in line with the approach Kl\u00fcver et al. (2015, 488)  discussed: \n\u201c[\u2026] words that co -occur \u201ein similar contexts tend to have similar meaning' and \u201edocuments \nthat contain similar word patterns tend to have similar topics.'\u201d6  \nTo develop the topic models that would form the foundation for our dictionary, \nmultiple LDA (Gibbs sampling) topic models wi th 2 to 50 topics were created from the ECB \ncorpus (Blei et al. 2003) .7 One difficulty of using LDA topic models is to select a reasonabl e \nnumber of topics. As there is not \u201eone perfect\u201f method of determining this number, we opted \nfor an n of topics that would both increase model perplexity8 while preserving human \ninterpretability of the topics (as an \u201coptimal\u201d number of topics based purely  on perplexity that \ncould lead to a topic model consisting of non -intelligible topics).9 Finally, a topic model with \n38 topics was used, as it showed both good perplexity values, and the best interpretability of \nthe various topics. We tested interpretabili ty in line with what Quinn (2010)  defines as the \ndifferent notions of validity. Topics therefore had to be both semantically valid (meaning they \n                                                           \n6 For an impression of how closely documents within a topic align, see a sample in online appendix A -5. \n7 Model run with 1000 burn -in iterations and 600 iterations for the final model, and a seed for comparability and \nreproducibility  \n8 For an overview, see Montgomery et al. (2012)  \n9 Models with 35 -43 topics showed the best perplexity values and were checked individually for \nunderstandability  of the contained topics (by looking at the top 50 terms with the highest word -per-topic \nprobabilities and by looking at the documents with the highest topic -per-document probabilities).

We then enriched the list of search terms for \neach of our frames with other words that the topic model algorithms found to be also closely \nrelated to these specific topics. Importantly, we excluded t erms that were strongly related to \nour target frames but also co -occurred in topics that we were not interested in measuring. We \nran extensive robustness checks to ensure that our dictionary would actually be measuring \nwhat we are interested in. To ensure that our topic model is internally consistent, we ran an \nadditional five topic models with the same parameters and tested the presence of our target \nframes in each of the topic models.11 To ensure external consistency, we ran a topic model \nwith the same par ameters for the news database and tested if the topics that we detected in the \nECB database would also appear in the news (with a positive outcome, see online appendix \nB-2).  \nAfter constructing the dictionary of terms, we calculated the average occurrence of \nthese terms in relation to the overall number of words in each document (after removing stop \nwords) and averaged that value per year to get an overview of frame development across time \n(figure 2). After completion of the frame measurement, we aggregated  the data in a time \nseries dataset with the monthly occurrence of the target terms as a percentage of the overall \nnumber of words for both the ECB and the news datasets . When measuring the same frame \nwith both the topic modelling and dictionary approach, w e received comparable results \n                                                           \n10 We included the annotated topics in online appendix A -4. \n11 Five mor e topic models with 38 topics were created and checked for the existence of our target frames to \nvalidify topic stability (due to the latent nature of topic models, topics can sometimes disappear between \nmultiple model runs if they are not stable enough). The frames were present in all validation models, although \nthey were sometimes slightly differently distributed across multiple topics.

This shows that our method is a viable way of measuring frame \noccurrence in various bodies of text.  \n \nMeasuring frame alignment between the ECB and collective issue attention in the media  \nWe subsequently ran a vector autoregression model (VAR) analysis with Granger causality \ntests, to measure whether the ECB pays attention to the target frames reactively or \nproactively, i.e. whether we observed the ECB\u201fs use of frames to precede or follow t he \nframes emerging from the media coverage. A variable x granger -causes variable y if the past \nvalues of x help to improve the predictions for y above and beyond predictions that are \nmerely drawn from y (Granger 1969) . We operationalize a proactive communication strategy \nas an increase of the ECB\u201fs use of a frame before the media picks up the use of the same \nframe. In contrast, a reactive communication strategy is operationalized as an increase of the \nECB\u201fs use of a fram e after  an increase in media coverage regarding the same frame.  \nIt is important to note that Granger causality should not be confused with actual \ncausality; the measure does not exclude the possibility of confounding variables that \ninfluence the dependent  variable. If there are no other confounding factors that might \ninfluence the value pairs in question (in the case of this paper these pairs are attention to the \nthree different functional areas in both ECB communication and media coverage), Granger \ncausal ity provides sufficient evidence for the causation in the David Humean sense of the \nterm ( Reiss 2013, 21 : \u201cAll Cs are Es or, whenever C, then E\u201d,). We cannot make such a \nstrong assumption, as we cannot rule out othe r potential contributing factors that influence \nboth ECB and media communication. But even without these restrictive assumptions, \nGranger causality still allows the researcher to explore the dynamics between the value pairs, Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n23 \n and to generally assess whether  the two key variables empirically respond to each other (for a \nfurther discussion, see Resodihardjo et al. 2016) . \n To consider external factors that might account for changes in communication, we \nused the monthly Economic Policy Uncertainty score for Europe (Baker et al. 2016)  to test an \neffect of levels of economic uncertainty on all ECB communication and media coverage. This \nmeasure captures the degree of economic policy uncertainty that is conveyed in news \nrepor ting of European newspapers and provides a fine -grained quantification of the European \nfinancial crisis. We included this as a dummy variable in the models to control for an \nindependent effect of economic policy uncertainty on the patterns of ECB frames an d media \nframes.  \n \nResults  \nWe first offer a descriptive analysis of how the frames emerge from the ECB\u201fs formal \ncommunication and from media attention and evolve over time separately. The left panel of \nfigure 2 depicts ECB the three frames we identified: co re frame, expansion frame, and \nunusual measures frame. The right panel shows the coverage of the same frames by the \nmedia.  \n< FIGURE 2 HERE  > \nInternal frame alignment in ECB communication  \nIn line with our first hypothesis, the ECB focuses on its core compe tencies frame in its early \nyears.  Throughout the years, this focus diminishes and reaches a low point in 2012, one of \nthe worst years of the European financial crisis. However, while the ECB appears to be silent, \nit continues to communicate its core compe tencies. And after 2012, this remains the focus. In Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n24 \n general, we observe less emphasis on the expansion and unusual measures frame, as the ECB \ncontinually emphasizes its core competency.  \nThe unusual measures frame seems to display a rather continuous level  after 2008, \nwith a slight decline in recent years, reflecting the multiple crises that the EU and the ECB \nfaced in the past decade. For the expanding competencies frame we observe an interesting \npattern: We detect an uptake after 2008 and a relative peak in attention closer to the year of \n2014, when the Banking Union entered into force. Thereafter it stabilized again at the same \nlevels as before. This pattern of frames seems to signal that the ECB emphasized (albeit \nmodestly) competency expansion in the pe riod preceding the actual entry into force of the \nbanking union. The banking union has been one of the most significant expansions of ECB \ncompetencies since its foundation, and more emphasis on these expanding competencies prior \nto such a major reform woul d be logical to expect.  \nThe relative emphasis on such expanding competencies is less outspoken than one \nwould expect following our theoretical framework and based on the historic nature of the \nreform. At the same time, such a gradual broadening of the ECB \u201fs scope seems in line with \nrecent findings on EU agency issue prioritization over time (Busuioc and Rimkute 2019). \nMore specifically, the patterns we observe patterns of internal frame alignment (i.e., co -\noccurrence of several frames), point into the dire ction of strategic communication as \nregulatory and reputational strategy. That is, a pattern of frame alignment might indicate that \nthe ECB, while consciously emphasizing expanding competencies, has deliberately balanced \nthis with attention to its core com petency, to benefit or not jeopardize its core reputation \nconcerning price stability. These expanding competencies signal a complicated balancing act \nof central bank independence and a more entrepreneurial stance, which would trigger \nunwelcome political co ntestation affecting its reputation in its core area. Frame alignment \nmight have helped the ECB in its attempt to forge a reputation concerning those evolving Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n25 \n competencies while protecting and benefiting from its core reputation of ensuring price \nstability . \nThe ECB core frame appearance in the media data follows a relatively continuous \npattern as well, but is characterized by a more volatile pattern. For the two other frames under \ninvestigation, expanding competencies and unconventional measures, we find in teresting \ndifferences between the frames appearing in the ECB communication and the media. The \nECB does slightly alter its focus on the expansion of responsibilities and unconventional \nmeasures over time. However, the two frames seem to develop in a parall el fashion, while \nattention to unconventional measures is much more dominant in media coverage than in ECB \nformal communication from the start of the financial crisis in 2008 until 2016. The dominant \nattention to the core competency frame, yet still modest , seems in line with an overall \npreference for an independent central bank by its major audiences.   \n \nExternal frame alignment between ECB communication and media attention  \nWhile ECB formal communication and media attention reveal the emergence of similar \nframes over time, we do observe some variation. To test the proactive or reactive nature of \nECB issue attention, we conducted a vector autoregression model (VAR) analysis to  test our \nhypotheses, assuming that the relationship between frame occurrence in ECB\u201fs \ncommunication and the media is mutual. Due to the option of testing relationships of two or \nmore time series in both directions and the possibility to test for Granger c ausality (Granger \n1969) , VAR\u201fs suitability for analyzing dependencies between the  media and other actors has \nbeen tested, used, and verified multiple times in public relations research (Vliegenthart 2014) . \nWe investiga ted if and when the media and the ECB were following each other\u201fs use of \nframes. That is, we investigated external frame alignment between the same frame in both the \nECB and media data. We aggregated the occurrence of the frame words to a monthly score Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n26 \n for both databases (i.e., ECB formal communication and Newspapers), starting from January \n2001 until December 2017 (the timeframe of overlap between both datasets). This resulted in \nsix distinct time series (three frames in each dataset). Additionally, we inc luded the monthly \nEconomic Policy Uncertainty score for Europe (Baker et al. 2016)  to test changes in \ncommunication due to crises in the financial system. We  then created three VAR models (one \nVAR model for each of the frames containing the frame occurrence in both the ECB and \nNewspaper databases) and conducted Granger causality tests to examine whether the frame \noccurrence in the ECB or media granger -causes t he frame occurrence in the other dataset.  \nTo construct VAR models, the time series need to be stationary. We tested all series \nfor stationarity (no time trend: mean, variance, autocorrelation are constant over time) by \nusing both the Dickey -Fuller and Phi llips-Perron test. None of the time series was non -\nstationary, therefore no data transformation was needed to proceed to the VAR analysis. \nLastly, the number of time lags was determined. Based on the framing cycle theory (Miller \nand Riechert 2001) , a maximum lag length of three months was allowed.  \nIn the following step, the VAR models were estimated with time lags chosen \naccording  to the Akaike information criterion (in some cases, the criterion suggested longer \nlags if no maximum lag length was set, but in these cases the model resulted in no significant \ncorrelation coefficients between the included variables). We then tested the data for the \nabsence of autocorrelation of the residuals by means of the Portmanteau (Q) test. Two models \nshowed autocorrelation, which disappeared by increasing the number of time lags in the VAR \nmodel (Strau\u00df and Vliegenthart 2017) . This process resulted in 9 (bivariate) VAR models (3 \nmodels of frame s in ECB and media, 3 models of media frames and crisis indicator, 3 models \nof ECB frames and crisis indicator).  \nIn the subsequent step, each of the models was tested for Granger causality. In the \nfollowing table we report the F -test scores of the Granger causality test within each VAR Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n27 \n model that we have generated, including the significance levels, at the most optimal time lag \n(Akaike information criterion). Since reporting the coefficients of VAR models does not \ndisclose much valuable information about th e underlying size of the correlation of the \nresponse variables, we chose to report the impulse response function plots (table 1). The x -\naxis in these plots shows the time lags (in months) after a shock (sudden increase) in the \nimpulse variable. The shock s ize of the impulse variable is taken to be one standard deviation \nof the disturbance term contained in the underlying VAR model. To better understand the \nsize of effect in the response variable, we divided it by the shock size to display the \npercentage inc rease.  \nTable 1: Impulse response functions (**p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01)  \nIn terms of external frame alignment, we observe significant overlap between ECB \ncommunication and media attention. All frames show significant granger causality in both \ndirections, so there is likely a mutual relationship between ECB communication and med ia \ncoverage. The variation in response time suggests variance how the ECB responds to \nattention in the media.  The ECB reacts relatively weak to the media when it comes to its core Frame  Media response to ECB  ECB response to Media  With inclusion of \nfinancial crisis as \nexogenous factor  \nCore competencies  Granger, F -Test: 4.61**  \n< IRF_1 HERE >  Granger, F -Test: 4.86**  \n< IRF_2 HERE >  Media response: Granger \nF-test: 6.97***  \nECB response:  Granger \nF-Test: 4.97**  \nunconventional measures  Granger F -Test: 3.89**  \n< IRF_3 HERE >  Granger, F -Test: 13.21***  \n< IRF_4 HERE >  Media: Granger, F -test: \n3.01***  \nECB: Granger F -Test: \n12.54***  \nexpanding competencies  Granger F -Test: 5.5***  \n< IRF_5 HERE>  Granger, F -Test: 8.03***  \n< IRF_6 HERE >  Media: Granger F -test: \n5.08**  \nNews:  Granger, F -Test: \n7.15***  \nNote: Y -axis shows effect in response variable in percentage of shock size, x -axis shows time in months after the initial \nshock.  \nTo provide an example: The top left field shows that a 100% increase in the use of the core responsibility topic by the ECB \nin month 0 will likely trigger a ~30% increase in the same frame in news coverage by month 4.

In the month after a shock, we see no increase in the emphasis  on core \ncompetencies in the ECB communication. Interestingly, the ECB autonomous \ncommunication pattern seems to indicate a stead -fast communication pattern to reaffirm its \ncore competencies and its credibility. However, the picture is different for both e xpanding \ncompetencies and unconventional measures. If the media suddenly increases their focus on \nsuch topics, the ECB reacts strongly and quickly. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we see the \nstrongest effect for unconventional measures. If the media increases thei r focus on such \nmeasures by 100%, the ECB increases it by 140% in the following month. The media in \ncontrast reacts much slower to shocks in the ECB\u201fs communication and seem to only react to \nit much later. This is in line with earlier observations on frame  congruence between private \nbank communication and media attention, showing a resistance by German financial media to \npick up frames adopted by major German banks  (Strau\u00df and Vliegenthart 2017) . It seems \nthat a reactive versus proactive issue attention pattern can be better understood in terms of \nreaction time and autonomous communication, rather than in the sequential way we \nconceptualized the relationship based on existing reputational accounts.  \nIn addition, when we include the economic and policy uncertainty measures as a \ndummy variable, the findin gs still hold, with marginal differences in the p -values of the \nGranger tests. ECB\u201fs main pattern of frame alignment does not seem to be significantly \naffected by economic and policy uncertainty. This seems to be in contrast to the findings of \nMoschella an d Pinto (2018), who find evidence for an increase in frame alignment in \nresponse to uncertainty. We find a more modest pattern of external frame alignment that is \nnot significantly affected by contextual uncertainty.  This might signal the crucial importan ce \nfor central banks to stay on topic as much as possible. Equally, the frame congruence \nbetween the ECB and the media is not affected by times of crises (for a rudimentary but more \ndetailed test, see online appendix C -1).   Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n29 \n We should also be sensitive to a selection effect by the media when interpreting our \nfindings.  Overall, the increased attention to unusual measures follows commonly adopted \ncriteria of news value, including conflict and drama, causing bias in news coverage \n(Mazzoleni and Schulz 1999). This might explain why the media\u201fs attention to unusual \nmeasures and the expanding competencies correspond to the issue attention pattern of ECB, \nas the multiple ensuing crises had arguably more news value than a plea for new \ncompetencies of the ECB or mor e generally the establishment of the banking Union.    \nFinally, our analyses seem to signal how the ECB alternated between varying levels \nframe alignment with the media, a pattern generally in line with what one might expect from \na reputational account of independent agencies. Whereas we did not find evidence for overt \nproactive communication, the varying levels of responsiveness do indicate entrepreneurial \nagency behavior that goes beyond a merely reactive mode of engagement.  \n \n \n \nDiscussion and Conclusion  \nStrategic communication can be used as a reputational and regulatory strategy by fostering \nand advancing a reputation for certain organizational competencies via strategic \ncommunication, and hence ensure effective regulatory oversight. From a reputational \nperspective, it follows that agencies strategically diversify between proactively addressing \n(Proactive Agency Hypothesis) or reactively responding to public concerns raised by their \nmanifold audience (Reactive Agency Hypothesis) to cultivate their reputat ion and thereby \nensure effective regulatory oversight, depending on whether a core or evolving competency is \nat stake. We tested these assumptions of strategic communication based on a longitudinal Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n30 \n analysis of ECB formal communication and attention to ECB competencies by its audiences \nvia media coverage. We find the ECB communication pattern to be largely characterized by \ninternal frame alignment. That is, a focus on its core competency of price stability is a \nconstant dominant factor in ECB communication o ver time. Attention to its core \ncompetencies coincides with either attention to unusual measures in the wake of the financial \nand economic crises, or a focus on expanding competencies, not surprisingly in 2008 during \nthe financial crisis and afterwards in the run up to the establishment of the Banking Union, \nbestowing more competencies to the ECB. The patterns of media attention show more \nvolatility, paying much more attention to the unusual measures in the wake of financial and \neconomic crises. Our analysi s of external frame alignment shows a stronger mutual \nrelationship than we hypothesized in which the ECB seems to adopt a more reactive than \nproactive communication strategy. The ECB responds more quickly to media attention to its \nexpanding competencies an d unusual measures compared to its response to media attention to \ncore competencies. Overall, our analysis indicates a pattern of internal frame alignment in \nECB communication regarding multiple competencies and external frame alignment between \nECB and med ia attention in which the ECB adopts a reactive communication strategy at \ndifferent intervals.   \nBefore turning to the implications of our findings, we discuss several implications of \nour case selection. First, we selected central banks, and in particular the European Central \nBank, to study strategic communication as a reputational and regulatory strategy under the \nassumption of selecting a most likely case. That is, given the crucial importance of \nexpectation management, central bank communication is highl y driven by both reputational \nand regulatory concerns. While this case selection facilitated our study of the interactive \nnature of strategic communication with collective issue attention, it might have resulted in \ncertain biases as well. First, regarding the selection of central banking, it is plausible that the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n31 \n proactive communication pattern regarding evolving competencies is less outspoken than \nmight be the case for other regulatory agencies, precisely because of the crucial importance \nof its core reput ation as fully independent and therefore credible keeper of price stability or, \nmore particularly for the ECB as the guardian of the Euro. Second, a plausible assumption for \nthe less outspoken attention to evolving competencies would be that the ECB has ta ken \nanother route to advance such additional competencies, namely via the European Court of \nJustice (Curtin 2017), via direct negotiations with member -state central banks, and EU \ninstitutions given the strong prevalence of domestic monetary preferences in its governing \nand executive council. This speaks to a third important implication of our case selection, \nnamely the supranational nature of the ECB and European central banking. We have focused \non a supranational central bank. This is not only reflected in  its organizational structure to \nbalance representativeness with expertise as noted in the research design, but also in the type \nof media coverage. This could have affected media attention and frame alignment between \nthe ECB and the media. Selection of a n ational central bank or national independent agencies \nmight have yielded more outspoken external frame alignment patterns given the immediacy \nof national media. All in all, our case study of central banking, and the ECB in particular, \nmight have affected t he likelihood of both the reactive and proactive communication patterns \nin a distinct way and the careful signaling of a compound reputation much more likely. This \ncould explain the strong internal frame alignment pattern we observed in the data combined \nwith the less outspoken proactive pattern. It would also explain why we find the ECB to be \nmore attentive to uncertainties in its environment (Moschella and Pinto 2018) or to focus less \non its evolving competencies (Gilad et al 2015), compared to other cent ral banks.   \n Our findings yield important implications for the study of strategic \ncommunication as a reputational and regulatory strategy. First, and concerning central bank \ncommunication more specifically, our study complements studies of central bank Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n32 \n communication by revealing ECB\u201fs responsiveness to its multiple audiences. Many studies \nhave focused on the effect of central bank communication on financial market behavior \n(Blinder et al 2008; Coenen et al 2017) yet largely neglected interactive patterns o r \nengagement with concerns raised by stakeholders or only studied one source, either media -\ncoverage or central bank communication (Gilad et al 2015; Maor et al 2013; Rimkute 2019). \nWe contributed to this emerging literature by examining how the ECB\u201fs commu nication \npatterns are congruent with media attention by including both formal communication and \nmedia attention.   \n Both the internal and external frame -alignment patterns seem to signal the \nprecarious balance a central bank should strike in its formal com munication to ensure \npredictability and preserve its reputation for credibility and independence (cf. Gross and \nGreen 2019; Johnson et al 2018). These findings are in line with recent studies indicating \nhow the ECB and central banks seem to gradually expan d their scope (Johnson et al 2018; \nGross and Greene 2019; Heldt and Mueller 2020; Princen and Van Esch 2016). At the same \ntime, it might also reveal potential patterns of (limited) accountability and entrepreneurial \nbehavior vis -a-vis its multiple audience s, in line with concerns of the ECB becoming \nincreasingly politicized and less accountable (Curtin 2017; Moschella and Diodati 2020; \nStreeck 2015).  Understanding how the ECB engages with its audiences helps to better assess \nits alleged powerful position i t developed over the recent decade (Streeck, 2015: 370; Gren et \nal 2015; Schimmelfennig 2018).  \n Our findings also speak to strategic communication as a reputational and \nregulatory strategy beyond central bank communication. European Union regulatory agenci es \nseem to gradually expand their scope via attention to other issues or competencies (Busuioc \nand Rimkute 2019), suggesting a similar logic of strategic communication across multiple \nagencies. This pattern of internal frame alignment also fits the idea of  institutional layering as Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n33 \n a specific type of institutional reform (Streeck and Thelen 2005) as well as the importance of \npolicy narratives for institutional reform (Baumgartner 2013; McNamara 2006; Schiller \n2018). Agencies could carefully link attention t o distinct yet related competencies to \nemphasize both evolving competencies and their perceived capability in those areas by \nrelying on a stead -fast reputation for its established competencies and tasks. Our empirical \nmethod allows for larger scale compara tive analyses of regulatory communication over time \nand across cases, facilitating both the empirical study of agency responsiveness to its external \naudiences, as well as the refinement of reputational theories of agency autonomy and \nperformance. In doing so, future research should explicitly consider the observational \nequivalence of regulatory competencies and bureaucratic reputation. Future research to better \nexplain such phenomena and unpack the mechanism of strategic communication as a \nreputational and regulatory strategy hence not only requires longitudinal and quantitative \nanalyses, but also in -depth analyses of agency motivations to trace the causal mechanisms of \nstrategic communication as both a regulatory and reputational strategy.  \n  The responsiveness of independent regulatory agencies has always been a \ncentral concern in the study of bureaucratic politics. How such agencies respond to concerns \nand priorities voiced by their multiple audiences, reveals which issues they prioritize and how  \nthey cultivate their autonomy. By implication, how agencies respond to such concerns is a \ncrucial instance of their democratic legitimacy (Dietsch 2020; Krause 2013). Given that the \ninvolvement of and collaboration with a variety of stakeholders is becomi ng more and more \nprominent (Abbott et al 2017; Carpenter and Krause 2012, Maor 2020, Gilad et al. 2015), \nunderstanding how regulatory agencies engage with their external audiences should be part \nand parcel of explaining the extent to which they are respons ive and accountable and, by \nimplication, their democratic legitimacy.  \n Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jopart/muab008/6225153 by guest on 23 April 2021\n\n \n34 \n Data availability:  \nAll coding and data analysis decisions are specified in the online supplementary data.  \nThe data and reproduction files underlying this article are available in the D ANS Easy \nrepository, at https://doi.org/10.17026/dans -z27-qdcp.

They are asked to cover a wider range of the information ecosystem and develop students\u2019 capacity to critically engage with Google and the open web. In this \nstudy, we incorporated these learning objectives in an introductory computational thinking course, combining two information literacy pedagogies. For evaluating sources, we used Mike Caulfield\u2019s SIFT technique (Stop, Investigate the source, Find better coverage; Trace claims to the original source); for \nresource discovery, Lane Wilkinson\u2019s Information Needs, Types and Qualities lesson. We adapted Wilkinson\u2019s worksheet, asked students to apply the SIFT technique to their chosen sources, and added a reflection component where students documented their research process. We conducted a content analysis of the assignment responses and coded evidence of students demonstrating knowledge \npractices and dispositions of two  frames from the ACRL Framework , Authority is Constructed and \nContextual and Searching as Strategic Exploration. Our analysis showed that students responded well to learning the SIFT technique, particularly at investigating sources ;  furthermore, Wilkinson\u2019s \npedagogy for source discovery encouraged students to use a wide variety of research tools. The reflection component further revealed evidence of students\u2019 research processes and metacognition. We found this unit to be an effective means of asse ssing the se Framework concepts, and argue that it can be \napplied to other topics and disciplines . \n De plus en plus, les biblioth\u00e9caires sont encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 offrir des s\u00e9ances de ma\u00eetrise de l'information qui \nvont au -del\u00e0 de la recherche et de l'utilisation des sources savantes traditionnelles.

Pour \u00e9valuer les sources, nous avons utilis\u00e9 la technique SIFT de Mike Caulfield (Arr\u00eater, Enqu\u00eater sur la source, Trouver une meilleure couverture  ; Retracer les \nrevendications jusqu'\u00e0 la source d'origine  ; pour la d\u00e9couverte des ressources, la le\u00e7on Besoins \nd'information, types et qualit\u00e9s de Lane Wilkinson.

We no longer search for information. Instead, we google. And as we increasingly rely on Google for answers, so our ability to search for information by ourselves diminishes (Harari, 2018, p. 54) . \n Noah Yuval Harari\u2019s provocative statement challenges the university community to reflect \non their own information literacy programs. To what extent do their students rely on Google as their primary search tool? How do their students find and evaluate infor mation sources? If their \nstudents\u2019 ability to search for information has diminished, what are they doing about it? Furthermore, since Google remains a widely used and effective (yet problematic) research tool, how do educators expect students to critically engage with Google and the wider information \necosystem?  \nHistorically, library research workshops have downplayed Google and sources found on \nthe open web (Head & Eisenberg, 2010; Wilkinson, 2017) . Instead, librarians teach students how \nto find scholarly sources for their research paper assignments using the library catalogue and subject databases. However, this approach has been criticized for supporting the false assumption that students should onl y ever engage with academic sources, particularly peer reviewed journal \narticles (Jankowski et al., 2018) . In addition to developing students\u2019 skills for success in research \nassignments, librarians can and should be given time to incorporate discussion of the wider information ecosystem, which includes Google and its search algorithm, non- academic sources, \nthe open web, and social media (Berg, 2016; Fister, 2021) . To counter Harari\u2019s polemic that \nGoogle searches constitute the \u201ctruth,\u201d (Harari, 2018, p. 54) we need to foster critical engagement with a wide range of information sources and develop students\u2019 metacognition about the research process itself.    \nThis paper interrogates Harari\u2019s claim that information literacy skills are in decline, while \nalso presenting a strategy for information literacy instruction that supplements students' use of Google. Our unit combines two approaches for finding and evaluating information sources: Lane Wilkinson\u2019s Information Needs, Types, and Qualities strategy, and Mike Caulfield\u2019s SIFT method. These approaches are grounded by concepts described in the Framework for Information Literacy \nfor Higher Education (hereafter refe rred to simply as the Framework or the ACRL Framework ). \nThe paper is organized as follows: we first provide an overview of the Framework , followed by a \ndiscussion of previous research on Framework -based instruction and assessment. We then describe \nthe strategies we adapted from Wilkinson and Caulfield and how we implemented the information literacy unit. Finally, we analyze students\u2019 assignment responses and discuss the implications. Our results in dicate that our unit could be an important step forward in e xpanding students\u2019 awareness \nof the information ecosystem and building their information literacy skills.    \n \nThe ACRL Framework   \n \nIn 2016, The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), an influential \nassociation of North American academic librarians, moved away from the premise that information literacy consists of a checklist of discrete and measurable sills. Instead, th ey posit that it involves \nunderstanding of six overlapping core concepts, called frames. They published this position in the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Association of College & \nResearch Libraries, 2016) . These conceptual frames are: Authority Is Constructed and Contextual; \nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Vol. 15, Iss. 2 [2024], Art. 8  \nhttps://doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2024.2.15558   2 Information Creation as a Process; Information Has Value; Research as Inquiry; Scholarship as \nConversation; and Searching as Strategic Exploration. Each frame includes examples of \u201cknowledge practices\u201d and \u201cdispositions\u201d of both novice and expert researchers, thus acknowledging that information literacy is a cognitive journey for university students.   \nThis cognitive journey is explicitly stated in the Framework by referencing Meyer and \nLand\u2019s notion of threshold concepts (Meyer & Land, 2003). They conceptualize that disciplinary knowledge involves crossing into a \u201cportal, opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress\u201d (Meyer & Land, 2003, p. 412). In the context of information literacy and the F ramework, when students fully understand a frame, \nthey have a newfound grasp of the nuances and complexities of the information ecosystem.   \nAdditionally, the Framework emphasizes the importance of metacognition, described as \n\u201ccritical self reflection\u201d (ACRL, 2016).   Metacognition provides students with a measure of \ncontrol over their search processes (Livingston, 2003) . The Framework is thus adaptable in a \nrapidly changing information ecosystem; it emphasizes context, and argues that researchers are not merely information consumers, but potentially creators as well. The  Framework provides an \nintellectual grounding for librarians to move beyond subject database demonstrations and lessons in search syntax, and opens opportunities to discuss the wider information landscape and students\u2019 place in it.    \n Teaching and Assessing the Framework    \n \nThe Framework has been widely discussed in Library and Information Science (LIS) \nliterature since it was published in 2016, but no single approach has emerged as the predominant way to teach it and assess students\u2019 competencies of various frames. The Framework does not \nprescribe specific lesson plans or learning outcomes to assess mastery of the Frames; instead, librarians are expected to develop curriculum that fits context -specific instructional needs. There \nare abundant resources online available for educator s search ing for learning activities: \nACRL  supports the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy Sandbox (Association of College \n& Research Libraries, n.d.) , which offers a wide variety of practical sugge stions on how to \nimplement the  Framework. The Community of Online Research Assignments (CORA)  is another \nrepository of learning objects for information literacy instruction. Regarding assessment, Oakleaf (2014) and Hosier (2017) posited early suggestions in creating Framework- based learning \noutcomes, which could be graded. Oakleaf suggested the structure, \u201cThe student will be able to + ACTIVE VERB\u201d (p. 512), mapped to knowledge practices and dispositions of spec ific frames. \nHosier developed learning outcomes for the frame Scholarship as Conversation using multiple choice questions on an online tutorial. Julien et al. (2020) compiled case studies of collaborations between librarians and course instructors who had successfully implemented Framework \nprinciples. This compilation includes Steele et al.\u2019s (2020) rubric for the Searching as Strategic Exploration frame; they also found that assigning research and writing logs facilitated assessment of the frames Information H as Value, Research as Inquiry, and Searching as Strategic \nExploration.   \nThe Framework also stresses the importance of critical self -reflection, a facet of \ninformation literacy that researchers have only recently begun to assess. Hostetler et al. (2018) notes that metacognition tools have not traditionally been integrated into information literacy instruction. McCoy (2022) agrees, and stresses the interconnectedness of metacognition with \nHendrigan et al.: Combining SIFT and the Information Needs, Types, and Qualities Approaches \nPublished by Scholarship@Western, 2024   3 searching, finding, and evaluating sources. She implements a short metacognition assessment \nsurvey after information literacy instruction sessions. Others have created comprehensive metacognition survey instruments (Catalano, 2017; Robertson et al., 2022) or used eye tracking \ntechnology Zhou (2023).   \nOur research team has also investigated methods of teaching and assessing select \nFramework competencies  (Hendrigan et al. , 2020a; Hendrigan et al., 2020b; Hendrigan et al., \n2022). In fact, this is the re search team\u2019s fourth iteration of Framework -based information literacy \nunits. We started this work in 2017, the year after the Framework was publi shed, with a simple in -\nclass presentation and assignment on the Authority is Constructed and Contextual frame. In 2018, \nwe studied students\u2019 competencies in this frame as well as the Scholarship as Conversation \nframe.  We retained our focus on Authority is Constructed and Contextual in 2019 but swapped the \nScholarship as Conversation for  the Searching as Strategic Exploration frame in  2020 and 2021, \nwhich aligns with  the preponderance of  information literacy workshops that cover the skills of \nfinding and evaluating sources (Head & Eisenberg, 2009) . Students\u2019 responses in these \nassignments indicated that we assessed them without providing adequate pre -assignment \ninstruction in source evaluation and searching strategies. In our most recent iteration of the \ninformation literacy unit, we also wanted to  develop an assignment that probed students\u2019 research \nprocesses,  and s timulate metacognition as part of the assignment itself, rather than prompting it in \na separate activity.    \nWe discovered two promising pedagogies in the literature to adapt for our unit. First, Mike \nCaulfield focuses on source evaluation, which fits with the Authority is Constructed and Contextual frame. He developed a strategy called SIFT (Caulfield, 2017) , an acronym that stands \nfor Stop; Investigate the source, Find better coverage, and Trace claims to the original source. SIFT is gaining attention in librarian and academic circles (Bull et al., 2021; Fielding, 2019)  and \nhas been adapted and tested in both university and high school settings (Brodsky et al., 2021; \nPavlounis et al., 2021) . SIFT has replaced strategies such as the CRAAP evaluation test, which \ninvolves checking a source based on its Currency, Relevancy, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose \n(Blakeslee, 2004) . In res ponse to growing criticism of the CRAAP test and other checklists where \nresearchers evaluate sources using the close reading technique (Fielding, 2019; Wilkinson, 2017) we decided to use the SIFT method. SIFT was influenced by Wineburg and McGrew\u2019s study \n(2017) reporting that professional fact checkers, who employ a technique of lateral reading, were the fastest and most effective web content evaluators in their study population. In contrast to the CRAAP test, lateral reading and the SIFT technique directs researchers away from a source and instead, focuses their evaluation process on what external sources say about the source in question.   \nSecondly, Lane Wilkinson provides a strategy for finding sources which we associate with \nthe Searching as Strategic Exploration frame. His lesson \u201cInformation Needs, Types, and Qualities\u201d ( Wilkinson, 2016)  has been downloaded from the Community of Online Research \nAssignments  database more than 3000 times (Community of Online Research Assignments , n.d.) . \nHe proposes a structured approach to literature searches by information need and source type: background, current events, statistics, opinions, and research. His assignment requires students to search for a wide range of sources, both popular and scholarly, and recommends that instructors : \n [T]urn searching into evaluating. Show [how] Google works and how results are \nmanipulated. Show them things like the \u2018site:\u2019 tag. Talk about truth and fairness in reporting. Talk about media ethics. Talk about consistency across multiple sources. Examine how different sources cover the same event. Again, it\u2019s not about asking \u201cis this \nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Vol. 15, Iss. 2 [2024], Art. 8  \nhttps://doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2024.2.15558   4 article credible?\u201d It\u2019s about getting students to ask \u201cgiven the source of this article, and \ngiven the way the issue is reported elsewhere, can I trust what I\u2019m reading?\u201d (Wilkinson, 2017)    Wilkinson agrees with recommendations to focus on research processes in information \nliteracy instruction (Wilkinson, 2017; Head & Eisenberg, 2009; Caulfield, 2017), and Fister\u2019s passionate urge (2021) for educators to discuss information platforms in addit ion to search \nstrategies.    \nWe combined Wilkinson and Caulfield's methods in our fourth attempt to teach and assess \nFramework concepts. We looked for evidence of students' understanding of two frames: Authority \nis Constructed and Contextual and Searching as Strategic Exploration. We wanted to see how students employed the SIFT method, how they assessed the credibility of authors and publications, and their search processes. We were also interested in their feedback  regarding the assignment as \na whole, since the research topic itself, on the influence of Google  and Big Data on our daily lives, \ninserts a layer of metacognition on th e whole exercise. Ultimately, we challenge Harari\u2019s statement \nthat research merely consists of Googling, while also acknowledging that Google and the open we are widely used and acceptable in certain contexts.      \nBackground   \n \nThis research took place at Simon Fraser University , a comprehensive Canadian university \nwith over 23,000 full -time equivalent students enrolled. We created and piloted the revised unit \nfor CMPT 115, Exploring Computer Science, , delivered remotely and synchronously in summer \nand fall terms in 2021. This course, designed for students who are not  Computing Science majors, \nexposes students to basic programming principles, explores fundamental ideas in computer \nscience, and examines the impact of computational thinking and computers on modern society. \nThirty -seven students were enrolled in the spring term and thirty- one in the fall. They came from \na wide variety of backgrounds, including Business, Fine Arts, Criminology, Labour Studies, Biology, He alth Science, and Psychology. They ranged from their first semester of their studies to \ntheir sixteenth.    \nThe assignment was mandatory and graded. We obtained approval from our Research \nEthics Board to analyze the assignment responses [# 20180123]; the consent form was part of the \nassignment. A teaching assistant graded the assignments, and if the student consented, a member of the research team downloaded and de -identified their work. Between the two classes, thirty -\neight students consented for a participation rate of 55.9 percent\n.\u202f\u202f  \nBroadly speaking, we used Wilkinson\u2019s strategy and worksheet for students\u2019 literature \nsearches, and Caulfield\u2019s SIFT strategy for evaluating sources. Wilkinson\u2019s approach involves finding sources on their topic from five different categories of \u201cinformatio n needs:\u201d background \ninformation, current events, opinions, statistics, and research. While most library instruction sessions teach students to find types  of information (eg, books or articles) (Head & Eisenberg, \n2009) , Wilkinson\u2019s approach prioritizes resource content over format. We made one important \nmodification to Wilkinson\u2019s worksheet involving source evaluation, however. While Wilkinson is not a strong advocate of evaluation checklists (Wilkinson, 2017)  nevertheless his worksheet \nincluded the \u2018CRAAP test\u2019 evaluation technique. We substituted this for SIFT.   \nThe information literacy unit is summarized as follows (see Appendix A for the complete \nunit.) It began with a reading from Noah Yuval Harari\u2019s book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century  \nHendrigan et al.: Combining SIFT and the Information Needs, Types, and Qualities Approaches \nPublished by Scholarship@Western, 2024   5 (Harari, 2018), a  passage that aligns with the course goals on the social implications of computing. \nHarari contends that Google and big data algorithms have caused a decline in our ability to conduct \nresearch and make decisions. Borrowing from Wilkinson, we asked students to compile a bibliography of 5 different item types (Background, News, Statistics, Opinion, and Res earch) on \none of the claims related to the Harari passage. Specifically, these claims were:    \n \n1. Google has diminished our ability to search for information   \n2. Google's top search results are \"the truth\"    \n3. AI will eventually make better major life decisions (eg who you marry, what you study) than you would have made yourself   \n4. Big data algorithms: they have lots of glitches, but we have no better alternative.    \n These topics reinforce the course\u2019s learning goals related to algorithms and big data, but they also \nallow them to interact with, and reflect on, these concepts personally.  Students were required to \nemploy Caulfield\u2019s SIFT method on the sources as an evaluation method. Finally, they wrote a \n200-500 word reflection passage on their research process describing how they chose one or two \nof their sources, which the research team used for assessment and analysis  \nWe emphasized the learning objects using both a flipped classroom approach and a live \npresentation. Prior to completing the worksheet, students completed online tutorials in Canvas, the university\u2019s learning management system, on the SIFT method and how to find sources \ncategorized by Wilkinson\u2019s five information needs. We had built short modules that covered the learning objects, accompanied by non- graded quizzes reinforcing the material. After the students \ncompleted the tutorials, the librarian gave a 50-m inute presentation covering the concepts from the \ntutorials and demonstrated different approaches to find and evaluate sources in the different \ninformation need categories.  \n \nAssignment Assessment and Analysis   \n \nThe library uses the Primo federated search interface, which searches and retrieves \ninformation resources from a variety of resource types, including monographs, journals, and \ncontent from some (but not all) subject databases. We asked students to be explicit about their search tools when they documented their search processes and indicate when they deliberately chose a subject database or the library catalogue.   \nTo assess the assignment, we adapted Steele et al.\u2019s rubric (2020) and switched the research \nlog for a reflection passage. Our assessment rubric is found in Appendix B. Initially, in 2020, we focused our assessment on the reflection passage and simply grad ed the bibliography for \ncompletion. However, that decision resulted in our inability to correct misunderstandings in students\u2019 source choices. For example, one student wrote that the ScienceDirect platform was unsuitable in the academic context because it contained advertisements and sensationalized images; this student determined that an article from Vice  magazine was a better choice. This \nresponse required further probing to better understand the context of this response, and letting the student know that Elsevier is generally accepted as a suitable academic publisher, free of advertising. In the second t erm, we added \u201cappropriate source\u201d as a grading criterion and provided \nfeedback to students when we had concerns or questions about the sources they used.  \nAfter the assignment was marked, we conducted a qualitative content analysis (Schreier, \n2014) on the worksheet\u2019s reflection passage. We examined how students employed the SIFT \nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Vol. 15, Iss. 2 [2024], Art. 8  \nhttps://doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2024.2.15558   6 technique, what criteria they used to evaluate sources, and their search processes. Following Eva \net al. (2021) , we coded for attributes listed as knowledge practices and dispositions of the relevant \nFrames in the Framework. Our codebook included the following categories: credibility criteria mentioned, search strategies/tools employed, and search perseverance behaviour. We also coded students\u2019 sentiments to get an overall impression of how well the unit was received. To conduct the qualitative analysis, two members of the research team read and coded samples of submissions individually, then discussed how we interpreted and applied the codes to the samples. We resolved differences in codes applied by mutual agreemen t. One member then coded the remainder of the \nsubmissions.   \n \nFindings   \n \nOur study combined SIFT with Wilkinson\u2019s search strategy; we added a reflection exercise \nto analyze and assess how students employed these strategies during the research process. We divide our findings into four categories: Employment of the SIFT method; Analysis through Authority Is Constructed and Contextual frame; Analysis through Searching as Strategic Exploration frame; and Sentiment Analysis.   \n \nEmployment of SIFT Method   \n \nWe conducted a content analysis of the reflection passage to examine how students \nemployed the SIFT method. Most students (84.2%) in the study population completed the \u201cInvestigate the source\u201d component of SIFT, and documented how they did so. Fewer students (47.4%) mentioned finding better coverage or tracing claims to the original source. Among those who tried finding better coverage or tracing claims, some were successful while others were not. \nStudents\u2019 source investigation involved researching both the authors and the publications, \nincluding information about their publication record, reach, affiliations, and impact factor:  \n I did an open web search on both the publisher (using Wikipedia and a website I am familiar with, mediabiasfactcheck.com) to determine that the publisher was reputable. Additionally, I open web searched for the author of the article, and found that she was  a reputable and \nknowledgable [sic] journalist who has extensively written about the intersection between technology, privacy, and society, ... (#7, Summer 2021)   \n  Upon finding an article from the results I checked the credibility of the journal and it's [sic] impact score. (#11, Summer 2021)   \n \nMany students found the SIFT method useful in their research process, and expressed relief in learning this quick and effective strategy:    \nIt was also quite fascinating, doing a more thorough look at my sources with the SIFT methods. In previous courses, I only went in -depth when it was a source I didn't \nimmediately trust, but I'm glad it's a skill I have now. It's really useful, being able to check right away if something is peer -reviewed or being able to track down a biography for an \narticle's author. While most of my sources I'd picked straight from their original \nHendrigan et al.: Combining SIFT and the Information Needs, Types, and Qualities Approaches \nPublished by Scholarship@Western, 2024   7 publication, those where I didn't --my News and Research pieces-- brought me a sort of \nexcitement, tracing the claim back to their original publications. (#4, Fall 2021)   \n \nAuthority Is Constructed and Contextual Frame   \n \nWe also assessed students\u2019 competencies in this frame by coding how they applied the \nSIFT technique to their sources. Figure 1 shows the range of indicators of authority students used \nto determine the credibility of both authors and publications. Using the reflection passage as our data source, we counted the frequency of criteria mentioned. Common indicators students used include the reputation of the publication and/or publisher, authority of the authors, and whether \nthe source was peer reviewed. They also used tools such as fact -checking websites, citation counts, \nand journal impact scores. Sources obtained from the library webs ite or tutorials were other \nindicators of credibility. However, we also noticed that some students evaluated the credibility of the sources purely based on their familiarity with the source.    Figure 1   \nIndicators Used to A ssess C redibility of Sources  \n  \nThe most prevalent authority indicator (73.7%) was the reputation of the publication or \npublisher which includes its accolades, history, and affiliations. Often, students used multiple indicators to assess the credibility of the source:   \n I searched for the magazine on Wikipedia and determined that it is a respected monthly \nAmerican business magazine that was named magazine of the year in 2014 by the American Society of Magazine Editors. Mark Sullivan the author is an award- win[n]ing \njournali st who covers topics such as emerging technology, large tech companies and \nmisinformation among others. After this search, I was confident that the article was from a credible source.\u201d (#10, Summer 2021)   \n  \n\nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Vol. 15, Iss. 2 [2024], Art. 8  \nhttps://doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2024.2.15558   8 I used Access Science to find the background source, which was a recommended \nWikipedia alternative in the information literacy module. Additionally, Access Science is run by McGraw Hill, a popular education provider that I have used before. To further support the credibility, the two authors, Dr. Gupta and Dr. Mata -Toledo are experienced in \nthe field of computer science working and teaching.\u201d (#3, Summer 2021)   \n \nStudents also seem to have developed greater awareness of the need to critically assess the sources they use:   \n \nThis exercise was useful because it gave me a reminder about the importance of verifying claims and not blindly agreeing with text. It was a good way to hone my skills to ensure that I could discern credible sources from non -credible ones. (#7, Fall 2021)   \n  Although I know about the NYT [New York Times], I still did my research into its credibility. I learnt that many times, criticism has been raised towards the paper when covering political issues for misrepresentation, but, I didn't find much in the way of normal reporting. (#5, Summer 2021)   \n \nSearching as Strategic Exploration Frame   \n \nWe present our findings of students\u2019 search tools and databases used in Figures 2 and 3, \nand search strategies in Figure 4.    Figure 2   Search  Tools U sed  \n  \n  \n\nHendrigan et al.: Combining SIFT and the Information Needs, Types, and Qualities Approaches \nPublished by Scholarship@Western, 2024   9 Figure 3   \nDatabases U sed  \n  \nThe most common resource that students consulted was Google, followed by the library catalogue, \nsubject databases and Google Scholar. Google was rarely the sole search tool documented; 87% of students used Google in conjunction with other resources.     \nOverall I would say I found this exercise helpful, it helped me get a feel for other databases \nthat the library catalogue offers. I've done quite a lot of research papers for other courses \nbut I only used the business and political science database so this  exercise was great to \n[help] me get a feel for the other resources the library has to offer. (#15, Summer 2021)    \nI used the SFU  library catalogue to gain access [to] the Statista Database. I found it to be \nextremely helpful when trying to get some statistics or raw number data compared to \ngoogle or other search engines. (#15, Summer 2021)   \n  \nAs successful searching often involves iterative searches based on initial results, we also examined how students revised their searches ( see Figure 4.) Most students ( n=32) experimented with \ndifferent search terms. Students also used filters, Boolean operators and quotation marks as part of their search strategies.    \n  \n\nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Vol. 15, Iss. 2 [2024], Art. 8  \nhttps://doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2024.2.15558   10 Figure 4  \nSearch St rategies U sed  \n  \nWe also looked for evidence of students\u2019 search perseverance, checking their capacity to \nrefine their search strategies when necessary. In their reflection logs, 79% of the students \nacknowledged their failed search attempts and 63% documented their iterative searches. Some of the refinement strategies include adapting the terms used in the search, use of additional filters or using alternative resources:     \n \nThe most challenging part of the assignment was figuring out what keywords to use. Much of the searche[s] that come up on google under \u2018search algorithm\u2019 are blogs or ad companies explaining SEO results for marketing purposes. I had to narrow my search to include \u2018 the truth\u2019 or \u2018problems with google search algorithm\u2019 to find more academic \nsources through Google. The library's database made it very easy to find academic articles, but for anything more basic like simple background information or news articles it was a  \nbit more of a challenge. (#17, Summer 2021)   \n  \nThe other source I feel fits here is the New York Times article on the recent changes to \nhow google will display information having to do with slander and other such problems. I \nhad to make a few searches and scroll through the news section a few times bef ore I came \nto an article from the \"Search Engine Journal\". Here, the SIFT method came handy as \nbefore, I would have simply used this website as my source, but, the article wasn't an \noriginal. It was simply an article about a NYT original. So, I stopped rea ding that article \nand traced the claims to the original, which was significantly more exhaustive and gave me \nbetter context behind the Google changes . (#5, Summer 2021)   \n Student #5 demonstrates how the SIFT method can be used to find resources in addition to \nevaluating them.    \n\nHendrigan et al.: Combining SIFT and the Information Needs, Types, and Qualities Approaches \nPublished by Scholarship@Western, 2024   11 Sentiments   \n \nOne of the prompts in the reflection assignment queried students\u2019 perceptions of the \nassignment. We asked, \u201cWas the SIFT method useful? Was the assignment useful?\u201d We \nqualitatively analyzed their responses and documented them in Figure 5. Twenty- six students made \npositive comments about SIFT and fourteen were explicitly positive about the assignment. We were surprised that none of the students in the sample expressed any negative or neutral sentiments toward the assignment or SIFT.     \n Figure 5   \nSentiment Analysis   \n  \n  \nPositive A bout SIFT and the A ssignment:    \n \nSome students expressed engagement with both the SIFT method and the unit overall, \nincluding the topic of the literature search.     \n All the SIFT methods proved useful. Investigating my sources made me more cautious of the sources I'm using, being able to eliminate questionable ones even if they make claims relevant to the topic. STOP made me think through how I can better improve my se arch \nand made me consider narrowing or broadening my search. Finally, finding better coverage meant I viewed various sources and compared their claims, and think about their biases and possible agendas. (#6, Summer 2021)     \nThis exercise was very useful and honestly, I wish I was taught it far in advance of my third \nyear in university... It would have made much of my previous academic endeavors easier. \n(#17, Summer 2021)     To be honest, I was really interested in this topic from the get -go. As a university student \nin 2021, I must confess that Google has been a lifeline in some situations. I wanted to know \nwhat scholars thought\u2026was [Google] negatively affecting me in the long run\u2026Another \ninteresting feature of this bibliography assignment is that it showed how different people \n\nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Vol. 15, Iss. 2 [2024], Art. 8  \nhttps://doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2024.2.15558   12 defined intelligence differently --whether it's the ability to seek out information, or retain it \nfor later, and which skill is more important in the long run. I can't help but wonder if Harari \nconsidered this --are there more important skills than searching  for information? What \nabout once we've obtained it?   (#4, Fall 2021)   \n \nDiscussion  \n \nOur research examined Caulfield and Wilkinson\u2019s research and evaluation strategies \nthrough the lens of two ACRL frames. More ambitiously, we also wanted students to learn about \nthe information ecosystem, Google, and reflect on their own research processes. We wanted to test Harari\u2019s assertion that people no longer know how to use search tools other than Google. Where other studies (Brodsky et al., 2021; Pavlounis et al., 2021)  largely isolated the SIFT evaluation \nfrom the search process, our combined approach is well suited for undergraduate students from a wide variety of disciplines. Ultimately , these skills can be transferred to other courses and research \nsituations outside the university setting and will influence a wide variety of decisions that we make as engaged citizens in a participatory democracy.    \nOur results confirm that the SIFT method can be useful in developing students\u2019 capacity to \nevaluate and find sources. SIFT\u2019s processes\u2014i nvestigating sources, finding better coverage, and \ntracing claims \u2014link to the knowledge practices and dispositions of both the Authority I s \nConstructed and Contextual and Searching as Strategic Exploration frames, prompting students to query authors\u2019 authority and publications\u2019 reputations, and employ mindful and deliberate search strategies for resource discovery. SIFT discourages simplistic approaches to assessing content, such as the scholarly versus popular trope. Additionally, SIFT fosters \u201cinformed skepticism,\u201d a disposition listed in the Authority I s Constructed and Contextual frame. We saw students \nconducting quick background checks on major publishers such as the New York Times and \nSpringer. The SIFT method facilitates learning the nuances of authority and familiarizes students \nwith publication types for different purposes, including academic, commercial, and non- profit \npublishers.    \nOur results also indicate that Wilkinson\u2019s Information Needs, Types and Qualities \nassignment is an effective method for students to further develop their knowledge practices and dispositions of the Searching as Strategic Exploration frame. His strategy addresses a lack of awareness of different sources and tools (Bloom & Deyrup, 2015) , and requires students to \ninvestigate different types and collections of information, such as statistics, news items, and published research. Figure 2 shows that most students used Google in concert with other sources, such as the library catalogue and subject databases. We also see, in Figure 3, students using a wide variety of sources mentioned in the tutorials, such as Statista  and Academic Search Premier. \nWilkinson\u2019s process aligns with Head and Eisenberg\u2019s recommendation (2009) that students should approach topics from multiple points of view and counter their propensity to use a minimal number of search strategies during their research process.    \nWe also looked for evidence of students\u2019 research flexibility and persistence, dispositions \nlisted in the Searching as Strategic Exploration Frame. Many students commented on how difficult the assignment was due to the ubiquity of the terms, such as Google  and intelligence. When their \ninitial searches\u2014often  on Google \u2014were unsuccessful, they adapted their search terms, applied \nfilters, modified their search syntax, and chose different databases. This persistence contrasts with Bloom and Deyrup\u2019s study (2015), where students were quick to abandon topics when their searches di d not provide adequate results. In our study, only 13% of students relied exclusively on \nHendrigan et al.: Combining SIFT and the Information Needs, Types, and Qualities Approaches \nPublished by Scholarship@Western, 2024   13 Google, and students generally demonstrated a high degree of flexibility when their initial searches \nretrieved disappointing results. Triangulating research logs with keystroke analysis, as Bloom and Deyrup did, would be worth investigating.   \nCaulfield and Wilkinson\u2019s approaches also acknowledge the importance of Google and the \nopen web, topics that receive minimal attention in librarian -led instruction sessions (Head & \nEisenberg, 2009) . After all, librarians are typically invited into classes to provide instruction on \nlibrary resources and collections, and normally have limited class time to do so. Adding learning objects that involve a broader understanding of the information ecosystem, which includes Google and the open web, is a challenge. Wilkinson and Caulfield\u2019s approach thus provides a pragmatic alternative to a \u201cno Google\u201d pedagogy. Wilkinson argues, \u201cGoogle is not our enemy\u201d (2017); indeed, he teaches news sources via Google or social media, in their naturalistic settings, rather than sending students to newspaper databases. Similarly, Caulfield\u2019s curriculum teaches students to leverage Google to evaluate sources, but also articulates how its results are commonly a source of misinformation (Caulfield, 2017) .   \nDespite some difficulty researching the claims, the students found this exercise useful and \neven enjoyable, as evidenced in Figure 5. The positive sentiments support prior research where students received instruction that combined algorithms and information literacy (Head et al., \n2020) . We confirm that the topic of Google and the i mpact of algorithms on their research practices \nare relatable to students who have been using search engines their entire lives. We challenged them to research, and ultimately support or refute Harari\u2019s provocative claims on their own search and decision-m aking capacities. Students also appreciated the opportunity to expand their knowledge \nof different databases and learn the SIFT technique for source evaluation and discovery, which provides them with a feeling  of agency over their own research capabilities.    \nFinally, we note that the reflection passage, where students recounted their search process, \nbenefited both the students and the research team in multiple ways. First, the reflection passage \nprovided the research team with a dataset that enabled assessment and analysis of students\u2019 search \nprocesses.  For the most part, students\u2019 research processes remain a mystery to both librarians and \ncourse instructors. Without the reflection require ment, we can view only students\u2019 works cited list, \nthe output of their search processes. This component of the unit confirms why research logs should be widely employed in information literacy instruction (Fluk, 2015) .    \nFurthermore, the reflection passage required students to think about and articulate their \nown research strategies, and thereby stimulate metacognition. While other methods can be used to examine search processes and metacognition, such as keystroke analysi s (Bloom & Deyrup, 2015; \ninterviews (Head & Eisenberg, 2010), questionnaires (McCoy, 2022; Catalano, 2017;   Robertson \net al., 2022), and eye tracking software (Zhou, 2023), we felt it was important to query these cognitive processes within the assignment itself. An added advantage to our technique was its ease in implementation.  While we did not specifically code for metacognition in this study, we noticed \nthat students frequently made comments indicating an awareness of their own research habits and \npractices prior to and following the assignment. However, we realize that we could refine the reflection questions, particularly where we ask whether the SIFT method was usef ul. Instead, we \nshould re -frame the question as, \u201cHow did you find the assignment useful?\u201d or use a Likert scal e.   \n Conclusion   \nThis study provides an information literacy pedagogy that both acknowledges Google\u2019s \nrole in research and incorporates a wide variety of library resources. Our approach is novel in \nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Vol. 15, Iss. 2 [2024], Art. 8  \nhttps://doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2024.2.15558   14 several ways: with the ACRL Framework in mind, we combined Wilkinson\u2019s search and \nCaulfield\u2019s evaluation pedagogy, layered these strategies with a research reflection passage, and developed an assessment rubric. In addition to our instruction strategy, we chose a research topic on the information ecosystem and how algorithms and Big Data affect students themselves. This unit therefore provides a model for \u201cproactive evaluation,\u201d (Bull et al., 2021)  which fosters the \nability for researchers to evaluate their sources, reflect on their search results, and consider what is missing. These knowledge practices and dispositions, to use the Framework\u2019s terminology, are lifelong research skills.    \nThis unit could be used in a multitude of settings across the university. Indeed, this \napproach is suitable for anyone who is not a subject expert on a topic. It acknowledges the utility of reading a wide variety of sources in the learning process and leverages the work of writers who source and translate subject experts. This fosters a holistic consideration of the information ecosystem and discourages binary thinking about good and bad sources. Furthermore, the unit, which includes a reflective passage an d a structured bibliography of source types, facilitates \nfeedback from the instructor on the students\u2019 research processes and chosen sources. If students demonstrate gaps or deficiencies in their research processes, such as a lack of awareness of a subject database, or a lack of knowledge for a search term that could result in better results, \ninstructors can intervene.   \nWe acknowledge that this entire unit is not appropriate for a one -shot instruction session \ncommon in university settings (Bowles -Terry, 2016). It includes multiple components: a reading, \nonline tutorials, a librarian\u2019s presentation and an assignment. The instructor must have the capacity to commit a considerable amount of time and resources to this unit. However, the Principal Investigator has adapted the unit in other 100 -level writing courses in the Faculty of Applied \nSciences. In some courses, the PI had  students complete the online tutorials, followed by a \npresentation on Caulfield\u2019s SIFT strategy and Lane Wilkinson\u2019s Information Needs, Types, and \nQualities presentation. In two other courses, the librarian gave a similar SIFT/Information Needs, \nTypes, and Qualities presentation, and the students completed the bibliography and reflection assignment. In each adaptation, the search examples aligned with course content on the social and ethical implications of technology.   \nWe continue to refine the unit and hope to continue the research. Future studies could \nassess the data considering other aspects of the unit, including an analysis of the content of the bibliographies, and a study of the research assignments that followed this unit. We could also develop a coding schema for other knowledge practices and dispositions listed in the Framework, such as metacognition. Finally, we would like to more formally and deliberately solicit student feedback on the assignment, include a survey, and possibly triangulate student survey responses with their grades. We strongly believe that this approach benefits students and we will take opportunities to promote its continued adoption in other settings. We owe it to students to disprove Harari\u2019s simplistic claim that Google has supplanted all other research approaches.    \n \nReferences  \n Association of College & Research Libraries. (n.d.).

The rhetoric of unblock ads\nAbstract\nOur times are characterized by a rapid evolution of means and ways of communication. Thanks to the Internet, the genres of pers uasive \nfunctional texts are constantly appearing (and disappearing). These include messages encouraging to unblock advertisements. The  \nmessage sender aims at convincing the Internet user to uninstall the adblocker (the name comes from the most popular AdBlock software), resign, or at least to add the given website to the so-called white list because the service earns money thanks to t he \ndisplayed ads. In this article I analyze a text corpus of 50 examples, mainly in Polish, using a research apparatus of rhetoric . On \nthis basis, I discuss genre characteristics and distinctive argumentation strategies, which - as the analysis shows - can be ar ranged in\na system de \ufb01 ned by two axes: potential losses or pro \ufb01 ts and agency, which can be in the domain of either the sender or the recipient. \nAs a result, I present typical patterns of contemporary messages encouraging to unblock advertisements on the Internet.\nNasze czasy charakteryzuje szybka ewolucja \u015brodk\u00f3w i sposob\u00f3w komunikacji.
