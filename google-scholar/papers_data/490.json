Persis-\ntent manipulation of social media has resulted in increased\nconcerns regarding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, due\nto its potential to influence individual opinions and social dy-\nnamics. In this work, we focus on the identification of dis-\ntorted facts, in the form of unreliable and conspiratorial narra-\ntives in election-related tweets, to characterize discourse ma-\nnipulation prior to the election. We apply a detection model\nto separate factual from unreliable (or conspiratorial) claims\nanalyzing a dataset of 242 million election-related tweets.\nThe identified claims are used to investigate targeted topics\nof disinformation, and conspiracy groups, most notably the\nfar-right QAnon conspiracy group. Further, we characterize\naccount engagements with unreliable and conspiracy tweets,\nand with the QAnon conspiracy group, by political leaning\nand tweet types. Finally, using a regression discontinuity de-\nsign, we investigate whether Twitter\u2019s actions to curb QAnon\nactivity on the platform were effective, and how QAnon ac-\ncounts adapt to Twitter\u2019s restrictions.\nIntroduction\nDisinformation and social media manipulation has threat-\nened the integrity of elections and democracies around the\nworld. In the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, official in-\nvestigations by the U.S. Congress revealed the presence of\nRussian state-backed operations attempting to manipulate\nthe U.S. political landscape. In the years following the in-\nvestigation, social media platforms like Twitter and Face-\nbook have actively documented several other suspicious op-\nerations linked to Russia, Iran, Venezuela, China and other\ncountries (Gadde and Roth 2018), suggesting presence of\npersistent efforts to manipulate online discussions. Although\nsocial media has been instrumental in shaping conversations\naround social and political issues (Loader and Mercea 2011),\nits positive effects have been undermined by disinformation\nand manipulation. The promotion of disinformation, propa-\nganda, and politically divisive narratives have been regularly\nseen in many social contexts (Sharma et al. 2021; Bessi and\nFerrara 2016; Martin and Shapiro 2020).\nCopyright \u00a9 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.Distortion of facts to promote disinformation and propa-\nganda greatly reduces trust in online systems, because of\nits ability to influence both individual opinions and social\ndynamics (Van der Linden 2015; Nyhan and Reifler 2010).\nAt an individual level, exposure to unreliable and conspir-\natorial narratives has been observed to influence people\u2019s\nperceptions of the truth and decrease pro-social behaviours\n(Van der Linden 2015; Nyhan and Reifler 2010). Moreover,\nwith polarized and partisan narratives, it can further exacer-\nbate prejudices and ideological separations (Jolley, Meleady,\nand Douglas 2020). Secondly, the disinformation landscape\nis complex, with possibilities for injecting disinformation,\npropaganda, and influencing the discourse through automa-\ntion (Ferrara et al. 2020), coordination (Sharma et al. 2021),\ncompromised accounts, follow trains and others (Torres-\nLugo, Yang, and Menczer 2020). The range of activities can\nbe widespread, with both concealed and overt efforts to pro-\nmote manipulative narratives.\nIn the context of the 2020 U.S. 2020 presidential elec-\ntion, held on November 3, 2020, since Twitter is recognized\nas one of the social media platforms with the most news-\nfocused users, with significant following in U.S. politics\n(Hughes and Wojcik 2019), we investigate and character-\nize disinformation on Twitter, with an analysis of more than\n240 million election-related tweets, collected between June\n20, 2020 and September 6, 2020. We focus on the following\nresearch questions to characterize online engagement with\ndisinformation and conspiracies:\n\u2022R1. What are the prevalent disinformation and con-\nspiracy narratives on Twitter preceding the U.S. 2020\nElection? We apply and train a detection model to sepa-\nrate factual from unreliable (or conspiratorial) claims to\nexamine how the political discourse was manipulated.\n\u2022R2. How significant is the impact and reach of disin-\nformation and conspiracy groups in terms of account\nengagements (characterized by activity level, political\nleaning, tweet types, and propagation dynamics)? We\ncharacterize account engagements with the QAnon con-\nspiracy group, and we compare propagation dynamics of\nunreliable/conspiracy and reliable engagement cascades.\n\u2022R3. Did Twitter\u2019s restrictions on QAnon influence its\nactivities and were they effective in limiting the con-\nspiracy? We investigate activity before/after the restric-\nProceedings of the Sixteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2022)\n908\ntion and factors driving the sustained activity of QAnon\naccounts, and we test if QAnon accounts adapted to Twit-\nter\u2019s restrictions using a regression discontinuity design.\nContributions and Findings. The findings of the research\nquestions studied in this paper are as follows,\n\u2022 Applying CSI (Ruchansky, Seo, and Liu 2017) to de-\ntect unreliable/conspiracy tweets in the election dataset,\nwe obtain validation AUC 0.8/F1 0.76. The prominent\ntopics of unreliable/conspiracy tweets preceding the\nelection included mail-in voter fraud, COVID-19, Black\nLives Matter, media censorship, and false claims and\nconspiracies about past and current political candidates.\n\u2022 While unreliable/conspiracy tweets were widespread\nand diverse, accounts engagements with such tweets\nwere less viral than with reliable tweets (i.e., mean time\nto reach unique accounts is higher, mean cascade breath\nis smaller). Yet, there can be several such tweets which\nmanage to receive substantial attention and engagements.\n\u2022 QAnon far-right conspiracies are quite prevalent on\nTwitter, and we find that 85.43% of all accounts did\nnot have an observed interaction with QAnon accounts\n(i.e., accounts with QAnon conspiracy related keywords\nin their tweets), but the fraction of such accounts is much\nsmaller (34.42%) in the 1.2M active accounts (i.e., with\nat least 20 tweets/retweets/replies in the dataset). Their\ninfluence however extends to fewer accounts, compared\nto the expected influence of a random sample of the ac-\ntive accounts. Interactions of QAnon accounts suggests\nthat they try to engage in active discussions (bidirec-\ntional replies) with left-leaning accounts to \u201cred pill\u201d\n(i.e., transform perspectives with disturbing revelations),\nwhile right-leaning interactions include replies/retweets.\n\u2022 QAnon accounts\u2019 activities before and after the Twit-\nter ban (restrictions) in July, 2020 indicate that older\naccounts (created before the ban, rather than new ac-\ncounts) continue to sustain the volume of tweets, but\nadapt to alternate hashtags related to their conspiracies\nand increased tweeting volume to continue pushing their\nconspiracy, and counteract the Twitter restrictions (as\ninferred by causal effect estimation using a regression\ndiscontinuity design to identify statistically significant\nchanges in QAnon hashtag usage before/after the ban).\nRelated Work\nSocial media manipulation has been observed in political\ndiscourse in several countries (Woolley and Howard 2017).\nHowever, changing strategies of social media manipulation\ncontinue to challenge our understanding and findings on ma-\nlicious activities on the network (Cresci 2020). Twitter re-\nported seeing some of the operations as being less clandes-\ntine and more overt efforts to promote disinformation than\nthey have in recent years (Miles P. 2020). Therefore, iden-\ntification and analysis of disinformation and its landscape\npreceding the U.S. 2020 election is vital, along with char-\nacterization of account engagements with disinformation, to\nestimate its risks, and investigate the effectiveness of inter-\nventions and actions to limit it.With regards to U.S. elections, recent papers attempt\nto uncover different aspects of social media manipulation.\n(Bessi and Ferrara 2016) discovered tens of thousands of\nbot accounts distorting the 2016 election-related Twitter dis-\ncourse, in what turned out to be an effort associated with\nthe Russian Internet Research Agency (Badawy et al. 2019).\n(Luceri, Cardoso, and Giordano 2020) conducted a year long\nanalysis of bot activity on Twitter before the 2018 midterm\nelection. Based on detection of bot-like behaviours in ac-\ncounts, they found that 33% of bots were active even one\nyear prior to the midterm, and new bots were introduced\ninto the discussion progressively up to the midterm. Nine-\nteen thousand highly-active bots generated a large volume\nof 30M political messages, and humans were susceptible to\nretweeting bots with one-third of their retweets being con-\ntent pushed by bots. (Ferrara et al. 2020) observed high vol-\nume of tweets from bot-like accounts prior to the Novem-\nber election, and found highly partisan retweeting behav-\nior among bots and humans. (Ferrara et al. 2020) also an-\nalyzed distortion with three types of conspiracy hashtags,\ni.e. QAnon, -gate conspiracies such as pizzagate andobam-\nagate, and COVID-19 conspiracies, and found 13% of all ac-\ncounts sharing the conspiracy hashtags were suspected bots.\nThey also found that accounts sharing content from right-\nleaning media were almost 12 times more likely to share\nconspiratorial narratives than left-leaning media accounts.\nTracking the growth of the QAnon conspiracy from fringe\nonline subcultures to mainstream media over one year,\n(de Zeeuw et al. 2020) found that after the incubation pe-\nriod on 4chan/pol in Oct 2017, the movement had quickly\nmigrated to larger platforms, notably YouTube and Reddit,\nand was covered by news media only when it moved off-line.\nIn terms of cross-platforms effects, (Papasavva et al. 2021)\nfound spike in new account registrations on V oat after Red-\ndit ban on QAnon threads in Sept 2018. They also studied\ncontent of QAnon posts finding discussions related to pre-\ndecessor Pizzagate conspiracy, and \u201cQ drops\u201d, which refer\nto the cryptic posts meant for adherents of the conspiracy to\ndecode, and found more submissions but less comments in\nQAnon threads compared to general threads.\nAddressing growing concerns around conspiracy commu-\nnities, (Phadke, Samory, and Mitra 2021) investigated what\nindividual and social factors promote users to join conspir-\nacy communities. Their findings on Reddit suggest that di-\nrect interactions (i.e., replies) with conspiracists is the most\nimportant social precursor for joining (i.e., first contribu-\ntion to) a conspiracy community. (Silva et al. 2020), on the\nother hand, investigated which factors are most predictive\nof engagements with factual and misleading tweets, finding\nfollower-friend ratio, banner image or URL in user profile,\npresence of image in the tweet, as most relevant, and fac-\ntual tweets were more engaging in COVID-19 tweets. Dif-\nferently from the papers, we focus on characterization of in-\nteractions with QAnon accounts, based on political leaning\nand tweet types, and on their activities and strategies to en-\ngage with other accounts and escape Twitter\u2019s restrictions.\n909\nStatistic Count\nTweets 242,087,331\nUsers accounts 10,392,492\nUnreliable/conspiracy URLs cascades 3,162\nReliable URLs cascades 4,320\nUnlabeled cascades 192,103\nAvg. cascade size (# engagements) 57.11\nAvg. cascade time (in hrs) 80.42\nAvg. time between engagements (hrs) 5.93\nTable 1: Detection dataset statistics.\nData Collection\nFor the analysis, we start from the dataset collected in (Chen,\nDeb, and Ferrara 2021) which tracks election related tweets\nfrom May, 2019 onwards, and contains over approximately\none billion tweets.1The dataset was collected by tracking\nmentions of official and personal accounts of Republican\nand Democratic candidates in the presidential election us-\ning Twitter\u2019s streaming API service, which returns matches\nin tweet content and metadata within a \u223c1% sample of the\nstream of all tweets. The details of the tracked mentions and\ndistribution of frequent hashtags and bigrams in the data are\navailable in (Chen, Deb, and Ferrara 2021).\nFor this analysis, we focus on the tweets that appeared\nbetween June 20, 2020 and September 6, 2020, in or-\nder to study the disinformation surfaced on Twitter in the\nmonths preceding the election. This subset of the data con-\ntains242,087,331election-related tweets from 10,392,492\nunique users. We focus on engagements, therefore, it is use-\nful to define four tweet types considered here: (i) Original\ntweets (accounts can create content and post on Twitter) (ii)\nreply tweets (iii) retweeted tweets, which reshare without\ncomment (iv) quote tweets (embed a tweet i.e., reshare with\ncomment). Engagements are defined here as one of the tweet\ntypes other than original tweets (and engagements can be\nwith original tweets or other tweet types also).\nDisinformation Detection Methodology\nIn this section, we present the methodology to separate fac-\ntual from unreliable (or conspiratorial) claims in election-\nrelated tweets. Conspiracies theories are attempts to explain\nevents or situations, often postulated on most likely false and\nunverifiable theories, and may be politically motivated (Fer-\nrara et al. 2020; Phadke, Samory, and Mitra 2021). To cap-\nture distortion aimed at manipulation of public opinion, we\nfocus on any kind of unreliable (likely false or misleading)\nnarratives, including conspiracies promoted prior to the elec-\ntion. The term disinformation is used here as an umbrella\nterm to refer to distorted narratives appearing in the form\nof unreliable, including conspiratorial claims. In literature,\nthe term disinformation separates itself from misinformation\nbased on intent to manipulate vs. lack thereof (Sharma et al.\n2019). However, since we do not assess intent from tweets,\nwe do not make a distinction between the two terms.\n1Dataset:https://github.com/echen102/us-pres-elections-2020Model Specifications\nDetection Model. We apply CSI, a supervised deep learn-\ning based model in (Ruchansky, Seo, and Liu 2017) for dis-\ninformation detection. The model captures three main sig-\nnals or features: source, text, temporal, which are useful for\ndisinformation detection (Ruchansky, Seo, and Liu 2017;\nSharma et al. 2019). To classify a tweet, the model con-\nsiders time-ordered sequence of engagements that the tweet\nreceives, along with temporal information such as the fre-\nquency and time intervals between engagements. In addi-\ntion, it learns the source characteristic, based on account be-\nhaviours i.e., which accounts co-engage with a given tweet.\nThese input signals are useful for differentiating disinfor-\nmation tweets. In general, engagements or social context are\nuseful to learn predictive features, as they provide feedback\nfrom other accounts through engagement dynamics (Sharma\net al. 2019). The model needs to be provided training data\ncontaining labeled cascades (i.e., tweets with its engage-\nments), We describe the process for labeling data and ex-\ntracting features (cascades) for training the detection model\nin the following paragraphs.\nReliable, Unreliable and Conspiracy URLs. We collect\nlists of unreliable and conspiracy news sources from three\nfact-checking resources on low-credibility news sources:\nMedia Bias/Fact2, NewsGuard3, and Zimdars (2016). News-\nGuard maintains a repository of news publishing sources\nthat have actively published false information about the re-\ncent COVID-19 pandemic. The listed sources from News-\nGuard, accessed on September 22, 2020 are included, along\nwith low and very low factual sources listed as question-\nable from Media Bias/Fact Check, and sources tagged with\nunreliable or related labels from Zimdar\u2019s list. We sepa-\nrately collect mainstream reliable news sources referencing\nWikipedia4. In total, we obtained 124 mainstream reliable\nand 1380 unreliable (or conspiracy) news sources. Original\ntweets sharing URLs published from these news sources are\nthereby labeled as reliable and unreliable/conspiracy respec-\ntively. In addition, we also label tweets that are retweets,\nreplies, or quotes sharing such URLs, if the parent of the\ntweet is not in the collected tweets (1% Twitter sample).\nInformation Cascades and Cascade Statistics. To train\nthe detection model, we first extract cascades of engage-\nments from the dataset. Information cascades represent the\ndiffusion or spread of information on the network. Each\ncascade corresponds to a time-ordered sequence of engage-\nments (retweets, quotes and replies), that originate at a\nsource tweet and spread through chains of retweets, quotes\nand replies. Formally, a cascade can be denoted as Cj=\n[(u1, tw 1, t1),(u2, tw 2, t2),\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(un, twn, tn)], where the tu-\nple corresponds to an original tweet, or an engagement with\nthe original tweet or its predecessor engagements, and repre-\nsents the user (u), tweet (tw), and temporal (t) dimensions of\nwhen the user posted the tweet or engagement.

We find that this can be achieved by sub-\nsampling cascades with a minimum number of engage-\nments, and accounts with highest active and passive engage-\nments with other accounts in the dataset5. For accounting\nfor>75% of the tweets, we find cascade size of 5, and\n7471 highest engaging accounts was sufficient. This results\nin\u223c200K cascades (192K unlabeled, and rest labeled with\n3120 unreliable and 4320 reliable cascades). The full cas-\ncades comprise engagements from accounts outside of the\nsubsampled accounts, and span the large fraction of dataset\ntweets. Full cascades are used in the analysis of identified\ndisinformation cascades, but for training and inference with\nCSI, the subsampled accounts in these cascades are utilized.\nTable 1 provides statistics of data and training cascades.\nModel Evaluation\nTable 2 reports 5-fold cross validation results obtained using\nCSI on the labeled cascades. The metrics reported are the\nROC AUC average precision AP score. We also reported the\nF1, Precision, Recall and macro-F1 at the detection thresh-\nold selected from the ROC curve, that achieves maximum\ngeometric mean of validation set sensitivity and specificity.\nFor comparison, we evaluate it against several baselines:\n(i)SVM- RBF on text features of the cascade source tweet,\nextracted with doc2vec. (ii)GRU (Ma et al. 2016) which uti-\nlizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify the cas-\ncade based on text features of the time-ordered sequence of\nengagements in the cascade. (iii)CI, which can be consid-\nered as a variant of the CSI model, utilizes only tweet text\nand account metadata features of the engagements as input\nto a RNN for classification. (iv)CI-t, another variant of the\nCSI model, utilizes tweet features of engagements, and in\naddition temporal information of time intervals between en-\ngagements as input to a RNN. (v) CSI model, which includes\nall three features (tweet features of engagements, temporal\ninformation, and account behaviours).\n5Active refers to tweets (original, retweet, reply, quote) from the\naccount, whereas passive means the account has been involved in\nanother account\u2019s tweets (retweeted, replied, quoted, or mentioned)The CSI model has AUC 0.8 and high recall and is there-\nfore used for inference on unlabeled cascades. The ensemble\nof CSI models trained over five folds are used for inference.\nWe take the top 80th and bottom 80% percentile, of cascades\npredicted with the largest margins above and below the de-\ntection threshold, resulting in 72,228 unreliable and 81,453\nreliable classified cascades respectively. The engagements\nor tweets forming the reliable cascades constitute about two\nthird of the total tweets in all cascades.\nFor human validation, we take a random sample of 50\ncascades from ones labeled by the model (Note: the list of\nvalidated tweets is provided in supplementary materials). In\n2/50 (4%) the model label differed from the label assigned\nby inspecting the tweet and its account for suspensions. The\nmodel errors included a tweet critical of the postal system\nand though non conspiratorial, could have been mistaken for\nclaims related to mail-in voter fraud by the model, and an-\nother which strongly supported criticism of China by presi-\ndent Trump, although not from a suspended account and un-\nlikely part of QAnon/conspiracy groups, was predicted unre-\nliable. To reiterate, these validated cascades were uniformly\nsampled from cascades that were assigned labels using CSI,\nconsidering predictions with largest margins from the detec-\ntion threshold, as discussed earlier using the ensemble of 5-\nfold classifiers, and the expected lower error rate, confirmed\nby validation suggests it can be reliably used in analysis.\nMethodology for Inferring Political Leaning\nIn this section, we describe the methodology we use to infer\npolitical leaning of accounts on the network. The inferred\npolitical leanings are used later in the analysis and charac-\nterization of the disinformation landscape. Similar to prior\nwork (Ferrara et al. 2020), we use the list of 29 prominent\nnews outlets classified as left, lean left, center, lean right,\nright as per ratings provided by allsides.com.6We consider\nleft and lean left classified outlets as the left-leaning, and\nright and lean right as right-leaning.\nModel Specifications\nFor accounts that tweeted or retweeted URLs published\nfrom these news outlets, we characterize their political lean-\ning by measuring the average bias of the media outlets they\nendorsed. This gives us a set of labeled accounts with known\npolitical leaning labels based on the media URLs. To infer\nlabels of other accounts, we can propagate labels from this\nknown set (also called the seed set i.e., accounts with known\n6https://www.allsides.com/media-bias\n911\npolitical leaning labels based on the media URLs) to other\naccounts based on interactions between accounts.\nWe utilize the retweet network to infer political lean-\ning of other accounts starting from the seed set accounts.\nRetweeting is a form of endorsement, different from other\ntweet types, and accounts which retweet each other tend to\nshare the same political biases (Badawy et al. 2019). To that\nend, we use Louvain method (Blondel et al. 2008) to iden-\ntify communities in the retweet graph, where edge weights\nrepresent the number of retweets between accounts. The\nmethod optimizes modularity which provides a measure of\nedge density within communities compared to across com-\nmunities. We assign political leaning to each identified com-\nmunity, using the average political leaning of media URLs\nendorsed by accounts in the seed set that belong to the com-\nmunity. The seed set accounts with high entropy in distri-\nbution of left-leaning and right-leaning URLs (close to uni-\nform distribution with margin of 0.2), and ones that shared\nless than 10 URLs from the media outlets are filtered out.\nInference of Political Leanings\nUsing media outlets, we obtain a seed set of 114K accounts\nfrom 10.4M accounts in the dataset. To limit the size of\nthe retweet network, we consider the top active 1.2M ac-\ncounts that appeared (in original tweet, retweet, quote, or\nreply tweet) at least 20 times in the collected dataset.\nUsing the seed set and retweet graph of 1.2M accounts,\ngives a resulting inferred network with large left-leaning\ncommunities of 540,719 and 68,197 accounts and two\nsmaller left-leaning ones, and large right-leaning commu-\nnities of 480,982 and 10,723 accounts, and multiple smaller\nones. Of the 1.2M accounts, we were able to infer the politi-\ncal leaning of 92% of the accounts. The rest of the accounts\nremain undetermined due to high entropy in left and right-\nleaning URLs shared, or with communities that had fewer\nthan two seed accounts. We thereby identified 610,430 left-\nleaning and 500,804 right-leaning in the 1.2M accounts.\nVerification. We measure the accuracy of inferred lean-\nings based on three types of evaluations (i) Media URL la-\nbels i.e., based on the averaged political leaning of left/right\nleaning media outlets endorsed in tweets from the account\n(However since media URL labels are also used as seed set\nlabels during inference, therefore for evaluation we report\naveraged 5-fold results wherein 20% of the seed labels are\nheld-out and kept unseen during inference). (ii) Profile de-\nscriptions, i.e., based on whether the account profile descrip-\ntion dominantly included left or right leaning hashtags (the\nhashtags were classified as left/right through human valida-\ntion of most frequently used 3,000 hashtags. The list is pro-\nvided in supplementary material). (iii) Manual verification\nbased on inspection of tweets of randomly sampled subset\nof accounts (i.e., based on explicitly stated party affiliation\nin tweet or account profile, or expressed support of left/right\npresidential candidate/party, and assigned \u2018center\u2019 instead of\nleft/right if non-partisan). We sampled 100 inferred accounts\nuniformly at random, and 124 inferred accounts by strati-\nfied sampling based on degree distribution of accounts in\nthe retweet graph, to ensure coverage of dense and sparselyMediaURLs Profile Desc.

Here, we added an alternative baseline based on La-\nbel propagation (Badawy et al. 2019) for comparison. The\ntotal error rate was 4.46% on manually verified labels for\nboth methods (label propagation (LP) and Louvain (Lo) used\nhere, on RT graph from same media URL labeled seed set)\nand results were robust on both. Error analysis on the man-\nually labeled set, suggests that errors included few accounts\nthat are actually neither left/right leaning (but center), e.g.,\nU.S. Department of State, reporter accounts, or unrelated\nor disinterested in U.S. politics, and were erroneously clas-\nsified as left/right leaning. Other mistakes included anti-\nTrump conservatives that were inferred as left-leaning, or\nwith high entropy in left/right leaning views in their tweets.\nResults and Analysis\nIn the following subsections, we analyze identified unreli-\nable/conspiracy cascades, and characterize account engage-\nments. We characterize disinformation topics, QAnon con-\nspiracy group and its interactions with left and right demo-\ngraphics, their activities, effect of Twitter\u2019s restrictions, and\npropagation dynamics of engagements with disinformation.\nDisinformation Topic Modeling\nTopic Modeling. We use topic modeling to identify\nprominent topics that were targets of disinformation prior to\nthe election. With identified unreliable/conspiracy cascades,\nwe can model the topics in tweet text associated with the\nsource (first) tweet in the cascade.

The resultant clusters are in Fig 1. For\neach cluster, top words ordered by highest tf-idf scores,\nalong with an example tweet from 100 most representative\ntweets of the cluster are shown. The major themes relate to\nfalse claims about mail-in voter fraud, COVID-19 and push-\ning hydroxychloroquine as a cure, and protests concerning\nlaw enforcement and Black Lives Matter. Other topics target\nspecific candidates and entities, such as social media plat-\nforms for censorship of unverified and conspiratorial con-\ntent, conspiracies and allegations against former president\nObama, or targeting the democratic party as a whole on dif-\nferent social issues, and misleading claims about jobs and\neconomy.

We identify accounts that\nactively form part of the conspiracy group by posting orig-\ninal content related to QAnon conspiracies, referred to as\nQAnon accounts thereafter. We extract tweets (original,\nquote, or reply tweets) excluding retweets containing any\nkeywords or hashtags frequently associated with the QAnon\ngroup. Table 5 lists the QAnon associated keywords with\ntheir frequencies. This gives 92,065 accounts with posts con-\ntaining QAnon associated keywords. 7,661 of these were in-\nferred left-leaning accounts, for 10,085 the political lean-\ning was undetermined (not inferred), and the rest were in-\nferred as right-leaning. For accounts posting QAnon key-\nwords, grouped by the inferred political leaning, we sampled\n100 accounts uniformly at random from each group (left,\nright, undetermined), and inspected their tweets to identifyKeyword Freq.

Among the 100 inferred left accounts,\n19% were mistakenly inferred as left-leaning (and were pro-\nmoters of the conspiracy), 79% were not part of the con-\nspiracy group and only referencing the QAnon movement\n(oppose, ridicule, discuss or tag in their tweets containing\nQAnon keywords), and 2% were using the \u201cpedogate\u201d hash-\ntag in a different context as compared to how the hashtag\nwas used by QAnon conspirators. Among the inferred right-\nleaning accounts, all were verified to be QAnon accounts.\nBased on this observation, we retained the inferred right-\nleaning accounts posting QAnon associated keywords as the\nidentified QAnon accounts (since they indicate with high\nprecision support of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theo-\nries). This two-stage filtering for QAnon accounts identifica-\ntion, results in 100% precision and 88% recall based on the\nverified examples weighted by actual number of accounts\nin each type (words not included as QAnon associated key-\nwords are not considered in the recall measure).\nQAnon Interaction Graph.

In-\nfluenced accounts are those that have been influenced by\n(retweeted, quoted, or replied to) QAnon accounts tweets,\nwhereas influencer are accounts that QAnon accounts have\nretweeted, quoted or replied to. Table 7 reports what per-\ncentage of all accounts were influenced but did not influence\nQAnon (ID-only), influencer but not influenced (IR-only),\nand both influencer and influenced in the data (IR&ID).\nWe find that 85.43% of 10.4M accounts had no observed\ninteraction with QAnon accounts in the collected tweets.\nHowever, considering accounts that appeared in at least 20\ntweets (original, reply, retweet, quote) in the dataset, we find\nonly 34.42% of the active 1.2M accounts had no interaction\nwith QAnon accounts in the collected tweets. Also, we con-\nsider a random sample of accounts from the active 1.2M ac-\ncounts of the same sample size as % of QAnon accounts in\nthat set (drawn five times, and statistics averaged) for com-\nparison. IR&ID and IR-only are similar. The main difference\nis in the ID-only and Neither cases, wherein % of ID-only\n(QAnon influenced) accounts was fewer than the expected\ninfluence accounts of the random samples (30.98 vs. 47.01),\nand % of accounts not interacting with QAnon is higher than\nthat with the random samples (34.42 vs. 22.19).\nThe interaction graph of the 1.2M active accounts (ac-\ntivity >20 in the dataset) is visualized in Fig. 2. Thus,\n5.2% of these accounts are QAnon accounts, as described\nearlier. And 24.9% (IR&ID) are closely coupled accounts\nthat both influenced QAnon content and were influenced by\nRPQTD RTNot\n(RT/QTD)\nLeft-Leaning0.000.250.500.751.00\nRPQTD RTNot\n(RT/QTD)\nRight-Leaning0.000.250.500.751.00Figure 3: Fraction of inferred left/right-leaning accounts in\nthe active 1.2M accounts that interacted with QAnon ac-\ncounts with the mentioned tweet types.\nit (retweeted, quoted, replied). A larger 30.98% were only\ninfluenced (ID-only), while a small fraction of 4.5% were\nretweeted, quoted, or replied by QAnon, but did not engage\nback (IR-only). The edge weights in the interaction graph\ncorrespond to the volume of retweets, replies, or quoted\ntweets of the destination node by the source node, per ac-\ncount in the source node.\nQAnon Engagement Characteristics. Next, we character-\nize interactions with QAnon accounts by inferred political\nleaning and tweet types, in the active 1.2M accounts in\nFig. 8. As one would expect, the retweeted and quoted tweet\ninteractions are mostly between right-leaning and QAnon\naccounts (90.06% and 73.44%), as these are more close to\nendorsements. Replies on the other hand are roughly equally\ndistributed amongst left and right-leaning accounts (49.97%\nof replies by QAnon are towards left-leaning and 42.54% of\nthe replies to QAnon tweets are from left-leaning accounts).\nThis suggests that QAnon get engaged in active discus-\nsions with left-leaning accounts. This might also be indica-\ntive of engagement strategies by QAnon to influence liberals\nby \u201cred pilling\u201d, i.e., have their perspective transformed, il-\nlustrated in a QAnon account tweet which states:\n\u201cWe interact with liberals the most under realDon-\naldTrump\u2019s most recent posts.

Timeline of tweet volume\n(original, retweet, quote, reply) from QAnon accounts is vi-\nsualized in Fig. 4a. We separately plot the total daily vol-\nume of tweets and the daily volume of tweets containing the\nQAnon keywords (frequently associated with QAnon listed\nearlier in Table 5). As observed, although the volume of\ntweets with QAnon associated keywords sharply declines\nafter the Twitter Action, but the overall volume of activ-\nities from these accounts is sustained even after imposed\nbans and restrictions. This clearly suggests a gap in enforce-\nment actions and desired outcomes. So we investigate eva-\nsion strategies that rendered Twitter Action ineffective.\nIn Fig. 4b we inspect whether new QAnon accounts\nwere injected to continue activities after the Twitter Action.\nWhilst a declining and small fraction of new accounts were\nintroduced, the fraction of the total volume of QAnon ac-\ncount tweets attributed to new accounts created after Twitter\nAction is less than 3%. Clearly, much of the volume is sus-\ntained by earlier accounts even after the ban.\nEvasion Strategies With Emerging and Declining Hash-\ntags. Twitter restrictions attempted to make QAnon con-\ntent less visible, by banning QAnon-related content from\nappearing in trends and search. Therefore, we examine\nchanges in QAnon content through analysis of hashtag usage\npatterns, that could have been employed as evasion strate-\ngies to sidestep Twitter restrictions. To that end, we leverage\nregression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate causal ef-\nfects of Twitter intervention, on hashtags adopted by QAnon\naccounts. RDD is a design which elicits causal effects of in-\nterventions by assigning a threshold above/below which an\nintervention is assigned (Lee and Lemieux 2010). By com-\nparing observations lying closely on either side of the thresh-\nold, it is possible to estimate the average treatment effect\nfrom observed data, when randomized trials are infeasible.\n10https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-bans-7-\n000-qanon-accounts-limits-150-000-others-n1234541Hashtag |\u03b2| slope intercept p-value\nwwg1wga 1.512 -0.047 4.951 0.002\nqanon 0.901 -0.03 2.974 0.007\nkag 0.411 -0.002 1.419 0.000\nq 0.226 -0.004 0.584 0.000\nqarmy 0.207 -0.008 0.7 0.048\nwwg1gwa 0.139 -0.005 0.47 0.071\nqanons 0.108 -0.004 0.42 0.031\npatriotstriketeam 0.087 -0.001 0.164 0.010\ndeepstate 0.082 -0.001 0.233 0.000\ninittogether 0.067 -0.002 0.19 0.083\nTable 9: Top 10 hashtags that declined (\u03b2 < 0) in usage by\nQAnon post Twitter Action, estimated by regression discon-\ntinuity design in top 10K hashtags used by QAnon accounts.\nFor RDD, we consider each hashtag in the most frequent\n10K hashtags adopted in QAnon account tweets, and fit a\nlinear regression model on the hashtag\u2019s daily usage vol-\nume during the data collection period, with an additional\ntreatment variable assigned to the regression model to cap-\nture intervention effect. The regression model is as follows,\ny=mx+b+\u03b2I{x > x 0}. Here, the hashtag usage volume\nper day (i.e., how many times the hashtag was adopted in\ntweets from QAnon accounts), normalized by tweet volume\nfrom QAnon accounts on that day, is modeled by dependent\nvariable y, over each day x. The slope mand intercept b\ncaptures the trend in hashtag usage, and the coefficient \u03b2of\nthe treatment variable I{x > x 0}captures the discontinuity\nat threshold x0, selected as the end of the week that Twitter\nannounced and enforced its restrictions on QAnon.\nIn Table 9 and 10, we list identified hashtags with highest\nestimated treatment effects |\u03b2|(i.e., most change with re-\nspect to Twitter\u2019s intervention on QAnon with p-value of \u03b2\nat most 0.2) and highlighted in bold are p-value \u22640.05 i.e.,\n95% confidence interval.11In the assumed function, since a\n11The goodness of fit tests and other regression statistics, with\nfew illustrated examples of identified hashtags are in the Appendix.\n916\nHashtag |\u03b2| slope inter p-value\nwalkawayfromdemocrats 0.138 -0.001 0.145 0.000\nsaveourchildren 0.099 0.002 0.011 0.158\nhuge 0.074 -0.001 0.016 0.130\nheelsupharris 0.068 0.0 0.006 0.098\nvote 0.067 0.0 0.071 0.005\nwarroompandemic 0.065 -0.001 0.041 0.007\nth3d3n 0.064 -0.001 0.016 0.002\nwomenfortrump 0.061 0.0 0.086 0.133\nthesilentmajority 0.059 0.0 0.017 0.122\nsallyyates 0.058 -0.001 0.015 0.058\nhcqworksfauciknewin2005 0.055 -0.001 0.014 0.000\nnomailinvoting 0.053 0.0 0.014 0.000\nmo03 0.051 -0.001 0.015 0.032\ntrump2020victory 0.05 -0.001 0.03 0.001\nhermancain 0.05 -0.001 0.016 0.003\nbigpharma 0.05 -0.001 0.018 0.000\njimcrowjoe 0.05 -0.001 0.032 0.072\nbidenisapedo 0.049 -0.001 0.014 0.011\nvppick 0.049 -0.001 0.008 0.172\nhcqzinc4prevention 0.048 -0.001 0.015 0.000\nTable 10: Top 20 hashtags that increased (\u03b2 > 0) in usage by\nQAnon post Twitter Action, estimated by regression discon-\ntinuity design in top 10K hashtags used by QAnon accounts.\nTweet Type V ol./\nday\n(Before)V ol./\nday\n(After)% In-\ncrease\n(V ol./\nday)% De-\ncrease\n(Eng vol./\nQAnon\ntweet)\nQAnon 295,267 361,176 22.32 -\nRPTO 49,161 46,114 -6.2 23.32\nRT 177,013 189,387 6.99 12.53\nQTD 8908 8985 0.86 17.55\nTable 11: % Decrease in ratio of direct engagements (reply\nto, retweet, quote) with QAnon accounts tweets to volume\nof QAnon accounts tweets, before and after Twitter Action.\ncommon slope with different intercepts (b before interven-\ntion and b+\u03b2after intervention) is used to capture the esti-\nmated treatment effect, both coefficients \u03b2andmdetermine\nwhether the hashtag\u2019s usage declined or increased post in-\ntervention. For declining hashtags, \u03b2 < 0, m\u22640are in-\ndicators of decreased intercept post intervention, whereas\n\u03b2 > 0, m\u22650indicate increased intercept and increased\nhashtag usage post intervention. An error margin of \u00b10.001\nfrom 0was considered for the slope based on inspection of\nscatter plots of data for fitted regressions that were nearly\nparallel to the x-axis, resulting in difference of averages on\neither side of the intervention as estimated treatment effects.\nAs per Table 9 and 10, we can see a change of dis-\ncourse strategy in the hashtags used. The top declining\nones include \u201cWWG1WGA\u201d (where we go one, we go all),\n\u201cqanon\u201d, \u201cdeepstate\u201d and others which are directly related\nto the QAnon movement and the top increasing ones include\n\u201cwalkawayfromdemocrats\u201d, \u201cnomailinvoting\u201d and hijackedhashtag \u201csaveourchildren\u201d among others, which are not di-\nrectly related to Qanon, but to the conspiracy theories they\nare pushing. For example, the hashtag \u201csaveourchlidren\u201d has\nbeen detected as part of a strategy used by Qanon users to\nstay under cover and promote the conspiracy of child sex\ntrafficking by Democratic leaders12. It was later also ban-\nished (or limited) by platforms such as Facebook13.\nWe examined the change in volume of engagements (di-\nrect engagements in the form of replies to, retweets of,\nquotes of) with QAnon accounts tweets, following Twit-\nter intervention on QAnon (Tab 11). While the volume of\nretweet engagements per day per QAnon account tweet de-\ncreased by 12.53%, from earlier part of the timeline to later\nhalf after Twitter action, the overall volume of retweet en-\ngagements per day increased by \u223c7%. This can be explained\nby 22.32% increase in QAnon tweet volume per day, com-\npensating for decrease in engagements per tweet. Similar for\nquoted tweets, but for reply tweets the engagements volume\ndeclined overall by \u223c6% in the later half of the timeline.\nPropagation Dynamics of Election Cascades\nIn Fig. 5, we provide additional analysis of engagements\nwith unreliable/conspiracy tweets by comparing cascade\npropagation dynamics. The engagements with the unreli-\nable/conspiracy tweets appeared less viral (mean time to\nreach unique accounts is higher (Fig. 5d), and mean breadth\nof accounts reached at lesser depth of the propagation tree\nis smaller (Fig. 5b)). The propagation tree corresponding\nto each cascade was constructed from available retweet/re-\nply/quote links between tweets. Yet, there can be several un-\nreliable/conspiracy cascades that do get many engagements\n(cascade size CCDF (Fig 5a)). The findings about the prop-\nagation tree structure are similar to previous findings on un-\nverified information or rumor cascades (Friggeri et al. 2014).\nIn addition, unreliable/conspiracy cascades appear to have\nmore repeated engagements (reaching fewer unique users\nfor the same cascade size (Fig. 5c)), which is also observed\nin (Ruchansky, Seo, and Liu 2017).\nV osoughi, Roy, and Aral (2018) studied propagation dy-\nnamics of false and true news (verified on fact-checking\nwebsites e.g. snopes.com) on Twitter from 2006-2017. They\nfound that fact-checked false news was more viral (diffused\nfarther, faster, deeper and more broadly) than fact-checked\ntrue news. We note that the study provides useful find-\nings, however, is specific to information that has been fact-\nchecked (e.g. PolitiFact often fact-checks statements submit-\nted by readers, and mentions that since they cannot check\nall claims, they select the most newsworthy and significant\nones14) Also, the fact-checked true rumors would likely not\ninclude mainstream news articles. In comparison, our find-\nings about unreliable/conspiracy cascades being less viral\n12https://www.vox.com/21436671/save-our-children-hashtag-\nqanon-pizzagate\n13https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-is-limiting-\ndistribution-of-save-our-children-hashtag-over-qanon-ties/\n14https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-\ntruth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/\\#How\\%20we\\\n%20choose\\%20claims\n917\n2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5\nCascade Size (Log-Scale)0.00.20.40.60.81.0CCDFUnreliable/consp.\nReliable(a)\n0 100 200 300\nDepth0.00.20.40.60.81.0Mean Breadth \n (normalized by cascade size)Unreliable/consp.\nReliable\n0 100 2000.000.020.040.06 (b)\n (c)\n (d)\nFigure 5: Comparison of information propagation dynamics of reliable vs. unreliable/conspiracy cascades identified in election-\nrelated tweets.

Unfortunately, our findings also suggest\nthat Twitter actions to limit the QAnon conspiracy might not\nhave been sufficient and effective, and even known conspir-\nacy groups can adapt and evade imposed restrictions.\nIn conclusion, we discuss limitations of the current study.\nAlthough we find high recall of unreliable and conspiracy\nclaims with the CSI model based on cross-validation over\ntweets labeled using news source URLs, reducing false pos-\nitives is desirable for solutions to limit disinformation, with-\nout censoring free speech. Also, distorted narratives lie on\na spectrum of truth, that can be hard to assess. In addition,\nhere we regard right-leaning accounts that tweet pre-defined\nQAnon related keywords or hashtags as QAnon accounts.\nIn future work, it will be desirable to make finer distinctions\nto characterize conspiratorial vs. non-conspiratorial far-right\nnarratives in QAnon tweets, as well as to characterize tweets\nthat debunk QAnon conspiracies, and investigate account in-\nteractions based on these distinctions. We also discuss the\nlimitations of causal estimation from observational data. In\nRDD, since we do not control for confounding variables\nthat might be related to real-world events, it is possible that\na spike caused in a hashtag\u2019s usage near the intervention\nmight be attributed to the intervention, instead of a possi-\nble unrelated confounding event. Also, given the certainty\nof the Twitter action date, we use RDD with a hard thresh-\nold, which is a reasonable assumption based on inspection\nof the results; however, extensions to fuzzy RDD could be\nalternatively considered (Lee and Lemieux 2010).\nAnother interesting observation is that QAnon accounts\ninfluenced fewer accounts (ID-only) as compared to the ex-\npected influence of a random sample. This could suggest\nthat QAnon accounts are either not as influential or specifi-\ncally target a smaller audience. More investigation is needed\nFigure 6: RDD data plot for example hashtags (Left)\n\u201cwwg1wga\u201d (Middle) \u201cwalkawayfromdemocrats\u201d (Right)\n\u201cnomailinvoting\u201d before and after Twitter action (fraction of\nhashtag usage in volume of QAnon tweets \u2019y\u2019 vs. day \u2019x\u2019).\nto understand this behavior. Also given the limitation that\nQAnon accounts here are considered as ones that tweet\nQAnon group keywords, it is difficult to characterize if the\ninfluenced accounts are already part of the conspiracy group\n(promoters) or have been targeted by the group.\nWe also discuss inherent limitations in data collection.\nThe standard API allows access to a \u223c1% sample of the\nTwitter stream filtered based on tracked parameters. Since\nTwitter does not allow unpaid access to historical tweets\nolder than 7 days, it is hard to do iterative/snowball sam-\npling based on keyword expansions. Therefore, we rely on\ntracking candidate mentions in tweet text/metadata instead\nof manually selected fixed keywords. The inspected topics,\naccounts, and hashtags distributions do suggest comprehen-\nsive coverage of election events and disinformation.\nRegression Statistics\nWe conducted goodness-of-fit tests for the RDD regression\nfunction (illustrated examples in Fig 6). When comparing\ndifferent degree polynomials as chosen functions for RDD,\nwe found AIC and BIC were lowest for degree-1 (we mea-\nsured up to degree-4, since the results are similar we show\nonly degree-1 and degree-2 in the table). Degree-1 is the\nmodel used in the RDD analysis y=mx+b+\u03b2I(x > x 0)\n(Lee and Lemieux 2010). Adjusted R2, f-statistic and p-\nvalues of the coefficients also indicate degree-1 is preferred,\nsince the p-value of coefficient m2forx2term is not signif-\nicant at 0.05. The results were also consistent when separate\ncoefficients were used on either side of the intervention.\n918\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by NSF Research Grant (CCF-\n1837131), DARPA (HR001121C0169, W911NF-17-C-\n0094) and FA9550-20-1-0224.

BRONIATOWSKI\nGeorge Washington University, USA\nREBEKAH TROMBLE\nGeorge Washington University, USA\nUtilizing an original data set of public Telegram channels affiliated with a\nright-wing extremist group, the Proud Boys, we conduct an exploratory\nanalysis  of  the  structure  and  nature  of  the  group\u2019s  presence  on  the\nplatform.  Our  study  considers  the  group\u2019s  growth,  organizational\nstructure, connectedness with other far-right and/or fringe factions, and the\nrange of topics discussed on this alternative social media platform. The\nfindings show that the Proud Boys have a notable presence on Telegram,\nwith  a  discernable  spike  in  activity  coinciding  with  Facebook\u2019s  and\nInstagram\u2019s 2018 deplatforming of associated pages and profiles with this\nand other  extremist  groups.

These channels, primarily\nfrom the United States, also include international presences in Australia,\nNew Zealand, Canada, the UK, and Germany.

Content\nanalyses  of  this  network  highlights  several  prominent  and  recurring\nthemes, including opposition to feminism and liberals, skepticism toward\nofficial  information  sources,  and  propagation  of  various  conspiracy\nbeliefs. This study offers the first systematic examination of the Proud\nBoys on Telegram, illuminating how a far-right extremist group leverages\nthe latitude afforded by a relatively unregulated alternative social media\nplatform.\n \nKeywords: Proud Boys, Telegram, Far-right, Extremism\nIntroduction\nFounded by far-right political commentator and media personality Gavin McInnes\nin  2016,  the  Proud  Boys  are  an  all-male,  far-right  neo-fascist  group  that  describes\nthemselves  as  \u201cproud  Western  chauvinists  who  refuse  to  apologize  for  creating  the\nmodern world\u201d (McBain, 2020). They have been designated as a \u201cgeneral hate\u201d group by\nthe Southern Poverty Law Center and classified as an \u201cextremist group with ties to white\nnationalism\u201d  by  the  U.S.  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  (Wilson,  2018;\nRosenberg, 2018). As of 2021, the Proud Boys have had 116 chapters across 46 states in\nthe United States (ADL, 2021), as well as several international chapters in the UK,\nNorway, and Australia (Crawford, 2020). The organization has been linked to numerous\narrests and violent incidents, including high-profile events like the UC Berkeley protests\nand  the  Charlottesville  Unite  the  Right  rally  of  2017  (MacFarquhar,  2021).  In  the\nfollowing  years,  the  Proud  Boys  continued  to  engage  in  street  violence,  primarily\ntargeting their political opponents on the left. \n3 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nIn the months after the 2020 U.S. General Election, the propagation of the big lie\nby former President Donald Trump and his allies, which falsely alleged that the election\nwas stolen from the incumbent, generated ample opportunity and motivation for members\nof  the  Proud  Boys  to  engage  in  coordinated  violence,  particularly  against  left-wing\nprotestors in Democrat-heavy regions, such as Portland, Oregon (Hay, 2020). Members\nof the Proud Boys participated in \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events across the United States (Kishi,\nStall, and Jones, 2021), culminating in the January 6th, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol\nBuilding in Washington, DC. The group\u2019s visible participation in the attack assured that\nthe Proud Boys were a focal point for subsequent investigatory and prosecutory efforts by\nmultiple government agencies (Walker, 2022).\nThe Proud Boys have long relied on a variety of social media platforms for both\ninternal  and  external  communication  \u2013  including  recruiting  new  members,  planning\nactivities, growing solidarity among their adherents, and sharing their beliefs with the\nwider public in an effort to mainstream  or normalize their world view (Nguyen and\nGokhale, 2022). However, in  recent  years, major social media  platforms  have more\nstrictly regulated the group\u2019s presence and activities on their networks. In 2018, both\nTwitter and Facebook announced that they would deplatform the group and quickly\nremoved the largest accounts linked to the organization and its leaders (Linton, 2018).\nLike other right-wing extremist groups, the Proud Boys responded to these bans by\nmigrating to smaller, alternative social media platforms, such as Telegram (Walther and\nMcCoy, 2021). \nTelegram is a free cloud-based instant messaging platform created in 2013 by\nPavel and Nikolai Durov in response to the Russian state\u2019s censorship of online speech\n(Urman  and Katz, 2022). Telegram offers several  options for engagement, including\nprivate one-on-one conversations, group chats, and both private and public channels that\nare controlled by administrators. According to the Telegram website 1, the company does\nnot partake in extensive content-moderation policies compared to apps like Facebook,\n1 Please visit https://telegram.org/faq for more information.\n4 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nInstagram, and Twitter, only removing pornographic material and blocking ISIS-related\nterrorist  activity  on  its  public  channels  (Walther  and  McCoy,  2021).  As  a  result,\nTelegram has attracted users from across a range of hate-based, extremist organizations,\nincluding the Proud Boys.\nBy February 2021, the Proud Boy\u2019s Telegram community consisted of a plurality\nof public channels, the largest of which had more than 45,000 members  (Crawford,\n2020). However, although Telegram has been a popular platform for communication\nwithin  extremist  groups  for  a  number  of  years  \u2013  with  its  popularity  increasing\ndramatically following the January 6th Capitol insurrection (Dickson, 2021) \u2013 to date,\nrelatively few studies have systematically investigated how these groups make use of this\nplatform. The present study contributes to this nascent body of research, offering useful\ninsights into how an alternative social media platform can be leveraged by an extremist\ngroup  after  it  is  deplatformed  by  mainstream  social  media  sites.  A  longitudinal\nexamination of the group\u2019s  use of Telegram provides insight into the evolution and\norganizational structure of the Proud Boys network, its connectedness with other far-right\ncommunities, as well as the information and narratives that its members and leaders share\nthrough those channels.\nIn our effort to construct a more systematic and nuanced understanding of the\nProud Boys network on Telegram, our analysis focuses on four specific questions: 1)\nWhat are the dynamics of how the Proud Boys community developed on Telegram? 2)\nWhat is the structure of the Proud Boys network on Telegram? 3) Outside of their core\nstructure, to what degree is the Proud Boys community connected to other far-right or\nfringe communities on Telegram? And, 4) Which topics are communicated about more\nprominently and frequently by the members of this network? \nIn the next section, we describe our data set and its collection process. We then\ndiscuss the motivation for each of our research questions in more detail, and outline the\nmethodology we used to investigate each.  This  is followed  by a description  of our\n5 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nfindings and their implications for each of the research questions. We then conclude with\na discussion of the limitations of our findings and potential avenues for future research. \nData collection\nOur data collection on Telegram is channel-based. We compile data and metadata\nfor publicly-viewable Proud Boys-affiliated channels. Typically, each Telegram channel\nis set up by its owner to allow broadcast or one-way communication from a small set of\nsenders  to  a  broader  set  of  general  channel  users.  However,  some  channels  are\ninteractive,  allowing  channel  followers  to  share  and  respond  to posts.  Content  in  a\nchannel primarily consists of messages composed of text, images, audio files, and/or\nvideo files. To collect content and metadata from Proud Boys channels, we use Telethon,\na Python-based interface for the Telegram API  2. Data provided by the Telegram API\ninclude channel and post-level metadata, as well as the content of the posts themselves. \nChannel  metadata  provided  by  the  Telegram  API  includes  the  unique\nidentification number, title, creation date, current count of users, and various channel\nsettings (e.g., usage configurations, administrator restrictions, and whether the channel is\na bot), as well as the actual messages sent in the channel. Messages can either be original\ncontent posted to a channel or can be forwarded content from another channel. We do not\ncollect  user  handles  pertaining  to  the  individuals  who  posted  in  these  channels.\nAccordingly, our data set consists of anonymized user posts to public channels. \nWe  start with a seed list of 10 Proud Boys-affiliated broadcast  channels3 on\nTelegram identified by leading organizations working in this domain.4 To grow this list\nof channels, we rely on mentions of other channels and the \u201cforwarding\u201d feature within\nTelegram, whereby content can be shared between channels. Each time we encounter a\n2 Please visit https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/  for more information.\n3 The seed list of 10 Proud Boys channels are \u201cProudBoysUSA\u201d,  \u201cKingdomZombe\u201d,  \n\u201cTheWesternChauvinist\u201d,  \u201cProudBoysCanada\u201d,  \u201cProudBoysBritannia\u201d,  \u201cSeattleProudBoys\u201d,  \n\u201cPhillyPB\u201d,  \u201cProudBoyspdx\u201d,  \u201cOfficialMichiganProudBoys\u201d, and \u201cOhioProudBoys\u201d.\n4 The list of channels that served as the starting point for our data collection was shared by Moonshot , a \nprivate consulting firm that specializes in investigating and disrupting online harms.\n6 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nnew mention of a channel or content forwarded from a channel that was not already on\nour list, we add the channel to our list, collect its data, and follow all of its channels. This\nsnowball \u201ccrawling\u201d approach results in a list of more than 7,000 unique channels. From\nthe dataset of 7000 public channels, we employ a rigorous manual identification process\nto single out channels associated with the Proud Boys. Initially, we execute keyword-\nbased  searches  focusing on terms  such as \u201cProud Boys\u201d, \u201cPB\u201d, and other  affiliated\nterminologies in the channel\u2019s username, title, or bio. After this preliminary filter, a team\nof trained undergraduates and graduates from George Washington University undertook a\ncomprehensive review of each channel\u2019s posts. Throughout this annotation phase, the\nstudents  often  encountered  content  that  included  the  use  of  established  Proud  Boys\nnarratives, memes, slogans, and jargon. Posts to these channels also include mentions of\nor interactions with other recognized Proud Boys channels, figures, or sources. This\nprocess  enabled  the  team  to  confidently  confirm  that  these  92  core  channels  were\nexplicitly and primarily Proud Boys-centric.\nTo explore the network, we focus on 2,934 public channels  consisting of 92\nexplicitly Proud Boys-affiliated channels and 2,842 other related channels that promote\nProud Boys-aligned content (including 571 with full histories of their posts, and 2,363\nthat  have  been  mentioned  by  these  core  channels,  but  lacking  full  histories5).  The\ncorresponding  data  spans  a  period  from  November  2018  \u2013  when  the  first  channel\nincluded in the network is created \u2013 to February 2022.\nThe research questions and their methodologies\n5 Our methodology of constructing the network involves analyzing chats from all available channels and \nidentifying forwarded messages within these chats. It\u2019s in these forwarded messages where we encounter \nreferences to new channels. Once we obtain chats from these newly discovered channels, we often find \nreferences to even more channels within their forwarded messages, creating a cascading discovery of \nchannels. This recursive discovery of new channels implies that acquiring full histories becomes inherently \nunfeasible, as each layer of discovery could potentially lead to more layers, in a seemingly endless process. \nThe nature of this methodology means that the collection is bound to be incomplete, given the continually \nunfolding layers of channels referenced in the forwarded messages. Our approach has been to garner as \ncomprehensive a snapshot as possible within the constraints of this ever-expanding network of channels.\n7 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nResearch Question 1. What are the dynamics of how the Proud Boys community \ndeveloped on Telegram?\nThe Proud Boys have long relied on social media for recruitment and to strategize\nas a group (DeCook 2018); however, the Proud Boys have seen their digital reach in\nmainstream online spaces limited in recent years. In August 2018, Twitter terminated the\ngroup\u2019s official account, along with that of the group\u2019s founder, Gavin McInnes\u2019, under\nits policy prohibiting violent extremist groups (Roettgers, 2018). Facebook and Instagram\nalso banned the group and its leader in October 2018 (CBC, 2018). In December of that\nsame year, YouTube banned the Proud Boys founder for copyright violation (Solsman,\n2018).  Then,  in  February  of  2019,  Slate  magazine  reported  that  Square,  Chase\nPaymentech, and PayPal had pulled their payment processing services from 1776.shop,\nan online far-right merchandise site associated with the Proud Boys (Glaser, 2019). In the\nlight of this mass deplatforming, as well as the popular right-wing social platform Parler\ngoing dark (Kenes, 2021), the Proud Boys community began flocking to alternative social\nnetworks, including a large migration to the encrypted messaging app Telegram. This\nprogression is the focus of our first research question (RQ1): What are the dynamics of\nhow the Proud Boys community developed on Telegram? \nTo answer RQ1, we first create a Proud Boys-centered directed network using all\nforwardings from the 571 channels with full histories (self-citations were included), with\nthe total channel interactions amounted to 2,363. Forwardings include direct re-posts\nfrom other channels/groups (sometimes with their added comments) in message texts. In\nthis network, each node represents a public channel, each edge stands for the number of\ndirect re-posts between two channels, and the arrow of each edge indicates the direction\nof the connection (e.g., if forwarding a message from channel B to channel A, then\nchannel B is the source, and channel A is the target, then the arrow direction would be\nfrom the channel B pointing to channel A). Then, to trace the evolution of the network,\nwe take the temporal dimension into account and examine the rates of its growth. Since a\nnetwork evolves over time by adding or removing nodes or edges, we calculate the\nnetwork\u2019s temporal (e.g., monthly) number and cumulative number of onset channels\n8 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\n(nodes) and messages (edges). The onset nodes correspond to the channels that come into\nexistence and start to engage with the existing channels in the temporal network, and\nnewly active edges, new messages sharing within the temporal network. \nResearch Question 2. What is the organizational structure of the Proud Boys network \non Telegram?\nSome of the most consequential affordances that social media platforms provide\nto extremist groups include facilitating the spread and visibility of the group and its\nideology, which is a central component of the group\u2019s recruitment efforts, as well as the\ngroup\u2019s  ability  to  define  its  own  identity,  justify  or  mainstream  its  worldview, and\norganize and mobilize its members (Jost et al., 2018; Ruijgrok, 2017; Urman, Ho, and\nKatz, 2021). In the context of social media, network theory provides a framework for\nunderstanding and measuring the efficiency with which a group can achieve these goals\n(Jost et al., 2018; Urman, Ho, and Katz, 2021). When online networks are sparse and\ndisconnected, and thus lacking meaningful interaction partners, this structure can hinder\nthe speed with which information is diffused.  Although there remains some capacity for\nnodes in this network to receive information, the relative inefficiency of this network\nstructure decreases the degree to which it can be successfully leveraged to facilitate the\ngroup\u2019s visibility, expansion, and mobilization. Alternatively, to maximize efficiency, a\nnetwork needs powerful or influential actors that act as structural bridges to facilitate the\ntransmission  of  information  in  the  network.  Ideally,  such  an  efficient  spread  of\ninformation would lead to increased cohesiveness among participants (Urman, Ho, and\nKatz, 2021). One of the primary avenues for information diffusion on Telegram is via\npublic channels, which are easily searchable. These channels\u2019 discoverability and reach is\ndirectly dependent on being mentioned on and/or their posts being forwarded by other\nchannels. Hence, the analysis of the structure and cohesion of a forwardings6 network is\n6 Forwarding a message from channel B to channel A, i.e. members of channel A will see a link to channel \nB (a link from node A to node B). It is useful to think of each directed link (directed interaction) from \nchannel A to channel B, as meaning that A is influenced by B. \n9 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nparticularly  useful for  the assessment of the  efficiency  of information  diffusion and\ncommunication within the Proud Boys community on Telegram. This is the focus of our\nsecond research question (RQ2): What is the organizational structure of the Proud Boys\nnetwork on Telegram?\nTo investigate RQ2, we compute various descriptive statistics (e.g., nodes\u2019 in-\ndegrees, out-degrees, etc.) for the Proud Boys-centered network. While the first of these\nchannels  originates in November 2018, the  network data,  constructed  from  the chat\nhistories across these channels, covers the period from April 2019 to February 2022. \nTo enhance our understanding of the network\u2019s connectivity, we juxtapose the\nProud Boys network with the broader and more expansive far-right Telegram networks\ndelineated  by  Urman  and  Katz  (2020).  We  utilize  a  seed  propagation  approach  to\ngenerate  a simulated subgraph of comparable  size to the Proud  Boys network,  both\ncontaining 2934 nodes. Initiation of this approach involves the random selection of a\n\u201cseed node.\u201d Once this node is chosen, a traversal algorithm, that is, a breadth-first search\n(BFS), kicks into action. This method systematically explores nodes neighboring the\nseed,  expanding  the  subgraph  progressively.  This  iterative  process  persists  until  the\nsubgraph reaches the designated size, set at 2934 nodes for our study. A distinguishing\nattribute of the seed propagation technique is its commitment to retaining the original\nnetwork\u2019s connection structure, ensuring the resultant subgraph accurately mirrors the\noverarching network\u2019s characteristics. \nSubsequently, we compute the average clustering coefficients, indicative of the\nnetwork\u2019s interconnectedness or node density. When a network has an average clustering\ncoefficient nearing 1, it is typically viewed as being highly connected (Chalancon, Kruse\nand  Babu,  2013).  This  suggests  that  a  majority  of  the  nodes  are  intricately  linked,\nforming  dense  clusters  with  adjacent  nodes.  To  discern  if  the  average  directed  and\nundirected clustering coefficients of the Proud Boys\u2019 network significantly differ from\n10 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nthose of the identified far-right networks, we employed a permutation test (Edgington,\n2011). This non-parametric statistical method tests the null hypothesis that two samples\narise from the same distribution. For each of the six networks, they are combined with the\nProud Boys\u2019 network, the node labels are randomized, and the merged network is then\nsegregated again, resulting in two randomized subgraphs. This method is executed 10,000\niterations,  to  formulate  a  distribution  of  discrepancies  based  on  the  presumption  of\nconsistent clustering coefficients  across  networks.  The  p-value is  then calculated  by\ncomparing the fraction of randomized disparities that are equal to or more pronounced\nthan the initially observed difference. Following our analysis, we employ the Louvain\nalgorithm for community detection (Blondel et al., 2008) to partition the network into\ncommunities  of  nodes  that  exhibit  stronger  connections  with  nodes  within  their\ncommunity than with those outside it.\nTo gain deeper insight into the network\u2019s structural characteristics, we study two\ntypes of nodes and their roles within the Proud Boys network, based on the two main\nnetwork roles: gatekeeper and representative, as defined by Gould and Fernandez (1989).\nA gatekeeper, according to Gould and Fernandez (1989), is an individual who filters\ninformation within their own division, gathers knowledge from an external actor, and\ntransfers it to an actor within their own division. A representative, on the other hand,\nconveys knowledge obtained from an actor within their own division to an actor in a\ndifferent division, representing their own division externally. In essence, gatekeepers act\nas bridges between their own community and others through incoming contact, while\nrepresentatives  serve  as  bridges  between  their  own  community  and  others  through\noutgoing contact (Urman, Ho, and Katz, 2021).\nThere are a number of metrics that can be used to measure the roles of individual\nnodes in a network. Among these most widely used are degree (including indegree and\noutdegree) and betweenness. Degrees (including indegree and outdegree) can be used to\nassess a node\u2019s popularity and the direction of information flow in the network, while\nbetweenness can be used to  assess nodes\u2019 centrality and to what extent they act as\n11 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nstructural bridges that facilitate information diffusion across different communities in the\nnetwork. Research has shown that brokers, such as gatekeepers and representatives can\nbe identified with high betweenness centrality (Freeman, 1977; Giuliani and Bell, 2005),\nwhich is a centrality metric showing bridging score of a node (Gould and Fernandez,\n1989). \nHowever, knowing only which nodes have high betweenness centrality is not\nenough. In directed graphs like the Proud Boys network, connections often carry weights\n(in our case, the number of messages shared between two linked nodes) and directions.\nRelying solely on betweenness centrality may overlook the significance and directionality\nof  these  relationships,  both  vital  aspects  when  pinpointing  gatekeepers  and\nrepresentatives.  Therefore,  we  propose  a  method  to  identify  gatekeepers  and\nrepresentatives  based  on  the  definitions  outlined  above.  The  initial  step  involves\ndistinguishing communities within the network using the Louvain community detection\nmethod.  This  provides  clarity  on  node  groupings  and  helps  determine  if  a  node\u2019s\nconnections remain internal to its community or serve as bridges to others. \nWe then concentrate on influential nodes by determining and filtering them based\non their betweenness centrality. This centrality measure signifies a node\u2019s influence on\nthe flow of information within the network. Our  use of this metric ensures  that the\nidentified gatekeepers and representatives aren\u2019t merely passive links but play active\nroles in shaping communication routes, spotlighting the most significant nodes in terms\nof their capacity to bridge or filter information.\nFor the identification of gatekeepers, we focus on nodes within the Proud Boys\naffiliated channels, studying edges that stemmed from distinct communities. We then\nassign a score based on the edge weight and the variance between the node\u2019s in-degree\nand out-degree. This is particularly relevant since the Proud Boys network is a weighted\ndirected  network,  where  edge  weights  represent  the  volume  of  messages exchanged\nbetween two linked channels. On the other hand, for pinpointing representatives, we\n12 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nevaluate nodes projecting connections to diverse communities and apply a similar scoring\nmechanism.  Nodes with  top  scores  in  these  categories  are  distinguished  as  primary\ngatekeepers and representatives, respectively. By considering connection weights, our\nmethod underscores  the idea that not every connection holds equal significance in a\nnetwork. Incorporating these weights allows our approach to depict the depth and vigor\nof  relationships,  such  that nodes  with  more  potent  or  recurrent  interactions  receive\nappropriate  acknowledgment.  Thus, our  methodology for  discerning  gatekeepers  and\nrepresentatives integrates various dimensions of network analysis. (Please refer to the\nSupplementary Materials for a more detailed description of these steps.)\nResearch Question 3: Outside of their core structure, to what degree is the Proud Boys\ncommunity connected to other far-right or fringe communities on Telegram?\nFor a fuller understanding of the affordances that Telegram provides to the Proud\nBoys community, it is essential to understand their ties to other influential far-right and\nfringe entities on the platform. These connections influence both their engagement within\nthis larger ecosystem, as well as the narratives and information that is diffused within the\nProud Boys network. For example, Newhouse, Arlett, and McClintock (2020) discover\nthat  on  Twitter  numerous  Proud  Boys  follow  conservative  activists  like  DeAnna\nLorraine, Candace Owens, and Dan Bongino, all of whom have actively downplayed the\nseverity of the pandemic and propagated false narratives about its origins. This likely\ncontributed to the adoption of coronavirus trutherism among many members of the Proud\nBoys. Moreover, as they engage with more influential accounts in adjacent communities,\nthe Proud Boys themselves become conduits for message transmission and amplification.\nThus, examining the other communities with which the Proud Boys network is most\nclosely connected on Telegram is the basis of our third research question (RQ3): Outside\nof their core structure, to what degree is the Proud Boys community connected to other\nfar-right or fringe communities on Telegram?\nTo answer R3, we closely examine a total of 7,030 public Telegram channels,\nincluding Proud Boys-affiliated and other far-right channels related to the Proud Boys\n13 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nnetwork.  We  rely  on  the  far-right  community  classification  of  Telegram  channels\nprovided by a recent study by Puyosa and Leon (2022), in which channels are categorized\ninto similar ideologies and like-minded topical interests that nonetheless form distinct\ncommunities delineated by limited interactions with each other on the platform. In the\ncase  of  the  Proud  Boys  network  on  Telegram,  these  adjacent  communities  can  be\ncategorized  as  MAGA  Trumpists,  white-supremacists,  anti-mandates  and  COVID-19\nmisinformation, and QAnon. (Please see Table 1.) \nBy carefully examining the example channels identified by Puyosa and Leon\n(2022),  we  observe  a  recurring  pattern  in  usernames  and  titles,  which  frequently\nincorporate  terms  that  allude  to  far-right  ideologies  or  conspiracy  theories,  such  as\n\u201cTrump,\u201d  \u201cCoronavirus,\u201d  \u201cQAnon,\u201d  and  \u201cWLM\u201d.  Accordingly,  we  employ  these\nkeywords7 as criteria to identify and categorize channels. Our initial categorization yields\nmore than 300 channels spanning various extreme ideologies. To enhance our dataset, we\nincorporate additional sub-category channels identified by recent studies, especially that\nof Puyosa and Leon (2022), and leading organizations working in this domain 8.\nTable 1.

To ensure accuracy in our classification of channels propagating COVID-19\nmisinformation, we adopt a two-tiered examination process. First, we manually review\nthe metadata of each channel, including its username, title, and description, to ascertain\nany overt indications of misinformation or conspiracy. Subsequently, we compile the\nURLs shared within each channel and utilize the external lists of low-credibility news\nsources, specifically the \u201cIffy Index of Unreliable Sources\u201d (Resnick et al., 2018) to\ngauge the credibility of these shared domains. The Iffy index aggregates trustworthiness\n15 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nratings from Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)9 and includes a list of 1,388 unreliable\ndomains.10 Channels  are  deemed  as  disseminators  of  misinformation  if  they  either\ncirculate news from untrustworthy sources or explicitly indicate such a purpose in their\ntitle or description. Channels that do not fit this criterion are excluded from our dataset.\nUsing the identified classification of these channels, we build a larger network by\nthese different far-right communities. We visualize URL flows using an alluvial diagram\nto depict the frequency of URLs exchanges among these groups. This flow is determined\nbased  on  the  timestamp  when  the  URL  is  shared,  for  instance,  2020-11-12\n12:53:59+0000. If identical URLs are disseminated across multiple groups, the group\nwith the earlier timestamp is recognized as the source channel, with the subsequent group\nbeing the target. Subsequently, we calculate the distinct hashtags, mentions, and domains\nshared between the Proud Boys network and the other four communities. We also assess\nthe proportions of these uniquely shared elements in relation to the corresponding unique\ninformation within the Proud Boys network.\nResearch Question 4: Which topics are communicated about more prominently and \nfrequently by members of the Proud Boys network?\nIn addition to the efficiency of information diffusion, the nature of the content\ncirculated within a network is a crucial component of understanding its reach and impact.\nPrior research has shown that far-right activists need to actively participate in content\ncreation as a means of fostering and disseminating hate (Donovan et al., 2019; Gaudette\net al., 2020). To achieve this, they often depict an imagined homogeneous, victimized in-\ngroup (Hameleers et \u0bd7al., 2019), thus rationalizing the exclusion of out-groups (Kr\u00e4mer,\n2017). Furthermore,  their narratives involve the triggering of emotions and can thus\npromote  actions  perceived  as  logical  consequences  (Marcks  and  Pawelz,  2020).\nConsequently, the content of messages shared on Telegram is the basis for our fourth and\n9  https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/  \n10 The complete list is available at the following link: \nhttps://gwu.box.com/s/jvlr23ft96ncso7bj4d5h8a2tif1qu5a\n16 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nfinal research question (RQ4): Which topics are communicated about more prominently\nand frequently by members of the Proud Boys network?\nTo answer RQ4, we apply an unsupervised popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation\ntopic model (LDA)11 (Blei et al., 2003) to summarize the underlying themes present\nwithin the text. A key decision in our methodology is to retain duplicate text during LDA\napplication. This choice is driven by two primary considerations: first, in our contexts, we\nthink the repetition of content can be of significance. For example, if the Proud Boys\nstatement is frequently repeated across different channels, its repeated presence might\nindicate  its  importance  or  popularity,  which  we  would  like  to  capture  in  the  topic\ndistribution. Second, by maintaining duplicates, we ensure the dataset mirrors its original\ncontent distribution. This approach provides a more genuine representation of the source\ndata, staying true to its authentic nature and composition.\nPrior to employing the LDA topic model, we subject the text to a comprehensive\npre-processing routine to ensure data consistency and improve model accuracy. We first\ntransform all content to lowercase to ensure uniformity and address case discrepancies.\nSubsequently,  all  URLs,  including  http,  https,  and  www-based  links,  are  excluded,\nfollowed by the removal of mentions such as \u201c@username\u201d to diminish noise. Hashtags\nare retained but cleaned of the \u2018#\u2019 symbol, and all punctuation is removed for clarity. The\ntext is then tokenized into individual words, and common stopwords like \u201cand,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d\nand \u201cis\u201d are discarded. This is accompanied by the lemmatization of words, reducing\nthem to their base form (e.g., \u201crunning\u201d to \u201crun\u201d), and the elimination of words with two\nor  fewer  characters.  After  applying the LDA model,  we utilize  coherence  values to\nascertain the optimal number of topics.\nBesides  the  shared  discourse,  a  major  purpose  of  this  network  is  to  share\ninformation in the form of links to external content, such as news articles. To understand\nthe nature of the information being shared, we extract the link appearing in each message\n11 Hyperparameters in LDA model: alpha = 5, beta = 0.01, iterations = 400. \n17 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nin our collection and extract the domain name, e.g., from www.yahoo.com/news/MAGA-\nnews-story, we extract  yahoo.com. We then  focus  on the top 1000 most commonly\nshared domains appearing in the network, and classify them based on the type of service\n(including news, business, computers and technology, entertainment, politics and law,\ngovernment, shopping, education, health and medicine and personal sites) they provide\nusing Cyren.12 We further characterize the news websites with political labels based on\ninformation about the site contained in Media Bias/Fact Check website. This website is a\nfact checking site that rates websites based on ideological bias and credibility of factual\nreporting. Their methodology is subjective, but based on a numeric scoring system to\nassign labels. The possible labels for political bias are: far left, left, left-center, least\nbiased/pro-science, right-center, right, right conspiracy pseudoscience, and far/extreme\nright. They are assigned on domain level, so every article originating from the same\nsource will have the same label.\nFindings\nRQ1: The Proud Boys network\u2019s most significant expansions on Telegram are event-\ndriven.\nTo  understand  the  evolution  and  expansion  of  the  Proud  Boys  network  on\nTelegram,  we look at the dynamics of its formation. First, we  look at the speed of\nnetwork development over time to identify the tipping points in network formation. As\nshown in Figure 1, the network has 40 snapshots, each corresponding to one month\nperiod.  Although  the  Proud  Boys  established  their  initial  channel  on  Telegram  in\nNovember 2018, there were no observed interactions between the Proud Boys channels\nuntil April of 2019.  Thus our analysis is based on chat interaction histories across these\nchannels from April 2019 to February 2022. \n12 https://www.cyren.com/security-center/url-category-check \n18 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nFigure 1. The Cumulative and New Number of Nodes (channels) and Edges\n(shared text messages) within the Proud Boys Network Over Time.\nDuring the early months, the \u201cProudBoysUSA\u201d channel was the primary source\nof messages, disseminating a total of 86 messages between November 2018 and April\n2019. After manually reviewing these messages, we categorized their content into the\nfollowing  themes:  website  promotion  and  onboarding  (highlighting  the  Proud  Boys\nwebsite and encouraging chapter enrollment), media links (directing to YouTube videos\nand pertinent articles), internal announcements blended with humor (references to Tucker\nCarlson\u2019s brother, Gavin McInnes, and playful jibes about \u201cElder\u201d names likened to\nsuperheroes), quotes and ideological alignment (featuring quotations like those from Ayn\nRand), merchandise promotion (links showcasing Proud Boys merchandise), defense and\nreaction (countering claims of white supremacism or affiliations with violence), advocacy\nfor alternative platforms (encouraging engagement on Minds and Gab), general updates\n\n19 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\n(like  fundraising  for  a  leukemia-afflicted  child),  and  engagement  encouragement\n(emphasizing broader visibility and growth).\nBeginning in May 2019, interactions between channels intensified, peaking in\nJanuary 2021. During this time, the growth of channels depicted an exponential pattern.13\nFigure  1  reveals  that  edge  formation  began  around  April  2019,  and  subsequently\ncontinued to increase, with a notable surge during January 2021. Of relevance within the\ncontext of broader events in the digital space, Twitter suspended accounts related to the\nProud  Boys  on  August  10,  2018,  citing  violations  of  their  policy  against  \u201cviolent\nextremist  groups\u201d  (Buzzfeed,  2018).  Subsequently,  both  Facebook  and  Instagram\nimposed bans on the Proud Boys and its founder, Gavin McInnes, on October 30, 2018\n(Picchi, 2018). This was followed by a similar ban from YouTube in December 2018\n(Solsman,  2018).  Other  studies have  observed  a  parallel  between  the  rise  in  active\nchannels starting in April 2019 and the bans faced by US far-right entities \u2013 including\ncounterparts from Britain, Australia, Germany, and more \u2013 on Facebook during that time\nor  slightly  earlier  in  February  2019  (Hern,  2019;  Urman  and  Katz,  2022).  These\ndevelopments highlight a potential shift of far-right groups, including the Proud Boys,\ntowards Telegram around this period. \nThe second notable expansion of this network occurred after the U.S. Capitol\ninsurrection on January 6, 2021. This expansion coincides with significant events such as\nthe mainstream politician, former President Donald Trump, and many associated with the\nevent\u2019s planning being removed from major social media platforms (including Facebook,\nTwitter, and YouTube). At the same time, there is a demonstrable show of enthusiasm\namong allied individuals after the January 6th event. To visually represent and quantify\nthe changing trend over time, we employed an interrupted time series analysis, with\nparticular focus on the events surrounding January 2021. Although interrupted time series\n13 To investigate the channels\u2019 growth pattern, we compare an exponential model against a simple linear \nmodel. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, the exponential model yields a \nlower AIC score (126.65) relative to the linear model (595.21). This supports the assertion of an \nexponential growth trajectory for the channels.\n20 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\ncan be used to suggest causality, in the present study we use it strictly for descriptive\npurposes  to  observe  shifts  or  patterns  in  network  growth  without  drawing  causal\ninferences. \nOur analysis reveals an amplification in the network\u2019s expansion during and after\nJanuary 2021.  Whereas prior to January 2021 there was an addition of roughly 21 (p <\n0.001)  new  channels  to  the  network  every  month;  during  this  month  there  was  a\nprecipitous increase when the network expanded by 289 channels (p < 0.001).  In the\nmonths following January 2021, a persistent uptick in the growth rate continued, with an\naddition of approximately 93 (p < 0.001) channels monthly. (Please see Figure 2.)\nRQ2: Consistent with other far-right on Telegram, the Proud Boys Telegram network \nstructure is highly connected.\nTo examine the patterns of communication and information diffusion within the\nProud Boys community on Telegram, we focus on the final snapshot of the network\nduring the period of our analysis, the end of February of 2022. (Please see Figure 3.) The\nnetwork is comprised of 2,934 Telegram channels, including 92 explicitly Proud Boys-\naffiliated channels and 2,842 other channels that potentially promote Proud Boys-aligned\ncontent, and 10,392 weighted edges (weight represents the number of mentions; whereas\nthe total number of mentions, or unweighted edges, is 86,306 edges). \n21 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nFigure 2. Interrupted Time Series Analysis of the Peak of Growth of Channels\nwithin Proud Boys Network after January, 2021.\nIn the supplementary details provided for Urman and Katz\u2019s (2020) study, their\nfinal snapshot from February 2020 depicts a comprehensive network of 11,605 channels.\nIn a comparative analysis based on channel usernames, we identify an overlap of 461\nchannels between the Proud Boys network and the far-right network delineated by Urman\nand Katz (2020). Notably, 12 of these overlapping channels are explicitly affiliated with\nthe Proud Boys. On average, 338 channels from the six far-right networks discussed in\nUrman and Katz (2020) intersect with the Proud Boys-centered network.\n Upon juxtaposing the Proud Boys network with the February 2020 snapshot of\nthe far-right network from Urman and Katz (2020), we observe the former showcasing\nslightly  higher  values  for  both  directed  average  clustering  coefficient  (0.206)  and\nundirected average clustering coefficient (0.65). In contrast, the far-right network from\nUrman and Katz (2020) records directed and undirected average clustering coefficients of\n0.15  and  0.551,  respectively.  When  benchmarked  against  the  six  distinct  far-right\nTelegram networks, the clustering coefficients of the Proud Boys network (both directed\n\n22 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nat 0.206 and undirected at 0.65) are found to be in line with those networks. For context,\nthe six far-right networks from Urman and Katz (2020) demonstrate directed average\nclustering coefficients of 0.247, 0.219, 0.211, 0.233, 0.255, and 0.195, and undirected\nones at 0.514, 0.536, 0.543, 0.499, 0.564, and 0.509. Based on the permutation test, these\nvariations are determined to be statistically insignificant from the Proud Boys network.\nThis means that the pattern of communication and interaction within the Proud Boys\nnetwork on Telegram is consistent with the communication patterns seen in other far-\nright groups on the same platform. (These six graphs for these networks can be found in\nthe Supplementary Materials.)\nIn visualizing the Proud Boys network in Figure 3, it is evident that the majority\nof channels explicitly affiliated with the Proud Boys (represented as orange nodes) were\ncentrally  located  within  the  network  graph.  These  channels  had  a  higher  average\neigenvector centrality value of 0.144. In contrast, channels not directly affiliated with the\nProud Boys (depicted as gray nodes) had a lower average eigenvector centrality of 0.006.\nA  subsequent  two-sample  t-test  confirms  that  the  Proud  Boys  channels  have  a\nsignificantly  higher  mean  eigenvector  centrality  (a  difference  of  0.138,  p  <  0.001)\ncompared to non-Proud Boys channels. \nTo illustrate the distribution of in-degrees and out-degrees of nodes within the\nProud Boys network, in Figure 4 we plotted the Lorenz curves for both in-degree and out-\ndegree. The x-axis denotes the cumulative proportion of nodes, while the y-axis signifies\nthe cumulative proportion of degrees. The diagonal red dashed line, commonly termed\nthe \u201cline of equality,\u201d symbolizes perfect equality; if degrees are distributed uniformly,\nthe curve would trace this line. \n23 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nFigure 3. Network Map of Proud Boys-affiliated Telegram Channels\nNote.  The orange nodes represent explicitly Proud Boys-affiliated channels, and gray\nnodes indicate other far-right related channels that promote Proud Boys-aligned content.\nThe size of the node is based on how often messages are forwarded from that channel to\nanother within the network.\nFigure 4. Lorenz Curves of In-degree and Out-degree of the Proud Boys Network.\n24 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nThe in-degree Lorenz curve (illustrated in blue) commences beneath the line of\nequality, approaching it towards the end. This pattern indicates that many nodes possess\nrelatively low in-degrees. However, the curve steepens at the latter stages, revealing that\nonly a few nodes maintain high in-degrees, which denotes that they are notably connected\nand  receive  numerous  edges.  The  general  contour  of  the  in-degree  Lorenz  curve\nhighlights an inequality: a minority of nodes govern a significant share of the incoming\nconnections.\nContrastingly, the out-degree Lorenz curve (depicted in green) exhibits a starker\nascent, particularly in its concluding segments. This implies that the vast majority of\nnodes have minimal out-degrees, with the curve remaining adjacent to the x-axis for an\nextended stretch. The abrupt surge at the curve\u2019s end signifies that a minuscule portion of\nnodes  account  for  a  vast  number  of  outgoing  connections.  This  denotes  a  more\npronounced  inequality  in  out-degrees  than  in  in-degrees:  a  scant  few  nodes  are\npredominant in initiating outgoing connections. \nComparing the in-degree and out-degree Lorenz curves, the steeper ascent of the\nin-degree curve suggests a higher inequality in the distribution of incoming connections\ncompared to outgoing ones. This implies that while a select group of nodes act as major\nrecipients of connections (high in-degree), a broader distribution of nodes disperse their\noutgoing connections (out-degree) more evenly. In essence, while disparities are present\nin both in-degrees and out-degrees, it is the in-degree connections that exhibit a more\npronounced  level  of  inequality.  This  could  indicate  a  network  structure  in  which  a\nrelatively small number of nodes function as key \u201chubs\u201d or \u201cinfluencers\u201d that attract a\nlarge  number  of  connections,  while  a  larger  portion  of  the  network  consists  of\n\u201cbroadcasters\u201d  disseminating  information.  As  depicted  in  Figure  3,  the  Proud  Boys\nnetwork  is marked by prominent hubs that play a crucial role  in disseminating and\ngathering information across the network.\n25 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nNext, by employing the Louvain algorithm for community detection, the network\ndivides  into  five  communities  with  a  modularity  score  of  0.38,  indicating  a  good\ncommunity partition considering the degree distribution (Newman, 2006), as shown in\nFigure  5.  These  communities  include  the  KingdomZombe-ProudBoysUSA  cluster\n(comprising 38.4% of the 2,934 channels in the network), TheWesternChauvinist cluster\n(25.8%),  ProudBoysGirlsAlaska  -  ProudBoysAlaskaNorthStart  cluster  (19.3%),\nProudBoysBritannia cluster (13%), and ProudBoysAustralia-NewZealand cluster (3.6%).\nNotably, these divisions appear to align largely with national and geographic affiliations.\nWe can discern specific communities representing the British Isles (ProudBoysBritannia),\nAustralia  and  New  Zealand  (ProudBoysAustralia  and  ProudBoysNewZealand),  the\nUnited  States  (KingdomZombe,  ProudBoysUSA,  and  TheWesternChauvinist),  and  a\ndedicated community for the United States\u2019 Alaska region (ProudBoysGirlsAlaska and\nProudBoysAlaskaNorthStar).  While  these communities emerge  from  distinct national\nbackgrounds, they exhibit strong interconnectivity, as depicted in Figure 5, underscoring\npotential international collaborations amongst Proud Boys chapters.\nFigure 5. The Network Map of Modularities in Proud Boys Network.\n26 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nUpon  closer  examination,  we  discern  two  primary  functions  played  by  the\nchannels  within  this  network:  gatekeepers  and  representatives.  (Please  see Table  2.)\nSpecific  nodes  stand  out  as  gatekeepers,  characterized  by  their  distinct  interaction\npatterns. While these nodes are not essential in creating the shortest paths throughout the\nnetwork  (evidenced  by  their  low  normalized  betweenness  centrality),  they  exhibit\ninfluence, as reflected in their in-degrees and out-degrees. In the Proud Boys-centered\nnetwork, the normalized betweenness centrality values are distributed with quartiles of\n0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0789, corresponding to the minimum, 25%, 50%, 75%, and\nmaximum values, respectively. The pronounced left-skewed trend toward 0 suggests that\na large portion of nodes in this directed graph don\u2019t serve as bridges in the directed flow.\nNonetheless, nodes with non-zero betweenness centrality have a pivotal role in directing\nor managing the network\u2019s flow. Importantly, a betweenness centrality value of 0 should\nnot  be  interpreted  as  an  indication  of  a  node\u2019s  insignificance  within  the  network\u2019s\nstructure or its overall dynamics. Take for instance the node labeled \u201cKingdomZombe\u201d,\ndespite its negligible betweenness centrality of 0.000, it prominently stands out with a\nperfect normalized in-degree of 1.000 and a stark absence of any outgoing connections.\nThis indicates that \u201cKingdomZombe\u201d is a substantial magnet for attention or focus within\nthe network, drawing connections almost exclusively towards itself without dispersing\nany outward.\nChannels such as \u201cProudBoysGirlsAlaska\u201d and \u201cProudBoysoftheredoubt\u201d display\na  notable  balance  in  their  profiles.  Although  their  in-degrees  are  not  as  stark  as\n\u201cKingdomZombe\u201d, they both have higher normalized in-degrees of 0.182 and 0.125,\nrespectively, indicating their importance in the reception of information. Furthermore,\ntheir nonzero normalized betweenness centrality implies that they do occasionally act as\nbridges  or  intermediaries  in  the  communication  paths.  \u201cMauiPB\u201d  bears  some\nresemblance to \u201cKingdomZombe\u201d, primarily acting as a recipient of information, given\nits  in-degree  of  0.074  and  negligible  out-degree.  \u201cProudBoysBritannia\u201d  presents  an\nintriguing mix, with both a decent in-degree (0.151) and out-degree (0.094), revealing a\n27 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nmore balanced role in both acquiring and transmitting information. All five nodes have a\nlow  betweenness  centrality,  meaning  they\u2019re  not  critical  connectors  in  terms  of  the\nnetwork\u2019s shortest paths. However, they all exhibit the trait of gatekeepers to varying\ndegrees \u2013 receiving more information or connections than they send out.\nOn the representatives\u2019 front, \u201cTheWesternChauvinist\u201d emerges as a paramount\ndisseminator of information. With a normalized out-degree pegged at the maximum value\nof 1.000, this channel is evidently the most active in broadcasting information to other\nnodes  in  the  network.  Furthermore,  its  non-trivial  betweenness  centrality  of  0.079\naccentuates its role in connecting disparate parts of the network. \u201cProudBoysUSA\u201d and\n\u201cNobleLeader\u201d  both  have  significant  out-degrees  of  0.278  and  0.109,  respectively,\nmarking  their  positions  as  crucial  information  distributors.

Their  nonzero\nbetweenness  centralities,  albeit  small,  indicate  that  they  occasionally  play  roles  in\nbridging communication paths within the network.\nIn summary, these gatekeepers and representatives, with their distinct in-degree\nand out-degree profiles, offer an insight into the flow of information and influence within\nthe Proud Boys network. Their roles, whether predominantly receptive or distributive,\nunderpin the network\u2019s communication structure and influence dissemination.\nRQ3: The Proud Boys network is tightly linked with other far-right and/or fringe \ncommunities on the platform.\nOur analysis identified a larger Telegram network, within which the Proud Boys\nnetwork is situated, comprised by four adjacent communities (i.e., MAGA Trumpists,\nwhite-supremacists,  QAnon,  and  anti-mandate  and  COVID-19  misinformation\npurveyors), incorporating 7,030 Telegram channels and 178,580 weighted edges (weight\nrepresents the number of mentions; the total number of mentions, or unweighted edges, is\n2,411,478).  The  network  is  closely  connected,  with  an  average  undirected  average\nclustering coefficient of 0.58314, and a total of 3,133,469 triangles. Specifically, about 83\nout of 92 Proud Boys affiliated channels are indirectly and/or directly linked with 42% of\npro-Trump channels, 83% of white supremacist groups, and 64% of channels that involve\nCOVID-19 and 39% of QAnon conspiracy theory channels. On average, by calculating\nthe shortest path, we discover that the Proud Boys channels connect with pro-Trump\nallies,  white  supremacist  groups,  and  channels  espousing  COVID-19  and  QAnon\nconspiracy beliefs, through 2.7, 2.3, 2.7, and 2.9 nodes, respectively. \n14  A clustering coefficient, ranging from 0 to 1, is a measure of the likelihood that its neighbors (i.e., other \nnodes it\u2019s directly connected to) are also connected to each other.\n29 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nWe also track and display the flow of URLs between these communities (see\nFigure 6). The Proud Boys, denoted with an originating count of 456,744, are observed to\nhave substantial intersections with the four other groups. A pronounced flow is evident\ntoward  the  \u201cCOVID\u201d  category,  suggesting  significant  content  sharing  concerning\npandemic-related topics. Furthermore, discernible intersections with the \u201cQAnon\u201d faction\nsuggest  a  confluence  of  thematic  interests,  potentially  rooted  in  shared  conspiracy\nnarratives. While intersections with the \u201cTrumpist\u201d and \u201cWhite-supremacist\u201d factions are\nevident, their relative flow densities are comparably subdued. \nIn addition, there is a large sharing of unique domains, hashtags, and mentions\namong these communities. (Please see Figure 7). Starting with the interaction between\nthe  ProudBoys and  the COVID-19 group,  there is a notable  overlap  in  their  online\ndiscussions. Specifically, 16.2% of the ProudBoys\u2019mentions are also found within the\nCOVID-19 discussions. This percentage is even higher when observing hashtags, where\n21.8% of ProudBoys\u2019 unique hashtags overlap with those of COVID-19. Moreover, when\nit comes to shared domains, an astounding 44.5% of ProudBoys\u2019 domains coincide with\nthose mentioned in the context of COVID19.\nFigure 6. URL Shares Between Proud Boys and Four Other Communities: COVID-\n19, QAnon, Trumpist, and White-Supremacist.\n30 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nIn terms of the Proud Boys and Trump dynamic, there is a discernible overlap\nacross all three categories: mentions, hashtags, and domains. Specifically, the Proud Boys\nshare 22.2% of their mentions, 19.7% of their hashtags, and 25.9% of their domains with\nthose  associated  with  Trump.  Next,  the  White  Supremacist  group  also  exhibits\nintersections with the Proud Boys. The data shows that 19.9% of Proud Boys\u2019 mentions,\n12.6%  of  their  hashtags,  and  22.9%  of  their  domains  overlap  with  those  of  White\nSupremacists. \nFigure 7. Overlap of Unique Domains, Hashtags, and Mentions Between Proud Boys\nand Four Other Communities: COVID-19, QAnon, Trumpist, and White-\nSupremacist. \nNote. The bar chart illustrates the number of unique mentions, hashtags, and domains,\nwhile  the  accompanying  percentages  denote  the  proportion  of  these  unique  counts\nrelative to the total unique sharings by the Proud Boys.\nLastly, the interaction between the Proud Boys and QAnon unveils interesting\npatterns as well. Approximately 11.4% of mentions, 15.5% of hashtags, and 34.2% of\ndomains that are unique to Proud Boys also appear within QAnon\u2019s digital footprint. The\ndomain  overlap,  in particular,  highlights that more  than a  third  of  the  platforms  or\nwebsites referred to by Proud Boys are also frequented by QAnon adherents. \nTo further provide context, Table 3 lists the top 5 shared domains, hashtags, and\nmentions shared both within the other four groups and by the Proud Boys group. The\n31 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nmentions illuminate interconnected themes and affiliations. For instance, mentions like\n\u201ccovid19up\u201d and \u201ccovid19agenda\u201d associated with COVID-19 indicate mutual concerns\nor  doubts  about  the  pandemic.  Mentions  from  the  Trumpist  sphere,  notably\n\u201crealdonaldtrump\u201d  and  \u201cthetrumpist\u201d,  highlight  common  political  inclinations  and\npossibly an admiration for Trump\u2019s perspectives. Mentions within the white-supremacist\ncontext,  such  as  \u201cwhitelivesmatterofficial\u201d  and  \u201cwhiteagendaradio\u201d,  point  to  mutual\nemphases on white identity and socio-political movements. The QAnon mentions, with\nthe likes of \u201cstormisuponusjm\u201d and \u201cqanonplus\u201d, reveal overlaps in conspiracy beliefs.\nThese connections accentuate the themes and influencers shared by the Proud Boys and\nthese adjacent groups, underscoring their interlinked ideologies.\nThe confluence of hashtags between the Proud Boys and the other communities\nprovides an additional lens into their mutual narratives. Shared use of \u201ccovid19\u201d by\nProud Boys, COVID-19, and Trumpist groups underscores a collective engagement with\npandemic discourse. Trumpist hashtags, including \u201cmaga\u201d and \u201cantifa\u201d, shed light on\npolitical affiliations, hinting at a converging narrative with the Proud Boys. Concurrently,\nwhite-supremacist  tags  like  \u201cwhitepower\u201d  and  \u201creclaimamerica\u201d  evoke  common\nideologies  around  racial  perspectives  and  a  vision  for  America.  QAnon\u2019s  more\nspiritually-toned tags, such as \u201cgodblessamerica\u201d, suggest shared patriotic sentiments.\nThis hashtag overlap pinpoints the intersecting ideologies and concerns among these\ncommunities.\nThe preference for domains such as \u201cTelegram.org\u201d and \u201cBitchute.com\u201d across\nthese groups showcases a united appreciation for discrete communication channels and\nplatforms  that  support  uncensored  content.  Their  mutual  engagement  with\n\u201cYouTube.com\u201d and \u201cTwitter.com\u201d signifies a cohesive strategy to engage expansive\naudiences and be part of mainstream dialogues. Moreover, the use of \u201cBit.ly\u201d indicates a\nshared approach to efficient content dissemination. This selection of domains highlights\nthe synergized digital tactics among these entities.\n32 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nTable 3.

Dominating the discourse, the most pronounced theme\nis that of \u201cexpression of misogynistic views and/or use of derogatory language towards\nwomen.\u201d This overshadows other societal themes, such as discussions on \u201clife, love,\nhope, and the human experience\u201d and a more ambiguous category that combined \u201cdaily\nlife activities with potentially darker or controversial themes.\u201d This suggests a strong\nundercurrent  of  gender-based  resentment  and  animosity  toward  women  within  the\nnetwork.  Another significant  portion of  the discourse  revolved  around  contemporary\npolitical events and figures. Topics such as \u201cjudgment of political liberals,\u201d the dynamics\nbetween \u201cTrump vs. Biden,\u201d and the intricate \u201cTrump-Clinton dynamics\u201d constitute a\nsizable chunk of the discussion. Additionally, events such as \u201cAntifa, Black Lives Matter\n(BLM),  and  the  Capitol  riot\u201d  also  showcase  the  network\u2019s  active  and  ongoing\nengagement  with  political  current  events.  Within  this  cluster,  it  is  noteworthy  that\ndiscussions revolve around critiques of liberal perspectives, as well as various aspects\nrelated to both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n34 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nConspiracy  theories  are  rife,  with  posts  reflecting  \u201cdistrust  and  conspiracy\ntheories,\u201d concerns about \u201csecret global elites,\u201d and debates around \u201cmedia narrative,\npolitical polarization, and ideological divisions.\u201d The frequency of these topics indicates\na general atmosphere of skepticism and suspicion toward official information sources,\nespecially when  compared  to more  grounded  themes such as  \u201cdialogue, information\nexchange, and problem-solving.\u201d Issues surrounding \u201cmask-wearing\u201d and \u201cCOVID-19,\nincluding vaccinations and public health measures\u201d are also prominent, revealing the\nongoing global health crisis as another focal point of discussions. \nThe role of media and its perceived bias is another central theme, followed closely\nby concerns about \u201csocial media rules and censorship.\u201d This reflects an overarching\nsentiment of mistrust towards media platforms, both traditional and digital, and the role\nthey play in shaping public opinion. While religious themes center mainly on the \u201cfaith\nand theology of Christianity,\u201d international politics touch upon \u201cUkraine/Europe-Russia\nmilitary  relations\u201d  and  \u201cChina,  communist,  and  Sino-American  political  dynamics.\u201d\nThese topics,  though less  frequent  than domestic  political  issues, indicate a broader\nhorizon of discussion within the network.

Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nBesides  the  shared  discourse,  a  major  function  of  this  network  is  to  share\ninformation in the form of links to external content, such as news articles. Not only is this\nreflective of the preferred perspective or slant of information shared within this network,\nbut it also suggests which sources members of this network consider to be more reliable\nor authoritative. In the Proud Boys network, about 15.2% of text messages contain links.\nA total of 4,853 distinct domains (65,077 unique URLs) have been shared within the\nProud Boys network. Of the 1000 most commonly shared domains in this network,\n38.7% are news websites according to Cyren\u2019s classification. Among the top 100 shared\nnews  websites,  24  %  are  websites associated  with extreme/far  right  and  conspiracy\ntheories, 37% are right or right-center websites, 29 % are left or left-center websites,\naccording  to  the  MBFC.  In  addition,  2%  associated  with  satire  and  1%  Russian\ngovernment sponsored messaging are  also observed. Table 5 shows the top 20 most\npopular  news  websites shared  in  the  Proud  Boys  network,  including  the  frequency,\npercentages  of  total  number  of  domains shared,  and  their characteristics  defined  by\nMBFC.\nTable 5.

Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nA significant trend is the dominance of U.S.-based news outlets, indicating a\npredominantly domestic focus in the shared content. Moreover, the majority of these\ndomains  lean  towards  the  right  or  extreme  right  in  their  bias  rating.  Notably,\nthegatewaypundit.com,  classified  as  \u201cextreme  right\u201d  and  having  \u201cvery  low\u201d  factual\nreporting, stands out with the highest frequency of 3.03%, followed by Breitbart.com and\nInfowars.com  with  1.08%  and  0.91%  respectively.  There\u2019s  a  noticeable  correlation\nbetween high traffic and the frequency of shares, suggesting that popular sites with larger\naudiences have a higher likelihood of being circulated within the network. Examples\ninclude Breitbart.com, Dailymail.co.uk, and Theepochtimes.com, all of which have high\ntraffic and are among the top domains shared.\nLimitation\nWhile this study provides valuable insights into how a far-right organization, the\nProud Boys, makes use of an alternative, relatively unregulated social media platform, it\nis  not  without  its  limitations.  First,  the  research  is  confined  to  our  data  collection\nmethods. Specifically, utilizing Telegram\u2019s \u201cforward\u201d feature to expand upon our initial\nseed list of channels opens the door to certain potential biases. Primarily, our starting\nchannels have an undeniable influence on the derived channels, potentially leading to a\nlack  of  sample  diversity.  There  is also  a  risk  of  recurrently  encountering  the  same\nchannels, leading to an echo chamber effect. \nThe search constraints imposed by Telegram\u2019s design introduce another type of\nlimitation. Specifically, the platform\u2019s search functionality primarily returns channels\nbased on handle or name matches, which means that our exploration was accordingly\nlimited to these parameters. This restricted search capability suggests that there may be\nchannels related to our topic of interest that don\u2019t explicitly mention relevant keywords in\ntheir handle or name and, thus, might have been missed in our study. Other sources of\nlimitation include the forward feature\u2019s algorithm, which may inherently favor popular or\ncurrently active channels, inadvertently sidelining smaller or dormant yet still relevant\n41 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nchannels. Lastly, the channels we\u2019ve accessed are shaped by user behavior, and if our\nseed channels exhibit certain preferences or biases, the derived channels will reflect those\ntendencies. \nNevertheless,  even with these limitations in mind, we feel confident that our\nstrategy ensured that the sample covered a vast network of channels associated either\ndirectly or indirectly  with  the seed channels. This method is beneficial  in capturing\npotential lesser-known channels that might be indirectly linked to the primary channels or\nthat emerge over time. Moreover it offers a dynamic and organic expansion method that\nmimics real-world user behavior on the platform.\nTurning to other potential limitations, to determine whether a source is misleading\nor not, we relied on external credibility ratings to assess the unreliability of URLs. This\nmethod is domain-based and dependent on the MBFC website. Next, to capture the flow\nof URLs between Proud Boys and other four far-right groups, we relied on identical\nURLs  rather  than  the  \u201cforward\u201d  actions  in  Telegram  channels.  We  opted  for  this\napproach because the text network often captures these actions, and URLs are frequently\nshared independently without using the \u201cforward\u201d feature. Additionally, in collecting the\ndomains, we encountered numerous short links from \u201cbit.ly\u201d. Regrettably, not all of them\ncould be expanded due to expiration or invalidity upon access. For those unexpanded\nshort  links,  we  retained  them  under  the  domain  of  \u201cbit.ly\u201d,  which  might  lead  to  a\npotential underestimation of the frequency of unique domains.\nConclusion\nThis study offers insights into the Proud Boys\u2019 digital presence on and use of\nTelegram.  Our findings indicate that the Proud Boys established and expanded their\npresence  on  Telegram  in  November  2018,  coinciding  with  Facebook\u2019s  enforcement\nactions against pages and profiles affiliated with group (Statt, 2018). A second large\nexpansion of the network was precipitated by the January 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol attack. As\n42 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\nof the conclusion of our data gathering in February 2022, our analysis identified 92\nprimary  Proud  Boys-affiliated  channels  with  over  130,000  subscribers,  extending\nglobally from the U.S. to regions like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Europe. \nIn addition to these channels with explicit affiliation with the group, over 2800\nchannels  were  identified  that  also  disseminate  Proud  Boys-aligned  content.  These\nchannels, while not overtly affiliated, showed interconnectivity, often bridging various\ncommunities  and  acting  as  crucial  nodes  in  this  digital  network.  The  Proud  Boys\nTelegram network is also closely connected with a number of far-right and/or fringe\ncommunities  on  Telegram,  including  Trump  enthusiasts,  QAnon  followers,  white-\nsupremacist communities, and COVID-19 doubters.\nAn inductive content analysis, utilizing LDA topic modeling, of the messages and\ninformation  shared  within  the Proud Boys  network revealed  strong undercurrents  of\nmisogyny, a critical or hostile stance towards liberals, and an abundance of conspiracy\nnarratives. The discourse spans a wide array of topics, from the U.S.-centered political\ndynamics,  such  as the  Trump-Biden  discussions,  to  broader  global issues,  including\ninternational politics and the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, URLs shared within\nthese channels often lead to alt-right platforms or conservative-biased sites.\nThe threat posed by the Proud Boys and other far-right extremist groups has been\nraised by numerous journalists and experts. However, it was not until after the 2020\npresidential election and the January 6, 2021 insurrection that the mainstream began to\nrecognize the seriousness of the issue (Kenes, 2021).  Despite facing internal and external\npressures, our findings suggest that Proud Boys remain active, especially online. Future\ninvestigations could focus  on this organization\u2019s  transnational collaborations and the\npotential ideological unions of various other far-right factions on Telegram.\nAcknowledgements\n43 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nWe first thank the Institute for Data, Democracy, and Politics for its support of \nour work.

We \nadopted the seed propagation approach to network subgraph extraction, the process commences \nby selecting a node at random, termed the \u201cseed node\u201d. From this starting point, a traversal \nalgorithm, that is, breadth-first search (BFS), is employed. This algorithm explores the \nneighboring nodes stemming from the seed, progressively expanding the subgraph. This \nexploration and expansion continue until the subgraph reaches a predefined size, in this case, \n2934 nodes. \nAccess to the far-right Telegram networks documented by Urman and Katz (2020) can be\nfound in their appendix. The following six networks are displayed:\n13 JQD: DM 4(2024) Proud Boys on Telegram\nFigure A1. The non-Proud Boys far right networks documented by Urman and Katz (2020)\nStep-by-step Description of the Methodology for Discerning Gatekeepers and\nRepresentatives within Proud Boys Network\nStep 1: Community Detection\n\uf0b7Convert the Proud Boys network into an undirected version and use the Louvain \nmethod to detect communities (or divisions).\nStep 2: Centrality Calculation\n\uf0b7Compute the betweenness centrality for all nodes in the directed Proud Boys \nnetwork\n\uf0b7Filter out nodes based on betweenness centrality that\u2019s higher than the \nnormalized mean value. This ensures only influential nodes are considered in \nfurther analysis.\nStep 3: In-degree and Out-degree Analysis\n14 Zhong et al. Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media 4(2024)\n\uf0b7Compute the weighted in-degree and out-degree for each node. The in-degree \nrepresents incoming connections, while the out-degree represents outgoing \nconnections.\n\uf0b7Calculate the average in-degree and out-degree across all nodes.\nStep 4: Gatekeeper Identification\n\uf0b7For each edge in the network:\n\uf0a7If the target node belongs to the identified Proud Boys channels and the \nedge comes from a different community, calculate a score. This score is a \ncombination of the edge\u2019s weight and the difference between the node\u2019s \nin-degree and out-degree.\n\uf0a7Rank the nodes based on their gatekeeper scores. The top nodes with the \nhighest scores are the main gatekeepers.\nStep 5: Representative Identification\n\uf0b7Similarly, for each edge in the graph:\n\uf0a7If the source node belongs to the identified Proud Boys channels and the \nedge goes to a different community, calculate a score. This score is \ninfluenced by the edge\u2019s weight and the difference between the node\u2019s out-\ndegree and in-degree.\n\uf0a7Rank the nodes based on their representative scores. The top nodes with \nthe highest scores are the main representatives.\nManually Identification of Misinformative COVID-19 related Telegram Channels\nTo ensure a precise and accurate classification of channels disseminating COVID-19 \nmisinformation, we implemented a two-step examination process: Initially, we conducted a \nmanual review of each channel\u2019s metadata, encompassing its username, title, and description. \nThis allowed us to identify channels with clear markers of misinformation or conspiratorial \ncontent. The results are in the \u201cNotes\u201d column in Table A2.\nTable A2.

Using\n \nsocial media data mining, this study develops a deeper\n \nunderstanding of such targeted disinformation campaigns and\n \nthe ways they spread. It also adds to the available literature on\n \nthe endogenous and exogenous influences within the US far right,\n \nas well as motivating factors that drive disinformation\n \ncampaigns, such as geopolitical strategy. This study is to be taken\n \nas a preliminary analysis to indicate future methods and\n \nfollow-on research that will help develop an integrated approach\n \nto understanding the strategies and associations of the modern\n \nfascist movement.\n \n \nKeywords\u2014 Alt-Right, fascism, white-supremacy, data mining,\n \ntwitter, Russia, disinformation, information warfare, hybrid\n \nwarfare\n \n \nI.\nIntroduction\n \nFascism is both a palingenetic and syncretic form of\n \nultra-nationalism that frequently co-occurs with traditionalist\n \nfundamentalism, ethno-supremacy, authoritarianism,\n \nanti-cosmopolitanism, and opposition to open markets and\n \nliberalism. Although white supremacist groups manifest as\n \nfar-right movements opposed to freedom and equality, closer\n \nscrutiny tends to reveal overlap with a syncretic definition of\n \nfascist movements more broadly [11] [68] [77]. While fascist\n \nand white-supremacist dissemination methods have\n \nhistorically occurred through pamphleting, subcultural\n \naesthetics, and word of mouth, it now happens at a much\n \nlarger scale through the internet. Additionally, on the social\n \nmedia landscape state actors are able to engage in information\n \nwar at much larger level than ever before including by\n \npromoting extremist movements within other countries. As a\n \nresult of the monumental increase in dataset size, analysis of\n \nthis problem requires the tools of data science in order to\n \ngenerate wider reaching analyses of both mainstream social\n \nmedia and more niche forums. Tools like network mapping\n \nand natural language processing research on these social\n \nnetworks such as twitter provide a blueprint for better\n \nunderstanding this re-emergent threat on an international\n \nscale.\n \n \n \nII.\nLiterature Review (\n\u200b\nFascist, Alt-Right, and\n \nHate-group Specific Data Science)\n \nWhile historical scholars of fascism such as Hannah Arendt\n \nand the Frankfurt School provide insights into the psychology\n \nand context that gives rise to fascist movements, they require\n \nan update into the modern context. Therefore, it becomes\n \nimportant to present a review of available sources of\n \ninformation on modern fascism, and particularly the Alt-Right.\n \n \nAn important scholar on the phenomena of Alt-Right internet\n \nbased radicalization is Matthew Lyons who authored,\n \nCtrl-Alt-Delete: The Origins of the Ideology of the Alternative\n \nRight\n\u200b\n and works, in part, for the cutting edge think tank,\n \nPolitical Research Associates, alongside other scholars of\n \nmodern white-supremacist and fascist movements such as\n \nSpencer Sunshine. There is little modern study of the\n \nAlt-Right specifically from the academic sphere and instead\n \ncomes either directly from the mouth of babes such as \u201cAn\n \nEstablishment Conservatives Guide to the Alt-Right\u201d by\n \nBokhari and Yiannopolous [15], or the infamous, \u201cNormies\n \nGuide to the Alt-Right\u201d by the neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin [5].\n \nBeyond these self-proclamations, the most in-depth source of\n \nadditional research comes  from various antifascist publishers\n \nand authors such as Mark Bray and Shane Burley, as well as\n \ndecentralized antifascist research groups such as Rose City\n \nAntifa, One People\u2019s Project, and NYC Antifa.\n \n \n \nAlthough crude in many respects, one important study\n \nprovided a kind of natural language processing (NLP) study of\n \nthe fascist extremist board 8chan /pol/ that looked at language\n \nusage and exposed a wide range of credible threats to violence\n \nresulting from the networked support and vectors for\n \nradicalization of the gritty forum [49]. This mirrored the more\n \nscholarly findings of \u201cStormfront is Like a Second Home to\n \nMe\u201d by De Koster and Houtman in 2008 [2], which utilized\n \nqualitative analysis to suggest that online forums help white\n \nsupremacists feel less stigmatized while solidifying and\n \nradicalizing their ideology. Ross\u2019s recent guide, \n\u200b\nAgainst The\n \nFascist Creep\n\u200b\n, exposits a broader strategic approach by\n \nfascists to \u201center\u201d political and social milieux in order to\n \ndisseminate [11]. While such historical patterns still apply, the\n \n \nmodern fascist movement has distinct characteristics and\n \nthreats.\n \n \nAlthough there is an abundance of historical study on hate\n \ngroups, and even more so Islamic extremism, there is\n \ncomparatively little actual data science applied to movements\n \nsuch as the Alt-Right and their more extreme descendents\u2019\n \nmobilization through the internet. In \u201cHate Online: A Content\n \nAnalysis of Online Extremist Internet Sites,\u201d Gerstenfeld,\n \nGrant, and Chiang [41] found that \u201cthe Internet may be an\n \nespecially powerful tool for extremists as a means of reaching\n \nan international audience, recruiting members, linking diverse\n \nextremist groups, and allowing maximum image control.\u201d This\n \nis reinforced by \u201cCyberhate: The Globalization of Hate\u201d\n \nwhere Perry and Olson [25] showed how the internet has\n \ncreated a medium by which historically fractured white\n \nnationalist and fascist movements are able to create a\n \ncollective and supra-national identity thus strengthening the\n \nmovement in turn.  Through network analysis focusing on\n \nreciprocal following and interactions of prominent white\n \nsupremacist twitter accounts, Callaghan et. al. [14] uncovered\n \ndeeply internationalized relationships developed over topics\n \nunderlying extreme right ideologies. In an innovative\n \napproach, Burris, Smith, and Strahm [82] studied external\n \nlinks of white supremacist forums and websites to analyze\n \nbridges and cleaves in the movement. They found that:\n \nInterorganizational links are stronger among groups with a\n \nspecial interest in mutual affirmation of their intellectual\n \nlegitimacy (Holocaust revisionists) or cultural identity (racist\n \nskinheads) and weaker among groups that compete for\n \nmembers (political parties) or customers (commercial\n \nenterprises). The network is relatively isolated from both\n \nmainstream conservatives and other extremist groups.\n \nChristian Identity theology appears ineffective as a unifying\n \ncreed of the movement, while Nazi sympathies are pervasive.\n \nRecruitment is facilitated by links between youth and adult\n \norganizations and by the propaganda efforts of more covertly\n \nracist groups. Links connect groups in many countries,\n \nsuggesting the potential of the Internet to facilitate a white\n \nsupremacist \u201ccyber-community\u201d that transcends regional and\n \nnational boundaries.\n \nThis research implies that while the internet may facilitate\n \ngreater outreach and unifying collective identity, it also brings\n \nschisms to the surface contradictingly amplifying fractures as\n \nis seen in the constant infighting and purity spirals of forums\n \nlike 8chan [49].\n \n \nMore recently, Shannon Jones [51] published, \u201cMapping\n \nExtremism: The Network Politics of the Far-Right\u201d in which\n \nshe used network and discourse analysis to find that\n \nultra-nationalist parties utilized extra-parliamentary networks\n \non social media to help facilitate and sustain political\n \ntakeovers in Europe. Similarly Bevensee and Yershov [37]\n \nshowed that fascist movements employ memetically\n \ndangerous rhetorical devices in order to build capacity in\n \nattempting violent acts as well as larger political coups. They\n \nfurther showed how there is an explicit and conscious attempt\n \nto fight the social stigmatization of fascism by widening the\n \nOverton window through such online and discursive\n \nstrategies. An Italian-specific study by Parenti and Caini [69]\n \nshowed how extreme-right groups were exploiting \u201cthe\n \nInternet for diffusing propaganda, promoting \u2018virtual\n \ncommunities\u2019 of debate, fundraising, and organising and\n \nmobilising political campaigns,\u201d thus confirming the link\n \nbetween online and offline actualization of extremist goals\n \n(273).\n \n \nThe vast majority of studies surrounding radicalization\n \nsurround the topic Islamic terrorism, despite the fact that there\n \nthe threat of violence from fascist, far-right, and white\n \nsupremacist groups is statistically greater [83]. Snopes\n \nreporter Dan MacGuill [84] wrote that \u201cNot a single death has\n \nresulted from terrorist activity by a Muslim extremist\n \nrefugee.\u201d However he also cited the faulty 2017 study by the\n \nU.S. Government Accountability Office that oversimplified\n \nthe Pulse nightclub shootings by Omar Mateen as Islamic\n \nextremism, which led them to conclude that far-right attacks\n \nwere lower in number than those of Islamic extremism. A\n \nmore detailed study of Mateen\u2019s relationship to Islam revealed\n \nthat it was spotty at best, as both his Imam and ex-wife\n \nconfirmed [47]. Alt-Right and Islamic extremist movements\n \nhave also been shown to share similar values from different\n \nangles [59], evidenced most explicitly by the semi-ironic\n \n\u201cwhite shariah\u201d movement coming out of the Alt-Right [81].\n \nAlthough there are many complexities to counting and\n \ndefining what makes a \u201cfascist\u201d or \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d crime\n \nversus \u201cIslamic extremism,\u201d there is nonetheless a clear rise in\n \nhate groups [40] with a concomitant rise in hate crimes [39].\n \n \n \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center study of Alt-Right-linked\n \nkillings released in 2018 found over 100 people murdered with\n \nthe majority of the killers being under 30 (thus very exposed\n \nto the internet) and all male [67]. This is not surprising when\n \nreflecting on the research done in \u201cA Psychological Profile of\n \nthe Alt-Right\u201d which found that adherents \u201cexpressed higher\n \nDark Triad traits, social dominance orientation, and\n \nauthoritarianism; reported high levels of aggression; and\n \nexhibited extreme levels of overt intergroup bias, including\n \nblatant dehumanization of racial minorities [6]. This study is\n \nfurther reflected in the Associated Press call to encourage\n \nreporters to not call adherents by the specific term\n \n\u201cAlt-Right,\u201d which they deemed to be a deception designed to\n \nhide their true allegiances to white supremacy movements\n \n[17]. Meanwhile the right claims the status of victim to\n \nIslamic, immigrant, and leftist violence despite responsibility\n \nfor the clear majority of political violence [85]. Despite\n \nwhatever semantic difficulties exist, the demand for\n \nbroad-based data science on the topic of fascism and white\n \n \nsupremacism, more broadly, and the Alt-Right, specifically, is\n \ngreater than ever.\n \n \n \nA.\nDisinformation and Botnets\n \nPeter Hernon [29] writes that \u201cInaccurate information might\n \nresult from either a deliberate attempt to deceive or mislead\n \n(disinformation), or an honest mistake (misinformation).\u201d The\n \nAlt-Right presents a complexification of this simplified notion\n \nin that individual actors may varyingly believe in the racist or\n \nfascist political propaganda they spread, or they may be\n \nintentionally using information misleadingly to achieve a\n \npolitical ends. Additionally, while they may be making an\n \n\u201chonest mistake\u201d personally, they can be unknowingly a part\n \nof a larger geopolitical struggle of disinformation through\n \nstate-run media outlets pursuing a political agenda.\n \n \n \nAnother tool in the arsenal of state-based disinformation\n \ncampaigns is social-media bots as part of the information\n \nwarfare of hybrid-warfare [89]. Social-bots have begun to\n \nrepresent a large share of the social media landscape and while\n \nsome are innocuous or even helpful, many can cause damage\n \n[74] either through things like automatic retweeting of\n \ndisinformation or of politically motivated propaganda spread\n \n[44]. It is difficult, however, to identify malicious twitter\n \naccounts [35] or fake news  (Shu, et. al. 2017).  Kumar and\n \nShah [32] have made significant progress in identifying the\n \ntypologies of false information spread through social media\n \nand the various effectiveness of its many forms. Ferrara et al\n \n[74] also created a massive sting operation called \u201cBot or Not\u201d\n \nthat utilized both crowdsourced and machine learning\n \nalgorithms to detect bots on social media through various\n \nfactors.  For the purposes of this paper, we utilize the language\n \nof disinformation more broadly to highlight the ways in which\n \nAlt-Right mobilization is rooted in faulty notions for the\n \npurposes of political power grabs that can manifest on the\n \nlarger multi-national theatre of geopolitical warfare.\n \n \nB.\nGaps in the Literature\n \nIt is clear that the interconnectivity and global reach of the\n \ninternet has brought new opportunities and challenges to the\n \nfield of politics and policy. The same fascist movements that\n \nsee \u201cglobalism\u201d as a threat to their integrity have since begun\n \nto rely and even excel at utilizing the internet as a means of\n \nborderless connectivity for the purposes of violently\n \nanti-multicultural mobilization. By analyzing Alt-Right\n \nmovements using big data methodologies on social media, we\n \ncan reveal the extent to which they have succeeded and how\n \nbest to thwart their movements. To the extent that these\n \nmovements are being steered by larger, state-based\n \ngeopolitical projects, they will be more difficult to unravel.\n \nHowever, data science provides the tools needed to tease apart\n \nthe connections underpinning these modern movements. This\n \nresearch is all the more important while many western powers\n \nover-focus on foreign Islamic threats rather than homegrown\n \n(if internationally manipulated) fascist threats veiled as the\n \n\u201cAlt-Right\u201d.\n \n \n \n \nIII.\nHistorical and Present Context\n \nMuch of the Alt-Right\u2019s international outlook stems from\n \ninternational correspondence groups forged through affinities\n \namong fascists during the 1980s and \u201990s. Attempting to fuse\n \nrevolutionary left-wing ideology with far-right\n \nethnonationalism, groups like American Front entered into\n \nassociation with the Italian Terza Posizione (Third Way),\n \nFrance\u2019s Troisieme Voie (also Third Way), and the influential\n \nBelgian fascist, Jean-Francois Thiriart. Together, this so-called\n \n\u201cInternational of Mailboxes\u201d circulated group literature,\n \nmanifestos, and strategic documents to set forth a strategy for\n \ninternational fascism. Amid the decline of the Soviet Union,\n \nmost of these \u201cThird Positionists\u201d pursued a \u201cNational\n \nBolshevik\u201d ideology, which supported a kind of revolutionary,\n \nethno-nationalist model of Soviet-like governance in Western\n \nEurope in favor of North Atlantic liberalism purportedly\n \nimposed by NATO [18].\n \n \nIn the early 1990s, Thiriart traveled to Russia to promote a\n \nkind of Eurasian integration under a federated system of\n \nstrong, ultranationalist states, while his Italian disciple,\n \nClaudio Mutti, joined former Troisieme Voie organizer,\n \nChristian Bouchet, in advancing a geopolitical strategy\n \npromoted by Russian fascist, Alexander Dugin [18]. In\n \nDugin\u2019s influential 1997 text, \n\u200b\nFoundations of Geopolitics\n\u200b\n, the\n \nNational Bolshevik explicitly developed the strategy for\n \nintriguing within the social and political dynamics of the\n \nNorth Atlantic in order to bring about the disintegration of\n \nliberalism [36]. Utilizing the geopolitical notions of the\n \nEurasian \u201cHeartland\u201d and Atlantic \u201cRimland\u201d initially\n \nconceived by British geographer, Halford Mackinder, Dugin\n \nlayered fascist myths of the Aryan \u201cSonnenmensch\u201d over an\n \nidea of a united Eurasia to promote a global Russian empire\n \nfrom Dublin to Vladivostok and southerly to the Indian Ocean.\n \n \n \n\u201cIn this respect, Heartland\u2019s position is clear: it is necessary\n \nto resist the USA\u2019s Atlantic geopolitics, on every level and in\n \nevery region of the world, in an attempt to fully weaken,\n \ndemoralise, deceive and ultimately defeat the opponent. It is\n \nparticularly important, moreover, to introduce geopolitical\n \ndisorder into domestic American reality, encouraging all\n \nkinds of separatism, a variety of ethnic, social and racial\n \nconflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements:\n \nextremists, racists and sectarian groupings, destabilising the\n \ndomestic process in the USA. At the same, this means\n \nsupporting isolationist tendencies in American politics and the\n \narguments of (often right-wing Republican) circles that\n \nbelieve the USA should confine itself to its domestic\n \nproblems.\u201d \n\u200b\n[36]\n \n \n \nWhile Dugin\u2019s text found wide currency and influence among\n \nhigh levels of the Russian state, including the General Staff of\n \nthe Armed Forces, the Putin regime installed in 2000 pursued\n \na foreign policy largely amenable to Western interests until\n \nWestern support for Kosovo\u2019s independence in 2007 [19]. In\n \n2008, Russia invaded Georgia after a brief period of escalation\n \ninvolving the early model of modern cyber attacks seen\n \ncurrently in Ukraine. As competition over influence and\n \ncontrol over resources in Central Asia ramped up in the wake\n \nof the 2008 financial crisis, relations between the Kremlin and\n \nthe West grew increasingly tense as Putin blamed the decadent\n \nWestern liberals for mass public protests on the heels of his\n \n2011 re-election [75]. Russian state media turned the\n \nanti-Western sentiment toward support for protest movements\n \nin the US like Occupy Wall Street, while downplaying dissent\n \nwithin Russia [22].\n \n \nRussian media became a hub for right and left-wing political\n \nactivists to express their dissent against the US, and\n \nparticularly against liberalism. The Alt-Right fit into this\n \nstrategy, having emerged in 2008 largely through the influence\n \nof \u201canti-interventionist\u201d or \u201cisolationist\u201d far-right ideologues\n \nin college organizing\u2014particularly in relation to Richard\n \nSpencer\u2019s reports on the Duke Lacrosse Scandal, as well as the\n \nemergence of both the Taft Society and the Youth for Western\n \nCivilization [80] [70] [3]. Hence, Russian state-sponsored\n \nmedia followed Dugin\u2019s strategy of pitting left and\n \n\u201cisolationist\u201d far-right against the liberal center as Putin\n \nincreasingly gravitated toward a foreign policy focused on\n \nEurasian integration.\n \n \nIn 2013, Russia launched Sputnik, which advanced more\n \nradical perspectives from the left and right, often in\n \ncollaboration. While Russian media corresponded with the\n \nlikes of Mutti and Bouchet, the Alt-Right deepened its\n \ncontacts with Dugin through groups like the Traditional\n \nWorkers Party created by former Youth for Western\n \nCivilization organizer Matthew Heimbach. Meanwhile,\n \nconspiracy theorist Alex Jones hosted Dugin on his Infowars\n \nYouTube channel, and made a guest appearance on Dugin\u2019s\n \nfar-right Tsargrad television channel. The integration between\n \nAlt-Right and the international fascist movement, as located\n \nthrough the work of Thiriart\u2019s cohort in the 1980s, was\n \nfurthered by the trans-national development of Identity\n \nEvropa, a group that spun off from Youth for Western\n \nCivilization, borrowing its ideology from the Identitarian\n \nideology promulgated by French fascist, Guillaume Faye,\n \nwhose \u201cEuro-Siberianism\u201d is approximate to Dugin\u2019s\n \nEurasianism [61]. Thus, Russian media, Duginism, and the\n \nEuropean fascist movement, more broadly, played an\n \nimportant role in the maturation of the Alt-Right from its\n \ninception in 2008 up to its mainstreaming during the Trump\n \ncampaign.\n \n \nIV.\nMethodology\n \nOur research uses a combination of data mining techniques to\n \nunearth networks and implications of news providence\n \nthrough the study of links [82]. For the initial round of\n \ninvestigatory testing we utilized around 50 twitter accounts\n \nfrom prominent \u201cAlt-Right\u201d and \u201calt-light\u201d accounts. The\n \nalt-light is a variation of the Alt-Right that splintered from the\n \nplainly fascist elements during the Trump campaign, while\n \ncontinuing to utilize obfuscation and conspiracy theory to find\n \nentryways into the mainstream. We utilized several Python\n \npackages, including Tweepy, to gather around 5000 tweets\n \nfrom 20 Alt-Right and 20 alt-light accounts, and then\n \nextracted and expanded the links from within those tweets. We\n \nthen counted the frequency of unique base URLs from both\n \nthe Alt-Right and alt-light accounts in order to compare them\n \nto each other.\n \n \n \nV.\nInitial Findings\n \nExternal link analysis of the initial data revealed that the\n \nmajority of both Alt-Right and alt-light accounts rely on other\n \nsocial media sites and accounts for  information sources,\n \nrather than credible news outlets or journals. Aside from\n \nretweets, which were the majority of links, people frequently\n \nlinked to things like Facebook posts, instagram accounts, and\n \nto their own personal accounts on gab.ai, which is a \u201cfree\n \nspeech\u201d social media platform that has come under fire for\n \nallowing the incitement of violence and its ties to prominent\n \nneo-nazis [52]. Accounts cite YouTube videos more often than\n \nanything else, often linking to their own YouTube channels as\n \nseen by YouTube micro-celebrities such as Lauren Southern\n \nand Bridget Pettibone, who both recently met with Dugin in\n \nRussia [60]. Echoing the results of research into Islamic\n \nterrorism, we found that YouTube is a vector for white\n \nsupremacist radicalization [21].\n \n \n \nSimilarly, the accounts we studied often link to either their\n \nown personal blogs or the blogs with which they work. This is\n \nillustrated by figures like David Duke and Peter Sweden\n \ncreating personal websites, and by regular retweeting of white\n \nsupremacist \u201calternative news\u201d or research outlets such as\n \ntheoccidentalobserver.net, nationalpolicy.institute, and VDare.\n \nAmong the most explicit iterations to show up are \u201cFash the\n \nNation\u201d which is a project of \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d and hosts\n \npodcasts such as \u201cThe Daily Shoah.\u201d As may be obvious from\n \nthe thinly veiled anti-Semitism and fascist allusion in the\n \ntitles, this is an extreme Alt-Right podcast. They are\n \nresponsible for the propagation of the anti-Semitic memes,\n \nlike the \u201c(((echoes)))\u201d phenomena used to  identify supposed\n \nwidespread Jewish control [30]. They came under fire from\n \nother Alt-Right organizations, however, when their founder\n \nwas doxxed and revealed to have been married to a Jewish\n \nwoman [54]. Additionally, \u201cThe Political Cesspool\u201d appeared\n \nin the Alt-Right links. A white-supremacist podcast hosted by\n \nJames Edwards, who wrote a book called, \u201cRacism,\n \n \nSchmacism\u201d and is on the board for both the American\n \nFreedom Party and the Council of Conservative Citizens,\n \n\u201cPolitical Cesspool\u201d is a clear example of fascist media efforts\n \nonline, as well as deep coordination between fascist groups\n \nthat attempt to disguise themselves as radical-right\n \nconservatives (e.g., the \u201cFreedom Party\u201d identity popularized\n \nby the Austrian Freedom Party, or FPO) [13].\n \n \nCounter to these and other explicit white-supremacist sites,\n \nthere was a frequency of Jewish or Israeli sites linked. These\n \nwere often either making fun of their panic in sites like gab.ai\n \nor attempted \u201cgotchas\u201d at perceived loopholes in their political\n \nviews. This shows that, in addition to their own alternative\n \nnews ecosystem, the Alt-Right also engage in a degree of\n \nmonitoring of outlets that they perceive as ideological\n \nenemies.\n \n \nMany accounts seek to build credibility by citing multiple\n \nblogs which, upon analyzing WhoIs registry data, are revealed\n \nto be controlled by the same organization. The sites\n \ntheamericanfreedomparty.us, conservative-headlines.org, and\n \nthedailytrump.org are all owned by the Nevada-based\n \nAmerican Freedom Party which stems from the so-called\n \n\u201cThird Positionist\u201d (fascist) political tendency [13]. This trend\n \nof \u201crefraction,\u201d through which a single message is reproduced\n \nthrough different \u201cwrappers\u201d or political perspectives to give\n \nthe perception of the agreement of a heterogeneous plurality\n \nhas been observed in conspiracy theory networks supporting\n \nRussian geopolitical imperatives in Syria [44].\n \n \nThe import of personal blogs is made all the more clear by the\n \ndegree to which the aggregation of websites only shared once\n \nor twice appeared in both the Alt-Right and and alt-light\n \ntwitter accounts. This reveals a skew towards personal blogs\n \nsuch as national-socialist-worldview.blogspot.com and\n \nrefugeesettlementwatch.wordpress.com and away from larger\n \nmedia outlets with track records of credibility and fact\n \nchecking.  For example, Refugee Resettlement Watch is run\n \nby Ann Corcoran who frequently posts on the white\n \nsupremacist blog American Renaissance, which was founded\n \nby the white nationalist, Jared Taylor, to \u201cprove\u201d the\n \ninferiority of black people to whites and has become a\n \ncommon \u201csource\u201d among racist groups [50]. In addition to\n \nthese \u201calternative media\u201d hubs, there is also the presence of a\n \nnumber of nationalist European or pseudo-Eurasian news\n \nblogs such as traditioeuropae.wordpress.com, breizatao.com,\n \neuropa-terra-nostra.com, or orientalreview.org.\n \n \nAside from this highly dispersed and diffuse, alternative news\n \necosystem of personal blogs and YouTube videos, there is also\n \na density of links to Kremlin media outlets such as Russia\n \nToday (RT) and Sputnik News. The ability of Russian\n \nstate-controlled media outlets to drive their narratives through\n \nprominent Alt-Right figureheads aligns with the historical\n \nstrategy of people like Dugin and his affiliated Izborsky Club,\n \nas well as the modern tenants of \u201chybrid war\u201d (what Dugin\n \ncalls \u201cfourth political warfare\u201d) often associated with the\n \n\u201cGerasimov Doctrine\u201d of the leading officer in the General\n \nStaff of the Russian Armed Forces. Despite featuring\n \nprominently in the Alt-Right links, these Russian outlets did\n \nnot show up amongst the alt-light tweeters. This shows a\n \ndegree of nativism but may not indicate a lesser extent of\n \nsyncretic strategy, insofar as the alt-light is more prone to link\n \nto domestic, ostensibly-conservative sites and less likely to\n \nlink to foreign media, but does not have qualms with Tucker\n \nCarlson inviting left-wing guests on to his FOX News TV\n \nshow. Carlson\u2019s The Daily Caller, which, despite being more\n \nmainstream than many of the other sources, has engaged in\n \nvarious forms of conspiracy pandering such climate change\n \ndenialism, also appeared in the Alt-Right links [27]. The Daily\n \nCaller has gained prominence on the far right by taking radical\n \nand sometimes violent positions, for instance encouraging\n \npeople to use their cars to run-over protestors, as happened in\n \nthe murder of Heather Hayer during the Charlottesville \u201cUnite\n \nthe Right\u201d rally [28].\n \n \n \nThere was one English speaking reference from the Alt-Right\n \nto Dugin\u2019s Russian blog 4pt.su by Arktos Media, mourning\n \nit\u2019s temporary or permanent outage. Arktos is an Alt-Right\n \nmedia outlet that translates Dugin alongside the fascist French\n \nfounder of the Nouvelle Droite and pivotal inspiration for the\n \nAlt-Right, Alain de Benoist, who also spoke at a conference\n \nhosted by Richard Spencer\u2019s Alt-Right and white supremacist\n \nthink-tank National Policy Institute [66].\n \n \n \nBreitbart featured prominently in the alt-light accounts but\n \nabout half as often in among the Alt-Right twitterers. The\n \nformer head of Breitbart, Steve Bannon, was also the former\n \nchief strategist to Donald Trump. Bannon has shown strong\n \nideological ties with the Eurasianism of Dugin and Putin\n \nhimself [45]. This seems strange, considering the strong\n \nhistorical relationship between the Alt-Right and Breitbart, a\n \nla figures like Milo Yiannopoulos [15] who helped smuggle\n \nwhite supremacy into the mainstream and ultimately into the\n \nWhite House. Yet it is still important to note that Breitbart\n \nremains closer to an edgy conservative outlet of the \u201cradical\n \nright\u201d ilk, rather than being purely Alt-Right. Sites like these\n \nmake widening the Overton Window more possible as\n \nindicated by Bernstein\u2019s famous BuzzFeed article on the\n \nsubject [42].\n \n \nAmong the sites most implicated in both Russian\n \ndisinformation and syncretic conspiracy theories are Veterans\n \nToday, 21st Century Wire, ZeroHedge, GlobalResearch.ca,\n \nMintPressNews, and The Duran [44]. We analyzed accounts\n \nassociated with these sites separately from the Alt-Right and\n \nalt-light sites, and cross-referenced them for correlations. Only\n \nZeroHedge appeared in our initial data collection and only\n \n \nslightly in alt-light. It is possible that the higher level figures\n \nwe examined rely less on direct references to these sites than\n \ntheir followers, in addition to the fact that we are not yet\n \nstudying the types of bots implicated in propagating\n \nconspiracy theories at the behest of state actors.  However,\n \nZeroHedge made another appearance in a Latent Semantic\n \nIndexing of 500 tweets between Alt-Right handles and their\n \nfollowers. Although inconclusive, this does suggest that an\n \nanalysis that expands the handles beyond these prominent\n \nfigures would feature such sites more prominently. In the\n \nsphere of conspiracy theories, however, Infowars was found in\n \nboth Alt-Right and alt-light link counts, as well as other\n \nwebsites implicated in conspiracy theory propagation, such as\n \nthefreethoughtproject.com [38].\n \n \n \n \nThe most prominent and clearest connection between the\n \nAlt-Right and conspiracy theory sites in our conspiracy theory\n \nselection is called The Unz Review, which appeared very\n \nfrequently amongst the Alt-Right twitter handles. The Unz\n \nReview is a \u201cmix of far-right and far-left anti-Semitic\n \ncrackpottery, from 9/11 \u2018truther\u2019 and conspiracy theorist Paul\n \nCraig Roberts to \u2018Holocaust industry\u2019 critic Norman\n \nFinkelstein, who believes Jews exploit the Holocaust to justify\n \noppressing Palestinians\u201d [87]. This website represents the\n \nheart of Alt-Right disinformation landscape, in that it sees\n \nitself as a radical opposition to the mainstream that transcends\n \nthe traditional left-right political binary in order to propagate\n \nwhite-supremacist narratives amidst a wide range of\n \nconspiracy and propaganda.\n \n \n \nAmong the sites that support the Unz Review is the\n \nanti-Semitic and pro-Kremlin website russia-insider.com [86],\n \nwhich also featured in the Alt-Right websites linked.\n \nRussia-Insider keeps a running feed of articles posted on The\n \nUnz Review. Russia-Insider was founded in tandem with a\n \nlarger effort to generate a more positive view of the Kremlin\n \nin the US by taking a critical approach to US politics from a\n \nRussian perspective while advancing pro-Russian conspiracy\n \ntheories. Russia-Insider\u2019s top sources of traffic, according to\n \nAmazon\u2019s Alexa site overlap tool are searches for ZeroHedge,\n \nand the top sites visited before it were Sputnik News and RT.\n \n \n \nAside from the linkages fostered by hyperlinks and audience\n \nclustering, as rendered through site metrics, it is important to\n \nobserve direct, personal linkages in this alternative newscape.\n \nRussia Insider was co-founded by a Gilbert Doctorow, a\n \ncolumnist for the alternative news site Consortium News,\n \nwhich publishes conspiracy theorist Caitlin Johnstone, who\n \nopenly supports an alliance between left and far-right forces\n \nagainst the liberal center. Doctorow also co-founded the\n \npro-Kremlin interest group \u201cAmerican Committee for\n \nEast-West Accord\u201d (ACEWA) in 2014 via an event in\n \nMoscow known as the Russia Forum, which is convened by\n \nthe American University in Moscow headed by long-time\n \nfar-right operator, Edward Lozansky. Lozansky\u2019s University\n \nhosts a \u201cthink tank\u201d that includes Doctorow, Duginists like\n \nMark Sleboda, political activists like the Ron Paul Institute\u2019s\n \nDaniel McAdams, and Unz Review columnist, Anatoly\n \nKarlin.\n \n \nPresent at the \u201cround table\u201d that conceived the ACEWA was a\n \nDuginist named Andrew Korybko, whose analyses have been\n \npublished by the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, a\n \nthink tank noted for its involvement in strategizing the 2016\n \nelections meddling [57]. The ACEWA was subsequently\n \nlaunched in Brussels by Doctorow with another \u201cround table\u201d\n \nthat included a far-right, pro-Kremlin associate of Dugin\n \nnamed Aymeric Chauprade, suggesting an inclination to draw\n \ntogether left and right with the intention of supporting\n \nrelations with the Kremlin. Doctorow has also written in\n \nsupport of Dugin\u2019s associate, Mateusz Piskorski. With\n \nDoctorow, the ACEWA was co-founded by a contributing\n \neditor to The Nation, Stephen F. Cohen, and its website editor\n \nis American Conservative contributor, James Carden [11].\n \n \n \nThe convergence of these interests\u2014specifically, Doctorow\u2019s\n \nengagements with Consortium News and Russia Insider,\n \nCohen\u2019s association with The Nation, and Carden\u2019s\n \ninvolvement with The American Conservative\u2014indicates a\n \nwidespread willingness to engage in a far-reaching effort\n \nuniting ideological positions in favor of a \u201cnew detente\u201d with\n \nthe Kremlin, vis-a-vis a coalition spanning far right and\n \nradical left. This engagement mirrors Dugin\u2019s strategic\n \nproposition that the Kremlin should propagate and spawn both\n \nextreme right and left wing politics as a means of destabilizing\n \nthe US while also increasing the ground upon which larger,\n \nsyncretic fascist projects, such as the Alt-Right, can be sewn\n \n[12].\n \n \n \nFurther, Dugin has shown incredible support for both Donald\n \nTrump [73] and the Alt-Right. Evidence of the impact of\n \nDuginist political philosophy on concrete Russian policy can\n \nbe seen in the fallout surrounding the expansive involvement\n \nof the Russian \u201cInternet Research Agency\u201d on the 2016\n \nelection of Donald Trump [79]. Through an elaborate troll\n \nfarm, they were able to create thousands of bot accounts that\n \npromoted right and left-wing opposition to liberalism while\n \npropagating, and even funding, various political events,\n \nincluding protests. It might be said that the general idea of\n \ntampering in foreign elections through various forms of media\n \nis well-worn strategy practiced by different countries and\n \ncorporate actors, including the US; however, Russian media\n \nstrategy reveals a more sophisticated, internet-age approach to\n \ngeopolitical manipulation that, if successful, could support\n \ninternet-led fascist mobilizations in the US and elsewhere. The\n \nwork of Kate Starbird [44] and others on disinformation and\n \nconspiracy theory networks on Twitter has begun to unravel\n \nthe ways in which movements like the Alt-Right can create an\n \n \n\u201calternative media\u201d bubble [1] that is vulnerable to state\n \ninterventions. Further study of things like botnets, as well as\n \nnews sources of the Alt-Right through things like external link\n \nanalysis, could begin to unravel the extent to which these\n \nmovements are a part of a larger geopolitical project.\n \n \n \nVI.\nNeed for further research\n \nThis initial dataset was intentionally constrained to ensure\n \nmethodological consistency and code capacity in order to\n \nscale analysis later. As a follow up we will create a metric for\n \n\u201cfriendship\u201d that can be used to generate a much more\n \nmassive dataset following the other similar research\n \nprocedures. From this big data set we will create network\n \nmaps in addition to more thorough analysis of external links.\n \nWe will then also scale external link analysis in order to create\n \nnetwork maps of websites to investigate how often they\n \nreference each other beyond just twitter. From this position we\n \ncould also look at server IP addresses to determine a rough\n \nanalysis of where different sites are being hosted.\n \n \nAs we scale the number of accounts we can also begin to\n \nincorporate methods that allow for the inclusion of potential\n \nsocialbots and more fringe accounts. This will likely reveal\n \nmore clearly the relationship of the Alt-Right to conspiracy\n \ntheories and \u201calternative news\u201d sites.\n \n \nVII.\nConclusion\n \nAmidst the resurgence of fascism and authoritarianism in\n \npopular culture, there is a concurrent global information war\n \nafoot. State super-powers are warring through manipulating\n \nthe information sources and social media discourses of\n \ndifferent political groups in foreign nations. Our initial data\n \nsuggests that the Alt-Right leans heavily on Kremlin\n \ncontrolled media sources as a critical backbone of their\n \nideology, thus playing a role in their concomitant violence.\n \nFurther scaling of data mining analysis of Alt-Right twitter\n \nnetworks will give greater insight into the shape and contour\n \nof fascist disinformation and influence networks in the age of\n \nbig data. Undermining the instrumental rationality of\n \nauthoritarianism through data analysis gives us the opportunity\n \nto push-back on the empowerment of proto-fascist movements\n \nacross the globe.\n \n \nVIII.\nBibliography\n \n[1]    A.

The project explores cultivation deeply, especially the \nconcepts of  mainstreaming, the Mean World Syndrome, and resonance, while challenging some \nestablished notions and deterministic aspects of the theory. Employing a diverse range of \nmethods, such as survey, interviews, and an experiment, the project focuses on four individuals, \nthree categorized as politically left -leaning, and one categorized as alt -right in their news \nconsum ption profiles. The interviews of these subjects explore  how these individuals actively \ncurate their news intake  and how th e lived realities of these individuals do, or do not, come \nagainst the narratives of their media. Through experiment, the three left -leaning individuals were \nasked to alter their news consumption habits , revealing a n active reinforcement and justification \nof their typical media . The analysis of the  interviews and experiment leads to a reinterpretation \nof cultivation\u2019s resonance . By establishing a difference between resonance that is more concrete \nversus abstract , the argument is made that lived experiences that are grounded in a subject\u2019s lived \nreality  serve as a means of preventing or  limiting the effect of cultivation.  The interview and \nanalysis of the alt -right individual provides a case study in cultivation mainstreaming, \nhighlighting a convergence in worldviews between hi m and the media that he consumes. The \nproject overall suggests that individuals are not passive receivers of media\u2019s messaging, and \nadvocates for utilizing agency in the consumption of media.  \n  \niv \n Acknowledgements  \nI would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors  Timothy Schwab and Elizabeth \nMiller for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. I also extend my thanks \nto Dr. Fenwick McKelvey for his insightful feedback and encouragement.

I thank the dozens \nwho filled out my survey  and the people who graciously  agreed to be  interviewed  but did not go \nfurther  with the project.

\n Chapter 1 : Introduction to the Project  \nFollowing this introductory section, this thesis paper will  first explore the project\u2019s form \nof research creation, then provide a review of the theoretical framework  of Cultivation Theory, \nthe primary theoretical focus of the project, explaining its key concepts of mainstreaming, the \nMean World Syndrome, and resonance. Then, I present the methodology used in the project, \ndetailing survey, interviews, and an experiment. Discussion of the findings follows, where I draw \nconnections between the video essay's ana lysis, the literature, and explore further the conclusions \nof the video essay. Finally, the conclusion of this paper will summarize the project's \ncontributions and suggest avenues for future research.  \n1.1 A New (s) Syndrome  \nIt was  a high school civics class \u2014or perhaps it was  philosophy , or even a \ncommunications course ? \u2014where I first learned about a concept called the  Mean World \nSyndrome.  The concept was simple: those who are exposed to message s of violence in the  media \nthat they consume start to think that the world is more violent than it actually is.  For nearly \ntwenty years th is concept has followed me,  and it has altered how I look at people\u2019s actions and \nreactions differently. A family member getting riled up  at the dinner table  about trans athletes : \nwell, that\u2019s the Mean World Syndrome ! A friend blaming their unemployed status on immigrants \nstealing the ir jobs: Mean World Syndrome. A general sense of dread, worry, fear , and anxiety \nabout the state of the world? Well \u2026 the geopolitical climate has certainly shifted considerably  \nsince th is project\u2019s inception  in 2022 . Suffice to say, the Mean World Syndrome has been a \nfavorite theory of mine for decades.  But the syndrome was only a start, and in learning that it \nwas a part of a greater theoretical framework , I established a  basis for this research creation \nproject.  I had a strong feeling I knew where so many of these feelings were stemming from , and \nthat one kind of media w as a major  source  of the syndrome:  the news . \nThe news is an integral part of many people\u2019s lives. It  is important, it  is how we stay \ninformed and up to date on the goings on in the world. But what is the balance between being \ninformed and being overwhelmed with information? For years, I grappled with  this, for the news  \nused to play a significant role in my life . My family got the morning paper delivered every day ; \nthree of them even, at one point I remember, for some reason . I wrote articles that were \npublished in the local town paper. I even went to school to study Television \u2013 Broadcasting, \nwhere I fell in love with directing live news broadcasts. But as part of that program, I learned \nspecifically how broadcast  news was made. At one point we were tasked with producing a \nroughly three -minute  \u201cin-the-field\u201d news piece , featuring  a reporter  and commentary from off-\nthe-street  people , every one or two weeks. This exercise was extremely challenging , because  it\u2019s \none thing t o just report on a news event,  and another to  play journalist  and seek out things to \nreport on. Quickly, anything and everything mildly interesting could be considered a news story. \nA new school group teaching indigenous drumming techniques? That\u2019s a  great n ews story ! \nFrequent delays in the bus system? News story. Vending machine broken? Technically , still a \nnews story.  We started producing content  to fill a quota , rather than create anything  meaningful . \nNow , this program was not a journalism program by any m eans,  it was practical based , but I \nbegan to see how our experiences could also be reflected  in the actions of the mainstream news. \nThey too so often produce c ontent by any means , just at a significantly larger scale ; we struggled \nwith making one video a week , yet as we know t he twenty -four-hour news cycle  exists . I noticed \nfrom news creators a willingness to make an issue out of something rather than go and report on \n \n2 \n a real problem . In learning how the news was made, I became disillusioned with it, and thus I \nstarted  to consume as little news as possible.  \nWith this new paradigm, t he issue I faced as the years went on was that this \ndisillusionment bordered on apathy.  An apathy that came at a cost.  I lost a connection to the flow \nof information in the world, and I simply became less informed.  And w hile I took great strides to \nnot let myself be as affected by the news,  I was still being affected by how affected everyone \nelse was. In an era of political turmoil  (what era isn\u2019t though) , of the increasing threat of \u201cfake \nnews\u201d and a shift in the value of \u201ctruth \u201d in society, of the power of social media , and the \nuprooting of traditional  institutions of journalism , the news, whatever that was, was  becoming  \nimportant in never -before -seen ways . And so, I became increasingly concerned with the ways \nthat news consumption  could shape our perceptions of reality  and shape what we deemed \nimportant or not . Just how much can the news affect us? This is what I wanted to explore  \nthrough this research -creation project.  \n1.2 On the Video Essay\u2019s Contents  \nAt one point, I learned that the Mean World Syndrome that I was so captivated by is a \npart of a greater theoretical framework called C ultivation  Theory , and t his theory  became my \nprimary  focus towards an  epistemological exploration of news media.  In the  video essay I \nexplain and exposit upon Cultivation Theory, and then  I use interviews  and an experiment \ncomponent  to engage in  critical analysis focused on a specific aspect  in cultivation  called  \nmainstreaming . To note, these interviews were conducted in the summer and fall of 2024 , and \nthus they are situated expressly within th at post-covid, pre -Trump -2 time period.  After \nexplaining what cultivation is, I establish the news profiles of three individuals who are \nidentifiably left leaning  and who all hail from my hometown of Kemptville, Ontario . Kemptville \nis in a staunchly  conservative riding both provincially and federally , but from living and working \nthere for decades  I felt confident I  could find individuals who fit the criteria of a habitual , heavy \nnews consumer with strong emotional ties to t opics in t heir news,  and from a wide range of \npolitical orientations ; this confidence was sorely tested in execution.   \nFollowing the establishment of their news profiles, I ask these individuals to conduct an \nexperiment to alter their news consumption habits entirely . One was asked  to consume only \nright -leaning news media, another to consume only far-left and far -right  news media , and the \nthird to abstain from news altogether. Their responses to this experiment were then compared \nagainst each other. Following them are selects from an interview with a distinctly alt -right \nindividual whose persona was anonymized in the video to hide their identity. I then compared the \nresponses of the first three against the responses of the alt -right individual, to draw conjecture on \nthe levels of mainstreaming they are each subjected to from their ne ws consumption.  \n1.3 Research Questions  \nAs is very common in research creation, this project went through many iterative changes \nbefore landing on the final version  of a video essay . The original conception for this project was \nas a documentary  film where  I wished to explore what the purpose of news was  and how much \nof an impact news media can have on people\u2019s dispositions. Feelings , emotions , and affect  were \nmajor factors of the project originally  and this conformed the direction of the interviews , \nexperiment component,  and initial research focu s.  \nMy original research questions were:  \n \n3 \n - Can the consumption of news media that is situated politically opposite to that \nwhich one normally consumes ( aka, alternative news media) meaningfully affect \nthe dispositions of individuals towards topics discussed in or out of that media?  \no And what does this tell us about the effects of cultivation ? \nI was also operating with a hypothesis  for this research question  that was integral  to the \ndirection the project initially took . The hypothesis was :  \n- Exposure to alternative news media cannot meaningfully change a person\u2019s held \nbelief s but rather c an alter their emotional response to certain topics . \nUltimately, I was  unable to prove or disprove this hypothesis with just the subjects and \nmedia I had found . This resulted in me moving away from a documentary film format  and more \ntowards analytical analysis of the content I had procured . With this , my original research \nquestion  was forgone, and I created a new one that I sought to pursue in this analytical analysis:  \n- Are the subjects  of these interviews subjected to cultivation mainstreaming? And \nif so, how much?  \nThis question  is explored  with an attempted  answer  directly in the video essay .  \n \n4 \n Chapter 2 : Introduction to the Form  \nThis project is considered research creation.  The video essay that accompanies this paper \nis the creative output of the research. Chapman and Sawchuk give an excellent explanation  of \nthis form , defin ing research  creation as  the integrati on of  a creative process with an artistic work \nas part of a study project (6). They further elucidate on four subcategories of research creation \nprojects : \u201cresearch -for-creation, \u201d \u201cresearch -from -creation, \u201d \u201ccreative presentations  of research, \u201d \nand finally \u201ccreation -as-research\u201d (16). Importantly, i n most of these subcategories Chapman and \nSawchuk  mention th em being iterative processes  (15\u201319). Iteration was  extremely  prevalent in \nthis project  at all stages , from the original idea of a  more  traditional documentary  focused \nheavily on the subjects , to a more hybrid documentary exploring the concept of news media, to \neventually the video essay , and several other variations in between . Each iteration served as a \nbase for the next  iteration . For example , I never s ought out to do the kind of analysis  present in \nthe video essay , so without building to that iteration of the project I would likely never  have  \ndrawn  that line of analytical thinking .  \n In the original conception of this project, I sought to employ specifically research -for-\ncreation  as a methodological  focus . My research methods , to be explored further  here in its  own \nsection , included  gathering  survey data, conducting interviews , and executing an experiment , all \nof which was then to be presented  in the form of a documentary film , to be the artistic work . \nInterestingly, t hrough the iterative process of the development of the output of my research  I feel \nthat I have in fact explored  three of these four sub categories of research creation, with even some \nargument towards  the fourth.  My justification for each is as follows:  \nThe video essay employs  the subcategory  method of  \u201ccreative presentations  of research. \u201d \nUnlike the original documentary film, the video essay -style piece serve s as more of a \npedagogical tool , at least that was my intention  for it . I felt that m y attempts to make complex \ntheoretical concepts more accessible to a wider audience  using  talking -head narration and artistic \nanimations  did not fit the style and form of a  traditional documentary film . This also le d me to \nengage in deeper analysis and interpretation of the content  using my own words. Originally, the \ndocumentary was to use mostly the words of the subjects in conversation with each other without \nmy overt commentary in between.  \nThe documentary did exist at one point  though mostly in \u201cassembly\u201d or very rough -cut \nform s; the interviews sections are pulled from that version though heavily truncated . This \niterative design is just what is described as \u201cresearch -for-creation \u201d by Champman and Sawchuk , \nwhere one piece of creative research informs and iterates into another  (16\u201318). If I had not cut \ntogether the interviews  as I had  for the documentary form at, I possibly would not have landed on \nthe critical analysis of the content the way I did in the video essay.   \nAnd then for the fourth subcategory  \u201ccreation -as-research, \u201d it is described as \u201c projects \nwhere creation is required in order for research to emerge\u201d (Chapman and Sawchuk 19) . I used \nthe documentary\u2019s content  and specific method of intercutting the interviews  to pull from , which \nthen allowed  for the research in the video essay to emerge.  And, t o a lesser extent even, the \ndeeper analysis in this paper employs that as well, stemming from the video essay  which was \nsomewhat constrained in breadth of exposition . Though this is less solid than the other  three sub-\ncategories . \nAs for the format of the video essay itself,  I drew from my years of video production \nexperience and education in broadcasting \u2013 television , scriptwriting , and my Communication \n \n5 \n Studies production courses.  The format was somewhat  inspired by the works of several \nYouTuber creators  who produce video essay content , who often  synthesize complex theoretical \nconcepts  into formats that are digestible by a general audience, while also incorporating \nanalytical research and analysis, interviews, a s well as  personal commentary . One such creator is \nDerek Muller,  otherwise known as Veritasium  on YouTube , who is  a popular science creator \nwho uses interspersed animations to better illustrate complex concepts. Muller aka Veritasium \u2019s \nvideos are usually hyper -focused  on one topic  and are framed as both instructional yet also as a \npersonal exploration into that one topic.  This is precisely what I tried to do with my video essay , \nand while I did not seek out to emulate him directly, in watching his videos now there are some  \nstylistic simi larities . Another creator is Lindsay Ellis  who produces video essay -style content  that \nis far more commentary based . Some of her videos feature more of herself in them which helped \nme shape the method  of self-insertion I tried to have  in my video . For Veritasium, and for some \nof Ellis\u2019 videos especially, they walk the line between a n academic research paper and an \nentertainment video , deeply exploring topics and weaving strong research through  personal \ncommentary and investigation . \n  \n \n6 \n Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework  \n2.1 Original Literature  \nThis project has a hyper -focused mono -theoretical perspective. In the original conception \nof the project , in the documentary form at, there was a wider array of theor ies that were  being  \napplied . As the project moved to video essay, to keep the content focused I decided to \nexclusively explore Cultivation Theory and base the theoretical framework off just that.  I wanted \nto make the video an extensive exploration of one theory, rather than try and bring in  other \ntheories that, while  potentially apt ly suited to reinforce my analysis and findings, would have \nmade the video much more theoretically dense. Another part of this justification was that, even \nthen there were many , arguably very important  aspec ts of cultivation that were not being \nexplored in the video , else the video would be twice as long as it is; most of these ignored \naspects are mentioned in the video  at the end . There are  also other theories that are mentioned  at \nthe end of the video , but there was no significant deep dive or literature review done for those, \njust enough to confirm the connections  mentioned . It is still worth noting some of the initial \ntheoretical research  that was done, as it did play a role in the conceptual development and initial \niterations of the project.  \n2.1.1 Affect Theory  \n As mentioned, the project was  at one point  much more focused on emotional \nengagement to news media, and Affect Theory was to be the theoretical perspective to further \nexplore this. Affect Theory being a popular and widely used theory in communications and \nbeyond means it has an extremely diverse and broad literature to pull from. There appears to be a \ngeneral resistance to \u201cbox -in\u201d affect and quantify it as a \u201ctheory\u201d  though, and a lot of the \nliterature seems to reflect that.  Andrew Murphie in \u201cFielding Af fect\u201d denotes affect\u2019s resistance \nto being institutionalized and \u201cpackaged,\u201d giving eighteen points discussing why this is the case, \nand how the very nature of affect \u201csuggests that [it] is perhaps not best pursued as [a] territorial \nquest for a delimited field\u201d (Murphie 4) . As such, the many voices who speak of affect are all \ntalking of the same \u201cthing,\u201d but each in extraordinarily different and diverse ways. In \nconversation with each other and  yet, to some degree, at odds with each other.  Sarah Ahmed\u2019s \n\u201cSticky Affects \u201d explores how affect can stick with objects due to certain associations  (Gregg et \nal. 30 \u201333). This could  be an excellent alternat e theory to explore the \u201cabstract resonance\u201d \nconcept that I establish in the video . Repeatedly associating negative affects with particular \ngroups or issues, news media contributes to the \u2018stickiness\u2019 of these feelings with people, either \nin the absence of direct personal experience or in the face of it.  When the project was exploring \nwhat the purpose of news was, I considered incorporating  Lauren Berlant\u2019s Cruel Optimism form \nof affect. In the opening paragraph Berlant describes  Cruel Optimism as \u201cwhen the object that \ndraws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially\u201d (1). In the \ncontext of this project, this would have explored how, despite causing us such anxiety , the aim of \nnews to be informed.  And a s Berlant continues, \u201c\u2026 subjects who have x in their lives might not \nwell endure the loss of their object /scene of desire, even though its presence threatens their well -\nbeing \u201d explaining why we develop an almost dependency on the news (24). This exploration of \naffect, while interesting, did not seem particularly applicable to later iterations of  the project . \nOverall, Affect Theory is a very broad and extensive field  of study. The one loss I regret is how I \nwas going to attempt to reinterpret  the \u201ceffects\u201d of Cultivation Theory instead as  \u201caffects\u201d \nthrough Affect Theory , but I digress.  \n \n7 \n 2.1.2 News Media Polarization  \nI did some preliminary research into news media polarization , and in the documentary \nversion of the project this was to have a much greater focus. In the video essay, things are  \npresented very binary, with the subjects on the left being labeled as such largely due to how \nstrongly on the right the other subject is  by comparison . There  is more nuance to the subject\u2019s \npolitical leanings  than is presented in this video , and  this section of research was going to be \nused to explore this. This needed to be dropped  due to the scope of the video essay.  \n What I explor ed originally  was t he divide between \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d sources of news , \nand how  this has become a reality of the news media landscape, even used as a signifier of what \nis truthful or what can be trusted. For example, the labeling of sources as \u201cwoke\u201d by \nconservatives and/or the right -leaning is an increasingly used tactic to decry messaging as  being \nuntrustworthy (Major) . This would have been very relevant in expanded  discussion surrounding  \nthe video\u2019s alt -right  subject . Hilariously, in the proposal for this project I had  a line that said \n\u201cfact checking has become a growing concern and effort on social media, and it has been \ncriticized for \u201cunfairly\u201d targeting or being weaponized towards people and news sources on the \nright \u201d (Stencel) . Since then, Facebook has completely removed fact checking, and \u201cCommunity \nNotes\u201d on X/Twitter are a dubiously reliable substitute  for it  on that platform  (Oxford; Drolsbach \net al.) . Research on the polarization of western news media has been conducted for decades, \ngoing back into the mid 20th century. Now though, with the internet and social media firmly \nsupplanting broadcast television in popularity, a renewed and shifted perspective in this research \nhas arisen (Shearer) . For example, as early as 2008 a study found \u201cgreater partisan filtering\u201d of \npotential news sources on the web compared to that of television (Baum and Groeling 345) . \nToday traditional media is  deeply intertwined with social media , and i n this light, more research \nand a stronger definition on what polarization even is today may be required (Kubin and von \nSikorski) . In the context of the video essay, almost all the subject s consumed the ir news via the \nweb, but  I never deemed this significant enough to analyze further.  \n2.2 Cultivation Theory  \nDeveloped in the 1960s  by Hungarian -born, American communications scholar George \nGerbner (1919 -2005), Cultivation Theory primarily explored the effects of heavy television \nviewing on individuals  (Nabi and Riddle 328) . These effects were explored through examining \nfictional primetime television dramas, focused \u201cat the macrolevel of broad scale institutional \npractices\u201d as Potter puts it (\u201cA Critical Analysis of Cultivation Theory\u201d 1017) . The \u201ccultivation \nhypothesis\u201d posits that long -term and extensive exposure to media causes individuals to develop \nworldviews that mimic the messages i n the content that they are exposed to (Morgan and \nShanahan, \u201cThe State of Cultivation\u201d 338) . Gerbner\u2019s methodology involved something called \n\"Message System Analysis,\" a systematic content analysis of television programming to identify \nrecurring themes and messages across primetime television.  To do this, Gerbner  created \nsomething he called the Cultural Indicators Message System Databank  (CIMSD) , which  was a \ncollection of data gathered from weeks of primetime television dramas , looking for consistent \npatterns. For the purposes of this project, while I elected to not create  a CIMSD,  I make the \nargument that the message siloing that occurs with politically polarized news media creates a \nkind of CIMSD where consistent messaging can be identified  and pulled from . \nFor the video essay I focused on Cultivation Theory in a rather broad sense , and there are \nmany aspects of Cultivation Theory that I outright ignore or do not utilize due to the scope of the \n \n8 \n project . I did apply some of these concepts  in the analysis , just without naming them to save \nthem  from overloading  the viewer of the essay with more theoretical concepts.  First and second \norder effects describe  how an individual\u2019s behavior first changes when exposed to media, and \nthen secondly how their attitudes and beliefs change  after. The accessibility principle (or model) \nis the viewer\u2019s ability to recall things they saw in the media , and  institutional process analysis \nexplores how  messages are dissem inated through media institutions (L. J. Shrum) . In a larger \nscale project, each of these aspects would be instrumental to fully executing cultivation analysis.  \nCultivation Theory is not without its criticism, and being aware of its historically denoted \nshortcomings is important, especially considering  its lesser use in communication studies today. \nScholars such as James W. Potter have written extensive critical analysis on cultivation, with a \ncommonly cited issue of the theory being the lack of agency that Gerbner gives the viewers of \nmedia  (\u201cA Critical Analysis of Cultivation Theory\u201d 1022) . As far as Gerbner is concerned, heavy \nconsumers  of a given media  are subjected to cultivation no matter what.  This is a highly \ndeterminist stance that begs for some added nuance in modernity.  As Potter explains, simply \nshifting the \u201cmeaning locus\u201d towards the receivers, as many have done in the continued \napplication of cultivation, allows for a greater breadth in use of the theory  (\u201cA Critical Analysis \nof Cultivation Theory\u201d 1022) . In this project I believe I attempted to do this , both in the video \nessay and further in this paper . Additionally, as far as Gerbner is concerned, television content is \nthis monolithic block of media, and many factors such as genre nuances, narrative structures, and \npotential viewer interpretation of the content of the media are not factored in  (Newcomb; \nHawkins and Pingree) . If a programme  had violence in it, then to Gerbner it contribute d to the \ncultivation of a heavy viewer\u2019s perception of the violent state of the world , regardless of the \nindividual\u2019s interpretation of that violence . Potter also criticizes the lack of studies done at the \ntime using cultivation which look at content such as news (\u201cA Critical Analysis of Cultivation \nTheory\u201d 1025) . \nThese criticisms are important especially in the context of this project . In today\u2019s \nfragmented media landscape , with the countless possible streams of information, identifying any \nkind of \u201cmonolithic block of media\u201d as it might have existed in the  second half of the twentieth \ncentury  is virtually impossible.  Additionally,  Cultivation Theory is meant to be applied at the \nmacro level, using questionnaire and survey to explore large scale trends over years. While \nGerbner did not explicitly denounce the use of micro -level analysis,  nor the use of experiment \nfor that matter,  the concep tion of the theory is heavily macro -focused . Gerbner\u2019s collaborators \nand other scholars have attempted to apply cultivation in more micro -level  focused ways over the \nyears (Morgan and Shanahan, \u201cTwo Decades of Cultivation Research\u201d) . Overall, Cultivation \nTheory is a somewhat  technologically  determinist theory that places too much power in the  \nhands of the  media, yet despite this shortcoming I believe it can still be used to great effect to \nexplore media effects  today bearing these shortcomings in mind . \n2.3 Mainstreaming  \nA core concept within Cultivation Theory, Mainstreaming is the convergence of attitudes \nand beliefs \u2014aka worldviews \u2014amongst heavy television viewers.  Through mainstreaming , \nheavy television consumers develop  a shared perception of reality that mimics the worldview of \nthe media  that they consume  (Gerbner et al., \u201cCharting the Mainstream\u201d) . Importantly, individual \ndifferences between the heavy consumers are overwritten  by the media , as everyone is \nmainstreamed into a similar reflection  of what they consume ; you are what you eat, so to speak . \nMost interestingly, Gerbner and his cohort found a degree of convergence in attitudes and beliefs \n \n9 \n that cross  the political divide . Heavy consumers of television would all begin to converge in their \nanswers and attitudes : liberals, moderates, conservatives would begin to answer far more \nsimilarly if they were  heavy television consumers (Gerbner et al., \u201cCharting the Mainstream,\u201d \nfigs.3 \u20134). Even more interestingly, this convergence typically trended  towards more conservative \nvalues . Through message system analysis, Mainstreaming was  identif ied through  so called \n\u201ctelevision answers\u201d from individuals  (Gerbner et al., \u201cGrowing up with Television\u201d) . These \nwere responses from people that aligned with the worldviews presented in television \nprogramming. For example, liberal respondents would suddenly shoot up in their favor towards \nlaws against intermarriage if they were a heavy television consumer , comparatively to their light \nviewer counterparts  (Gerbner et al., \u201cCharting the Mainstream,\u201d fig.3) .  \nAgain though, i t is important to understand that Gerbner\u2019s original studies were \nconducted when there was a dramatically different media landscape to today. There was a \nminiscule number of television stations that a given person could watch at any given time \u2014\nstations did not  even run for twenty -four hours  at that point . Creating a  Cultural Indicators \nMessage System Databank,  a collection of common themes and messages recorded from across \nprimetime television dramas at the time, was, by no means trivial, significantly easi er to do than \nit would be today.  In the context of this project, the argument is made that the homogeneity of \nyesteryear\u2019s television exists  still in the ideological silos of politically sorted news media.  \n2.4 The Mean World Syndrome  \nThe Mean World Syndrome is perhaps the most well -known aspect of Cultivation  \nTheory . As stated previously, it is the tendency of heavy television viewers to perceive the world \nas more dangerous or violent than it actually is. But the Mean World Syndrome can be used to \nencompass a broader sense of distrust, cynicism, and anxiety about the  state of the world that is \ninstilled upon people from the media they consume.  It's crucial to understand that the Mean \nWorld Syndrome is not solely about a realized belief of something (i.e., \u201ccrime rates are high!\u201d) \nit encompasses emotional and attitude components. Heavy viewers do  not just think the world is \nmore dangerous: they feel more vulnerable and anxious about the state of the world, which can \ninfluence their perceptions on other things too.  For example, as  Gerbner et al. explain s, this \ncultivated fear can lead to a variety of behavioral consequences, such as increased support for \n\"tough on crime\" policies, a greater willingness to accept authoritarian measures in the name of \nsecurity, and a general sense of helplessness and alienation in the face of this worldview \n(Gerbner et al., \u201cGrowing up with Television\u201d) . \nIn the context of this project, the Mean World Syndrome serves as a starting point for \nexploring the broader affective consequences of news consumption. While the project does  not \nfocus on violence, it examines to a degree how news media, through its selection and framing of \nstories, can cultivate a sense of unease, anxiety, and emotional distress, even in the absence of \ndirect personal experience with the issues being reported. Essentially, t he Mean World Syndrome \ndemonstrates that media can shape not just  our understanding of the world, but also our  \nresponse \u2014physical, emotional, or otherwise \u2014to the world as we are presented it.  \n2.5 Resonance  \nResonance is a crucial concept within Cultivation Theory that explains why some \nindividuals are more susceptible to  the effects of  cultivation than others. Resonance is an \namplification of the impact of media messages when th e messages align with or \"resonate\"  more  \nwith an individual's real -world experiences. In essence, resonance occurs when the \"television \n \n10 \n world\" and the \"real world\" converge, thus giving someone  a \"double dose\" of the message  as \nGerber puts it (Gerbner and Gross) . For example, a person who lives in a high -crime \nneighborhood and watches a lot of crime -related television is likely to experience stronger \ncultivation effects than someone who lives in a low -crime area. The media messages about \nviolence are reinforced b y their personal experiences, making the perceived threat seem more \nimmediate and relevant  to their person . Similarly, someone who has been a victim of a crime \nmight be  more  susceptible to the Mean World Syndrome after viewing violent media content , \nbecaus e that content will dramatically resonate  with them more.  Resonance adds an important \nlayer of nuance to Cultivation Theory . It somewhat, though not completely, acknowledges that \nthe effects of media are not as uniform and wholly dominating  (or determinist)  as the other parts \nof the theory might suggest.  Though Gerbner seems to only position resonance as it amplifies \ncultivation, rather than  potentially having  any opposite effect s. Regardless,  it establishes within \nthe theory that i ndividual experiences do play a role in shaping how we interpret and respond to \nmessages. It highlights an important  dynamic between the media world and the lived world . \n   \n \n11 \n Chapter 4: Methodology  \nThis project went through several large iterative changes due to the nature of the \nproduction and outlining how the project evolved from conception to finished product is \nimportant , as each iteration influenced the project going forward . In the original conception of \nthe project, I was focused on the emotional impact of news media and the importance that people \ngave to given social issues \u2014their disposition towards a topic. Through the project\u2019s \ndevelopment this shifted first towards a greater focus on the \u201cpurpose of news\u201d for habitual news \nconsu mers , until  eventually  landing on  a focus in synthesis  and reinterpretation  of the concept of \nresonance from Cultivation Theory.  \n3.1 News Sources Gathering  \nI needed to affirm my understanding of the possible differences between sources of news. \nBefore I began anything, I familiarized myself with different news sources on the left , right,  far \nright , and far left.  Where a news source falls on the political spectrum can be an important factor \nin whether someone will consider not only trusting it, but whether someone will even consider \nviewing it at all (Kubin and von Sikorski) . I did this to get a sense of things such as  the source \u2019s \nfrequency of  content , the types of content  they produced , and to affirm or deny any preconceived \nnotions I had about the sources.  I used several websites to help facilitate this, such as \nmediabiasfactcheck.com,  adfontesmedia.com,  groundnews .com, and allsides.com,  which claim \nto offer a degree of nonpartisan identification of media bias and truthfulness . These sites give an \nextensive explanation as to how they determine the political leaning of a giv en source , and what \nbiases they might present.  A direct result of this was  my new familiar ization  with many sources \nthat could be considered on the \u201cfar left ,\u201d resulting in me finding news sites  I had never heard of \nbefore . I eventually used this to develop a list of sources that was used further in the project  \nduring the experiment portion.  \n3.2 Expert Interviews  \nStemming from this I conducted interviews with Concordia University journalism \nprofessors Paul Gott and Francine Pelletier. Though I did not use these interviews in the video, \ntheir responses were integral to shaping my understanding of the \u201cpurpose\u201d of news media. \nImportantly, they helped shape the a ssertion I make in the video that, in the political divide of \nnews media, exists a kind of message sorting akin to what George Gerbner used in creating his \nCultural Indicators Message System Databank.  Also not used in the video was an interview I \nconducted  with Dr. David Shannahan , editor of the North Grenville Times,  a small -town \nnewspaper . Dr. Shannahan helped me develop a greater understanding of the  value and  \nimportance of local news . He also gave me  several possible leads and avenues to pursue in the \nother sections of the project , such as where to distribute my survey flier. \n3.3 Survey  \nTo find my interview subjects  for this project , I used the method of survey . I indicate d \nthat responses to the survey may be used illustratively in the documentary, but without any \npersonal information. The main purpose of the survey was to find people to interview.  To \ndistribute this survey,  I printed fliers ( see appendix ) designed to look like a news story webpage , \ncontaining a written link to the survey hosted directly on my personal website . The flier also had \na QR code  containing  the same link. This survey consisted of ten questions  designed to construct \nan initial news profile  of the respondent , which I could then use to gauge the viability of the \n \n12 \n person for further  participat ion. The questions in the \u201cNews Consumption\u201d section of the survey  \ncan also be found in the appendix.  \nThe flier was also printed as a large poster. These fliers and the posters were distributed \naround my hometown of Kemptville Ontario , at local businesses and places of work. Friends and \nfamily members took copies of the flier and poster  and distributed them  too. I produced a short \nvideo advertisement version of the flier which I posted on social media and that was shared by \nfriends and family, though this was shockingly ineffective and resulted in virtually zero uptick in \nresponses.   \nThere was an initial technical difficulty with the survey, where someone had managed to \ncrash the page that it was hosted on by putting some unexpected  information into one of the \npersonal information boxes . This issue might have accounted for a n unknowable  loss of potential \nresponses , as it went unnoticed for almost a day , right at the beginning , after the survey was \ndistributed around . \nAfter roughly a month in circulation  the survey had gathered ninety  recorded responses . \nThis was somewhat below my expectations, but it was cert ainly enough to work with at the time.  \nThe survey results were:  \n- YES,  to participat e in the experiment:  \no 9 left leaning  \no 1 right leaning  \no 8 consuming all  types of  media  \n- MAYBE, to participate in the experiment:  \no 24 left leaning  \no 4 right leaning  \no 18 consuming all types of media  \n- NO, to participat e in the experiment:  \no 10 left leaning  \no 2 right leaning  \no 1 center leaning  \no 16 consuming all types of media  \no 1 did not answer question  \nAs can be seen, the responses from right, left, and those who say they consume all types \nof media was very unbalanced. More in sight into this will follow, but at this stage I was \nconcerned that the places that I had  left the flier at was  a major  cause for  this disparagement.  It \nwas possible that the businesses or establishments did not attract a diverse enough clientele.  In \nhindsight, a greater  methodological misstep may have been the technological aspect of the \nsurvey , which may explain the lower responses from certain political demographic  groups.  For \nexample, my father took the flier and gave it to everyone in his men\u2019s choir group , which \nconsists of a lmost all men sixty years or older. Of the twenty plus men, a very small number \nfilled out the survey , all of whom were the younge st members of the group.  \n3.4 Initial Interview  \nUsing the survey responses,  I contacted many of the people who indicated either YES or \nMAYBE to wanting to participate in the experiment  component  via email  or via phone call . I \nwas specifically looking for individuals who indicated they were habitual or heavy consumers of \n \n13 \n news , and who lived in the town of Kemptville. I had correspondence  with nine individuals  to \nsetup initial interviews ; two had to cancel  before recording;  two were too camera shy  to proceed \nand indicated they  did not want to continue on with the experiment ; two more gave extremely \npoor interviews and thus I was not interested in continuing the experiment with them ; and  the \nremaining  three were the individuals who became  the focus of the video : Chassa, Cholly, and \nMagali.  Another methodological misstep may have been not adequately indicating that the \ninterview was to be filmed  (though it was stated in the  initial  email quite plainly) , as several of \nthe subjects  expressed some shock to me showing up with a large video recording setup.  \nFor the interviews, I conducted them in the  subject\u2019s home . The interviews were recorded \nsingle -camera style , in a location of the subject\u2019s choosing that they deemed comfortable.  The \nline of questioning was developed  from their individual responses to the survey questions , with \nsome common questions between the three.  The common lines of questioning were:   \n- Personal news profile  \n- Survey questions follow -up \n- Most important social issue (s) of the day  \n- News source leaning quiz  \n- News consumption habits profile  \n- Experiment explanation  \nChassa, Cholly, and Magali were  each very comfortable in front of the camera and \nrequired little to no retakes or requests for repetition or rephrasing. This initial interview lasted \napproximately forty -five minutes for each interview.  \n3.5 Assigning the Experiment  \nTo explore my hypothesis on the effect of alternative media consumption  on an \nindividual\u2019s dispositions and emotional engagement with their news media, I sought to use the \nmethod of experiment.  The inspiration for using experiment came from two areas. The first was \nwhen  researching Cultivation Theory, I wanted to focus more on the individual  rather than use a \nmacro -scale study , and I felt that an experiment was a means of practically applying cultivation\u2019s \nmethods  on a micro -scale . Stylistically, I was influenced by Nathan Fielder\u2019s docu -reality \ncomedy series \u201cNathan for You\u201d  which often features experiment -like escapades  with \nindividuals  to prove a hypothesis. This stylistic influence cannot be seen in the video essay.  \nUsing the survey responses of the subject and then altering that based on any revelations \nin the interview, I determined the course of action I wished for them to take for the experiment. \nOnly with Chassa did I end up changing my choice  mid interview  because of  her answers to my \nquestions , as it became clear she was a strong habitual consumer but was closer to the center and \na moderate than I originally  positioned her , and I did not wish for her to do the same experiment \nas Cholly . At the end of the interview, I asked each of them to do the following:  \n1. For Magali, I had her consume right -leaning news sources.  \n- I chose this because I identified Magali as being distinctly on the left and that, \nbecause of her trepidation even with her left news sources, she would never \nnormally choose to consume right -leaning news. She also seemed very unfamiliar \nwith the right -leaning sources.  \n2. For Cholly I had him consume both far -left AND far -right leaning news sources.  \n \n14 \n - For Cholly, while he seemed moderately left leaning overall, he seemed to \ngravitate towards more of the middle or center as far as his news sources were \nconcerned. Going to complete extremes was something I would never see him \nnormally do.  \n- I almost considered not having Cholly continue with  the experiment as, from his \ninterview, he seemed extremely well rounded and self -aware of his news \nconsumption. I worried that the experiment would prove a waste of time as I felt it \nextremely unlikely for my original hypothesis on emotional impact to be proven \nwith him.  Thankfully, I did have him continue.  \n3. For Chassa I had her abstain from news consumption as much as possible.  \n- Placing Chassa was more difficult. She seemed relatively well rounded in her \nnews consumption. The news occupied a significant portion of her day, because it \nprovided her with vital information that she relied on. Taking that away \ncompletely seemed like so mething she would not normally be able to do.  \n- This was largely a pivot in the case of Chassa,  away from my original hypothesis\u2019 \ngoal,  as I was unsure how to place someone like her.  \nI also requested that the subjects keep a journal detailing any thoughts or experiences that \nthey had while conducting the experiment. They were told that they would not need to share the \ncontents of this journal directly with me, rather it would serve as a springboard of reflection in \nthe follow -up interview.  \nI requested each of them to  perform the experiment for as long as one month , but if they \nfelt that they could not continue at any point they could stop and initiate the second interview. I \noriginally chose a month as that  would mean they would have gone through several news cycles.  \nThere does not seem to be much a cademic research on the exact length of a news cycle, with \nsome saying that it is just \u201cvery fluid, \u201d though  other research suggests that it is typically one \nweek (Walgrave and Van Aelst; Schema Design and Google Trends) . During the experiment  I \nkept email correspondence with each of them , and at the halfway point  request ed from them a \none-line summary of their experience  thus far . \n3.6 Follow -Up Interviews  \nFollowing the experiment, I interviewed each of them again on their experiences. Still \nworking from my original hypothesis, my line of questioning in this interview was to build from  \nthe first interview to establish any changes that might have occurred, and to have them reflect on \nthe experiment  as a whole . The subjects were asked to pull from their journals  for reflection . \nThese interviews turned conversational at times as the  participants bemused on the disruptive \nnature of the experience.  I asked each of  them again about the social issues that they had \nmentioned in the first interview , and f or all of them they responded with nothing new and had \nalmost no follow -up commentary.  I found t hese interviews somewhat disheartening, especially \nwith Cholly and Magali, as they communicated that they experienced very little to no changes \nwhatsoever. At this point, I was considering completely changing my methodological approach \nbut ultimately decided to stay the course.  \n3.7 Canvasing  for Another Perspective  \nWith the interviews and experiment executed by Chassa, Cholly, and Magali, I felt that I \nhad an adequate perspective from  largely  left-leaning individuals. What I was lacking entirely \n \n15 \n was perspective  from right -leaning people , and it was here where I faced my greatest  \nmethodological hurdle. What I quickly discovered was that, even if an individual indicated they \nwere right -leaning or even center in t heir politics, almost no one  who responded  to the survey  \nwas actually  very right leaning ; at most, everyone was f iscally conservative  and socially center. \nThis can even be seen a bit with Chassa  and Cholly , as they  are mostly  left leaning  with some \nnoticeable  moderate/centrist  outlooks . More nuance , with a deeper exploration into political \npolarization would have stemmed from  here, regarding the interview subjects.  With my survey \nnot being adequate to sourcing people on the right, I resorted to manually investigating potential \nsubjects via on-foot canvasing.  \nI executed th is canvasing by going  to select businesses and shops within Kemptville and \nspeaking to owners and employees there. My reasoning being that, as Kemptville was  in a \ndistinctly conservative  political  riding  both provincially and federally , it was likely that  business \nowners in town would also be right leaning . Additionally, by targeting businesses such as \nmechanics, autobody shops, hardware stores, and other blue -collar establishments, I felt I had a  \ngreater chance of finding right -leaning individuals there ; this was somewhat presumptuous and \nplaying off generalizations , but at least in the town of Kemptville,  it proved to be almost  \ncompletely accurate. What my pe rsonal bias did not prepare me for was what I encountered next . \nTime after time , the people whom I spoke to and identified  as being right -leaning news \nconsumers either said no, were downright rude to me, or they ghosted me altogether  after stating \nthey would fill out the survey . This is slight anecdotal conjecture, but I identified a certain degree \nof shame coming from these people , as they started out pleasant enough, but the second that I \ntold them what the project was about, or mentioned the experiment, their tone completely \nflipped. All I asked was if they were heavy news consumers and what kind of sources of news \nthey consumed, before giving  them my  survey  flier.  For several months this exercise continued \nfruitlessly, until I managed to find  \u201cJohn .\u201d  \nJohn was extremely interested in discussing the topic of news media with me, and he \nagreed to be interviewed  on his habits and views  with relish . Although, w hen I  did show up  with \nmy equipment, he became sheepish and said he did not want to be filmed. I did manage to \nconvince him to be recorded via audio only. John\u2019s interview progressed very similarly to the \ninitial interviews with Chassa, Cholly, and Magali, though John expanded much more on his \nanswers to some questions  than the others . It was very clear  that discussing the news, especially \nhis distrust of the mainstream news and his whol e acceptance of alt -right news media, was \nsomewhat of a passion for him.  Ultimately, John did not wish to participate in the experiment \nportion, citing his distrust of liberal news media and not wanting to subject himself to th eir lies . \n3.8 Material Analysis  \nWith months of material including more than a dozen nearly hour-long interviews  and \nhours of b -roll and other  footage  I began compiling the documentary in editing.  What I quickly \ndiscovered was that there was just no way to adequately explore my original hypothesis . With \nChassa, Cholly, and Magali, there was no identifiable change between the first and second \ninterview s, and because John did not do the experiment portion, I did not have the opposite \nperspective to compare against  there either . Emotion , at least in news  altering dispositions \ntowards topics  aspect,  seemed to be a non -factor altogether. Putting  my original hypothesis  aside , \nI began to  review the footage , and I  notice d patterns and themes  emerge  between the three left -\nleaning subjects  together and then between  those three and John . In analysis of the interviews \nwithout the original framing, I noticed things t hat were not apparent in the interviews before.  I \n \n16 \n also began to shift my focus away from exploring the  purpose of news, and eventually away \nfrom a conventional documentary  format altogether . It became clear that documentary was not \nthe best method of delivery for this content.  \nI began to explore methods of greater analytical engagement with Cultivation Theory \ndirectly , that also allowed me to incorporate my own commentary and interpretations of the \ninterviews. I felt that there was enough  to be analyzed with just those four subjects, with my  own \nwords  to fill in the gaps . I also needed to  facilitat e the anonymization of John and thus keep his \nsection entirely on its own. As for my reasoning  to anonymize John , I ended up engaging in  \nmore personal commentary towards  his responses  rather than let ting John speak on his own in \nopposite  to the others , as would have been more the case in the documentary.  Because of my \npersonal disagreement with his statements, anonymizing his audio was the best method rather \nthan present it without my personal critique or condemnation.   \nTo anonymize John, I exported his section\u2019s audio and used elevenlabs.io\u2019s AI voice \nchanger function. The reason why this service was chosen was that it generates a new voice that \nmaintains the original\u2019s inflection, tone, and intonation extremely closely.  Before anything, I did \nexplore open -source and locally run  options but could find nothing that produced satisfactory \nresults.  There are some ethical considerations  to be identified here: Elevenlabs is a  commercial \nentity which is explicit that any input i nto their systems may be used for future development of \nthe systems, and that no copyright of the media is transferred  to Elevenlabs . I did not use John\u2019s \naudio to clo ne his voice ; his transcription is being read by a  close -sounding ai-generated  voice  \nwith his original inflection . To maintain ethical consideration over the use of John\u2019s media, I \nmade sure there was no personal identifiable information that could link John\u2019s real identity with \nthe input  audio.  To me, this was necessary to anonymize John sufficiently while maintaining his \npersonal \u201cvoice\u201d  as it was important to the character and profile of John as a subject.   \n3.9 Scripting and Animating the Video Essay  \nI began the process of scripting . Using the dozens of pages of brainstorming and voice -\nover writing that I had done  at that point , I began to narrow my focus and compile a script. The \ninitial drafts of this script were still heavily focused on the purpose of news and featured \njournalism professors Paul Gott and Francine Pelletier. I was able to pluck the interview parts of \nthe documentary right out, truncate them , and incorporate them directly  into the script via \ntranscript . This ended up being the best method, as I could look at the interviews as their own \nmedia objects and apply analysis to them directly, rather than needing  them to stand  \nindependently . This was what led me to video essay. As I began to add more analysis, and as  I \nincorporated more of  Cultivation Theory, the script began to shape into  the mono -theoretical \nperspective that it became. I regret fully  ended u p having to cut the sections with the journalism \nprofessors and  eliminate all discussion on news as a medium. Then through multiple drafts, and a \nvariety of different conclusions, I came to the discussion on cultivation resonance as will be \nexplored further in the next section.  \nWith my script locked -in, I constructed an in -house  greenscreen studio , a DIY \nteleprompter, and I began record ing myself. From  this, I separated the video into twenty -three  \nsections and started creating animations. In the end I produced eighteen separate animated \nsequences a s well as the title card. The animations were created in the software Blender and \nrendered almost entirely in Eevee  with some sections in Cycles. Assets such as television  sets \nand other objects  came from the Blenderkit addon database and are all royalty free or creative \n \n17 \n commons zero.  Rendering all nineteen  animat ed sequences  took cumulatively more than \nseventy -two hours  total on an RTX 3090 graphics card . With all the animations completed  and \nrendered , I assembled them together with the interviews  and exported the full video essay.  \n  \n \n18 \n Chapte r 5: Discussion of Findings  \nCultivation Theory is meant to be applied at the macro -level  to examine trends over \nyears. This is the exact opposite of what I have attempted in this project , which does limit some \nof the potential direct application of cultivation to my findings.  My justification of this is to \nreturn to James W. Potter \u2019s criticism of cultivation, and his declaration to  shift the meaning locus \nto the receivers of the message, rather than focus on the media itself  (\u201cA Critical Analysis of \nCultivation Theory\u201d 1022) . I believe that to circumvent some  of the deterministic nature of \nCultivation Theory, focusing on the individual and their interactions with their media is the best \navenue for doing so. Additionally, I must acknowledge th at these findings  are constrained by the  \nlimited sample size  of the study that was conducted , and thus the findings must be constrained to \nthese individuals  for the most part . \nOriginally, I wanted this project to focus on the social issues question that I asked to the \ninterview subjects  but with a different objective;  I wanted to see the ways that the responses to \nthat question could change before and after the experiment . The idea was that if cultivation \nmainstreaming could occur, then the person\u2019s answer of \u201cwhat is the most important social \nissue\u201d could be changed  to align  closer  to messaging from the  alternative media they had to \nconsume . Or in Chassa\u2019s  case, the intensity or importance they placed in the issue could shift.  \nThe immediate finding from the experiment was just as Gerbner stated: cultivation occurs over \nyears, not weeks.  Not to mention, in struggling to find right -leaning subjects, I had no direct \ncomparison for  the experiment from  the opposite political side . This caused me to shift my focus \nof analysis to more of a compare and contrast, and from this some  interesting findings arose.  \n4.1 Reinforcement, not Transformation  \nThe experiment , rather than inducing cultivation, served as a means to solidify and justify \nthe existing news habits in the minds of the three left -leaning subjects. By exposing them to \nalternative or a lack of news  it demonstrated that they actively curate their normal news media \nbased on  a set of pre-existing values and  pragmatic needs.  Cholly touches on this in the video, as \nhe mentions specifically how disruptive th e experiment was to his news consumption habits. \nThis suggests that, at least in the short term, individuals are resistant to the effects of cultivation \nfrom alternate media if said media  just does not provide them with a bare minimum that their \ntypical media  provides them . This bare min imum could be in quantity of content, styl e of \ncontent, or breadth of coverage.  And this seems to even circumvent idealistic differences to some \ndegree \u2014though they were being forced to  consume  this media and put aside ideological \ndifferences temporarily . They each indicate d in some way that  the disruption  was most impactful \ndue to a lack of information , and thus a lack of perceived value in that media , which w ere an \nimportant detractor s. To return to Gerbner  for a moment , he was not  so concerned with the \nperceived value of a media for an individual, rather he saw all of media as relatively \nhomogenous  and individual preferences of programming was not much of a factor  (Gerbner and \nGross 227 \u201353). A study by  L.J. Shrum did try and assert  that attention and engagement with \nmedia does matter  for cultivation to occur , so there is some support to suggest that this is not an \nisolated factor  (L. Shrum) . Here, each subject identif ies an important value in their typical  media \nand then uses that to justify their habits . \nChassa indicate d an anxiety she feels from the lack of news, as  without it  she does  not \nfeel as informed about  the goings on around her. These goings on around her  though  became \nvery focused on the local , rather than global , as several anxiety -inducing events happened during \n \n19 \n the progress of the experiment . Given that this experiment happened to take place during a string \nof lockdown events at her children\u2019s school , not having the news had a real impact in her ability \nto know  how this was developing . Other p ossible conjecture from this is that in cutting off the \n\u201cbarrage of information\u201d , as she puts it,  she became much more insular, and her sphere of focus \nbecame significantly more narrowed  to her immediate . An equilibrium for her was then  found as \nshe relished in this lack of beratement,  yet she  still indicated a willingness to return to her typical \nnews habits  with some modifications.  \nCholly repeatedly indicated how useless he found the extreme news sources in providing \nhim actual news , indicating that they did not  even  provide the bare minimum  of journalistic \ninformation . To Cholly, he found the experience to be  laughable , and he even stated that the far -\nleft news sources were even more useless than the ones on the right , citing a lack of content . This \nwas an interesting observation, as I had not factored in the  lower  frequency of posting from the \nfar-left-leaning  sites to be so detrimental . But for someone who checked the news every single \nday and multiple times  throughout  that day , such a miniscule amount of content was completely \nunsatisfactory.  This, while not mentioned in the video essay for the sake of time, could have \nbeen a major point of exploration in the deafferenting effects of each political side of news ; one \njust makes more than the other.  For Magali , her experiment experience result ed in an even \ngreater reduction in her news consumption, due to  her finding that the alternat e news did not \nprovid e her with a wide enough worldview  for her to be informed . Magali is from  France, and \nshe indicated her parents live there currently , so a more globalist perspective is an utterly \nessential and bare -minimum requirement for her news . The impact on her mental health cannot \nbe understated either, causing her to prioritize her well -being over receiving any information \nregardless of how narrow it may be.  She just found that the right -leaning sites were considerably \nmore depressing.  \nAt the risk of getting into speculation, t he reasons for Cholly and Magali\u2019s reject ion of  \nthe opposite news could also be inferred as a possibl e reason for  why John  refused to participate \nin the experiment . John  has a pre -emptive dismissal of any news source outside of his established  \nnews silo , which is  not based on an evaluation of  any specific content  rather largely it is a \nblanket rejection stemming from his pre -existing worldview.  As John  stated many times,  he \nbelieves that the opposite, mainstream media is full of lies and does not show things in the proper \nlight. So, for John, the opposite media simply does  not provide him with a base reinforcement of \nhis existing values and beliefs, and thus he outright rejects it. His bare minimum is  likely \nsignificantly  more  ideologic al rather than informational . Though it would be folly to say t hat this \nis not something that everyone, even the other three on the left, engage in as well  to some degree . \n4.2 John: A Case Study in Mainstreaming  \nIn stark contrast to Chassa, Cholly, and Magali, the interview with John provided a \ncompelling case study of mainstreaming. John's responses mirrored common narratives found in \nfar-right news sources, such as Rebel News and The Epoch Times , sources that he states multiple \ntimes he consumes exclusively, rejecting anything he considers mainstream or on the left. He \ndeliberately chooses to limit his exposure to information that does not align with his worldview. \nIn these limited news sources,  he does not seek information, he seeks affirmation. His use of the \nphrases \"scamdemic\" and the \u201calphabet group\" show a close a lignment with the rhetoric and \nframing commonly employed by these sources. These phrases  explicitly  should be considered \n\u201ctelevision answers\u201d  as they are phrases that stem directly from the world of alt -right  media , \nwhich is a point that should have been made in the video essay.  Overall, John clearly \n \n20 \n demonstrates a convergence with the homogeneous messaging  of his media , which by definition \nis what Gerbner considered mainstreaming.  \n4.3 Resonance: Abstract vs Concrete  \nBy Gerbner\u2019s definition of Resonance , Chassa , Cholly, and Magali should be highly \nsusceptible to mainstreaming because they receive a \u201cdouble dose\u201d of the messaging from their \nmedia and from their lived realities. For example, Chassa sees constant discussion of transgender \nissues in her media, and then her children bring home discussion of that topic from their school. \nThe novel assertion that I am making is that resonance is only most  applicable to individuals \nwhen the messaging does not come against actual lived realities.  When the connect ions to a \nmessage are more abstract  can mainstreaming  occur. For example, if Magali were to read right -\nleaning news about indigenous groups , that story could  resonate with her up until they make \nassertions that go against her experiences working with those peoples \u2014such as a blanket \nstatement that says the chiefs wanted the children to go into residential schools.  \nI make the claim that Chassa, Cholly, and Magali are not subjected to mainstreaming \nbecause they declare real -world personal connection s to their given social issues  within their \ninterviews . On the other hand,  I make the assertion that John is subjected to mainstreaming \nbecause he attempts to  make abstract connections to his social issues . John connects himself to \nhis social issues through attacks on his sense of self, on his moral values, and on his belief  \nsystems , which is distinctly something that the other three never attempt to do.  Chassa, Cholly, \nand Magali do speak of social issues that are commonly discussed in left -leaning news medi a, \nyet for each issue they provide concrete personal connections to those issues . Their lived \nexper iences provide a framework for evaluating and challenging the media narratives they \nconsume, which I argue makes them less susceptible to cultivation.  \nIf John\u2019s media  presents something as an issue that  needs his attention, then John will \nconstruct resonance using whatever he can to then justify the attention he has been told the issue \nnow need s. For example, John continuously references his faith and the bible as reasons for \nbeing irked by LGBTQ+ peoples. He again uses the bible for justification for his dislike of truth \nand reconciliation initiatives , which he calls \u201cpeople pleasing ,\u201d a term that likely stems from his \nmedia.  While it is possible  (though  unlikely ) that John has had real encounters with LGBTQ+ \nand indigenous peoples attacking his faith, he simply does not bring up any concrete evidence \nthis has ever occurred . The assertion that I am making is that John is cultivated by his media \nbecause , especially with  the social  issues  that he discusses, these issues are conjured from his \nmedia ; they do not come from his live d reality.  In fact, it is possible  that the media itself \nsuggested these abstract connections; when I arrived to interview John, he was listening to \nChristian radio  that had a  very stern preacher on talking about the dange rs of not attending \nchurch . And John even gives an example of  when this does not occur to him, citing an issue that \nis closer to the examples given by the others : with the one instance where John did have a real-\nworld experience \u2014his attendance at the Ottawa trucker convoy  rally.  \nJohn  rejected the mainstream media's portrayal of the convoy because it contradicted his \ndirect observation of the event. This is an even clearer demonstration of how concrete experience \ncan provide a buffer against media \u2019s influence, even for someone who is generally predisposed \nto accept certain narratives. And yet , what was not included in the video for time was him \nmentioning how long he stayed at the convoy  and when he went: he stayed for a  very short time \nand only went at the beginning  of the demonstr ation . Over time, t hose experiences became more \n \n21 \n abstract against the developing narrative  of the harm the convoy was doing . John  saw, for a \nmoment, at the very beginning, that the convoy was a  pleasant experience . He then  held that \nagainst the assertion of how bad things became over time , which was very much against the \nactual lived experiences of th e people being deafened by honking for days on end.  Even this idea \nof \u201clived experience\u201d is completely relative  and updated reinforcement of this lived experience is \nneeded; else the media\u2019s narrative takes hold again.  \n4.4 Resonance: A Reinterpretation  \nThis conception of resonance I have made is a departure and reinterpretation  of the \noriginal theory by Gerbner . I argue , using  the evidence of the four subject \u2019s interviews , that \nmedia narratives are still most influential when resonance is at play, but that messag ing must  not \ncome against the actual lived experience s of the consumer  of that media  to have full effect . This \nproposed modification to resonance refines Cultivation Theory by suggesting that the nature of \nthe real -world experience \u2014whether it  is concrete or abstract , short lived or long term \u2014is a \ncrucial factor in determining the strength of cultivation \u2019s effects.  This distinction between \nconcrete and abstract resonance highlights what I believe to be something  often overlooked in \nCultivation Theory: the kind of real -world experience matters. Gerbner's original conception of \nresonance, while acknowledging the importance of real -world experience, did not fully account \nfor the nuances of how that experience might interact with media messages.  Just the  concept of \nthe \"double dose\"  as Gerbner describe d it is not sufficient to explain the observed differences. \nThe nature of that double dose \u2013whether it involves direct, personal engagement with the issue or \na more abstr act, perceived connection \u2013fundamentally alters the dynamic , and thus alters how , or \nhow much,  mainstreaming can occur  to an individual.  \n4.5 On Avoiding Determinism  \nI do not wish to pretend that this idea of abstract resonance is particularly novel in any \nother context than within  the halls of  Cultivation Theory. At the end of all of this , it is hard to \navoid  or ignore  the technologically determinist shortcomings of the theorem.  The pitfalls of \ndeterminism are taught in the first classes of a Communication Studies Undergrad for a reason, \nand it is no coincidence that  a lot of theories from the 1960s are used to explain these pitfalls. All \nthat I believe I have done  in this novel assertion  of resonance  is attempt to apply some non -\ndeterminist logic to a determinist  theory.  To in ject some nuance into a theory that states such \nmatters of fact regarding media,  using what I believe to be the least determinist aspect of the \ntheory to build from.  Acknowledging  this does not diminish  the interesting aspects of my \nanalysis though, at least,  I hope . \nIf the scope of this project were larger \u2014and the video essay much longer \u2014this \u201cabstract \nresonance\u201d would be explored and explained using other theories.  An area that bears mention is \nfeminist theory.  Purposefully a ntithetical  to the \u201cold-dead -white -man-theory \u201d that is Cultivation  \nTheory would be an exploration using Donna Haraway\u2019s Situated Knowledge . In summary, \nHaraway\u2019s argues against the idea of a universal, objective \"view from nowhere\" and instead \nemphasizes that all knowledge is produced from specific, embodied, and partial perspectives \n(583) . She decries what she calls \u201cthe god trick of seeing everything from nowhere ,\u201d where some \ndisembodied, universal perspective is presented as the ultimate truth (581) . Information, \nknowledge, our views on the world must all be situated from the perspective of the viewer, and \nthat everyone does not see the same  way. This is utterly  against Gerbner\u2019s suggestions that media \nhas this all-consuming  power to make people  all the same, that individuality matters not , either \n \n22 \n to begin with or because of  media.  Now, it could be possible to isolate Haraway, to use  her only \nin exploring resonance further , but doing so would be a disservice  to the theory . To me, Haraway \nand other feminist theorists are completely  at odds with  the line of thinking of scholars such as \nGerbner , sometimes explicitly so . Placing them in conversation is challenging because one seeks \nto in many ways  cancel the other one out. To fully use something like Situated Knowledge \nwould require a heavy refinement of the theory  for exploration , to give it the  respect  than this \nproject does not have the scope to. And of course, intersecting Cultivation Theory with other \ntheoretical frameworks, such as Uses and Gratifications Theory, Framing Theory, and Persona \nTheory, as was mentioned in the video, could offer a more holistic understand ing of the complex \ninterplay between media, individuals, and society than just using cultivation alone \u2014possibly \nwithout being so at odds  to each other  as Haraway and Gerbner would be . \n4.6 Reflection on the Form  \nThe final form of this project is considerably different to what I originally envisioned \nwhen I started.  I envisioned a long -form documentary film  that asked big questions like what the \npurpose of news was and  that tried to explore the phenomenon I indicated in th is paper\u2019s  \nintroduction more. I did not manage to explore w hat causes people to react to things so strongly , \nbecause I did not manage to document that pheno menon.  When considering a target audience, \nthe video essay landed in somewhat of a middle ground for me, between academic and general \naudience.  I wanted a pedagogical object, yes , but one that could be used by as many people as \npossible . If I were to show this video to a communications scholar, I feel they would pick apart \nthe theoretical application, some of the determinist viewpoints, and the overall shortness  of \ninformation and method  description  in areas.  Yet i f I were to show this video to my brother, a \npolitical science major , I feel he would instead nitpick the presentation  of the content itself . And \nthen showing this to a non -academic  and/or  a random  person ? I fear that the video would not be  \nfully  digestible, the theory too complicated and /or not synthesized simply enough, and that they \nwould not be able to take way as much as I desired. All of this to say, I am in no way unhappy \nwith the video, yet as is always the case with creative works, another iteration would or will be \neven better.  This process allowed me an incredible chance to explore my own approach to media \ncreation  and theoretical synthesis, in a form that test ed my production skills and understanding  \nand application  of theoretical frameworks  extensively.   \n \n23 \n Conclusion  \nThis research -creation project , culminating in the video essay \"Mainstreaming,\" has \ndelved into the relationship between news consumption and individual worldviews, employing \nGeorge Gerbner's Cultivation Theory as a foundational lens. While cultivation provided a useful \nframework for exploring the effects of news media, my study complicates traditional \nunderstandings of the theory . My use of interview, an experiment, and the analysis of the content \nof these  things , has resulted in an alternative interpretat ion of c ultivation\u2019s resonance. The \nexperiment, while not producing significant cultivation effects in the short term, serve d to reveal \nthe subjects' deeply ingrained news consumption habits and their resistance to alternative media.  \nIt showed a reinforcement and justification of existing habits and  highlighted the active role \nthose individuals play in curating their news media  to fit their needs , based on pre -existing \nvalues and beliefs. The contrast between the three on the left, Chassa, Cholly, and Magali, and \nthe one on the right , John, demonstrated the stark difference between those who more actively \nchallenge what is being said in the media  they typically consume and those who take everything \nwithout critical conjecture . This is the  difference between being mainstreamed and not being \nmainstreamed \u2014though  Chassa, Cholly, and Magali not being mainstreamed is not and likely \ncannot be  completely proven , at least not without a much, much longer study . \nI see m y reinterpretation of cultivation\u2019s resonance to be  more of an attempt at updating \nand trying to apply cultivation in a less deterministic method , to give more agency to the subjects \nand less omniscient power to the media  they consume . Though at the same time, I must admit \nthere are still some determinist takes in my analysis of the subject s, especially with John ; I \njustify  this as being  due to the limited material  from his interview . Give n a longer discussion, \nand if he had done the experiment, more nuance  with John could likely have been applied , and \nfurther examples of concrete versus abstract resonance could have been presented . I hope that I \nhave at least shown though that individuals do not just passively accept media narratives \nwholesale and  instead eval uate media messages based on a number of personal factors that either \nlimit or amplify the potential effects of that media.  \nThis project opens several avenues for future research  for me . The most straightforward  \navenue would be to  perform cultivation analysis using  more of  Gerbner\u2019s original methods.  \nStudies with a much larger sample size , employing both quantitative and qualitative methods ; \nstudies performed over a much longer period of time, tracking individuals' news consumption \nhabits and worldviews ; and a ll of this with studies featuring a greater diversity of subjects, in \nage, political leanings, gender, and race c ould help  further investigate concrete and abstract \nresonance and its impact on cultivation effects  as I have iden tified in this project.  As well, \nexploring the differences between different types of media should be explored , especially social \nmedia, as news can take so many forms there . The project's original hypothesis \u2014that exposure \nto alternative news media would not change beliefs but would alter emotional responses \u2014was \nnot fully supported , and the revised focus on resonance and the distinction between concrete and \nabstract experiences proved to be a more fruitful avenue of inquiry. But a further exploration into \nthe original hypothesis with this new concept of resonance could be an avenue of further \nexploration.   \nSomething that my alternative interpretation to resonance may also shed light on is the \nenduring appeal of certain types of media narratives. Gerbner focus ed on the Mean World \nbecause he saw a  pervasiveness of violence in the television of his day. Violence, giving feelings \nof anxiet y and fear  still dominate s much of media  today , and within news media I would argue  \n \n24 \n that these feelings  present even stronger than in television drama . The Mean World Syndrome, as \na manifestation of cultivation \u2019s effects , is not simply about believing the world is more \ndangerous : it is about being made to feel  more vulnerable and anxious.  To reiterate,  John  \nmentioning \"people pleasing\"  and the \"alphabet group ,\u201d his general  perce ption of the  erosion of \nhis traditional values , these issues to him are (likely)  not rooted in direct, negative experiences  he \nhas had . Rather, they are cultivated by his media t o frame these issues as existential threats . \nThere is a  fabricated  sense of unease , reinforcing John\u2019s  worldview to demand constant attention \ntowards intangible perceived threats . Yet why this is always negative, pessimistic, towards  \ndestruction, in making  such a mean  world is something that should be explored further.  \nMy ultimate goal for this project was and still is  towards  reflection. Personal reflection, \non a concept that I have carried with me for nearly twenty years.  My understanding of the Mean \nWorld Syndrome and Cultivation Theory has grown immensely, and I still see  its impact in my \neveryday , though with more nuance . Reflection from my participants, in the role that news plays \nin their lives. I think that with Chassa  especially  there was a noticeable  amount of reflection and \npossible further change to her news consumption habits. Even with John, I hoped that there was \nsome level of introspection from talking with me, even if it was incredibl y minute. And with the \nviewers of the video essay or readers of this thesis paper, I hope this has spurred some self \nreflection on the role of news. I hope viewers can recognize that the news is not a  transparent  \nwindow on the world , rather it is often an opaque,  constructed view  tinted  by the biases and \nagendas of those who set it in place . Understand that we, as consumers  of all kinds of media, not \njust news , are not passive recipients. We have agency. We can challenge narratives  and choose to  \nseek out diverse perspectives . Yet when consuming our typical sources, we can actively ground \nourselves through our own lived  realities , and use concrete, tangible experiences to counter the \neffects of  cultivation, mainstreaming, the Mean World Syndrome, and anything else  media  can \nthrow at us .  \nI wrote before that I approached  a level of  apathy towards the news. This should never \nhappen. Because through  apathy  leads ignorance.  As much as I hate to say it, the news is still a \ndominant  means of being connected with the goings on in the world.  Even at the risk of being \ncultivated, if we disconnect from the goings on in the world then we  risk losing our ability to \nhold things accountable. Despite what Gerbner may have stated about the unavoidable effects of \nmainstreaming,  we all have agency . Agency to  choose  what we consume  and agency to act on \nthe information that consumption provides us . We must just make sure that we  are using the \nnews to shape our world, rather than  letting the news shap e our world for us. \n  \n \n25 \n References  \nBaum, Matthew A., and Tim Groeling. \u201cNew Media and the Polarization of American Political \nDiscourse.\u201d Political Communication , vol. 25, no. 4, Nov. 2008, pp. 345 \u201365.

Kennedy School of \nGovernment.  \n\n \n \n \n COVID -19 misinformation and the 2020 U.S. presidential election  2 \n \n2020 U .S. Democratic primaries: the use of masks and the legitimacy  of mail -in ballots . Whereas \nmisinformation can arise from any community, health misinformation is associated with specific \ncommunities.  \n\u2022 A large and expansive cluster of politically heterogeneous user s (both liberal and conservative) \nadvocate for wearing masks and mail -in voting. A small but dense cluster of conservative users \npush es misinformation about the inefficacy of masks and potential for voter fraud.  \n\u2022 This study identifies one of the sources of amplification of misinformation during the COVID -19 \npandemic regarding public health practices and election integrity. We also suggest ways \npoliticized health messages have impacted the most recent 2020  Democratic primaries.  \n\u2022 A narrative\u2019s potential to be misinformation drives politicization of information just as much as \nmisinformation itself does.  \n \nImplications  \n \nVoting is the defining act for a democracy. However, this action is only meaningful if public deliberation \nand decision -making are grounded in veritable and equitable information. Studying the possible effects \nof misinformation on voting behavior is thus a  critical avenue of investigation even as we look back on the \nrecent 2020 US presidential election cycle. This essay examines how health misinformation may be \npoliticized \u2013 particularly how political alignment mediates the spread of COVID -19 misinformation .  \nIt is useful to first disambiguate misinformation and disinformation, particularly in the context of \npoliticization, or the use of information for political means. Misinformation is the spread of false \ninformation agnostic of intent, while disinformatio n is the intentional spread of false information. \nDisinformation campaigns often originate from specific institutions, such as intelligence agencies; \nhowever, these campaigns can also emerge spontaneously in online communities.  \nIn this study, we focus on the politicization of COVID -19-related health misinformation and its spread \nand further analyze two of the most critical narratives during the 2020 US Democratic primary cycle:  \n1. The legality and fraudulence of voting by mail  \n2. The efficacy of masks  \nAlthough t here have been widespread misinformation campaigns to convince the populace otherwise, \nthe practice of mail -in voting has already been adopted by several U .S. states and has not been shown to \nbe prone to or affected by significant fraud  (Qiu, 2021; Spencer , 2020) . The presence of disputed and \ndisproven anti -mask rhetoric on popular social media platforms may adversely affect voter turnout due \nto health concerns and accessibility to mail -in ballot resources. Research investigating the interplay \nbetween misin formation and voting behavior reports conflicting results: for example, using random dial -\nin questionnaires, researchers found that both misinformation and factual information increase voter \nparticipation (White et al., 2006). Others focused on issues such  as immigration, race, unemployment, \nand abortion. Automated phone calls (\u2018robocalls\u2019) in Canada that contained misleading information about \nthe location of polling stations resulted in a 3% average decrease in participation (Kessler et al., 2013).  \nThese e xamples demonstrate the nuances in the effects of misinformation, as its transmission \nmodality and type (e.g. , political) may influence voter behavior. Today, the modality of interest has shifted \nfrom phones to social media, due to its ubiquitous presence.  Efforts, spearheaded by the Russian Internet \nResearch Agency (IRA) and others, to deliberately manipulate social media discourse have been well \ndocumented both in the 2016 U .S. presidential election (Bessi et al., 2016) and  the 2017 French \npresidential election (Ferrara, 2017). The IRA appeared to have identified and targeted non -white voters \n(Badawy et al., 2019) months before the election with messages promoting racial identity (Dutt et al., \n2018) that may have led to voter suppression (Kim  et al., 2018), and certainly sowed division and conflict \nonline (DiResta et al., 2019).  \n \n \n \n Chen; Chang; Rao; Lerman; Cowan; Ferrara  3 \n \n \n   Many political scientists believe that an increase in information leads to electoral participation \n(Carpini et al., 1996). However, those who lack sufficient informati on tend to align with \u201copinion leaders\u201d \nby following perceptions of knowledge or partisanship (Katz et al., 1966). Other factors, such as \ndirectionally motivated reasoning (Flynn et al., 2017), selective exposure (Guess et al.,  2018), and  \ncorrection -induce d misperceptions (Nyhan et al., 2010), may also play a role in individual perception. With \nthe COVID -19 pandemic characterized by uncertainty about the disease and best welfare practices, the \npublic is vulnerable to partisan -driven misinformation at the in tersection of public health and politics.  \nRecently, Jost and colleagues (Jost et al., 2018) noted that conservatives, in general, maintain more \nhomogeneous social networks that are more conducive to the flow of misinformation, which would not \nonly make the m more vulnerable, but also generate dangerous cascade effects to the general public. \nFurthermore, prior studies have shown the elderly population engaging more with misinformation during \nthe 2016 U .S. presidential election (Grinberg et al., 2019). As such , the elderly is one of the most \nsusceptible populations to both digital misinformation and COVID -19 health complications.  \nThe COVID -19 pandemic presents a novel chance to assess where health misinformation becomes \npolitical (Ferrara, 2020). While misinfor mation is the current label for our \u201cnarratives\u201d, the importance in \nour study, beyond the truth value, is its political impact. The 1918 Spanish Flu has been shown to have \ngenerated political extremism that led to higher votes for the Nazi party in areas w ith more pandemic \ndeaths. The term of choice at the time was propaganda , but the meaning is the same: the deliberate \nspread of (mis)information to influence elections. In fact, the term misinformation has become so \nprevalent that it has become core to cand idates\u2019 campaign strategies (such as Donald J. Trump\u2019s use of \n\u201cfake news\u201d to discredit the media). These narratives may be misinformation, and that possibility, rather \nthan factuality itself, is what makes them effective in politics.  \nIn this study, we inve stigate two major narratives incubated within the COVID -19 discourse and their \ninterplay with the Democratic primary online chatter on Twitter from March 1 , 2020 through  August 30, \n2020. Upon isolating two health -related narratives prone to misinformation,  namely the use of masks in \npublic and the issue of mail -in ballots, we show how mask -related discourse grows with discourse about \nvoting. We find that instances of health -related misinformation continue to circulate after their initial \nreporting, and a co mmon strategy is to use true stories to drive larger misinformation narratives. \nTopologically, a large and expansive cluster of politically heterogeneous users constitutes the majority of \nthe public sphere on Twitter, and this group, in general, advocates for wearing masks and mail -in voting. \nIn contrast, a small but dense cluster of conservative users push es misinformation about the inefficacy of \nmasks and voter fraud. We show that while misinformation , in general , can arise from any point in the \nnetwork, there is a clear division between communities that spread mail -in ballot and mask \nmisinformation and those that do not.  \n \nFindings   \n \nFinding 1: Four overarching themes regarding health policies and voting procedures emerged in our data \nset. \n \n1. We first find, as expected, that Coronavirus discourse dominates much of the Democratic primary \ndiscussion during our observation period. This includes rulings by the United States Supreme \nCourt surrounding religious gatherings to allegations that the Coro navirus is a hoax perpetrated  \nby the Democratic party (Blue  dotted line, Figure 1 ).  \n2. We then identify a second narrative surrounding mail -in ballots and the role the United States \nPostal Service (USPS) played in the distribution and collection of these bal lots. In August, The \nWashington Post , along with many other news organizations, reported that Postmaster General \n \n \n \n COVID -19 misinformation and the 2020 U.S. presidential election  4 \n \nLouis DeJoy had restructured the postal office and reallocated funding, leading to slower ballot \ndelivery and returns during the primaries, wit h ramifications stretching beyond the Democratic \nprimaries into the presidential elections (Red  solid  line, Figure 1 ).  \n3. We also find that there is general discourse surrounding imposed lockdowns, their efficacy , and \nconstitutionality, as the United States faced a second wave during the summer of 2020 (Orange  \ndotted line, Figure 2 ).  \n4. Finally, we observe numerous tweets surrounding masks and face coverings, with a large number \nof tweets perpetuating the messaging that masks are a hoax and are ineffective (Pur ple solid  line, \nFigure 2 ).  \n \n \nFigure 1. Mail -in ballots and COVID -19-related tweets within primaries -related tweets, plotted as a 3 -day rolling average of \nthe percentage of primary -related tweets. State abbreviations aligned with the day on which the respective state conducted \ntheir Democratic primary.  \n \n \nFigure 2. Lockdown and mask -related tweets within primaries -related tweets, plotted as a 3 -day rolling average of the \npercentage of primary -related tweets.  State abbreviations aligned with the day on which the respective state conducted their \nDemocratic primary.  \n\n \n \n \n Chen; Chang; Rao; Lerman; Cowan; Ferrara  5 \n \n \n   Due to the nature of our dataset and research questions, it is unsurprising that COVID -19 is salient \nthroughout our dataset. Several narratives emerge under the umbrella of COVID -19, with some of the \nmost vocal believing that COVID -19 is a hoax pushed by the Democratic party or that the threat of COVID -\n19 had already passed. We also find that Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the injection of household \ndisinfectants began to circulate, largely due to  Trump announcing that he was actively taking the former \nas a preventative measure and suggesting that the latter might be worth further scientific investigation \nas a potential way to combat COVID -19 (Oprysko, 2020) . \nThe controversy around HCQ, in particular, emphasizes the constant evolution of the factuality of a \nclaim. This also motivates our focus on politicization rather than on only factuality. In March, there had \ninitially been suggestions that HCQ may have been effective against COVID -19, pr ompting the U.S. Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for HCQ. However, as more \nclinical reports and studies were conducted, it became apparent that the drug commonly used to treat \nmalaria was not effective in tr eating COVID -19. The FDA rescinded its recommendation and eventually \nEUA in April and June respectively, and the World Health Organization removed it from their coronavirus \ntreatment trials (Bull -Otterson et al., 2020 ; Edwards, 2020; World Health Organizat ion, 2020).  We note \nthat the initial effectiveness of HCQ against COVID -19 was unclear due to lack of evidence, but as more \nevidence showed that HCQ was in fact ineffective, this mirrors the change in factuality of HCQ as a \ntreatment in the context of COVI D-19 over time. Despite this, this narrative\u2019s political use was evident, \nregardless of its validity. This demonstrates the dangers of the spread of unverified health -related news \nstories on social media prior to reaching medical consensus regarding the va lidity of the story. We also \nsee that the use of these narratives can continue long after their initial reporting.  \nWe also find that the topic of mail -in ballots become more prominent throughout our observation \nperiod. During the pandemic, to mitigate transmission risks, many voters began to contemplate voting by \nmail instead of voting in person. However, after DeJoy\u2019s  changes to the USPS, Democrats began to call for \ninvestigations  into these policy changes due to the potential implications they had on not only the \nprimaries but also the U.S. presidential elections  (Bogage et al., 2020) . There were also many campaigns \nthat claimed mail -in voting would increase voter fraud, a claim that has been deemed false by FactCheck \nmultiple times since mid -April  (Farley, 2020) . This discourse increased in volume and representation in \nour dataset after Bernie Sanders conceded to Joe Biden on April 8, 2020, as the focus of the Democratic \nparty shifted from the primaries to the upcoming presidential race.  \nDiscourse surrounding social distancing, stay -at-home orders , and masks in the context of voting \nbegins as early as mid -March and co ntinues to attract attention over time. It then builds significant \ntraction right after April, when multiple states held their primaries or decided to postpone them, implying \nthat voting, social distancing , and mask discourse are largely event driven . The U.S. faced  a second wave \nduring the summer of 2020, which could explain the spikes in references to lockdowns and stay -at-home \norders that initially beginning to relax but were reimposed in response to the summer spike in certain \nparts of the country  (Wilson, 2020; \u201cAs U.S. Coronavirus Cases Hit 3.5 Million, Officials Scramble to Add \nRestrictions,\u201d  2020).   \n \nFinding 2: We find that there exists a clear political and content polarization in the retweet user network \ntopology.  \nWe consider politica l polarization and a user\u2019s history of spreading misinformation, as shown in Figure 3 , \nbelow . In this network, we focus our attention on users, represented by nodes, who have tweeted about \nmail -in voting and mask -wearing. We constructed weighted directed e dges between users, based on the \nnumber of interactions they had with each other (specifically retweets and original tweets). Figure 3 was \ngenerated first using node2vec  (Grover and Leskovec, 2016), which represents social networks in high \n \n \n \n COVID -19 misinformation and the 2020 U.S. presidential election  6 \n \ndimensional spac e. A two -dimensional layout was then extracted using the t-SNE algorithm (Maaten and \nHinton, 2008).  \n \n \nFigure 3 . Topological distribution of Twitter users who discuss mask -wearing and voting. Figure 3a) shows the political \naffiliation of Twitter users. Figure 3b) shows users who have tweeted URLs from domains known for posting misinformation. \nFigure 3c) shows users who have tweeted factual information or misinformation about mask -wearing and ma il-in ballots. High \nlevels of polarization are observed.  \n \nIn Figure 3a),  we observe a clear topological division between blue and red clusters in the top. By network \ntopology, we refer to how nodes in the network are arranged, and how their embeddings are spaced and \nclustered (such as when represented in a two -dimensional visualization). In much of the public Twitter \nsphere, there is a heterogeneous  cluster of users that has a well -mixed political news diet. The appearance \nof multiple, homogenous clusters i ndicates the presence of extreme political polarization. Users \npredominantly identify as center and left  leaning, but  there is a large cluster of conservative users in the \nupper right. This cluster is significantly denser and more homogeneous \u2014we refer to t his as the dense \nconservative cluster. Note that two nodes are plotted closer if they have a higher edge -weight (interact \nmore frequently). As a result, groups of users with shared connections will be visualized closer together. \nWhile exact heterophily sco res are possible, this would require labeling through community detection and \nmerits the full scope of a separate study.  \nFigures 3b) and 3c)  show this data augmented with misinformation tags. Figure 3b) shows users \n(green) that have previously shared artic les from questionable domains containing misinformation, as \n\n \n \n \n Chen; Chang; Rao; Lerman; Cowan; Ferrara  7 \n \n \n   defined by Media Bias -Fact Check  (Zandt, n.d.) . We observe that misinformation is spread in both clusters \nand across a mixture of political affiliations; however, a significant amount arises from the conservative \ncluster on the upper right. Figure 3c) further shows the distribution of four narrative positions, best \nrepresented by the hashtags in Table A1  (see Appendix Part B, \u201cTagging public health misinformation\u201d) . \nAs we discuss in the methods section, we leverage manual annotation to isolate misinformation and \nfactual tweets, and then find co -occurring hashtags and terms to identify a larger set of tweets that align \nwith the following positions:  \n \n1. WearAMask (Coral):  This policy position includes support for mask -wearing.  \n2. MasksOff (Purple): This policy position rejects mask -wearing as necessary and purports that the \nusage of masks is detrimental to one\u2019s health.  \n3. VoteByMail (Gold): This policy position supports voting by mail.  \n4. VoterFraud (Blue): This policy position suggests that increased voting by mail efforts leads to a \nsubsequent and highly correlated increase in voter fraud.  \n \nIn the discourse about mask -wearing and voting by mail, we observe a clearer division. Whereas most \nusers are predominantly marked by advocacy for mask -wearing and voting by mail, the denser \nconservative cluster pushes almost exclusively anti -mask wearing discourse  and equate s voting by mail to \nvoter fraud. It is important to not see this as a reductive division across partisan lines. Figure 3b) shows \nmisinformation can be spread by any user; however, the conservative clusters spread significantly more \nmisinformation. Figure 3c) shows the majority of users from across party lines advocate for confirmed \npublic health practices and safety precautions around voting. Interestingly, even within the dense \nconservative cluster, sub -communities emerge for which anti -mask or voter fraud discourse takes \nprecedent.  \nIn sum, the public sphere of users on Twitter engaged in conversation on COVID -19 and the \nprimaries take on a specific topology. There is a heterogeneous user -base comprising of a loosely \nconnected majority. In contrast, a dense network of conservative users emerges, disjoint from the \nmajority, which affirms Jost and colleagues\u2019 observation that there exist higher levels of homogeneity \namongst certain conservative populations (Jost et al., 2018). This dense gr oup demonstrates a propensity \nto politicize health -related misinformation.  \nWe find the top COVID -19 narratives, when tweeted during the 2020 Democratic primaries, to be \nhighly politicized. We observe that it is not only the factual basis but also the poten tial for misinformation \nthat contributes to the politicization of information online. For instance, one of the mask narratives stated \nthat there was an N95 mask  shortage in the US because the Obama administration had neglected to \nmaintain the stockpile. Th is was denied by some left -leaning users but is actually true  (Sherman, 2020) . \nOn the other hand, mask -related misinformation seemed to be pushed exclusively from the dense group \nof conservative users, which suggests selective exposure to fake news. In hin dsight of the Democratic \nprimaries  and now the 2020 U.S. presidential  elections, this paper provides a birds -eye view and warning \non how misinformation and the potential to be perceived as misinformation may galvanize further \npoliticization of surrounding public health policies.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n COVID -19 misinformation and the 2020 U.S. presidential election  8 \n \nMethods   \n \nData curation  \n \nWe leverage our public COVID -19 Twitter dataset (Chen et al., 2020) and U.S. presidential elections Twitter  \ndataset (Chen et al., 2020) for this study, as Twitter provides a platform for users to engage in conversation \nsurrounding events in real -time. Coll ection for the former dataset began in late January 2020, while the \nlatter began in May 2019. At the time of this writing, we only had processed our elections data from March \n2020 onwards, and so we chose to focus on tweets from both datasets that were pos ted between March \n1, 2020 through August 30, 2020. The Democratic National Convention took place from August 17 -20, \nmarking the official shift from the primaries to the presidential election. For this study, we utilize release \nv2.12 from our COVID -19 datas et and release v1.3 from our U .S. presidential  elections dataset. We tracked \nseveral related keywords and accounts for each dataset\u2019s respective topic, a sampling of which can be \nfound in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1.  Sample of keywords used for tracking in our COVID -19 Twitter collection (v2.12 \u2013 September 7, \n2020) and U .S. presidential elections  Twitter collection (v1.3 \u2013 November 16, 2020) . \nCOVID -19-keyword  Tracked since U.S. presidential  \nelections keyword  Tracked since \ncoronavirus  1/21/2020  @JoeBiden  5/20/2019  \nCDC 1/21/2020  @CoryBooker  5/20/2019  \nncov  1/21/2020  @PeteButtigieg  5/20/2019  \ncovid -19 2/16/2020  @JulianCastro  5/20/2019  \ncorona virus  3/2/2020  @BilldeBlasio  5/20/2019  \ncovid  3/6/2020  @JohnDelaney  5/20/2019  \nsars-cov-2 3/6/2020  @TulsiGabbard  5/20/2019  \nsocialdistancing  3/13/2020  @gillbrandny  5/20/2019  \nlockdown  3/16/2020  @KamalaHarris  5/20/2019  \nwear a mask  6/28/2020  @Hickenlooper  5/20/2019  \nwearamask  6/28/2020  @JayInslee  5/20/2019  \n \nWe then filtered the general COVID -19 dataset for tweets related to the Democratic Primary using \nkeywords of interest (Table 2). As we are interested in the U .S. Democratic  primaries, we utilize user -\nspecified location s included in each tweet\u2019s  metadata and normalized these locations (Jiang et al., 2020).  \nWe require all tweets to contain normalized location data that originates from the United States with an \nidentifiable state attribution and be tagged as an English tweet by Twitter. We used Lat ent Dirichlet \nallocation (LDA) to c luster the tweets into 8 topics (this was selected based on the number of topics with \nthe highest coherence score) and tagged tweets based on their nearest probable topic (Blei et al., 2003). \nWe describe how we construct the final dataset in the Appendix  (see Appendix  Part A, \u201cConstructing the \ndataset\u201d).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chen; Chang; Rao; Lerman; Cowan; Ferrara  9 \n \n \n   Table 2.

We remove quoted tweets, as we are interested in \noriginal content and the amplification of certain viewpoints , and quoted tweets (retweets with comments) \nmay contain contrarian commentary relative to the retweeted tweet. This results in 5,211,071  vote -by-\nmail tweets and 1,014,751 mask tweets . With this d ataset, we found relevant co -occurring hashtags from \nthese tweets (see table A1  in Part B of the Appendix ). Using these hashtags, we extracted tweets from the \nentire collection of primary -related tweets containing any of these hashtags.  We also leverage sp ecific \nhashtags that are indicative of stance to identify if a user has engaged in mask -wearing and voting by mail \nfactual information or misinformation. Please refer to the Appendix Part B, \u201cTagging public health \nmisinformation\u201d for a more detailed discus sion on how we determined hashtag ideology alignment and \nits surrounding discourse. To infer a user\u2019s political affiliation, we matched user -shared URLs with domains \nfrom Media Bias -Fact Check to five categories: left, lean left , center , lean right , and right  (Zandt, n.d.) . For \nbetter accuracy, we only included users with more than 10 politically leaning URL s in our visualization.

This results in 1,253,022 unique users.  The domains and the \naggregate bias of the data are shown in Table 4 and Figure 4. The most frequent political affiliation of \ndomains shared is from sources that are center left (or lean left), which is consistent with the labels the \nPew Center assigns to the most reputable media outlets  (Jurkowski et al, 2020) . However, the most \nfrequently retweeted indi vidual domain s include right -leaning media sources, Fox News , Dallas Morning \nNews , and the Daily Caller . This suggests that c onservative tweeters tend to have a more concentrated \nmedia diet.  \n \nTable 4.

Aggregate political leanings of news sources from our mail -in ballot and mask specific dataset.  \n \nGiven that there are more than 67 million tweets, visualizing user behavior in a meaningful way is a high -\ndimensional challenge. A network of social interaction was between Twitter users, where nodes are users \nand edges are the number of retweets. This is a directed graph, for which the original tweeter is the head. \nThere were 1,028,742 unique users and 2 ,886,004 unique weighted edges.  \nFrom there, we applied node2vec , which represents the network in Euclidean space (Grover and \nLeskovec, 2008). The algorithm conducts random walks to explore \u201cneighborhoods,\u201d such that in the final \nrepresentation nodes are pr eserved near their neighbors. We set the dimensions to 10 and the random \nwalk length to 100 \u2014these were found through experimentation of visualization parameters. Next, we \nextract the two most prominent bases using the t-SNE algorithm (t -distributed stochas tic neighbor \nembedding), which maps high dimensional data to lower dimensions by constructing Student t -\ndistributions over the dataset. We set the dimensionality to two, as we want to visualize our networks in \ntwo dimensions.

Constructing  the dataset  \n \nWe found the most frequent hashtags, keywords, bigrams , and trigrams to understand the content of \nthese topics and identified four broad narratives as discussed in Finding 1 and in Figures 1 and 2. Using \nkeywords that best described these narratives, we then filtered both our COVID -19 and U .S. presidential \nelections dataset  for tweets that contained at least one keyword from the primary -related keywords \n(Table 2) and the narratives of interest keywords (Table 3) and merged the two together. Because our \nCOVID -19 dataset was specifically tracking COVID -19-related  discourse, we  felt it necessary to expand our \nsubset of data to include the discussion on these narratives that were captured in our U .S presidential \nelections dataset to give us even more insight into how COVID -19 shaped primary discussion. This final \ndataset  contained a total of 67,846,555 tweets, with 10,536,524 directly mentioning one of the COVID -\n19-related keywords, 5,900,737 referencing mail -in ballots, 1,283,450 tweets referencing mask -related \ndiscourse, and 619,914 tweets referencing lockdown measures.  \n \nB. Tagging public health misinformation  \n \nUpon tagging each user with one of the four classifications (Democrat and fact, Democrat and \nmisinformation, Republican and fact, Republican and misinformation), we filter for tweets based on \nhashtags that are ali gned with the different ideologies within the topic campaign and refer to them by \ntheir representative hashtags (#WearAMask, #MasksOff, #VoteByMail, #VoterFraud) throughout this \npaper.  \nThe full list of hashtags aligned to each representative hashtag can be  found in Table A1  below . We \nthen identify the prevailing narratives present in each of the groups by examining the tweet n -grams.  \n \nTable A1.  Hashtags aligned with a specific representative hashtag.  \n#WearAMask \n(n=45,108)  #MasksOff  \n(n=7,236)  #VoteByMail  \n(n=171,453 ) #VoterFraud  \n(n=67,488 ) \nWearamask  NoMasks  SaveThePostOffice  VoterFraud  \nWearadamnmask  MasksOff  DontMessWithUSPS  NoMailinVoting  \nMaskup  MasksOffAmerica  MailinVoting  VoterIDNow  \n NoMask  VoteByMail  MailinVoterFraud  \n  MailinBallots  VoterFraudIsReal  \n  SaveTheUSPS  DemVotebyMailScam  \n  SaveUSPS   \n  USPSsabotage   \n  VoteByMail2020   \n  MailinBallot   \n  USPSisEssential   \nNote: For our mail -in ballot and masks -related subsets, we find the top 100 hashtags in each subset and isolate policy -stance  \nrelated hashtags. We filter tweets based on these hashtags (case insensitive) to find a subset of tweets related to fact and \nmisinformat ion views on masks and voting.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n COVID -19 misinformation and the 2020 U.S. presidential election  16 \n \nTable A2.  Number of tweets.  \n #WearAMask  #MasksOff  #VoteByMail  #VoterFraud  \nL/LL 8,626  364 52,343   1,592  \nC 624 117 3,529   630 \nR/LR 378 1,178  10,576  5,089   \nNote: We divide user views along their perspectives towards masks and mail -in voting and find the number of tweets for left (L), \nlean left (LL), center (C), lean right (LR) and right (R).  \n \nWe find that for the subset of tweets that align with #WearAMask posted by Liberal users, the discourse \nencourages others to comply with regulations to wear masks. Some of the most frequent bigrams include \n\u201csocial distancing\u201d and \u201cwearing mask .\u201d We then look at tweets from Conservative users and find their \nconversation revolves around Donald Trump\u2019s decision t o wear a mask and how this action can be used \nagainst the Democrats.  \n \n \nFigure A1 . Screenshot of one of the tweets driving misinformation on mask discourse in both the Democratic and Republican \nparties.  \n \nHowever, when we look at the #MasksOff discourse, we find that regardless of party affiliation, both \nConservatives and Liberals amplify misinformation messaging claiming that doctors believe that masks \nare adverse for one\u2019s health (an example of one such tweet can be seen in Figure A1).  \nFor mai l-in ballots, liberals tweeting #VoteByMail frequently mention \u201cvote safely ,\u201d \u201cexpand \nvotebymail ,\u201d and \u201cwear mask ,\u201d all of which suggest that Liberals are encouraging voting by mail as a \nmeans to remain safe during the COVID -19 pandemic. Conservatives are also voicing the same concerns, \nwith mentions of \u201cstay home ,\u201d \u201csocial distancing ,\u201d but also amplify their unhappiness regarding the Texas \nSupreme Court\u2019s decision to deny Democratic efforts to expand mail -in voting in Texas. On the other side \nof the spectrum, Liberals and Conservatives posting #VoterFraud -related tweets  all reference a testimony \ngiven to the House Judicial subcommittee that supports the notion that a shift in mail -in ballots will \nincrease voter fraud in the upcoming U .S. presidential  election.  \nWhat we find there is that, for tweets supporting factual information, there is slight variance in topic \ncoverage when we compare tweets from users in different parties that are engaging in the same \ninformation stance (misinformation versus factual information). However, when we examine \nmisinformation content, there is homogeneity between what users from both parties are pushing on \nTwitter. This suggests that, for both mail -in ballot and mask -related discourse, both the left and right are \nsusceptible to the same kinds of misinformation.  \n \n\n \n \n \n Chen; Chang; Rao; Lerman; Cowan; Ferrara  17 \n \n \n   C. Limitations  \nIt is difficult to compare survey reported political affiliations with political affiliation inferred through \nsocial media posts (Deb et al., 2019). Because our data set was filtered for keywords directly related to \nthe 2020 US Democratic primaries, we see a significantly larger volume of tweets from Democratic tagged \nusers, and a much smaller number of tweets attributed to Republican users. Thus, conclusions regarding \nRepublican and Repub lican -leaning users\u2019 narratives were based on a small sample size of users.  \nWe also note that Twitter\u2019s free streaming API only returns 1% of the total tweet stream. This means \nthat we are not able to collect all of the tweets that are a part of the COVID -19 and Democratic primary -\nrelated discourse. However, the 1% sample still serves as a fairly accurate representation of the discourse. \nTwitter has also recently removed location data from a tweet\u2019s metadata, which means that we have had \nto infer user loca tion based on the user reported location. These locations may not consistently be \naccurate, and we are unable to identify geolocation data for users who do not specify a location or users \nwho fail to list a location from which we are able to extract locati on data .  \n \n \n ", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "COVID-19 misinformation and the 2020 US presidential election", "author": ["E Chen", "H Chang", "A Rao"], "pub_year": "2021", "venue": "Harvard kennedy \u2026", "abstract": "Implications Voting is the defining act for a democracy.

Previous analysis of protest imagery from social\nmedia sites categorized these images into groups including texts,\nscreenshots, memes, and artwork. However, large-scale manual\nannotation to identify different types of images is not feasible. By\napplying machine learning to a large Twitter dataset focused on\nthe Stop Asian Hate movement, we found the type of image an\naccount posted during protests on Twitter is tied to the credibility\nand political leaning of posted content, type of witnessing (remote\nor connective), and community formation.\nIndex Terms \u2014images, protest, social media, social movements,\nTwitter, visual analysis, machine learning\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nSocial media platforms such as Twitter have enabled users\nto participate in protests by simply uploading images. Pho-\ntographs have become a form of visual protest through this\n\u201cconnective witnessing\u201d [1], where individuals contribute to\nthe \ufb02ow of information by sharing eyewitness photographs of\nan event. Researchers have also observed the phenomenon of\n\u201cremote witnessing\u201d [2] where accounts appropriate secondary\nsources, e.g. posting screenshots of news articles.\nPrevious work focuses on small samples of popular or\ncommonly re-posted images understood through manual anno-\ntation [2], [3], but there is little research on how these different\ntypes of images exist across an entire movement due to the\nsheer volume of images involved. In order to bridge this gap,\nwe ask the following questions: 1) how can we apply machine\nlearning techniques to identify and classify types of protest\nimagery on Twitter and 2) how do accounts leverage images\nto participate in protest discourse on social media?\nII. M ETHOD\nWe extended previous work by developing a method to\nclassify images by type in a large Twitter dataset using the\nconvolutional neural network ResNet50 [4]. We then applied\nthis method to the recent Stop Asian Hate movement to\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge support from the National Science\nFoundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates grant #2051101.better understand how different types of images contributed\nto political- and misinformation-related discourse.\nWe used a dataset focused on the Stop Asian Hate move-\nment, which appeared in response to the rise of anti-asian hate\ncrimes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. We started with\na dataset of 4.2 million tweets and selected a subset of ac-\ncounts who posted at least one domain and at least one image.\nImages posted by these accounts were classi\ufb01ed into one of 7\ncategories (infographics, photographs with graphics or text,\nphotographs, illustrations with text, illustrations, texts, and\nscreenshots). We also collected the number of right-leaning,\nleft-leaning, low-credibility and high-credibility domains1that\neach account posted and built a retweet network where each\naccount was labelled with the type of image that it retweeted\nthe most.\nIII. R ESULTS\nA. Network Structure\nIn the over 1.3 million images that were analyzed approx-\nimately 50% of the images shared were photographs, which\nsupports Jenzen et. al.\u2019s \ufb01ndings [3]. Infographics made up\napproximately 25% of the corpus, and screenshots and texts\neach made up about 12% of the corpus.\nAs seen in Fig. 1, the core of the network (E) is split into two\nhalves: on the left, accounts shared mostly photographs while\non the right, accounts shared mostly infographics. Smaller\ncommunities formed outside of the cluster E. For example,\ncluster A is a tightly knit community of accounts that mostly\nshared screenshots, cluster B shared mostly photographs, while\nclusters C and D shared primarily infographics. These clusters\nindicate that accounts who posted protest-related images on\nsocial media interacted with accounts who participated in a\nsimilar way.\nB. Images and Protest Discourse\nOverall, we found that the types of images that an account\nshared were tied to the political lean and credibility of\n1Ratings for credibility and political leaning of domains were taken from\nMedia Bias/Fact Check (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)\nFig. 1.

As seen in Figure 2, accounts\nthat shared right-leaning domains were more likely to share\ntexts and screenshots and less likely to share photographs\nthan their left-leaning counterparts. This suggests that right-\nleaning accounts tended to use text-based mediums associated\nwith remote witnessing, and left-leaning accounts tended to\nshare more photographs, which are associated with connective\nwitnessing. Similarly, Figure 3 shows that accounts who shared\nlow-credibility domains were more likely to share texts and\nscreenshots and less likely to share photographs than their\nhigh-credibility counterparts. This suggests that low-credibility\naccounts also tended to engage more in remote witnessing, and\nhigh-credibility accounts tended towards connective witness-\ning.\nInfographics stood out because they made up a signi\ufb01cant\nportion of our corpus but did not fall neatly into either\nremote or connective witnessing. However, infographics still\nplayed an interesting part in protest discourse. As seen in\nFigure 2, right-leaning accounts were more likely to share\ntexts than infographics, and Figure 3 shows low-credibility\naccounts were more likely to share infographics over texts.\nThis difference in how infographics, which we de\ufb01ne as text\nwith graphic elements added, and how plain text images were\nshared suggests design elements may have played a role in\nhow these types of images were utilized in protest discourse.\nIV. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nThis investigation into protest imagery posted during the\nStop Asian Hate movement on Twitter revealed that image\ntype was tied to credibility, political lean, type of witnessing\n(connective or remote), and community formation. Future\nresearch directions include investigating the prevalence of\ninfographics, which made up a quarter of our corpus but did\nnot fall into connective or remote witnessing, as well as text-\nbased images in general, which were popular in our dataset\ndespite the fact that Twitter already provides a space to post\ntext within the body of a tweet. A more in-depth look at text-\nbased images and their aesthetics and composition will enable\nus to determine if accounts share certain images based on\ncontent or visual appearance, and how image design might be\nleveraged by bad actors to spread disingenuous content.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

Yet, relatively\nlittle is known about the empirical efficacy of these buttons.\nNeither is much known about users\u2019 awareness of and confi-\ndence in them. To address these gaps, we simulated YouTube\nusers with sock puppet agents. Each agent first executed a\n\u201cstain phase\u201d, where it watched many videos of an assigned\ntopic; it then executed a \u201cscrub phase\u201d, where it tried to re-\nmove recommendations from the assigned topic. Each agent\nrepeatedly applied a single scrubbing strategy, either indicat-\ning disinterest in one of the videos visited in the stain phase\n(disliking it or deleting it from the watch history), or indi-\ncating disinterest in a video recommended on the homepage\n(clicking the \u201cnot interested\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d\nbutton or opening the video and clicking the dislike button).\nWe found that the stain phase significantly increased the frac-\ntion of the recommended videos dedicated to the assigned\ntopic on the user\u2019s homepage. For the scrub phase, using the\n\u201cNot interested\u201d button worked best, significantly reducing\nsuch recommendations in all topics tested, on average re-\nmoving 88% of them. Neither the stain phase nor the scrub\nphase, however, had much effect on videopage recommenda-\ntions (those given to users while they watch a video). We also\nran a survey (N = 300) asking adult YouTube users in the US\nwhether they were aware of and used these buttons before,\nas well as how effective they found these buttons to be. We\nfound that 44% of participants were not aware that the \u201cNot\ninterested\u201d button existed. Those who were aware of it often\nused it to remove unwanted recommendations (82.8%) and\nfound it to be modestly effective (3.42 out of 5).\n1 Introduction\nYouTube is the world\u2019s largest long-form video sharing plat-\nform, with users watching a billion hours of YouTube\u2019s\ncontent every day (YouTube 2017). In recent years, the\nYouTube recommendation algorithm has come under in-\ncreased scrutiny for its role in promoting conspiracy theories\n(Tomlein et al. 2021), radical content (Hosseinmardi et al.\n2021, 2024), and Alt-Right ideology (Lewis 2018; Ribeiro\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.et al. 2020). Studies have found that watching such content\ncan lead to its continual and sometimes increased promo-\ntion (Ledwich and Zaitsev 2020; Hussein, Juneja, and Mitra\n2020). Besides societally-harmful information, YouTube has\nalso been known to make unwanted recommendations to in-\ndividuals, sometimes in the form of offensive, triggering, or\noutrageous videos (Mozilla 2019; Haroon et al. 2023).\nIn the context of both individual and societal reasons for\nusers to better tailor their personalized content on YouTube,\nthe platform provides several buttons, such as \u201cNot in-\nterested\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d, which allow\nusers to express disinterest in a specific video or channel\nand alter their recommendation feeds accordingly (Burch\n2019; Cooper 2023). These buttons exist among a variety of\nplatform features, such as \u201cDisliking\u201d videos and deleting\nvideos from one\u2019s watch history. All of those buttons may\nhelp users eliminate certain content from their feeds.\nHowever, relatively little is known about the efficacy of\nthese buttons in practice, nor about users\u2019 awareness of and\nconfidence in them. To address these gaps, this work investi-\ngates how well simulated YouTube users (agents) can popu-\nlate their recommendation feeds with content from a certain\ntopic (the \u201cstain\u201d phase), as well as the ability for the rec-\nommendations of that topic to be removed by using a strat-\negy to indicate disinterest (the \u201cscrub\u201d phase). We selected\nfour topics: Alt-Right, Antitheism, Political Left, and Politi-\ncal Right. These topics are particularly interesting because,\nwhile plenty of literature exists on how one can get recom-\nmended more of these topics, little is known about remov-\ning them. Also, each topic is a realistic one that some users\nwould no longer want to see. We examined six strategies\n(Watch neutral, Dislike, Delete, Not interested, No channel,\nandDislike recommended ), as well as a None control strat-\negy. Lastly, we conducted a complementary survey study\nto understand real users\u2019 awareness of and experience with\nthose scrubbing strategies on YouTube.\nThe main findings are as follows:\n\u2022 Watching a topic increased its presence on the homepage,\nthough the stain never covers more than half of the recom-\nmendations. Watching a topic had less effect on the rec-\nommendations shown on videopages.\n\u2022 For scrubbing a topic from the homepage, the most ef-\nfective action was clicking the \u201cNot interested\u201d button on\na recommended video. In contrast, none of the scrubbing\nProceedings of the Eighteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2024)\n930\nactions significantly reduced the number of recommenda-\ntions of videos on the topic shown on videopages.\n\u2022 Nearly half of survey respondents were not aware of the\nmost effective feature (pressing \u201cNot interested\u201d). Those\nwho were aware of it used it frequently, and perceived it\nto be less effective than the \u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d\nbutton, contrary to our findings from the audit study.\n2 Background and Related Work\n2.1 Locations of Relevant YouTube Features\nThere are three main YouTube pages that are relevant to our\nstudy: the homepage, videopage, and watch history page.\nThe homepage is the landing page for users upon entering\nthe platform.1It presents recommendations in a grid format.\nIf a user is logged in, the content will be personalized to\ntheir account. Each recommendation contains a dropdown\nmenu, where users are presented with two relevant buttons:\nthe \u201cNot interested\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d but-\ntons. These allow the users to (ostensibly) indicate disinter-\nest with respect to specific recommendations.\nThe videopage is the page users see while watching a\nvideo. Recommendations are given in a right-hand sidebar.\nThe feature on this page that is relevant to our study is the\n\u201cDislike\u201d button, indicated by a thumbs-down symbol.\nFinally, the watch history page2(orwatch history for\nshort) is the page that displays a log of the user\u2019s previously-\nwatched videos. This page is only available to users who are\nlogged in. Relevant to our study is the option for users to\ndelete specific videos from their watch history. Specifically,\nthe \u201cDelete\u201d button is \u201cX\u201d located on the upper-right hand\ncorner of each video in the log.\nWe note that these pages and features were accurately de-\nscribed as of the time of data collection (August 2022) and\nthe paper writing (January 2023). Since the platform often\nundergoes changes to its user experience and interface de-\nsign, they may be outdated.\n2.2 Sock Puppet Algorithm Audits\nOur study takes a sock puppet algorithm audit approach.\nSeveral prior works quantifying the YouTube recommender\nsystem\u2019s role in promoting and removing unwanted content\nalso use the algorithm auditing approach. So we begin with\na review of this method.\nAn algorithm audit \u201cis a method of repeatedly and system-\natically querying an algorithm with inputs and observing the\ncorresponding outputs in order to draw inferences about its\nopaque inner workings\u201d (Metaxa et al. 2021). Algorithm au-\ndits are a tool for researchers to investigate algorithms whose\ncode and data are shielded from the public.\nOne type of algorithm audit is the sock puppet approach\n(Tomlein et al. 2021; Haroon et al. 2023; Hosseinmardi et al.\n2024). Sock puppet audits use code scripts to create simu-\nlated users. These fake users \u2013 also called \u201cagents\u201d \u2013 interact\nwith the platform or algorithm of interest as if they were real\n1https://www.youtube.com\n2https://www.youtube.com/feed/historyusers. In the meantime, researchers record and compare the\nrecommendations that the agents receive.\n2.3 Recommender Systems\u2019 Role in Promoting\nProblematic and Unwanted Content\nYouTube is one of the most popular video sharing platforms.\nIn recent years, it has received increasing public scrutiny\nfrom journalists and academics alike in assessing its recom-\nmendations of problematic content.\nThe center of the platform\u2019s content dissemination is the\nrecommendation engine, which plays an important role in\nhelping users decide what to watch (Covington, Adams,\nand Sargin 2016; Wu, Rizoiu, and Xie 2019). From a vast,\ngrowing pool of videos on the platform, users are suggested\nwhat to watch next based on their previous interactions with\nYouTube and what content they will most likely engage with\nnext (Zhao et al. 2019).\nYouTube\u2019s recommendation engine has been theorized to\npromote problematic recommendations, which can broadly\nbe split into two categories. The first is its propensity to sug-\ngest content that violates political and societal democratic\nideals, such as promoting extremism and conspiracy theories\n(Lewis 2018; Tomlein et al. 2021) or creating political filter\nbubbles and causing radicalization (Tufekci 2018; Hossein-\nmardi et al. 2021). The second category of problematic rec-\nommendations are those that conflict with individual pref-\nerences. Many users have found recommendations on video\nsharing platforms to be personally offensive, triggering, vi-\nolent, and outrageous (Mozilla 2019; Haroon et al. 2023), as\nwell as conflicting with their sense of identity (Karizat et al.\n2021), even if the video is completely legal and enjoyable\nfor others.\nSeveral YouTube algorithm audits have investigated the\nrole of recommender systems in promoting such content,\nlargely focusing on political ideologies and conspiracy the-\nories (Tomlein et al. 2021; Haroon et al. 2023; Hossein-\nmardi et al. 2024). While previous studies often refer to this\nphenomenon as \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d, we choose to use the term\n\u201cstain\u201d. This is because previous studies (as well as ours)\nfind that topical recommendations rarely take up more than\nhalf of one\u2019s feed and never reach 100% despite watching\nmany videos of that topic, and we would like to avoid the\nmisleading interpretation of the term \u201cbubble\u201d as being com-\npletely surrounded by (i.e., having 100% of) recommenda-\ntions of a certain topic.\nRegardless of the term, studies have agreed that contin-\nued consumption of videos of a certain topic will lead to\nfurther (and sometimes increased) recommendation of that\ntopic, on both the homepage and the videopage (Hussein,\nJuneja, and Mitra 2020; Papadamou et al. 2022; Haroon\net al. 2023). Recommendations in search results, on the other\nhand, do not experience such personalization effects (Tom-\nlein et al. 2021). Despite these findings, it is still unknown if\nthe stain is comprised largely or completely of videos from\npreviously-watched channels, or if YouTube introduces new\nchannels yet to be watched by the user that contain videos\nwith content on the same topic.\n931\n2.4 User Controls to Remove Unwanted Content\nCombined calls from academics and journalists alike to\nmitigate the YouTube recommender\u2019s role in problem-\natic content consumption have contributed to recent plat-\nform changes. These include features that are intended to\ngive users more control in tailoring their recommendations\n(Burch 2019; Cooper 2023). Other social media platforms\nsuch as TikTok and Instagram have also released and experi-\nmented with similar user controls (Ariano 2021; Meta 2022).\nSuch features may improve user satisfaction in online spaces\nmediated by recommender systems, especially on systems\n(such as YouTube) that receive much of their content viewer-\nship from users watching recommender-suggested content.\nHowever, compared to what is known about the preva-\nlence of unwanted content on YouTube, relatively little is\nknown about these features that remove them or their effi-\ncacy. We review this literature here.\nAlgorithm audits on how to reduce recommendations\nTwo experiments used an intuitive strategy to try to re-\nduce content of a given topic: watching videos of a differ-\nenttopic. Tomlein et al. (2021)\u2019s sock puppet audit found\nthat agents were recommended less conspiratorial content\nafter they watched many videos debunking conspiracy the-\nories. Haroon et al. (2023)\u2019s sock puppet audit found that a\npolitically-biased recommendation feed could be \u201cdebiased\u201d\n\u2013 or achieve similar amounts of left and right-leaning videos\n\u2013 by watching a diet of videos heavily featuring the ideology\nthat was less prevalent originally.\nThese studies suggest that it is possible to remove some\nunwanted content from one\u2019s feed. However, the degree to\nwhich it can be done varies and is never 100%.\nFurther, we find it necessary to expand recommendation-\nreduction strategies beyond video-watching and towards\nplatform-provided buttons. First, many such buttons are de-\nsigned for the explicit purpose of removing unwanted con-\ntent (e.g., the \u201cNot Interested\u201d button). Second, they may be\nmuch faster to perform: studies suggest a minimum watch\ntime of 10 minutes is required to register significant changes\nto recommendations (Papadamou et al. 2022); meanwhile,\npressing a button takes just seconds. Lastly, using buttons\nmay avoid the side effect of infusing too much content from\nanother topic to replace the unwanted topic.\nRicks and McCrosky (2022) provide the first quantita-\ntive study of such buttons on YouTube. They supplied users\nwith a browser extension with a custom \u201cStop Recommend-\ning\u201d button displayed on each video recommendation. Then,\nwhenever it was clicked, it caused a press of a native plat-\nform button in the background, with users randomly as-\nsigned to different native platform buttons. Their results\nshow that the native \u201cDon\u2019t recommend this channel\u201d but-\nton, which appears on recommendations, produced sugges-\ntions least similar to them.\nRicks and McCrosky (2022)\u2019s study benefits from a large\nsample. Their field experiment design also presents distinct\nadvantages, particularly external validity that a sock pup-\npet audit cannot achieve. At the same time, we still find it\nvaluable to perform a sock puppet experiment with a more\ncontrolled environment for two reasons. First, because userscould press the custom \u201cStop Recommending\u201d on any rec-\nommendation from any topic, the study was not able to iden-\ntify the effects of the buttons for well-defined topics. Second,\nthere are possible confounds from uncontrolled user behav-\nior, such as users watching videos similar to the ones they\npressed \u201cStop Recommending\u201d on, or cross-contamination\nbetween conditions where users clicked on native YouTube-\nprovided buttons in addition to the custom Mozilla-provided\none.\nUsers\u2019 relationship with user controls A few studies also\nused qualitative methods to understand users\u2019 experiences\nand perceptions of different strategies to remove unwanted\ncontent from their personal feeds.\nRicks and McCrosky (2022) surveyed and interviewed\na subset of their participants from the quantitative arm of\ntheir study. They find that users take a variety of strate-\ngies to combat unwanted recommendations, generally find\nplatform-provided features to be ineffective, and that achiev-\ning effective results requires sustained time and effort.\nWhile these surveys and interviews solicit the breadth of\nstrategies that users have to combat unwanted recommenda-\ntions, the degree to which general YouTube users are aware\nof each platform-provided feature is still unknown. It is also\nunknown whether they use these features, even if they are\naware of them. Such data is important because an effective\nfeature may be moot if they are unknown or unused.\nSmith, Bullen, and Huerta (2021) also examined YouTube\nuser controls for altering recommendations. They found that\nthe actions performed by such buttons were reactive (i.e.,\nonly useful after a user received an unwanted recommenda-\ntion) and that the feedback provided to the user after clicking\nthem was often unclear and vague. They also found that nav-\nigating to some of these features was difficult, which could\nlimit users\u2019 ability to use them.\n3 Research Questions\nPrevious studies of \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d on YouTube found that\nrecommendations of a given topic can increase as a re-\nsult of watching videos of that topic, but we do not know\nwhether these recommendations are from channels the user\nhas watched before, or whether they are new channels that\nYouTube finds similar. Such a breakdown would add to\nthe knowledge of YouTube\u2019s role in promoting unwanted\ncontent by quantifying how much YouTube is \u201cinferring\u201d\nthis content rather than simply suggesting content from\npreviously-watched channels. Also, confirming the general\nresult of increasing topical recommendations motivates our\nnext study phase, which attempts to remove them.\nThus, we first address the question, how responsive are\nYouTube recommendations to watching many videos of\nthe same topic? (RQ1) In particular, do they recommend\nmore videos of the same topic, and if so are they from chan-\nnels that users watched up to that point or are they new ones?\nDo the results vary for different topics? We study four topics\nwhose prevalence on YouTube has been previously studied:\nAlt-Right, Antitheism, Political Left, and Political Right (mo-\ntivated and described in Section 4.1).\n932\nWe are also interested in the effects of platform features\nin removing unwanted recommendations. While a previous\nstudy investigated their usage \u201cin the wild\u201d, the effects of\neach feature, uncontaminated by usage of other features, on\ntopics that are well-defined, is still unknown. Such ques-\ntions are worth answering because YouTube users in gen-\neral could benefit from knowing what are the most effective\nstrategies for removing unwanted content, specifically their\neffect on specific topics that they may dislike.\nThus, we ask, how responsive are YouTube recommen-\ndations to repeatedly performing a particular strategy to\ntry to remove unwanted videos of a topic? (RQ2) Are they\ndifferent between videopage and homepage? How much\ncontent is removed from similar channels that are not explic-\nitly interacted with? Do they vary topic to topic? We identi-\nfied six such strategies, such as pressing the \u201cNot interested\u201d\nbutton, and listed them in Section 4.1.\nFinally, it is unknown how many YouTube users are aware\nof each platform feature, how many utilize them, and how\neffective the users find them to be. This information is im-\nportant because effective strategies may be moot if users do\nnot know about them, and because users should be both us-\ning effective strategies and finding them to be effective.\nTherefore, we lastly ask, what are real users\u2019 experi-\nences with the platform features that we test in RQ2?\n(RQ3) With respect to each platform feature, we designed\na survey study to ask how many participants are aware of\nit, what percentage use it to remove unwanted recommenda-\ntions (given they are aware), and how effective participants\nfind it to be (given they are aware and have used the feature\nto try to amend the situation).\n4 Sock Puppet Study\n4.1 Sock Puppet Design\nWe take a sock puppet algorithm audit approach to exam-\nine how suggestions from certain topics can both be popu-\nlated onto and removed from one\u2019s personal recommenda-\ntion feed. Broadly, our agents first purposely populate their\nfeed with videos from this unwanted topic (\u201cstain phase\u201d);\nThen, they take on one of a variety of strategies to try\nto eliminate such videos from being recommended (\u201cscrub\nphase\u201d). We collect data on how recommendations change\nthroughout these phases in order to characterize the recom-\nmendation system\u2019s response to these various interactions.\nVideo topics Each topic is operationalized as a list of\nchannels collected by previous researchers who have studied\nthat topic on YouTube. They are used in our experiment in\ntwo ways. First, agents watch videos from the channel lists\nduring the stain phase. Next, during the scrub phase, some\nstrategies cross reference their homepage recommendations\nwith the assigned topic\u2019s channel list to determine whether\nand which one to indicate disinterest on.\n\u2022Alt-Right : The most extreme group of the Alterna-\ntive Influence Network, a loosely-defined community of\nYouTube channels that are defined by their opposition\nto mainstream media (Ricks and McCrosky 2022). The\nAlt-Right promotes white nationalism in the face of anincreasingly diverse US population, and is often openly\nanti-semitic (ADL 2019). YouTube channels of the Alt-\nRight were first collected by Lewis (2018) through a\nsnowball sampling method, and subsequently augmented\nby Ribeiro et al. (2020) and Chen et al. (2022).\n\u2022Antitheism: Collected by Ledwich and Zaitsev (2020). It\nis \u201cthe self-identified atheist who is also actively critical\nof religion\u201d.\n\u2022Political Left : Collected by Wu and Resnick (2021). They\ninclude local news, talk shows, and magazines. We use\nthe US political left channels, which takes similar views\namong various issues of political significance, such as\nclimate change.\n\u2022Political Right : Same as above, but with the US political\nright channels.\nScrubbing strategies The name and operation of each\nscrubbing strategy are listed below. Each agent is assigned\none strategy, and performs it repeatedly during the \u201cscrub\nphase\u201d of the sock puppet run.\n\u2022None (control): Load the homepage, then do nothing ex-\ncept refresh the homepage.\n\u2022Watch neutral : Load and watch a video from mainstream,\npolitically neutral news outlets as defined by the fact-\nchecking organization Media Bias/Fact Check.3\n\u2022 \u201cHistory-based\u201d strategies\n\u2013Dislike: Load a previously-watched video from the\nstain phase and click the \u201cDislike\u201d button.\n\u2013Delete: Load the watch history and click \u201cDelete\u201d on\nthe most recently-watched stain video.\n\u2022 \u201cRecommendation-based\u201d strategies. Load the home-\npage. If there does notexist any recommended video on\nthe homepage from a channel in the channel list, then just\nrefresh. However, if such a video exists, do the following\nto the first such video:\n\u2013Not interested : click the \u201cNot interested\u201d button and\nrefresh the homepage.\n\u2013No channel : click the \u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d\nbutton and refresh the homepage.\n\u2013Dislike recommended : click on the video and dislike it\n(agents do not stay to watch the video), then return to\nthe homepage.\nThe \u201cwatch neutral\u201d strategy attempts to ignore the cur-\nrent issue by watching videos from a different topic, and\nmost resembles the intervention strategies of related studies\n(Haroon et al. 2023; Tomlein et al. 2021). We call dislike and\ndelete strategies \u201chistory-based\u201d because they act on videos\nthat the agents watched during the stain phase. We call the\nfinal three strategies \u201crecommendation-based\u201d because they\nare performed with respect to recommended videos.\n3https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\n933\nSetup Stain Scrub Teardown\nP1...Watch a\nstaining video\nCollect\nhomepage and\nvideopage recsP2Perform a\nscrub\nP3Perform a\nscrub\n...... ...\nPhase\nData\nCollectionInteractionLogin, load\nvideo listClear\nhistory\n 40 steps  40 steps \nCollect\nhomepage and\nvideopage recsCollect\nhomepage and\nvideopage recsWatch a\nstaining videoFigure 1: The interactions and data collection that a sock puppet agent performs on the YouTube platform, separated by phase.\nSock puppet phases and data collection A sock pup-\npet agent follows the following process. After logging in\nto a YouTube account, an agent performs the \u201cstain phase\u201d,\nwhere it watches 40 videos, for up to 30 minutes each,4from\na \u201cstain video list\u201d which are sampled from the channel list\nbelonging to its assigned topic. Next, it performs the \u201cscrub\nphase\u201d, where it executes its assigned scrubbing strategy 40\ntimes. Lastly, the agent clears its entire YouTube activity\nthrough Google\u2019s MyActivity page,5in order to leave a clean\nhistory for the next audit to start (Tomlein et al. 2021). This\nincludes clearing all revertible actions made during its run,\nsuch as clicks of the \u201cDislike\u201d, \u201cNot interested\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t rec-\nommend\u201d, and \u201cDelete from watch history\u201d buttons.\nOur agents use web-scraping methods to collect the top\n10 recommendations from the homepage and videopage at\nthree strategic points:\n\u2022 P1: The beginning of the stain phase.\n\u2022 P2: The end of the stain phase.\n\u2022 P3: The end of the scrub phase.\nBecause the video being watched during videopage col-\nlection may itself have an effect on recommendations, each\nagent always loads the same video at all three collection\npoints (P1, P2, P3). This video is from the stain video list.\nAlgorithm 1 provides an overview of a sock puppet\nagent\u2019s interactions with the platform. A visual flowchart of\nthis process is given in Figure 1. The code implementation\nis available on the project webpage.6\nWe now describe the configurations of agents for the over-\nall experiment. For each topic we tested seven strategies,\neach five times, resulting in (7 * 5 =) 35 agents. All 35 agents\nof a given topic were run in parallel in order to deal with rec-\nommendation noise that may arise from having agents make\nqueries at different times.\nFor a given topic, we also drew five stain video lists, and\nassigned each list to exactly one agent within every strat-\negy tested. Doing so assures that agents of the same strategy\nwatch different sets of staining videos, boosting generaliz-\nability of the strategy effects, while simultaneously assuring\n4An alternative is to stay for the median watch time for videos\nwith similar length, see Wu, Rizoiu, and Xie (2018)\u2019s computation\nof relative engagement metric.\n5https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity\n6https://github.com/avliu-um/youtube-disinterestthat agents of different strategies watch, in total, the same\nvideos, enabling comparability between strategies.\nAdditionally, each of the 35 agents have their own Google\nAccounts so that the platform can track their viewing habits\nand personalize content to each agent, and so that we can\nmore closely simulate real users\u2019 experience with the plat-\nform. Logging into an account also grants access to buttons\nand features that are only available to users that are logged\nin (e.g., the \u201cNot interested\u201d button).\nOur agents ran in a Google Chrome browser with ad-\nblocker installed. They had Google accounts with birthdays\nset at an arbitrary 5/5/1990, a gender selection of \u201cRather not\nsay\u201d, and asexual names (e.g., \u201cTandy\u201d). We also address the\npotential biases from location effects, which would occur if\nqueries were made to the platform from different locations,\nor from (different accounts in) the same IP address. Thus, all\nagents are created and live in the same AWS Region of Ohio\n(US-East-2), but make queries from individual IP addresses.\nOut of 140 sock puppets released over the course of five\ndays in August 2022, 139 sock puppets ran successfully.\nAgents collected a total of 8330 recommendations.\n4.2 Data Annotation\nOur agents collected many recommendations during their\nruns. We would like to label them for whether they belong\nto the topics that the agents were assigned to (what we call\n\u201cstain\u201d), in order to quantify how well (1) the stain phase\nAlgorithm 1: Agent\nLog into YouTube\nCollect homepage recs \u25b7P1\nCollect videopage recs from the first stain video \u25b7P1\nfori\u2208[2. . .40]do \u25b7stain phase\nWatch a video from stain video list up to 30 minutes\nend for\nCollect homepage recs \u25b7P2\nCollect videopage recs from the first stain video \u25b7P2\nfori\u2208[1. . .40]do \u25b7scrub phase\nPerform assigned scrubbing strategy\nend for\nCollect homepage recs \u25b7P3\nCollect videopage recs from the first stain video \u25b7P3\nClear YouTube activity (cancel all revertible actions)\n934\nAlt-Right Antitheist Political Left Political Right Avg. relative change\nP1 P2 P3 P1 P2 P3 P1 P2 P3 P1 P2 P3 P2 to P3HomepageTotal 2%\u2217\u2212 \u219220% 11%\u2217\u2212 \u219237% 6%\u2217\u2212 \u219228% 9%\u2217\u2212 \u219229%\nNone 20% 22% 32% 38% 20% 34% 32% 42% +32%\nWatch neutral 12% 8% 34% 22% 32%\u2217\u2212 \u219218% 26%\u2217\u2212 \u219216% -38%\nDelete 20%\u2217\u2212 \u21920% 32% 24% 30%\u2217\u2212 \u21920% 24%\u2217\u2212 \u21924% -77%\nDislike 20% 4% 30%\u2217\u2212 \u219210% 24% 28% 32%\u2217\u2212 \u219216% -45%\nNot interested 18%\u2217\u2212 \u21920% 42%\u2217\u2212 \u21922% 28%\u2217\u2212 \u219210% 26%\u2217\u2212 \u21922% -88%\nNo channel 28%\u2217\u2212 \u219210% 44%\u2217\u2212 \u219222% 30%\u2217\u2212 \u219216% 36%\u2217\u2212 \u219224% -49%\nDislike rec. 20%\u2217\u2212 \u21928% 42%\u2217\u2212 \u219214% 32% 24% 26% 34% -30%VideopageTotal 6% 5% 26%\u2217\u2212 \u219237% 41% 42% 12%\u2217\u2212 \u219228%\nNone 6% 4% 40% 34% 38% 34% 20% 30% -2%\nWatch neutral 4% 6% 28% 6% 42% 46% 30% 34% -1%\nDelete 2% 2% 38% 34% 42% 34% 32% 16% -20%\nDislike 12% 14% 40% 34% 44% 46% 22% 42% +24%\nNot interested 4% 2% 40% 48% 44% 44% 32% 30% -9%\nNo channel 0% 0% 32% 30% 44% 40% 34% 36% -2%\nDislike rec. 6% 2% 42% 34% 40% 50% 24% 22% -17%\nTable 1: Stain percentage values, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, for the homepage (top) and videopage (bottom), at data\ncollection points P1, P2, P3, for each strategy (row) and topic (column).

Two authors who had\nextensive experience in studying political polarization and\nYouTube platforms independently labeled those channels by\nfollowing the codebook. The preliminary inter-rater reliabil-\nity (IRR), measured by Cohen\u2019s kappa, was 0.648, 0.728,\n0.634, 0.563 for Alt-Right, Antitheism, Political Left, Po-\nlitical Right, respectively, demonstrating substantial agree-\nment. The two raters discussed every disagreed case to reach\nconsensus and updated the codebook whenever needed.\nThe two raters then each labeled all the remaining chan-\nnels. The final IRR kappa scores were 0.660, 0.822, 0.854,\nand 0.945, respectively. The raters also discussed all dis-\nagreed cases and resolved disagreement. The final anno-\ntation codebook, annotation results, and IRR calculation,\nalong with sock puppet implementation are publicly avail-\nable on the project webpage.7\n4.3 Result 1: Stain Phase\nIn this subsection, we answer our questions posed in RQ1.\nEffects of stain phase We wanted to know whether our\nagents experienced a significant change in stain (the percent-\nage of recommendations of their assigned topic) after the\nstain phase. To address this question, we compared the stain\nof our agents at P1 with those at P2 for each topic, in both the\nhomepage and the videopage. To determine whether changes\nwere significant, we chose the Wilcoxon signed-rank test be-\ncause (a) the data was non-normal; (b) the comparison be-\nfore and after the \u201cstain phase\u201d treatment was a paired test.\nResults are given in Table 1 (P1 to P2).\n7https://github.com/avliu-um/youtube-disinterestOn the homepage, we find that all topics experienced sig-\nnificant increases in stain as a result of the stain phase. An-\ntitheism received the most stain at P2 (37%), while Alt-Right\nreceived the least (20%). In contrast, the videopage demon-\nstrated significant changes in stain only on Antitheist and\nPolitical Right. Alt-Right actually showed a slight decrease\nfrom P1 to P2. Despite this, a non-zero stain still existed in\nthe videopage \u2013 absolute percentages at P1 varied between\n5% for Alt-Right and 42% for Political Left. We lastly re-\nmark that, across both homepage and videopage, and across\ntopics and strategies, stain never reached more than half.\nThese findings set us up well for the scrub phase, because\nit assures that our agents will indeed have stain to remove\nwhen they perform their scrubbing strategies.\nStain from watched channels vs. new channels We\nwanted to examine the stain in P2 with more granularity.\nSpecifically, how much of it was from channels the agent had\nexplicitly watched before, and how much was from channels\nthat the agents had never explicitly watched before?\nTo answer this question, we categorized all recommenda-\ntions at point P2 as \u201coff-topic\u201d, \u201con-topic watched-channel\u201d\n(i.e., the agent that collected this recommendation had al-\nready watched a video from the same channel during the\nstain phase), or \u201con-topic new-channel\u201d (i.e., the agent had\nnot watched any videos from the same channel up to that\npoint). Then, for each topic, we found the percentage of rec-\nommendations belonging to each category. We report these\nratios for the homepage and videopage in Table 2.\nOn the homepage, we find that Political Left had the\nmost recommendations from new channels (26%), as well\nas the highest ratio of recommendations from new channels\nto those from watched channels (13:1). On the other hand,\ntheAlt-Right had the smallest new-channel percentage, both\nin absolute terms (5%) and as a ratio of watched-channel\npercentage (\u223c 1:3).\n935\nAlt-Right Antitheism Political Left Political Right\nOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nwatchedOn-\ntopic\nnewOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nwatchedOn-\ntopic\nnewOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nwatchedOn-\ntopic\nnewOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nwatchedOn-\ntopic\nnew\nHomepage 79% 16% 5% 60% 18% 23% 72% 2% 26% 70% 9% 21%\nVideopage 95% 5% 0% 63% 9% 29% 58% 13% 29% 72% 19% 9%\nTable 2: Stain at P2 split into categories of off-topic, on-topic watched-channel, and on-topic new-channel (we omit the word\n\u201cchannel\u201d to save space), for each of homepage and videopage (row) and each topic (column).\nAlt-Right Antitheism Political Left Political Right\nOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nscrubbedOn-\ntopic\nnewOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nscrubbedOn-\ntopic\nnewOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nscrubbedOn-\ntopic\nnewOff-\ntopicOn-\ntopic\nscrubbedOn-\ntopic\nnew\nWatch neutral 90% 8% 2% 74% 14% 12% 78% 2% 20% 82% 6% 12%\nDelete 96% 0% 4% 74% 18% 8% 100% 0% 0% 94% 2% 4%\nDislike 92% 2% 6% 84% 10% 6% 72% 0% 28% 84% 2% 14%\nNot interested 100% 0% 0% 96% 0% 4% 90% 0% 10% 94% 0% 6%\nNo channel 84% 0% 16% 76% 2% 22% 84% 0% 16% 76% 0% 24%\nDislike rec. 90% 2% 8% 80% 0% 20% 76% 0% 24% 64% 4% 32%\nTable 3: Stain at P3 on the homepage split into categories of off-topic, on-topic scrubbed-channel, and on-topic new-channel\n(we omit the word \u201cchannel\u201d to save space), for each of strategy (row) and each topic (column).\nOn the videopage, Political Left andAntitheist had the\nhighest absolute percentage of recommendations from new\nchannels (29%), and Antitheist had the highest ratio of new\nchannel recommendations to those from watched channels\n(\u223c3:1). By contrast, the Alt-Right agents received no recom-\nmendations from new channels (0%) while all other topics\nreceived at least 9%.\nThese findings suggest that the YouTube recommendation\nsystem sometimes plays a role in providing stain to the user\nby not only suggesting content that is from the same channel,\nbut rather by inferring and providing that from different but\nsimilar channels.\n4.4 Result 2: Scrub Phase\nIn this subsection, we answer our questions posed in RQ2.\nEffects of scrub phase We wanted to know whether our\nagents could remove stain after the scrub phase. To ad-\ndress this question, we compared the stain of our agents at\nP2 with those at P3, for each topic, in both homepage and\nvideopage. Again, our data was non-normal and paired, so\nwe ran Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to see whether stain de-\ncreased significantly. Results are again in Table 1 (P2 to P3).\nOn the homepage, Not interested andNo channel were the\nonly strategies that significantly reduced the amount of stain\nacross all topics. Comparing average relative changes be-\ntween P2 and P3, Not interested wins out (-88%). One strat-\negy successfully scrubbed three out of four topics (Delete),\nwhile two strategies were successful in two out of four topics\n(Dislike recommendation andWatch neutral). On the other\nend, the None strategy did not produce any significant effect,\nwhich was expected because it was our control strategy. On\nthe videopage, we did not find any significant scrub phase\neffects.Stain from scrubbed channels vs. new channels We\nwanted to know whether scrubbing strategies removed stain\nin general, or if they only removed the subset of channels\nthe agent had explicitly scrubbed up to that point.\nTo answer this question, for all recommendations at point\nP3, we categorized them as either \u201coff-topic\u201d, \u201con-topic\nscrubbed-channel\u201d (i.e., the agent that collected this rec-\nommendation had already scrubbed a video from the same\nchannel during the scrub phase), or \u201con-topic new-channel\u201d\n(i.e., the agent had not scrubbed a video from the same chan-\nnel up to that point). Notice that these categories are analo-\ngous to watched/new categories made for P2 in Section 4.3.\nThen, for each topic/strategy pairing, we found the ratio\nof recommendations at P3 that belonged to each category.\nWe report these ratios for the homepage in Table 3. We did\nnot examine the videopage because it did not experience any\nsignificant changes in this phase. The None strategy was ex-\ncluded because no videos were scrubbed.\nCategorizing recommendations this way reveals that\nscrubbing strategies behaved differently in removing un-\nwanted recommendations. For instance, in three out of four\ntopics, at least half of the Watch neutral strategy\u2019s re-\nmaining stain at P3 was from scrubbed channels. On the\nother hand, No channel rarely left recommendations from\nscrubbed channels (0-2%); most stain remaining after using\nthis strategy was from new channels. The behavior of No\nchannel agrees with many user perceptions of the \u201cDon\u2019t\nrecommend channel\u201d button (Ricks and McCrosky 2022),\nand matches an intuitive interpretation of the button name.\n936\n5 Survey Study\n5.1 Survey Design\nIn the sock puppet section of our work, we collected data\nfrom simulated users\u2019 interactions with YouTube to quantify\nhow platform features may help remove unwanted recom-\nmendations. In this section, we want to understand better the\nrelationship between real users and these features. We ran a\nsurvey to determine this.\nSurvey overview We first asked whether respondents had\nexperienced getting unwanted recommendations before. Re-\nspondents were specifically asked whether they have experi-\nenced this scenario before: \u201cYou are browsing YouTube, and\nnotice videos recommended to you that you would rather not\nhave recommended (because they are offensive to you, trig-\ngering, not safe for work, or some other reason)\u201d. The but-\ntons we consider are \u201cDelete\u201d (delete a video from watch\nhistory), \u201cDislike\u201d, \u201cNot interested\u201d, and \u201cDon\u2019t recom-\nmend channel\u201d. We asked for respondents\u2019 experiences with\nthese buttons, with respect to three constructs:\n\u2022Awareness: Before taking this survey, were you aware\nthis button existed?\n\u2022Usage: Have you used this button to remove unwanted\nrecommendations?\n\u2022Belief in efficacy: Recall the times when you used this\nbutton to remove unwanted recommendations. How ef-\nfective do you think it was? Please rate from 1 (not at all\neffective) to 5 (completely effective).\nOnly those who have experienced unwanted recommen-\ndations before and were aware of the buttons were asked\nto report on their real usage, while others were given a hy-\npothetical question (\u201cIf you had known this button existed,\nwould you have used it?\u201d). Furthermore, only those who\nwere (1) experienced, (2) aware of button, and (3) have used\nthe button were asked to report their belief in its efficacy\nin removing recommendations, while others were given a\nhypothetical question (\u201cIf you had used this button for this\nscenario, how effective do you think would you find it?\u201d).\nSurvey implementation We recruited 300 participants\nfrom the survey recruitment platform Prolific, and ran the\nsurvey on the survey delivery platform Qualtrics. We se-\nlected participants that had used YouTube before, were\nadults (18+), and resided in the US. Participants were paid\n$15 an hour. The University of Michigan Health Sciences\nand Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board has de-\ntermined that this research is exempt from IRB oversight\n(Study ID: HUM00224551).\nSurveys were pretested with colleagues. We emphasized\nhonest rather than \u201cright\u201d answers so that respondents would\nnot be tempted to \u201cplease\u201d us by saying they knew about\na button when in reality they did not (Paolacci and Chan-\ndler 2014). We included screenshots of buttons so that they\ndidn\u2019t have to know them by name. Since attention checks\nare important to maintaining experimental validity, we also\nimplemented three of them throughout the survey to make\nsure the respondents were focusing on and comprehend-\ning the survey questions. At three separate points, we gavethem a question whose format was identical to that of others\nand instructed them to select a specific choice. For example,\n\u201cPlease select \u2018Dislike\u2019 in the choices below\u201d.\nWe filtered responses by eliminating those from people\nwho failed any of the three attention checks. Respondents\nwere paid regardless of whether they passed or failed atten-\ntion checks. Then, we eliminated responses from anybody\nwho answered \u201cnot sure\u201d to our questions.\n5.2 Survey Analysis Methods and Results\nIn this subsection, we answer the questions posed in RQ3.\nIn total, our survey received 274 responses from those\nwho passed all three attention checks. However, our respon-\ndent sample did not immediately generalize to a more gen-\neral population. Thus we used post-stratification, a popular\nstatistical method that adjusts estimates on non-probability\nsamples (Salganik 2019), to generalize our results to the\nadult YouTube-using population in the US.\nTo perform post-stratification, we divided our respondents\ninto binary genders and age buckets (roughly 20 years apart),\nmaking a total of eight subgroups. We then made estimates\nof each subgroup\u2019s prevalence in the target population by\ncombining Census data on age/gender subgroups (Duffin\n2022) and PEW data on the percentage of each subgroup\nthat use YouTube (Auxier and Anderon 2021). Comparing\nour survey sample\u2019s distribution among subgroups with that\nof the target population revealed that our sample skewed\nyoung: Among usable responses, we routinely over-sampled\nthe 18-45 subgroups and under-sampled 65+ ones. Fortu-\nnately, post-stratification corrects this bias.\nWe report the answers in Table 4. Awareness percentages\nwere calculated by aggregating answers from all respon-\ndents that passed our attention checks. For Usage, we re-\nstricted our calculation to those who were both aware that\nthe feature existed, and had experienced having unwanted\nrecommendations. Belief in efficacy was the most restricted\nbecause we only wanted ratings from those who would be\nwell-informed of its effects from personal usage: Only those\nwho experienced unwanted recommendations, were aware\nthe button existed, and used that button to try to resolve the\nissue, were considered. These population restrictions are ap-\nplied to both the table and our discussion of results.\nMoving onto results, we find for Awareness that survey\nrespondents were most aware of the \u201cDislike\u201d button\u2019s exis-\ntence (93.94%). \u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d was the least\nwell-known (35.37%). As for Usage, they favored \u201cNot in-\nterested\u201d (82.83%) and \u201cNo channel\u201d (80.53%) to remove\nunwanted recommendations when they experienced it. \u201cDis-\nlike\u201d was the least used button (37.75%). Looking at Be-\nlief in efficacy, users found \u201cDelete\u201d (3.76), \u201cNot interested\u201d\n(3.42), and \u201cNo channel\u201d (4.10) all more effective than the\n\u201cDislike\u201d button (2.52).\nThese findings suggest that users do not use the \u201cDislike\u201d\nbutton to remove unwanted recommendations, despite most\nknowing about its existence. Respondents\u2019 intuitions about\nthis button match our empirical findings: We saw in Sec-\ntion 4.3 that the Dislike andDislike recommendation strate-\ngies both reduced less stain compared to other scrubbing\nstrategies (Delete, Not interested, No channel).

Note that Awareness and\nUsage are in the range of 0 to 100% while Belief in efficacy is in a scale of 1 to 5.\nthe button for our (empirically) most effective scrubbing\nstrategy \u2013 \u201cNot interested\u201d \u2013 was highly used by respon-\ndents who knew of it. However, awareness was not univer-\nsal: almost 44% of survey respondents were unaware of its\nexistence.\n6 Discussion\nWe performed an algorithm audit of the YouTube recom-\nmendation system to test whether one could remove un-\nwanted content from their feed. We paired our audit with a\nsurvey to understand whether users actually knew these but-\ntons existed, used them, and believed them to be effective.\nIn our audit, we found that the stain phase produces a sig-\nnificant increase in stain in the homepage across all topics.\nWe also saw that stain at P2 never reached more than half of\nrecommendations in either the homepage or the videopage.\nThese results confirm our initial suspicion that watching\nmany videos from a given topic does not completely \u201csur-\nround\u201d the user with topical recommendations, contrary to\nwhat the term \u201cfilter bubble\u201d would suggest. This motivated\nour usage of the altenative term \u201cstain\u201d.\nContinuing to results from the stain phase, we broke down\nstain at P2 into those from channels watched before and\nthose from channels not watched before. We found that their\nprevalence varied based on topic.\nBoth types of stain were present, but to varying degrees\ndepending on topic. On the one hand, Political Left received\nthe most stain from new channels for both the homepage\nand videopage, demonstrating that the platform had a no-\ntion of topical similarity by \u201cinferring\u201d other channels from\nthe political left that the user may like. On the other hand,\ntheAlt-Right received the least recommendations from new\nchannels, for both the homepage and videopage. This find-\ning is interesting given YouTube\u2019s recent public promises\nto curb misinformation and conspiracy theories (YouTube\n2019), especially \u201dharmful\u201d ones such as Q-Anon (YouTube\n2020), as well as a shift in company-wide attention towards\nstopping home-grown, right-wing extremism from spread-\ning on its platform (Bergen 2022). While the lack of recom-\nmendations from new Alt-Right channels supplied to agents\nwho watch that content could be evidence of YouTube op-\nerationalizing its promises, we cannot formally tell the dif-\nference between that and a general lack of Alt-Right videos\nremaining on the platform today.\nMoving onto the scrub phase, we compared different\nscrubbing strategies and found that Not interested was the\nmost effective one on the homepage: It produced significantdecrease in stain across all topics, and using it resulted in the\ngreatest average decrease in stain from P2 to P3 across topics\n(-88%). This strategy performed well in removing stain from\nboth channels were explicitly scrubbed as well as similar\nones the agent didn\u2019t interact with. Thus, users who would\nlike to remove recommendations from any channels belong-\ning to an unwanted topic should use this strategy.\nIn contrast to homepage findings, we found that the\nvideopage never experienced significant effects from the\nscrub phase. At a cursory glance, it seems that our results\ndisagree with Tomlein et al. (2021)\u2019s finding. In their study,\nagents could significantly reduce conspiratorial recommen-\ndations on the videopage by watching many videos debunk-\ning the conspiracy theory. However, upon further inspection\nit should be noted that in fact we have two separate experi-\nments. Whereas agents in our study collected videopage rec-\nommendations from a video at P3 that was the same as that\nused in P2, their study used a video at P3 that was the se-\nmantic opposite of that of P2. Specifically, Tomlein et al.\n(2021)\u2019s bots collected them from a video promoting agents\u2019\nassigned conspiracy theory at P2, and then collected them\nfrom a video debunking it at P3.\nCombining our findings with those from Tomlein et al.\n(2021) suggests that videopage recommendations may be in-\nfluenced more by the video that is playing at the time recom-\nmendations are shown, than by any prior interactions with\nthe system. The implication for users is that they should\nnot expect any scrubbing strategies to save them from fur-\nther recommendations of an unwanted topic if they keep\nwatching videos of that topic. Rather, they may want to stop\nwatching content from that topic altogether.\nLastly, we wanted to know how users interacted with plat-\nform features in their daily YouTube usage. We found that\nUS adult YouTube users were most aware of the \u201cDislike\u201d\nbutton, yet more empirically effective strategies, such as\n\u201cNot interested\u201d, were lesser known. Those who knew the\n\u201cNot interested\u201d button existed used it at a higher rate and\nsaw it as more effective than those who knew of \u201cDislike\u201d.\nPut together, our sock puppet and survey findings suggest\nthat if YouTube wants to allow users to more effectively re-\nmove unwanted recommendations, it should make its effec-\ntive platform-features for doing so more broadly known to\nthe general YouTube population. Doing so would not only\nbenefit users\u2019 experience; it would also be in the best in-\nterest of the platform because allowing users to have more\nagency to tailor algorithmic decisions to their preferences\ncan build and maintain their trust in the system (Ekstrand\net al. 2015), as well as increase overall satisfaction (Shin\n938\n2020). One implication for platform designers is that they\nshould make buttons such as \u201cNot interested\u201d more widely\nknown by increasing their discoverability on the website. To\nthat end, Ricks and McCrosky (2022) provide a blueprint.\nIn their experiment, they found that when their users were\ndisplayed \u201cDon\u2019t recommend this\u201d buttons prominently and\nclearly on recommendation title cards, instead of being hid-\nden behind a menu or requiring navigation away from their\ncurrent page, they were more than twice as likely to use it\n(Ricks and McCrosky 2022).\nWhile this study demonstrates the benefits of YouTube\u2019s\nuser controls, there still exist challenges to its uptake to re-\nmove unwanted recommendations. First, we note that these\ncontrols could be used to create digital media environ-\nments that run counter to democratic norms of diversity and\nbreadth of perspectives. Thus, policy makers should pay at-\ntention to the potential for user agency to further limit their\ncapacity for and consumption of cross-cutting content.\nSecond, as our survey highlights, knowledge of these\nbuttons is still an issue. Much of the general YouTube-\nusing public was not aware that the \u201cNot interested\u201d but-\nton exists, for example. Even more troubling was that even\nthose who experienced unwanted recommendations recently\n\u2013 thus having ample motivation to discover content removal\ntactics \u2013 still had not become aware of the button.\nThird, user interaction flows from these buttons may vi-\nolate design principles in a way that limits users\u2019 ability to\nfully understand and anticipate the effects of different user\ncontrols (Smith, Bullen, and Huerta 2021). For instance,\nthey found that users were not fully aware of their effects\non recommendations and account settings, and so they shied\naway from using them at all. Further compounding users\u2019\nhesitation to take up these features is the perception that\nsome of their effects are irreversible.\nLastly, the actions that these user control buttons allow\nare responsive, rather than proactive. Users respond to a\npoor recommendation by eliminating it, rather than asking\nYouTube to tailor their recommendations before they see it.\nThus, the worrisome effects of misinformation, toxicity, and\noffensiveness may have already taken their harmful course\nby the time the user decided to eliminate them. Therefore,\nthese features cannot be seen as a substitute for diligent and\nthorough content moderation by the platform.\nEthical statement We now discuss the ethical concerns\nof our study. First, since our sock puppets are computer\nscripted, we do not risk making real users watch potentially\nharmful content, such as those from the Alt-Right channels.\nHowever, making the bots watch a lot of content from a\ngiven topic may still increase its prevalence on YouTube by\nboosting its general popularity. Also, pressing the \u201cDislike\u201d\nbutton on channels may cause them to be demoted in recom-\nmendations, limiting YouTube creators\u2019 ability to generate\nadvertising revenue.\nWhile this is a possibility, we do not find these costs to\noutweigh the benefits of our study. First, we consider the po-\ntential cost to content creators of negative interactions with\nthe system, such as pressing the \u201cDislike\u201d, \u201cNot interested\u201d,\n\u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d, and \u201cDelete from watch his-tory\u201d buttons. Here we note that (a) our bots collectively in-\njected up to 3 such interactions per video, which we expect\nis small compared to the number of \u201cauthentic\u201d ones, (b) we\ncleared all the revertible actions caused by the audit when it\nexited its experimental runs, and (c) the average lifetime of\nan audit in this study is less than six hours, including both\nthe stain phase and scrub phase. This means that not only is\nthe effect of negative interactions small per video, it is also\nboth short-lived and fully reversed.\nAnother potential cost of our study is that our audits\nwould irreversibly alter two public metrics \u2013 total view count\nand total watch time. However, the costs are small because\nwe do not expect to affect videos\u2019 and/or channels\u2019 overall\nprevalence by much because the number of views we are\n\u201cartificially\u201d introducing to the YouTube world are minus-\ncule in relation to the number of \u201cauthentic\u201d views that the\nvideos have received.\nOur study\u2019s findings are a benefit to all YouTube users\nalike, because they can inform users on how best to deal\nwith and get rid of unwanted recommendations. We think\nthese benefits outweigh the minimal harms.\nAs for the survey participants, we must make sure that\nthey are not being put in the way of any harm. Because\nwe did not ask them to view any actual content, but rather\nrecall times in their life in which they had interacted with\nYouTube, we are only at the risk of having participants re-\nvisit potentially-triggering or traumatic events if they have\nhad any. However, we include at our introduction of the sur-\nvey a description of the survey, which describes the ques-\ntions we wanted to ask them. Thus, if a participant expected\nsuch harms to occur to them, they would have not consented\nto the survey, and they would have been removed from the\npanel before seeing any questions.\n7 Conclusion\nWith these results we conclude that different strategies to\nremove unwanted content on the YouTube platform work to\ndifferent degrees, and from our tested strategies we found\nthat using the \u201cNot interested\u201d button was a clear winner.\nHowever, this strategy has not seen widespread adoption\namong users. That is, while those who know about these\neffective buttons get to experience their effective behavior,\n44% of adult YouTube users in the US are not aware that\nthey exist. Thus, we join existing calls for YouTube to am-\nplify more broadly the effective ways to remove unwanted\nrecommendations on its platform.\nLimitations Our findings add to a growing chorus of stud-\nies investigating problematic and unwanted recommenda-\ntions on YouTube. However, our study is not without its lim-\nitations. First, we perform channel-level, rather than video-\nlevel labeling. Performing labeling at this level may result\nin labeling channels as a certain topic even if not all of its\nvideos are of that topic (e.g. an Alt-Right channel sometimes\nposting music videos), or, conversely, labeling a channel as\noff-topic if just a few of its videos are topical (e.g. a sci-\nence vlogger who occasionally talks about their journey to\natheism). However, we are encouraged by the fact that other\nstudies have taken this approach (Tomlein et al. 2021; Chen\n939\net al. 2022). Analyzing channels as a whole is still important\nbecause they indicate a high number of videos of that topic,\nand users may be encouraged to subscribe to these channels\neven if not all videos in the channel are topical.\nAnother limitation is that of generalizing from the partic-\nular settings our sock puppets used. In particular, our sock\npuppets tested just four topics, using geolocation of the US\nEast AWS center in August of 2021. While we found that\ncertain strategies work in these conditions to remove recom-\nmendations, we cannot be sure it does in other conditions.\nNew topics may be harder or easier to scrub due to more\nor less general interest in that topic in the broader YouTube\necosystem, respectively. Our code is publicly available so\nthat we and other researchers may continue to understand\nmore general effects of our scrubbing strategies.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the University of Michi-\ngan Center for Social Media Responsibility.

The first (Anthony, \n2020) analyzed problematic aspects of \u201cblue tribe\u201d consciousness (roughly, the political left) and how those issues are b eing \ninfluenced by the internet, education systems and globalization; as well as civilizational and psycho -spiritual dynamics. This \nsecond article takes a broader perspective, examining both blue and red (roughly, the political right) tribes, and argues th at \nsolutions to the broader problems surrounding the culture wars and its tribalism are unlikely to work successfully without ho nest \nintrospection. To this end, \u201cshadow\u201d work employing processes and insights by introspective psychologists like Carl Jung an d \nmindfulness practitioners Leonard Jacobson and Eckhart Tolle may be helpful, especially if deployed along with other systemic  \ninterventions. Anthony\u2019s (2007, 2010) Harmonic Circles process is briefly described as a specific healing process. Conversely , \nprocesses based only around technological intervention and regulation of behaviour are unlikely to work by themselves, as they  \ntypically do not address deeper psycho -spiritual drivers.  \nIt is argued that introspection and shadow work may help facilitate a mo re effective dialogue with \u201cthe other\u201d by neutralizing \njudgmental projections which tend to dehumanize tribal opponents, while encouraging a more honest appraisal of sources of \nconflict which lie within one\u2019s own group. Finally, it is argued that developin g a strong motivation to transcend the tribal split \nis ideal.  \nKeywords  \nMindfulness, Presence, Culture Wars, Online Conflict, Online Bullying, Healing, Projections, Trauma, Sensemaking, \nRepublicans, Democrats, Blue Tribe, Red Tribe  \nIf you want to know who y ou are, look into the true mirror.

Shakespeare (2010), King Lear, act 2, scene 2. (King Lear, n.d.).  \nIntroduction  \nThe tribal split between the Blue and Red tribes may represent the most divisive and potentially destabilizing conflict \nin the modern western world. As with the first article on this topic (Anthony, 2020) traditional political labels such \nas \u201cliberal,\u201d \u201cleft,\u201d \u201cprogressive,\u201d \u201cpostmodern,\u201d \u201cneo -Marxist,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d \u201cconservative,\u201d \u201clibertarian\u201d and so on \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n34 will be avoided as much as possible. For the purposes of simplicity, I shall refer to the \u201cBlue\u201d (left) and \u201cRed\u201d \n(right) tribes, unless a more specific clarification is required.  \nThe blue/red dichotomy is admittedly an oversimplification of the reality that the culture wars now feature \nmultiple memetic tribes, as Limberg and Barnes (2018) outline. Roughly aligned with the Blue tribe are groups like \nthe establishment left, social ju stice activists, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, Neo -Marxists and far -left radicals like \nAntifa; while aligned with the Red tribe are the establishment right, Benedictines, Christian right, Trumpists, \nInfowarriors and the Alt -right. Then there are centrist gro ups, who might lean a little more one way or the other, but \ntend to span the divide: including the Intellectual Dark Web, Integral Theorists, new atheists, and the rationalist \ndiaspora (Limberg & Barnes, 2018).  \nProgressive and Neo -Marxist ideologies now ty pically dominate Blue -tribe spaces. For example, such language, \nideas and narratives represent a strong curriculum focus of much of our university education systems (especially the \nhumanities and much of the social sciences), and a considerable portion of the mainstream media (Haidt & \nLukianoff, 2018; Murray, 2019; Wilber, 2001). This ideology has its focus upon inequalities and injustices like \nclassism, racism, sexism, sexual identity discrimination issues and so on. Yet while critique of opposing ideologi es \nand groups is a common aspect of the internal narrative within these spaces, such discourses tend to be far less \nanalytical regarding their own ideological biases. Further, there is typically relatively little deep analysis of the tribal \nsplit itself, a nd that divide is no longer an emerging issue, but an extant problem (Anthony, 2020).  \nTo initiate a genuine dialogue amongst competing memetic tribes, we cannot perpetuate inherently divisive and \nblame -based narratives, because these merely exacerbate trib alism. There is a strong need for introspection and \nincreased emotional and psychological maturity. As Daniel Schmactenberger (in Rebel Wisdom, 2019b) has stated, \nunless we master \u201canti -rivalry,\u201d civilizational termination is the most likely outcome. It wo uld be an irony if we \nwere to eliminate all the \u201cisms\u201d of the progressive wish list, only to initiate social collapse under the great social \ndivisions it is helping to engender\u201d (Anthony, 2020).  \nA difficult and cognitively destabilizing restructuring of ou r competing maps of reality will likely be necessitated \n(Limberg & Barnes, 2018). Daniel Schmactenberger (quoted in Darkhorse Podcast, 2021) has argued that we require \nincreased competence in at least three domains of communication with tribal others. Crit ically situating the position \nof that other party is the first and easiest aspect. This can include understanding their political alliance, their \nworldview and paradigmatic foundations. The second domain is the ability to deeply understand and engage with \nthe other, including \u201csteel manning\u201d their position. The third is to be able to reflect deeply upon one\u2019s own biases \nand arguments.  \nPart 1 of this two -part article series (Anthony, 2020) took a multi -factored approach in an attempt to deepen the \nunderstan ding of what drives the online conflict of the culture wars, with a predominant focus on the role of the \nBlue tribe. Sohail Inayatullah\u2019s (2018) Causal Layered Analysis was employed to this end.1 Causal Layered \nAnalysis is a useful analytical tool, and can  also be used to garner more thorough solutions to problems by \nacknowledging their multi -faceted nature; by generating solutions which intervene at more than one level. \nAlternatively, one may wish to think at which level intervention might be most effectiv e.  \nThe factors driving Blue tribe divisiveness uncovered in the first article (Anthony, 2020) made reference to \npsycho -spiritual conceptions. Integral theory and spiral dynamics (Beck, 2018; Wilber, 2001) were used to depict \nthe current conflict as being in part driven by the regression of liberal progressivism from \u201cgreen\u201d meme (collective, \nprogressive, ecological) to a more fundamentalist and intolerant expression, or \u201cmean green\u201d (Beck, 2018; Wilber, \n2001); and this relapse was linked in turn to the pos sibility of unresolved anger and trauma (the shadow). It was \nargued that the Blue tribe in general needs to become more aware of the divisiveness of its language, analytical tools \nand judgmental attitudes. Critical Futures Studies practitioners, who are ar guably generally aligned with Blue tribe \nideology, also need to be mindful here.  \nThat first paper did not examine any equivalent ideological, systemic or psycho -spiritual drivers of the Red tribe \nas that was not its focus. Nonetheless, a host of similar a s well as distinct drivers of tribalism can be cited or \nspeculated in that group: including common historical and technological drivers; information and media systems; \nand differing values, religious predilections, nationalism and so on.  \nThis current paper  outlines several possible approaches to resolving the tribal split. It will take a trans -tribal \napproach, addressing the need for dialogue and healing, and the argument shall be that this is relevant to both Red \nand Blue tribes, as peace is preferable to perpetual conflict and violence.  \n \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n35 Due to the multifaceted drivers of the culture wars, interventions attempting to reduce or heal the conflict will \nideally need to address more than a single driver. Merely intervening at more superficial levels, such as th e \ntechnological or educational, will likely fail to address the deeper dimensions of the problem. Comprehensive \nsolutions to complex problems should ideally address as many levels of the problem as possible (Inayatullah, 2018).  \nThe process employed in this  paper  moves in a general sense from the more obvious and oft -stated aspects of the \nproblem (the litany), through successively deeper and more subtle systems, worldview aspects then myth -metaphor \nlevels. This is in accordance with Inayatullah\u2019s (2018) Caus al Layered Analysis. Yet the focus will be towards the \ndeeper levels, especially the possible benefits of introspection and mindfulness. This shall include the idea of the \n\u201cshadow\u201d (following the teachings of Jung (1995)) and current mindfulness practition ers like Leonard Jacobson \n(2009) and Eckhart Tolle (2009). The author\u2019s Harmonic Circles process (Anthony, 2007, 2010)  is also introduced \nas a practical shadow work tool.  \nThe analysis below begins first by introducing several rather obvious possible processes which might help to \naddress the more superficial, extant expressions of the online culture wars.  \nOngoing Questioning of the Media  \nMuch of formal traditional media (as well as social media) is deeply polarized, and many netizens glean their news \npredominantly from one or just a few in -tribe sources (Brenan, 2019; Kalmore & Mason, 2019; Haidt, 2012). Given \ntheir increasing unreliability and bipartisan narratives, the present widespread mistrust of media and social media \nspokespersons is not unwarran ted, nor irrational. Further, it appears that a shift in the tribal nature of media is \nunlikely in the near future. Therefore, in the present culture it is up to the netizen to assume greater responsibility \nfor their online behaviour and to develop a deepe r questioning attitude towards information sources, including an \nawareness of how best to do that.  \nFirstly, political bias of most large and medium -sized news sources can be identified via web searches. There are \nmany sites which can be employed to this e nd, including All Sides (allsides.com); Media Bias/Fact Check \n(mediabiasfactcheck.com); and The Media Bias Chart (adfontmedia.com).  \nA useful further source is Media Cloud (mediacloud.org), which can produce word clouds associated with a \ntopic. By entering  a media company name and other specific terms, a word cloud is generated which can give the \nsearcher a sense of the focus of the media site\u2019s content. Of course, a problem with such sources is that they may \nthemselves be partisan, suggesting a need to che ck more than one evaluation service.   \nAnother simple way to challenge the filter bubble (Pariser, 2011) (thus ensuring that a given netizen\u2019s media bias \nis also challenged) is for her to deliberately check alternative news sources for reports on the same story. This habit \ncan be facilitated by setting one\u2019s news feeds to multiple sources. Google alerts can be utilized to this effect, by \nincluding key words that name different media sources: for example \u201cTrump impeachment AND CNN,\u201d \u201cTrump \nimpeachment AND Fo x News.\u201d More sophisticated word groupings can be imagined to provide more specific \nresults.  \nA destabilization of worldview will probably follow a new habit of habitually questioning and checking multiple \nsources of news for credibility. It is possible tha t it might also create a certain degree of cynicism towards not just \nthe media, but towards one\u2019s own country or civilization. Many netizens older than the millennial generation will \nstill be able to recall what it was like to hold a greater (though imperf ect) trust in mainstream media organisations, \nwhom they were able to view as generally truthful. Yet the situation has changed. An attitude of careful discretion \nshould ideally be applied to all media organizations.  \nThe suggested processes above are relat ively common sense. However, they are best employed alongside some \nof the deeper \u201csolutions\u201d suggested below. Without motivation and introspection, it is unlikely many will choose to \nemploy them rigorously.  \nStrategic Withdrawal  \nThere is a very simple indi vidual behavior which would likely alleviate a great deal of the issues surrounding the \nonline culture wars. This is simply reducing one\u2019s time spent online, or at least in unhealthy online spaces. An \nindividual can begin by identifying which sites and thi nkers to avoid by asking precise questions. Is there a diversity \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n36 of voices and opinions on the site? Is the culture of the site one of respectful engagement with those with differing \nviewpoints? Is the site run by someone with an attitude of tribalistic ag gression, or has it been overrun by such \nnetizens? If the answer is that the web space is tribalistic, the netizen can simply choose to avoid it, and find a more \nreliable source of news or information.  \nAnother simple self -test which the author has develope d and written about (Anthony, 2014) merely requires a \nmoment of introspection. If in any given moment the netizen is triggered into anger and judgment, this can be viewed \nas \u201ca diminishment of consciousness,\u201d as opposed to an expansion into greater opennes s and receptivity towards \nothers, their thoughts and beliefs. The key is recognizing when one\u2019s \u201cneed for drama\u201d2 is escalating. The following \nmay be associated with that.  \n\uf0b7 Wishing to immediately correct the opinion of another (rather than engage them).  \n\uf0b7 Noting that you are carrying some anger, judgment or anxiety as you enter an online space. This increases \nthe likelihood for projection of that emotion onto others. The key is to assume responsibility for the emotion, \nby whatever means possible. Presence tech niques, \u201cnoticing\u201d (Jacobson, 2009) and broader emotional \nhealing and shadow work can be useful here, as will be expanded upon below.  \n\uf0b7 A sense of destructive ill -will towards the other, and a desire to ridicule or shame them. Monitoring oneself \nfor a desire  to curse the other (including literally to swear at them) is one simple test. The pejorative labels \nreferred to in the first article on online tribalism (Anthony, 2020) are often indicators of projection: \u201cfascist\u201d, \n\u201calt-right\u201d, \u201clibtard\u201d and so on. Even terms like \u201cracist\u201d, \u201csexist\u201d, \u201cbigot\u201d and the like are often delivered \nwith a sense of disgust at the other, a desire to shame and belittle them.  \nModerating the amount of time one spends online is not complicated. It simply takes motivation and self -\ndiscipline. Clearly, if one not only eliminates the language of projection, but also withdraws from online space when \nthe need for drama arises, the potential to engage in online drama and tribalism diminishes dramatically. The \nquestion then becomes, \u201cAm I pre pared to do that?\u201d Here the issue of \u201cintentionality\u201d arises (which will be discussed \ntowards the end of this article). In turn, we may have to address the possibility that there is an addiction factor in \nour online behaviour, and addiction is one of the p rime drivers of the online culture wars (Limberg & Barnes, 2018).  \nRebuilding Trust in Media and Social Media  \nGiven the dramatic decline in media trust (Brenan, 2019) the formal (as opposed to social) media of both Blue and \nRed tribes must consciously and deliberately work to rebuild trust. To do this it seems likely that they must bring \ngreater self -reflection on  the unhealthy and often destructive culture that they are now driving (tribalism, constant \nspin, clickbaiting, and a marked decline in ethics including attempts to influence democratic political outcomes via \nextreme bipartisanship) (Brichacek, 2018). Yet many mainstream media organizations continue to present \nthemselves as objective purveyors of truth. This attitude must pass if they are to become a trusted part of the future \nof public information.  \nTo regain public trust, traditional public media must idea lly first acknowledge the tribalistic nature of \u201cthe news,\u201d \nand admit how they now commonly violate their prior norms and reasonable standards of journalistic integrity \n(Brichacek, 2018; Anthony, 2020). Media outlets should thus become more transparent abo ut their own narratives. \nThis is similar to what Limberg and Barnes (2018) call \u201cclean bias,\u201d where netizens and organizations acknowledge \ntribal and ideological affiliations. Such a shift would ideally bring covert elements of the \u201cdrama\u201d into open \ndiscou rse and facilitate a shift in focus towards solutions. Less energy would then theoretically be spent in the \ndrama3 of conspiracy theory and projection, and more on actual newsworthy issues, as well as generating the spirit \nof cooperation required to focus upon their resolution.  \nThe shift might require what Limberg and Barnes call \u201ca Culture War equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath.\u201d This \ncould be affirmed by the leaders of the memetic tribes, and other netizens.  \nIt would prove beneficial if journalists, autho rs, bloggers, and professors alike took this oath, but any \nsocial media user could take the oath, by pledging their name and accepting some sort of e -badge. \nPromises can be broken, but breaking public promises can generate swift social feedback.  \nWhat would  this Oath consist of? At the bare minimum: a commitment to good faith dialogue, the \nprinciple of charity, and intellectual humility. The last virtue is critical. A caveat of \u201cI could be wrong\u201d \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n37 underlying strongly held beliefs helps even the most difficult  conversations, a shared commitment to that \ncaveat helps even more (Limberg & Barnes, 2018, Hippocratic Oath of the Cultural War section).  \nThe question then becomes, what motivation do individuals and organisations have to transcend \u201coutrage porn\u201d \nand prod uce more socially responsible content?  \nBroader Initiatives  \nIn the first of these two articles (Anthony, 2020), it was argued that there has been an escalation of bigotry and \nprojection involved in the online conflict within the culture wars. It may be usef ul to frame such bigotry at political \nand ideological opponents as equally serious to that of racism, sexism and discrimination based on sexual \norientation, which now dominates much of progressive discourse. In doing so, we might begin to take it seriously . \nThe increase in abuse and projection have led to much regulation on mainstream news websites, and effectively \nto the outlawing of much offensive language (varying from site to site). Should such censorship be extended to \nterms like \u201cfascist\u201d, \u201cCommunist/ commie\u201d, \u201cNazi\u201d, \u201chater\u201d, \u201cSJW\u201d and \u201clibtard\u201d? What about \u201cracist\u201d, \u201csexist\u201d \nand even the word \u201cbigot\u201d itself, given that \u201cbigoteering\u201d (Ferris, 2016) has become almost pervasive?  \nIt should be noted that the identification  of human behavior as racist, sex ist, bigoted or even fascist is not \nintrinsically \u201cimmoral,\u201d and it is difficult to imagine any legal/moral code which does not operate without moral \njudgments. Instead, it is the misappropriation of these terms by many in the general public (and also by s ome \ninstitutions) that is problematic. Individuals often use the terms above for petty projection; while organizations, \nleaders and politicians may weaponize them for purposes of power and control: to gain moral superiority over \nopponents, and to discredit  them (Anthony, 2020; Haidt, 2012; Haidt & Lukianoff, 2018; Limberg & Barnes, 2018; \nMurray, 2019).  \nYet the regulation of language will probably have very limited effect on bridging the tribal divide. The limitations \nof regulation have been witnessed in mul tiple contexts across many locations on the internet, including more \nauthoritarian expressions as found in Communist China (Chen & Yang, 2018). As in China, netizens elsewhere will \nprobably find ways to get around the system, and the insults and tribal con flict will likely continue. Further, \ncensorship will do little to heal the deeper historical and systemic issues which underpin online conflict between the \nBlue and the Red tribes. Thus, censorship is probably a limited means of \u201ccorrecting\u201d the tribal spl it. \nFurther, the prospect of any wide -scale intervention returns us to one of the key drivers of the culture wars. \nAttempts at social engineering can easily backfire, as we have seen with the intersectionality, which has become an \nunintended focus of the c ulture wars (Anthony, 2020; Murray, 2019; Wilber, in Rebel Wisdom, 2019a). Many in \nthe general public have lost trust in governments, education systems and the media (Anthony, 2020), and winning \nback that trust will be no easy task. Whom do we trust to cre ate and implement the policies? Such political bodies \nwould need to demonstrate trustworthiness, and a high degree of impartiality.  \nFurther, what should be done with those individuals and groups within society that do not comply with social \nreconstruction policy initiatives? This has historically been a factor which has driven the greatest evils associated \nwith utopian -socialist ideologies. Communism sent at least 100 million humans to early graves in the twentieth \ncentury (Hicks, 2004), and the physical an d mental suffering it inflicted on humanity is arguably greater than any \nother political ideology in history. Inevitably, a certain proportion of any society will not wish to come on board \nwith a specific major social re -engineering project, and that numbe r may be large. If governments pass laws \nregulating online behavior and language, how severe should the penalties for violations be? How might civil \ndisobedience movements be dealt with? The question of what is \u201cmoral\u201d is always contestable, but not always  easy \nto define.  \nBeyond any kind of policy intervention in education or society, there is nothing stopping self -motivated groups \nand organisations from developing communities which seek to bridge the tribal split. Moral psychologist Jonathan \nHaidt (Haidt, 2012; Haidt & Lukianoff, 2018) has done exactly this at his Heterodox Academy \n(www.heterodoxacademy.org), now an online community of more than 2 500. It seeks to improve education and \npublish scholarly articles relevant to issues associated with developing \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d It also contains online \ndiscussion areas where netizens can engage in \u201cconstructive disagreement.\u201d  \nOther organisations seeking to resolve online conflict include the OpenMind platform (www.openmind.org, \nwhich employs psychology to de polarise campuses, organisations and communities); the Authentic Relating and \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n38 Circling Movement (which provides spaces for developing greater relating skills) (Limberg & Barnes, 2018); and \nDaniel Schmactenberger\u2019s The Consilience Project (www.civilizationr esearchinstitute.org, which seeks to identify \nprocesses and technologies to bridge tribal divides).  \nHowever, it appears at the present time that such communities are few, and their impact limited. This suggests a \ntroubling lag in the acknowledgement of ho w serious the cultural split is, and how our institutions have descended \ninto pathological cultural decline (Anthony, 2020). There is not yet a genuine intentionality within many institutions \nto introspect and address their part in the issue.  \nBeing Present  with Uncomfortable Ideas  \nIt is clear that for there to be any reduction in online tribalism, we need to individually cultivate the intention to \nunderstand the other. This will necessitate active listening and empathy. Trish Hall (2019) outlines a process \ndeveloped by psychiatrist Richard Friedman, one which has the goal of facilitating empathy. The process begins by \ncarefully observing the individual you wish to communicate with, and identifying something they stated or did that \nyou are in disagreem ent wit h or do not understand. The second step is to identify two different explanations \nregarding why they may have come to their conclusions. The questioner then should invite the other person to share \nas much as possible regarding their experience. It is impor tant that the questioner not communicate their opinion \nabout what the other person has said (Hall, 2019). The purpose here is to open one\u2019s mind to another\u2019s perspective, \nto understand them and to learn as much as possible without internal or verbal editor ial. Judgment is thus suspended. \nHall (2019) suggests that the interrogator should persist even if such understanding is not immediately cognised.  \nHall (2019) also describes a second empathetic facilitation method originally developed by Sean Blanda, whic h \nHall refers to as \u201cControversial Opinion.\u201d With this process, the individual is not permitted to argue, persuade or \ntry to win, merely to ask questions regarding why the other person feels the way they do. When confronted by ideas \nor facts that contradic t your viewpoint, the ideas should not be dismissed, merely reflected upon. The process can \nhelp us understand that groups are rarely as homogenous as assumed, and allows others to express controversial \nviews, whereas a more confrontational approach makes sharing less comfortable. Hall states that a second goal of \nthe controversial opinion technique is to \u201cget people feeling comfortable with the idea that they can be in the \npresence of an idea they dislike\u201d (Hall, 2019, p. 98).  \nGiven the current polarised p olitical and social climate, we need to improve the way we interact with others, \nincluding those we disagree with, and the kinds of listening processes outlined here may be conducive to that end.  \nMindfulness  \nThe discussion now moves a little deeper into th e psycho -spiritual aspects of the problem at hand. Mindfulness has \ngained much traction in educational and corporate sectors in recent years, and has been promoted as means to help \nfix numerous psychological social, cultural and ailments (Davis & Hayes, 20 12). It is a potentially powerful tool for \nthose wishing to assume more responsibility for their mental experience and develop greater self -awareness. It can \nbe applied to online experience just as well as to the \u201creal -world.\u201d  \nA related process follows th e work of Leonard Jacobson (2009). His teaching centers on the intention to \u201cawaken \nfrom the mind,\u201d and reflects Jacobson\u2019s own spiritual journey, having studied and applied many of the \n\u201cenlightenment\u2019 teachings of Eastern traditions, as well as several we stern mystical traditions. For Jacobson, \n\u201cawakening\u201d is the awareness that identification with the contents of \u201cthe mind\u201d hinders understanding of the deeper \nspiritual nature of \u201cself.\u201d  \nIt is not necessary to adopt Jacobson\u2019s spiritual worldview to utilise  his mindfulness process. His is a very simple \nteaching, and relatively easy to apply. As Jacobson (2009) notes, \u201cawakening\u201d from the mind requires two essential \nsteps.  \nThe first is developing the capacity for mindful attention. This can be done simply by  bringing focused attention \nto the breath, a part of the body; or alternatively an external object (such as a flower, candle or shoe). This is a \nrelaxed focus, not a forceful concentration (Jacobson, 2009). One may also notice without judgment or censure \nthoughts and feelings as they arise in the mind and body.  \nYet according to Jacobson, this first \u201cnoticing\u201d step is insufficient for \u201cawakening\u201d to occur. The second step is \nbeing able to maintain that state at will, including overcoming any psychological or  \u201cspiritual\u201d issues that may \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n39 impede the process. That motivation or willingness is something that only the practitioner can provide. Typically, \nfor spiritual practitioners such a motivation is the presence of a significant amount of suffering in the person \u2019s life \n(but not always). For those seeking simpler goals, such as reducing online conflict, the motivation may be more \nmundane.  \nEckhart Tolle\u2019s (2009) teaching is similar to Jacobson\u2019s, reflecting a perennial wisdom that is gleaned from \nmeditative and min dful practice. Like Jacobson, Tolle suggests that disidentification from the sense of \u201cself\u201d is key \nto transcending the drama that can emerge from conflict with others.  \nSomebody says something to you that is rude or designed to hurt. Instead of going into unconscious \nreaction and negativity, such as attack, defense, or withdrawal, you let it pass right through you. Offer \nno resistance. It is as if there is nobody there to get hurt anymore (Tolle, 201 8). \nThe rationale and effect of such practice is simple en ough.  \nNoticing judgment  \nJudging others (including demanding that they introspect, without subsequent self-introspection) is perhaps the most \ncommon source of interpersonal conflict, a truth that has long been recognized by psychologists and mental health \npractitioners. In Jacobson\u2019s (2009) teachings, judgments are typically seen as the mind\u2019s attempt to \u201cannihilate\u201d the \nother. To be rid of the other\u2019s perspective permits the mind to rest comfortably within whatever narrative or reality \nconstruction it has come to prefer. Judgments are mental constructs that may also prevent us from being present \nwith others. If this idea is applied to online conflicts, using dehumanizing labels may have the unconscious intention \nto effectively \u201celiminate\u201d the other, so that  we do not have to engage their ideas, nor consider the possibility that we \nmay be wrong.  \nJacobson (2009) advocates bringing awareness (attention) to the destructive intentions which may underpin \njudgments. This potentially improves relationships and faci litates greater psychological maturity. It invites the \ndeeper states of embodied presence which Jacobson sees as essential to \u201cawakening.\u201d Jacobson\u2019s \u201cnoticing\u201d process \nis simple. It is developing an attitude of detachment from thought by simply observing what arises in the mind, \nwithout judgment and without trying to eliminate the thought. In this way, the power of the thought is diminished. \nJacobson\u2019s awakening process is predicated on the capacity for developing a persistent state of present -mindedness. \nHe maintains that there is a requirement for ongoing self -discipline, focus and intention. The state of \u201cpresence\u201d has \nto be valued above such other cognitive experiences as emotional projection, online conflict and personal drama.  \nThe Ghost Watcher  \nA spe cific mindfulness tool which utilises visualisation has been created by the author. \u201cThe Ghost Watcher\u201d \n(Anthony, 2021) draws on the introspective traditions. It is a disruptive tool, designed to enhance cognitive \nresponsibility by imagining oneself (and o ne\u2019s online dramas) from a distance. \u201cThe Ghost\u201d refers to the chattering \nvoice within the mind. The process is outlined as follows (Anthony, 2021).  \nWhen you find yourself engaging in mental role playing (\u201cthe drama\u201d)\u2026 stop and bring yourself into \nthe pres ent moment by feeling your feet on the floor, or focusing upon an object in the room (or place) \nyou find yourself. Alternatively, take a breath or two and focus upon that.  \nClose your eyes (if the situation grants that possibility) and imagine that you (as \u201cthe witness\u201d) are sitting \nin front of a big screen, say in a movie theatre\u2026  \nNow, imagine yourself and your mental adversary appearing on the screen. Visualise yourself sitting \nclose to the \u201ccamera\u201d (the foreground), with the other person (or people) sitti ng a little further away, \ntowards the background, facing you. Alternatively, you might imagine both \u201cyou\u201d and the other party \nsitting facing each other on the screen, from side on.  \nBegin by replaying, word for word, what you have just been imagining in \u201cth e drama,\u201d on the big screen \nbefore you. As witness, see \u201cyourself\u201d from the third person perspective saying to the other person the \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n40 precise words that have just been rummaging through your head. Hear the words clearly, and make sure \nyou get the correct  tone\u2026 You can observe this situation for a minute or so.  \nNext, let the \u201ccamera\u201d switch to being behind your opponent. See him/her looking at \u201cyou\u201d (The Ghost). \nImagine yourself as he/she/they, watching and listening to your \u201cGhost.\u201d Listen to both parties say ing \nwhatever you imagined them saying in the original drama\u2026  \nAgain, keep that witnessing position for at least a minute.  \nIs there anything that you (as witness) can see differently from these distanced perspectives? You  might \nlike to consider the followin g. \n\uf0b7 How does the drama look to you from a distance?  \n\uf0b7 Are you comfortable with what you have just witnessed? Why or why not?  \n\uf0b7 Is the drama really necessary?  \n\uf0b7 What would you like to change?  \n\uf0b7 Is the perspective of your Ghost really your own? Or does it mirror that  of a media, social media, political \nor tribal group?  \n\uf0b7 Do different perspectives (than that of your Ghost) better embody your Authentic Self?  \n\uf0b7 Does the drama reflect your highest values? How can you better align your mental space with your Authentic \nSelf?  \n\uf0b7 Are there alternative mental spaces that you would prefer to inhabit, other than the internal drama you have \njust been witnessing? How might you better establish those mental spaces? (Anthony, 2021)  \n \nMuch of the value of The Ghost Watcher lies in the disruption of the Ghost\u2019s dialogue. In choosing to observe \nthe Ghost, the practitioner is developing the capacity to witness the mind without being controlled by it. The ideal \nrelationship with the Ghost i s that of a gentle but firm parent. The key is to develop the right relationship with the \nmind, and to shape it as best one can. The essence is to stop for a moment and observe the thinking mind. The Ghost \nWatcher has the potential to pull our minds out of  the collective mindscapes of the internet.  \nMindfulness is not enough  \nThere are many studies which suggest the positive benefits that mindfulness can have in reducing rumination and \nstress, improving focus, and boosting working memory (Davis & Hayes, 2012 ). Most significantly, Ortner, Kilner, \n& Zelazo (2007) found mindfulness meditation reduces emotional reactivity while increasing cognitive flexibility. \nFurther, Siegel (2007) showed that a capacity for improved self -observation is enhanced by mindful atte ntion; while \nthere is evidence that meditation activates brain regions correlated with greater adaptive response to stress (Cahn & \nPolich, 2006; Davidson, Jackson & Kalin, 2000). Notably the latter is associated with more rapid recovery to \nbaseline after n egative provocation (Davidson et al., 2000).  \nYet it would be na\u00efve to suggest that mindfulness is the ultimate \u201ccure\u201d for the culture wars. There are \nmindfulness studies which suggest the limitations of the practice (Davis & Hayes, 2012). For example, nega tive \neffects are reported in about eight per cent of those who are prescribed mindfulness as therapy, including an increase \nin depression or anxiety, and even suicidal impulses or psychotic episodes. Yet there are also downsides to \npharmaceutical intervent ion and more traditional forms of psychoanalysis, including worsening of the mental or \nbehavioral problems being addressed (Wilson, 2020).  \nFurther, a recent study found that mindfulness practice has no significant effect in increasing tolerance in relation  \nto political discourse (Petersen & Mitkidis, 2019). The study drew its conclusions from short, fifteen -minute \nmindfulness sessions. It found that that mindfulness would likely have limited effect on \u201cgenerating desirable \npolitical outcomes.\u201d  \nNotably, howe ver, Petersen and Mitkidis (2019) make no allowance for Jacobson\u2019s (2009) second step in the \n\u201cawakening\u201d process: a deep intention to stay in the mindful state by continuing to apply the simple methods \ninvolved in step one. And it is this intentionality wh ich is crucial, as discussed below.  \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n41 Therefore, despite their probable benefits, mindfulness practices have limitations in their capacity to help heal \nthe tribal divide. It is unlikely that large numbers of those netizens ensnared in the culture wars will independently \ndevelop the intention to utilize the relevant processes and tools. Nonetheless, it can be speculated that if key figures \nand leaders involved in political and ideological online disputes can adopt and promote such processes, there may \nbe a tr ickledown effect. Finally, if more educational institutions and media groups can deliberately share the wisdom \nof meditative and mindfulness traditions, while addressing the limitations mentioned above, the impact of \nmindfulness interventions can be optimi zed. \nMindful presence has a rarely recognized further limitation. Once the mind is stilled and attention moves deeply \ninto the body, unpleasant and painful thoughts and feelings which have been repressed may begin to arise (Jacobson, \n2009). The discussion now delves deeper into the human psyche, into the unknown country of the shadow, where \nwe may find there is a necessity for personal or group healing.  \nHarmonic Circles and shadow work  \nBeyond systemic interventions in the online culture wars such as censors hip, \u201cre -education\u201d or the dialogical, and \neven beyond the empathic and mindful, we may encounter processes which engage the deeper realms of the human \npsyche.  \nThe Jungian idea of the shadow (Jung, 1995, 2014) finds that the mind is deep, and contains unpl easant aspects \nwhich we may not readily care to acknowledge, both to ourselves and others. An essential claim here is that the \nunconscious drives much of human behavior. This includes projections, whereupon we may transfer our denied \nmotivations and feelin gs onto others. Similar conceptions can be found in many psychological and spiritual \nteachings today (Jacobson, 2009; Myss, 1998 ; Tolle, 2009; Grof, Grof , & Kornfield, 2020).  \nThe process of Harmonic Circles (Anthony, 2007, 2010) is an attempt to bring shad ow work into conflict \nresolution (personal and group), and to deepen self -reflection. The aim is to bring unconscious or barely \nacknowledged cognitive structures into awareness, where they can be \u201cowned,\u201d thus helping one to pull out of the \n\u201cdrama\u201d that pr ojections tend to engender. The introductory Harmonic Circles process described here involves five \nsteps. 4 \n1. Relaxation and opening  \n2. Embodying the shadow  \n3. Writing  \n4. Witnessing without judgment  \n5. Reflection and future actions  \nThe author was inspired to create the  Harmonic Circles process from his experience with healing groups upon \nhis personal healing journey. That exploration has included psycho -drama, inner child work, and emotional -cathartic \nhealing. Inspiration for such work has included the teachings of medi cal intuitive Carolyn Myss (1998) and \npsychologist John Bradshaw (1990).5 \nThe Harmonic Circles method in more detail  \nHarmonic Circles relies on a stream of consciousness process. Central to the author\u2019s personal understanding is that \nconsciousness is not l ocalised in brains, but is contained in effective fields of cognition. Such awareness can be \ntermed \u201cintegrated intelligence\u201d (Anthony, 2008, 2014). There are parallels with the idea of spiritual intelligence, \nhowever the construct of integrated intelligen ce is more precise. It details cognitive applications such as intuitive \nsynthesis, evaluation, diagnosis, foresight and deep empathy (Anthony, 2011).  Integrated intelligence entails \nconceptions of consciousness found in \u201calternative science\u201d circles such as Dean Radin\u2019s (2006) \u201cnon -local mind\u201d \nand Rupert Sheldrake\u2019s (2013) \u201cextended mind.\u201d 6 The transpersonal aspect of mind is significant, because if \nintegrated intelligence is extant, it means that intuitive perception may be able to bridge the gap between  the knower \nand the known. Nonetheless, the Harmonic Circles process can be employed without any particular belief in \nintegrated intelligence.  \nThe following represent the five steps of Harmonic Circles in more detail.  \n \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n42 Relaxation and opening  \nIt is strongly  recommended that the practitioner finds a private space for the Harmonic Circles process. The space \nshould be big enough for the individual to move around. Something to write with and on is required, such as an A4 \nsized piece of paper or a notebook, and a  pen or pencil.  \nPrivacy is essential. Shadow work is confronting not only for the practitioner, but if witnesses do not understand \nthe process it may result in further unhelpful conflict. It is also difficult to give voice to dark projections when \nuntraine d others are watching.  \nThe practitioner should sit quietly and then bring their attention to their breath, surrendering to the process. If \ndesired, the individual may say a small prayer to the universe, perhaps, \u201cAllow whatever needs to be brought forth \nto be witnessed with love and without judgment. Let there be full responsibility for whatever emerges.\u201d  \nEmbodying the shadow  \nThe practitioner should draw a large circle on their piece of paper or notebook. The space within the circle will \nrepresent the proje ctions and attitudes of the practitioner (and/or his or her tribe). A heading should be put above \nthe circle. In this current article the focus is upon the tribal split, so the practitioner could choose a category of \n\u201cother\u201d that they know is triggering. T his might be: \u201cMe to Trump supporters,\u201d \u201cMe to liberals,\u201d \u201cMe to Brexiteers\u201d \nor so on. They should relax and imagine  facing the other party, then proceed to permit verbal and emotional \nexpression towards the other, without censure. This can include any jud gments, projections, blame or anger. If \npreferred, the person can imagine being their entire tribe, and giving embodiment to group consciousness. In line \nwith the concept of integrated intelligence (Anthony, 2008), an individual can embody the consciousnes s fields of \ngroups.  \nThe simplest way to tap into the shadow is to begin to embody and verbalise judgments towards the other. The \npractitioner can get up and move around. The individual should let go of the need for control or self -censorship, and \nallow the ir hands and body to express their genuine feelings. Ideally, they should witness what occurs impersonally, \nand without judgment of themself . They should spend no more than about five minutes on this part. The ideal is to \nobserve the shadow, not to expand it! \nThe following common projections can help facilitate the process. The practitioner might like to print them on a \npiece of paper, then act out and verbalise those which they feel drawn to. Note: the individual might find swearing \nhelpful in triggering t he shadow, but not everyone curses, so such words can be left out if preferred.  \n\uf0b7 I hate it when you (people)\u2026  \n\uf0b7 I/We hate you because\u2026  \n\uf0b7 You (people) are evil because\u2026  \n\uf0b7 Why do you (people) always\u2026?  \n\uf0b7 Why do you (people) never\u2026?  \n\uf0b7 You are (all) nothing but...  \n\uf0b7 I am/W e are better than you (people) because\u2026  \n\uf0b7 Look at you, you are (all) so damn\u2026!  \n\uf0b7 You (people) are so damn stupid, because\u2026  \n\uf0b7 You are disgusting because\u2026  \n\uf0b7 What I\u2019d really like to do to you (people) is\u2026  \nThere are any number of possible projections that might emerg e, but these kinds of phrases can get the process \nmoving. The practitioner should then return to their seated position, after they feel they have expressed the essence \nof their emotional projections towards the other.  \nWriting  \nNext, the practitioner can wri te down into the circle the main projections that they just verbalized or acted out. The \nfollowing examples (Fig . 1) are some possible common projections.  \n \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n43  \nFig. 1: Possible projections using the Harmonic Circles tool  \nA common finding is that one has an agenda for power and control over the other: to silence, deceive, lie, cheat, \nset the other up for failure or humiliation and so on.  \nWitnessing without judgment  \nThe key to the integration and healing process is to be ab le to observe the projections of the other without judgment \nor turning the process into some kind of drama. For this reason, a vital part of the process is returning to mindful \npresence after the embodiment process is complete. The practitioner should ther efore sit quietly before the circle \nthey have written in. They should relax and focus on their breath till they feel quiet and present. Then they can bring \ntheir attention to the contents of the circle.  \nThe ideal process at this point involves both creati ve imagination and prayer/affirmation, and it typically looks \nsomething like the following. The practitioner can modify this in any way that preserves the essence of the process, \nwith imagery and vocabulary which feels comfortable.  \nClose your eyes for a mo ment, then focus upon your breath. Allow connection with your body and \nfeelings. Do not try to get rid of them. Simply be present with them.7 Next, open your eyes and bring \nattention to the Harmonic Circle. Imagine a white of light -blue light coming from y our heart and \nilluminating the circle. Feel a sense of love and forgiveness for the thoughts and feelings therein. It may \npay to imagine your \u201copponent\u201d being present with you. Acknowledge your part in the drama. \u201cI now \nsee that I have held these thoughts and feelings towards you, and it is my intention to assume \nresponsibility for them.\u201d You might like to ask for forgiveness from the other, or perhaps from your \npreferred higher power. You might like to utter or internalize words like: \u201cLet there be love, l et there be \nforgiveness, let there be healing.\u201d This may be done for a minute or longer, whereupon you may express \ngratitude, perhaps by saying \u201cThank you.\u201d Then return attention to your breath, and your body. When \nyou feel centered and relaxed, you can en d the session.  \n\nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n44 What the practitioner does with the actual piece of paper and the writing is up to them. They might symbolically \nfold it or tear it up and put it in the rubbish bin. Or they could place it somewhere where they could later return to \nit, and o nce again work at receiving its contents without judgment.  \nThe Harmonic Circles process is not meant to be a cure -all for one\u2019s inner torment, but for those who develop \nfamiliarity with such shadow work, it can be very freeing. For as Jacobson (2009) note s - as did Jung (2014) - once \nthe dark side of the mind is seen and brought to light, and when one sees that it has little or no control over us, we \ncan begin to move into deeper levels of relaxed presence. To quote Jung:  \nFilling the conscious mind with id eal conceptions is a characteristic of Western theosophy, but not the \nconfrontation with the shadow and the world of darkness. One does not become enlightened by \nimagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The later procedure, however , is \ndisagreeable and therefore not popular. (Jung, 2014, Para. 335)  \nCommon issues with shadow work  \nNeedless to say, shadow work such as Harmonic Circles may not be a very pleasant inner exploration. It is \nuncomfortable and confronting, by definition. Inde ed, it is recommended only for those who have previously done \nsome kind of deep introspective or shadow work. The cognitive shock for those employing the method without \nguidance may be psychologically unsettling.  \nThe prime function of shadow work is to ack nowledge and assume responsibility for one\u2019s deep feelings and \nprojections, which helps to pull the individual out of \u201cdrama\u201d with others - including with the other tribe. It could \nhelp facilitate some of the deep listening and empathy processes outlined a bove, by increasing self -awareness of \nstrong judgments and projections that might otherwise hinder healthy communication. What the Harmonic Circles \nprocess does not do is guarantee any change in the other party. Indeed, if we are talking about an online \u201cd rama,\u201d \nand if we are not in any personal relationship with the other, then any such shift is unlikely to occur.8 Harmonic \nCircles is about the practitioner developing the right relationship with his or her  own mind. Any attempt to \nmanipulate or convert, to  insist that the other  introspect, may simply produce another layer of the \u201cdrama.\u201d  \nObserving or engaging the shadow (your own or another\u2019s) requires great psychological and spiritual maturity, \nfounded in turn on an advanced capacity for personal responsib ility. The limitation of such a process is that it may \nappeal, at least in its full depth, only to those on a committed spiritual or introspective journey. Yet various aspects \nof it may be able to be employed by workshop facilitators, including by futurist s (Anthony , 2007, 2010).  \nThere may be various cultural barriers to the processes involved in shadow work. Ideas like \u201cshadow work,\u201d \u201cthe \ninner child\u201d and \u201cintegrated intelligence\u201d may be deemed \u201cnew age\u201d or \u201cnon -scientific\u201d by some. Alternatively, \nsome cultures, including the reli gious, may find that some of the processes violate their behavioural norms.  \nShadow work is thus quite problematic when conducted in groups, and this has only become more so since the \nauthor developed the process over a decade ago, as victim -centred grievan ce cultures have become increasingly \nvalorized in education and media (Haidt & Lukianoff, 2018); and are now a driving force of online drama and the \ntribal split (Anthony, 2020). Grievance culture is incompatible with the philosophical and healing approach  which \nunderpins Harmonic Circles, because attachment to personal and group narratives (including identity) must become \nan explicit and open acknowledgement if the end goal of personal cognitive transparency is to be actualized. The \nend goal of Harmonic Ci rcles is healing and the release of the past, not enhancing social position or personal power \n(although these may indirectly follow).  \nSurrender and forgiveness are central to the Harmonic Circles process. The author\u2019s experience indicates that \nany failure  to release attachment to the past, including any blame of individuals or groups, often creates further \nconflict and drama, and tends to derail the individual\u2019s and group\u2019s healing process. Indeed, in the kind of shadow \nwork involved in the Harmonic Circle s process, unconscious attempts to sabotage healing are common, because \nhealing is a threat to narratives founded upon blame or identification with suffering (Myss, 1998). Further, some \nlife narratives adopted by individuals may be unconsciously put in pla ce to ensure that their personal pain is not felt, \nnor taken responsibility for (Anthony, 2014; Bradshaw, 1990; Jacobson, 2009).  \nTherefore, the author\u2019s approach to group healing represents an inversion of certain key themes which are \ncommon in current so cial justice ideology. The latter tends to see the individual as a victim of environmental and \nhistorical forces, which he/she is encouraged to identify with and publicly affirm. Identity is often taken from one\u2019s \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n45 sense as a victim, where \u201clived experience \u201d (especially trauma) is elevated to high status. Personal grievances are \noften valorized (Anthony, 2014, 2020; Haidt & Lukianoff, 2018; Murray, 2019). Conversely, the prime function of \nidentifying trauma and oppression within the Harmonic Circles process is to heal any trauma by releasing attachment \nto the feelings and their associated narratives, acknowledging any blame and anger being projected at the other, and \nthen recognizing and assuming responsibility for one\u2019s pain.  \nIt is not necessary to do away with individual and group identity. There is nothing in shadow work which suggests \nthat a person cannot carry a specific identity as belonging to some social, ethnic or ideological group. The process, \nhowever, may require a reexamination of one\u2019s mental at tachment to that identity, and reflection upon any agenda \nthat lies behind it.  \nTowards a preferred future  \nPeople will likely only change their behaviour when an alternative becomes preferable to the present situation. And \nfor that to happen, something has to usurp the \u201cpleasure\u201d and reward that outrage and tribalism generate. This may \ninclude identification with a group, and group intimacy (Myss, 1998; Limberg & Barnes, 2018); social approval \n(Haidt & Lukianoff, 2018); and a quasi -religious sense of meaning  and purpose (Anthony, 2020; Limberg & Barnes, \n2018). What will the alternative, preferred future be? Ideally, the suggestion to move beyond tribalism should invite \npeople to explore some \u201chigher\u201d expression of self or life.  \nIf we wish to heal the tribal split, we ideally need to implement processes which bring about positive change via \nreference to the more noble parts of human nature. Telling individuals and tribes that they are deficient or immoral \nmay not be an optimal approach. For example, people are  more likely to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators \nif given a sales pitch which suggests their decision is one to be proud of, rather than harmful (Hall, 2019).  \nHow many netizens today have spent time envisioning a preferable image of what it woul d be like to live beyond \nthe tribal web? What we focus upon expands, which is a principle of perception. Netizens may thus need to spend \nmore time engaging their preferred futures of the internet, and less time on the used futures which identity politics, \nintersectionality and nationalism tend to push (Anthony, 2020).  \nThe argument posited here is that this ideal future can be founded upon a peaceful and loving relationship with \nthe self; via inculcating self -disciplined online habits and honest introspectio n. When one is at peace with oneself, \none tends to be at peace with the world. When one is in a state of inner turmoil, the world feels like an oppressive \nplace. Shadow and presence work can be employed to help address this. But there also needs to be a mo re brilliant \nvision and a more attractive story that we can move towards.  \nThe need for a new story  \nHumans need not eliminate stories, as stories are important parts of our lives. Still, care needs to be taken regarding \nthe stories people tell and come to believe in. They need to be doubly careful, least the media and the robots \n(algorithms) begin telling them what stories are real, whom to exclude and whom to hate.  \nThe current increasingly dominant story in both Blue and Red tribes (Anthony, 2020) is that the world is a terrible \nplace, that my tribe (or tribal allies) is oppressed and that the other tribe is bad and must be silenced, converted or \neven eliminated. Yet  what if the new story is that through first bringing peace and healing to my mind, and then \nbeing of service to others that I can then begin to heal the world? This narrative is deeply meaningful, returns the \nsense of empowerment to oneself, potentially e stablishes connection to the psyche and to the spirit, and then gives \nthat back to society. It sees opportunity for healing and love now and into the future, as opposed to the increasing \nmisanthropy and doomsdayism of current \u201cmean green\u201d politics (Wilber,  2001; Wilber in Rebel Wisdom, 2019a).  \nIn order for the new story to unfold, we have to release the enemy (or at least the image which we have \nconstructed of them), and eventually to invite them back through the city gate. This will likely require caution , \nbecause the widespread agenda for power, control and elimination of the other will not diminish on its own. There \nwill need to be a healing process. Trust will not likely easily return. It will need to be cultivated.  \nThe search for motivation  \nThere is t ypically little social or professional reward for spiritual and psychological growth. The reward is intrinsic: \nthe inner peace, wisdom and mindful presence that one is able to bring forth at will (or at least, can surrender to).  \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n46 Spiritual practitioners I have worked with such as Leonard Jacobson (2009) and well -known practitioners like \nEckhart Tolle (2009) teach that when an individual finds the light within themselves, they free not just themselves, \nbut shine a light which helps heal the human race. If th ere is indeed an integrated intelligence (Anthony , 2008, 2011, \n2014), the healing work we do and the inner peace we find may shine a subtle light upon the world, and into the \n\u201cdarkness.\u201d The society we live in, our friends and loved ones may never know wha t we have \u201cdone\u201d. There will \nbe no testamur to hang on the wall, no elevation of personal or professional status. Simply the inner knowing that \nwe have made a difference to the world and to future generations. And that will be enough.  \nAt some level, all of  us who are on an awakening journey know when we betray our own deeper selves, and our \nown journey. Those who continue to fight and argue in online and mental -psychic spaces know it is \u201cwrong,\u201d for \nthe diminishment of consciousness that follows is intuitiv ely apparent to those who have done such inner work. Yet \nthere are many of us who still cling to those spaces, not quite willing to release them. For at some level, we have \ncome to identify with the tribe, the narrative, and the heroes. Even when they are \u201cwrong.\u201d This, too, is human. \nPerhaps with a simple acknowledgment of that, without judgment or condemnation of ourselves or any of those \ninvolved in the drama, we can be free. Until the next moment arises.  \nConclusion  \nJust as the breakdown of the assumed k nown in the twentieth century was an opportunity for post -colonial depth to \nemerge, the possible breakdown of progressivism in its \u201cmean green\u201d form (Anthony, 2020) is an opportunity for a \npost-progressive depth to emerge. Ideally, this will incorporate no t just multiple perspectives, but enhanced virtual \nintelligence (of online and media systems), greater self -awareness and knowledge of the psyche. Higher levels of \ncognitive responsibility and emotional maturity will be required, including from those atop the current intersectional \nhierarchy.  \nIt has been argued in this article that internet conflicts are often a kind of \u201cdrama,\u201d generated via the irresponsible \nexternalisation of our inner conflicts out onto the world and its people. In turn, this is an exte nsion of the failure to \nlove and accept ourselves, to nurture and heal the wounded child within. Tragically, it is a drama that has become \nincreasingly commoditised and weaponised by virtual stakeholders, with the aim of optimising power and profit.  \nYet in  terms of the consciousness evolution of all individuals, tribal groups and the human species as whole, the \ncurrent cultures wars represent an opportunity for us to see more deeply the nature of mind and ego for what it is. It \nis a great opportunity to lea rn and grow, a moment of possible spiritual evolution for the human race. But in order \nfor that to happen, we have to be more honest about what we have become. The mindfulness and shadow work \nadvocated above is a chance to transcend tribal drama. The proce ss differs from the narrative which online tribalist \nperspectives typically imply is the way forward. The current tribal impasse stems from agendas to establish how \nbad, wrong and stupid the other tribe has become; thus achieving power and control over the m. The way forward \nshould ideally involve admitting how unconscious I/we have become (how bad, wrong and stupid), and how \nbringing awareness to that can help heal both \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d  \nIdeally, human beings in the virtual age should have a commitment to in trospective healing, to psychological \n(and possibly spiritual) development, and to narratives which transcend (and include) group identity. This can be \nseen not so much as a personal sacrifice, but as an act of supreme generosity: to the greater collective  of humanity. \nYet without introspection and a deliberate attempt to empathise with other groups (no matter how uncomfortable \nthe process), internet -based tribalism is unlikely to be transformed in the foreseeable future. A psycho -spiritual \nperspective, cou pled with true embodiment of its wisdom, may potentially help us rise above attachment to the \nquasi -religiosity of much current ideology and politics.  \nNotes  \n1- You will find a more personal detailing of my relationship to the tribal wars in my previous articl e (Anthony, \n2020), and why I chose to focus on the Blue tribe in that article.  \n2- \u201cThe need for drama\u201d is a term I have borrowed from my time doing shadow work in healing groups. This \nmostly unconscious drive escalates in accordance with the decrease in one\u2019s  cognitive responsibility - the \nwillingness to assume responsibility for one\u2019s own mental and emotional experience.  \nJFS September 2021  Anthony  \n \n47 3- I define \u201cdrama\u201d as conflict built on the irresponsible and unconscious projection of unresolved cognitive and \nemotional pathology or trauma . When this emotional discomfort is directed at another individual or group, the \nensuing conflict can be seen as \u201cdrama,\u201d as opposed to healthy dialogue or disagreement.  \n4- In practice, the processes of Harmonic Circles are more complex and may involve group work, but for the \npurposes of simplicity, I outline a process here which can be utilized by almost anyone with sufficient \nmotivation and commitment. One should be mindful when employing any process which involves bringing \nforth \u201cthe unconscious.\u201d If the pr actitioner finds the process too uncomfortable or disturbing, she can \ndiscontinue, or seek the help of a mental health professional.  \n5- The group healing processes I embraced, and which are part of Harmonic Circles (Anthony, 2007, 2010) are \narguably more powe rful means of exploring the shadow than self -work. Working with others allows one\u2019s \npersonal judgments and projections to arise more naturally; permits more opportunity for feedback from others; \nand facilitates the emotional expression and vulnerability th at allows for healing and the rediscovery of trust in \none\u2019s fellow human beings. However, the group process requires a very skilled facilitator who has done \nextensive depth work.  \n6- For a more complete explanation of Harmonic Circles, see Anthony (2007, 2010 ). \n7- It is possible that strong emotions might emerge during or after the embodiment process, and these in turn may \nbe linked to personal biographical trauma. If this occurs, I strongly suggest you seek the help of a professional \nmental health counselor, pre ferably one who understands shadow work.  \n8- Of course, the behavior of the other might change if your own behavior becomes more open and hospitable.  \nReferences  \nAnthony, M.

In this study we investigate the use of\nHI framing across different English-speaking\ncultures in news articles about climate change.\nDespite its demonstrated impact on the pub-\nlic\u2019s behaviour and perception of an issue, HI\nframing has been under-explored in NLP to\ndate. We perform a systematic analysis of HI\nstories to understand its role in climate change\nreporting in English-speaking countries from\nfour continents. Our findings reveal key dif-\nferences in how climate change is portrayed\nacross countries, encompassing aspects such as\nnarrative roles, article polarity, pronoun preva-\nlence, and topics. We also demonstrate that\nthese linguistic aspects boost the performance\nof fine-tuned pre-trained language models on\nHI story classification.1\n1 Introduction\nNews not only reports the political facts of a day;\nit also links global phenomena, such as climate\nchange, to the day-to-day existence of people by\nreporting on their impact on individuals or com-\nmunities. This strategy has been shown to capture\nand retain readership, and to enhance political en-\ngagement of the population (Cho and Gower, 2006;\nZhao et al., 2019; Figenschou et al., 2023).\nThis \u201chuman face\u201d of news reporting has been\nstudied in the social sciences ever since Semetko\nand Valkenburg (2000) defined the term human\ninterest (\u201cHI\u201d) framing in their seminal paper as\nbringing \u201ca human face or an emotional angle\nto the presentation of an event, issue, or prob-\nlem.\u201d News articles containing HI framing present\nan event, issue, or problem with an emphasis on\nthe personal, emotional, and humanising aspects\n1HI annotations, code to reproduce our data set, and fine-\ntuned classifiers can be found here.\nFigure 1: Top: A news article with Human Interest fram-\ning highlighted in blue (abbreviated for space reasons).\nBottom: Output from our automated labelling system.\nof the story.2While NLP has formalized and quan-\ntified media framing from a variety of perspec-\ntives (Ali and Hassan, 2022; Vallejo et al., 2024;\nOtmakhova et al., 2024), approaches have predom-\ninantly emphasised different framing devices and\nimplications. We complement this line of work by\npresenting, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nlarge-scale, cross-cultural study of HI framing in\nEnglish-language news reporting.\nFigure 1 shows an example of a news article that\nexhibits HI framing: the article about health and\nsafety risks of a planned natural gas pipeline leads\nwith a story about a local, who is already suffering\ndisruption from facilities in the area. The narration\nis vivid, referring to smells and health risks, and in\n2In this paper, we will use the terms HI framing and HI\nstories interchangeably.\n11381doing so humanises the issue and evokes disgust\nand empathy in the reader, resulting in a connection\nwith the affected community (Zhao et al., 2019).\nIn this paper, we study HI framing in the context\nof climate change reporting, analysing the specific\ncharacteristics of HI framing (vs. non-HI articles)\nin the context of this issue. Climate change, as a\npressing issue which effects individuals and com-\nmunities around the globe, is an omnipresent topic\nin the news (Poushter et al., 2022) and a compelling\ntestbed for HI framing. Its nature as a global, slow-\nmoving issue with no clear single \u201cface\u201d renders\npersonalisation through individual impact stories\nall the more important to engage and expose the au-\ndience to its imminent effects (Gibson et al., 2016).\nWe create a data set of climate change report-\ning from major news outlets in 2023, across four\nEnglish-speaking countries: Australia, India, the\nUSA, and the UK. We first label each article with\nthe presence or absence of HI framing, using large\nlanguage models with human oversight. We then\ndevise a set of aspects to analyse the prevalence,\nproperties, and cultural differences of HI fram-\ning, including prevailing topics, victims, and sen-\ntiment. Finally, we supplement document embed-\ndings from a fine-tuned RoBERTa model (Liu et al.,\n2019b) with these features to train a model that de-\ntects HI framing articles with high accuracy.\nOur findings reveal shared and culture-specific\ncharacteristics of HI stories. While the USA has\nthe largest prominence of HI framing, HI framing\nacross all countries predominantly focuses around\nvictims in the general public ; is characterized by a\nhigher proportion of first- and third-person personal\npronouns; and exhibits more extreme (positive and\nnegative) sentiment compared to articles with no\nHI framing. At the same time, the topic and victim\ndistribution in HI stories differs across countries.\nOur framework and resources provide a basis for\nfuture research into the manifestation and effects\nof human interest framing.\n2 Background\nOur work spans HI framing, framing of climate\nchange and NLP models of framing.\nHuman Interest Framing. Previous studies have\nillustrated positive and negative impacts of HI fram-\ning on the general public. Jebril et al. (2013) in-\nvestigated the effect of conflict andhuman interest\nframes on political knowledge gain. They found\nthat exposure to both frames increased politicalknowledge, with the higher benefit for those with\nlow political interest, suggesting that HI framing\ncan be used as a strategy to educate about poli-\ntics. Valenzuela et al. (2017) studied the effect of\nHI framing on news sharing on Twitter and Face-\nbook, analysing news stories and interviewing dig-\nital journalists and editors. Although they report\nlow correlation of HI framing and news sharing,\ntheir interviewees reported that such frames are\nassociated with highly viral stories and linked HI\nframing to emotional arousal , suggesting that they\ncan evoke strong emotions and encourage sharing.\nAnother line of work found that HI framing may\namplify emotional responses and negatively im-\npact perceptions of crises, potentially amplifying\nintensity of evaluations and perception of the is-\nsue compared to other reporting styles (Cho and\nGower, 2006; Zhao et al., 2019).\nFraming climate change. Research on climate\nchange framing has been extensive, with a strong\nbias towards countries in the global north (She-\nhata and Hopmann, 2012; Hart and Feldman, 2014;\nO\u2019Neill et al., 2015). Recent analyses of climate\nchange coverage across ten countries in the global\nsouth and north (Hase et al., 2021) have found a\ngrowing emphasis on societal aspects of climate\nchange, with the global south focusing on chal-\nlenges and implications for society. There has been\nan increase in attention and research on climate\nchange in NLP in recent years, including releasing\ndatasets for climate claim verification (Diggelmann\net al., 2020), exploring neutralisation (climate de-\nnial) techniques (Bhatia et al., 2021), extracting nar-\nratives (Stammbach et al., 2022; Frermann et al.,\n2023), or automatically detecting net zero or re-\nduction targets (Schimanski et al., 2023). Our re-\nsearch builds on humanities studies by devising\na framework to expose HI framing at scale with\nNLP methodology. It complements prior work on\nclimate framing in NLP with its specific focus on\nhuman interest.\nFraming in NLP In NLP, a large number of\nstudies have investigated framing. Both super-\nvised (Naderi and Hirst, 2017; Khanehzar et al.,\n2019; Huguet Cabot et al., 2020; Mendelsohn\net al., 2021) and unsupervised (Tsur et al., 2015;\nMenini et al., 2017) approaches have been applied\nto benchmarks including the Media Frames Cor-\npus (MFC) (Card et al., 2015) and Gun Violence\nFrame Corpus (GVFC) (Liu et al., 2019a). How-\never, Frermann et al. (2023) is the only study that\n11382has previously investigated HI framing in NLP.\nThey released a corpus of 428 English news ar-\nticles annotated with five frames (including HI),\nfinding that HI stories are particularly prevalent in\nright-leaning outlets. While we use some of their\ndefinitions and annotations for our analyses, our\nprimary focus is on HI stories and their dynamics\nacross countries and cultures. This study provides\ninsights at a much larger scale with a corpus of\nmore than 10knews articles about climate change\nfrom several countries. We also combine linguistic\nfeatures derived from topic modelling, entity role\nanalysis, and sentiment analysis with pre-trained\nmodels to improve model accuracy in identifying\narticles with HI framing. To the best of our knowl-\nedge, this is the first study in NLP investigating HI\nframing across several countries/cultures at scale.\n3 Data Construction\nIn this section we describe the process of collect-\ning and validating our cross-cultural data set of HI\nstories. This process comprises three steps: (1)\ncollecting a large number of news articles; (2) la-\nbelling the collection using Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-\nv0.1 (Jiang et al. (2024), hereafter referred to as\nMixtral); and (3) manually validating the quality of\nthe obtained labels. Below, we detail each of these\nsteps.\n3.1 Climate Change Corpus\nWe collected English news articles published in\n2023 via the ProQuest database3using climate\nchange as a keyword. To ensure a representative\nsample, we retrieved data from the top outlets by\ncirculation in each of four countries: Australia,\nIndia, UK, and USA.4We obtained the political\nleaning for each of the outlets from the Media Bias\nFact Check website,5ensuring that the outlets for\neach country span the political spectrum (full list\nof outlets with metadata in Appendix A, Table 3).\nAfter de-duplicating the articles by exact match,\nwe removed documents with lengths outside the\nrange of [100,9000] words. This resulted in a to-\ntal of 19,153articles. Our strategy of matching\narticles by a single keyword ( climate change ) lead\nto a large number of articles that only tangentially\nconcern the topic. We further filtered the articles by\nprompting Mixtral to return only those articles with\n3https://www.proquest.com\n4Based on the Wikipedia list of top newspapers by circula-\ntion: https://en.wikipedia.org/Newspapers\n5https://mediabiasfactcheck.comClimate Change Corpus (CC-corpus)\nCountry Articles HI articles % HI articles\nUnited States 3,836 1 ,078 28%\nIndia 3,193 404 13%\nAustralia 2,007 318 16%\nUnited Kingdom 1,264 270 21%\nTotal 10,300 2 ,070 20%\nControl Corpus\nCountry Articles HI articles % HI articles\nUnited States 3,762 1 ,517 40%\nIndia 3,195 893 28%\nAustralia 1,993 706 35%\nUnited Kingdom 1,267 373 29%\nTotal 10,217 3 ,489 33%\nTable 1: Number of articles and proportion of HI stories\nin the Climate-Change corpus (CC) (top) and control\ncorpus (bottom).\nclimate change as the primary focus. We validated\nthis step through manual inspection with a prefer-\nence to err on the side of precision (i.e., remove\nrelevant rather than retain irrelevant articles).6Our\nfinal climate change corpus (\u201cCC-corpus\u201d here-\nafter) comprises 10,300news articles. The distri-\nbution of articles across the four countries is shown\nin Table 1 (top, Articles).\nHuman Interest labels Given the CC-Corpus,\nwe further prompt Mixtral to label articles as con-\ntaining HI framing, or not. Our prompt included\na definition of HI stories based on Frermann et al.\n(2023) and Semetko and Valkenburg (2000), as\nwell as one positive and two negative examples that\nwere manually annotated by all authors. Mixtral\nis prompted to return: (1) a binary label indicating\nwhether a given news article contains a HI story,\n(2) an explanation for the label, and (3) a concise\nsummary of the HI story, if present. An article is\nconsidered to contain a HI story when it presents a\npersonal story of an individual, even if it is a short\nmention \u2013 we did not have length or prominence\nrequirements.7Figure 1 presents a news article\nwith HI story and the full Mixtral output.\n3.2 Control Corpus\nTo gauge the extent to which our findings are spe-\ncific to the issue of climate change, we collected\na control sample of news articles from the same\noutlets and time period, but without any content re-\nstriction.8The sample was down-sampled to match\n6See Figure 17 in the Appendix for the full prompt\n7See Figure 16 in Appendix Figure 16 for the full prompt.\n8We did not provide any keyword in ProQuest.\n11383the size of the climate change dataset, ensuring\nuniform coverage over 2023 (see Table 1, bottom),\nresulting in 10,217articles. This data was also\nlabelled using Mixtral with the same prompt as the\nCC-corpus. Control corpus statistics are in Table 1\n(bottom).\n3.3 Human Annotation\nTo verify the HI labels predicted by Mixtral, we\ndesigned an annotation task using POTATO (Pei\net al., 2022), which follows a three-step process.\nIn Step (1) annotators were presented our defini-\ntion of HI stories (the same as used in the Mixtral\nprompt), as well as a news article. On this basis,\nthey indicated (yes/no) whether the article contains\na HI story, eliciting the annotator\u2019s own, unbiased\njudgment. In Step (2) they were shown the label\nand explanation for the same article as generated\nby Mixtral, and indicated whether they agree with\nit (yes/no). Importantly, the annotators were un-\nable to change their initial assessment at this point.\nFinally, in Step (3) annotators were presented with\na Mixtral-generated summary of the HI story (only\nif a HI story was identified by Mixtral), and asked\nto indicate whether they agree with that summary\n(yes/no).\nIn preliminary experiments we validated the\nreliability of our conceptualization of HI stories\nand our annotation framework. Over 48articles,\nwe collected two human annotations each, achiev-\ning a Krippendorf\u2019s \u03b1(Hayes and Krippendorff,\n2007) of 0.67(83% agreement). We then evaluated\n100 Mixtral predictions, recruiting 10local volun-\nteer annotators, all with a graduate-level education,\neach of whom annotated 10articles. We evaluated\nthe model\u2019s performance by comparing its predic-\ntions with annotator\u2019s original assessments (Step\n(1)), achieving an agreement of 82%. When anno-\ntators were asked if they agreed with the model\u2019s\nreasoning \u2014 Step (2) described above\u2014 the agree-\nment increased to 87%.\nWe analysed the 13% of samples where annota-\ntors disagreed with the model and found that most\nwere borderline cases, containing subtle signals\nthat could indicate HI framing. For example, a\nnews article critiquing a study on the effect of cli-\nmate change in the economy included information\nabout the authors\u2019 affiliations and their awards, and\nused descriptions such as eminent economists and\nuniversities with vast resources to reinforce its mes-\nsage. Mixtral classified this article as \u2018containing\nHI\u2019 while the annotator did not attest such a fram-ing. In the context of this unavoidable ambigu-\nity of our task, the observed human-human and\nhuman-model agreement values of >80% leave us\nconfident that Mixtral predictions are reliable.\n4 Characterizing HI Framing across\nCultures\nRecall that HI stories provide \u201ca human face or an\nemotional angle to the presentation of an event, is-\nsue, or problem\u201d (Semetko and Valkenburg, 2000).\nDeparting from this definition, we define four mea-\nsurable key aspects along which we analyze HI\nstories across cultures. In Section 5 we will show\nthat these aspects are also empirically valuable for\npredicting the presence of HI stories in news arti-\ncles. First, we analyse the events, issues, or prob-\nlems by inspecting topics that dominate HI stories\nand discriminate between articles with and without\nHI stories. Second, given the human angle of HI\nstories we inspect the distribution of personal pro-\nnouns. Based on the same motivation, we thirdly\nanalyse the types of victims portrayed in HI stories.\nFourth, we assess the level of emotion in HI sto-\nries by comparing their sentiment intensity against\nnon-HI articles.\n4.1 Prevalence of HI framing\nWe analysed the prevalence of HI framing in cli-\nmate change news reporting, compared to general\nnews. Out of the 10,300climate change news ar-\nticles, 2,070were predicted by Mixtral to contain\nHI stories (see Table 1, top), where we also show\nthe number of HI stories per country and their pro-\nportion. Considering the total number of articles\nwith HI framing in the CC-corpus (Table 1, top)\nand the Control-corpus (Table 1, bottom), we ob-\nserve that HI framing is overall less prevalent in\nclimate change reporting compared to the general\nnews. This observation holds for every country in\nour study.\nComparing HI framing prevalence across coun-\ntries, we observe that articles from the USA are\nmore likely to contain HI framing than the other\ncountries, but that the relative drop in prevalence\nover the control corpus is much higher than the\nUK. By contrast, India has the lowest proportion of\nHI stories, and also the largest relative drop in HI\nstories over the control corpus for that country, fol-\nlowed by Australia (with the second highest drop).\nThese numbers demonstrate that there is a substan-\ntial difference in the prevalence of HI stories in\n11384\nAustraliaIndia\nUnited KingdomUnited StatesAustralia\nIndia\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States1 0.19 0.46 0.33\n0.19 1 0.15 0.17\n0.46 0.15 1 0.45\n0.33 0.17 0.45 1\n0.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0Figure 2: Heatmap over all topics\u2019 rank similarity across\ncountries.

And, how do those topics differ between ar-\nticles with and without HI framing? To shed light\non these questions, we conducted an exploratory\nanalysis of the collected news articles using the\nBERTopic topic model (Grootendorst, 2022). We\napplied this model on the CC articles and compared\nthe obtained topics across countries and articles\nwith vs without HI framing. We provide a full list\nof inferred topics (as lists of most representative\nwords) in Appendix C.\nFirst, we inspect the pairwise similarity of coun-\ntries\u2019 climate change reporting on the basis of their\ninduced topic distribution. Figure 2 depicts the\nrank-biased overlap (RBO) (Webber et al., 2010)\ncomparison across countries for articles with HI\nstories.9From the graph we observe that India is\nmost dissimilar compared to the other three coun-\ntries, while the United States, Australia, and the\nUK share a higher rank similarity. This finding sug-\ngests that India\u2019s climate change reporting about\nwild life (topic 110),Buddha (topic 68), and agri-\nculture (topic 74) is not closely aligned with that\n9We also include the comparison for only the top 15 most\ncommon topics\u2019 rank in Appendix C, with overall consistent\nresults.\n10See Tables 4 to 7 for the full topics per country.\n25\n 0 25\n Coefficient\n1.

This could be due\nto various factors such as differences in climate\nchange policies, cultural and religious influences\nthat are reflected in the way news are reported, or\nthe way climate change affects each of the coun-\ntries. We discuss our findings in socio-political\ncontext in Section 6. We also applied the same\nanalysis to the control corpus and obtained con-\nsistent results, with India again emerging as the\nmost dissimilar country. It is noteworthy, however,\nthat the control corpus revealed a higher overlap\nbetween Australia and the UK compared to the\nUSA. This suggests that Australia and the UK have\nclosely aligned agendas in general, but that they\ndiverge in the specific domain of climate change.\nNext, we turn to the difference in themes be-\ntween HI and non-HI articles, pooling articles\nacross all four countries. To this end, we fit a logis-\ntic regression model that predicts whether an article\ncontains HI framing, with the topic distribution as\ninput features.\nFigure 3 depicts the most predictive features for\nthe positive label (HI framing; top) and the neg-\native label (non-HI framing; bottom) in climate\nchange stories, based on labels from Mixtral (see\nTable 8 for full list). We observe that the most\ncommon words in each topic without HI stories\nare associated with corporate and financial issues,\ninternational relations, and energy policy, whereas\nHI stories are associated with environmental crises,\n11385\n1sg 2pl-sg 3sg-m 3sg-f 3sg-n 1pl 3pl\nPronouns0.0000.0010.0020.0030.0040.005Average T erm FrequencyHI\nNon-HIFigure 4: Comparison of average pronoun term fre-\nquency (including standard error of the mean) across HI\nand non-HI stories. 1pl denotes first person plural, 1sg\nfirst person singular, etc.\neducation, personal opinions, and cultural/religious\ncommunities. Interestingly, several of the most\npredictive topics for HI stories are dominated by\npersonal pronouns, like in our climate ,female liter-\nature andpersonal pronouns (see full top words in\nTable 8). We next inspect the role of pronouns in\nHI stories in more detail.\n4.3 Personal pronouns in HI stories\nTo analyse pronoun usage, we categorised personal\npronouns by person and number (1sg={ I, me, mine,\nmy}, 1pl={ we, us, our, ours }, etc; full lists of pro-\nnouns per group are in Table 9). We then calculated\nthe document term frequency for each group and\ncompared the results across HI and non-HI stories.\nFigure 4 shows the results averaged per docu-\nment, and reveal that pronouns are overall more\nprevalent in HI stories (with the exception of the\nthird-person neutral pronoun it). In contrast, third-\nperson masculine and feminine and first-person\nsingular pronouns are highly prominent in HI sto-\nries which involve first-person narratives as quotes,\nand descriptions of individuals with corresponding\nthird-person pronouns. Our analysis of the control\ncorpus (see Figure 10) shows a consistent pattern,\nsuggesting that pronouns are influential in shaping\nthe narrative of HI stories, and that this observation\nextends beyond climate change.\n4.4 Entity Analysis\nThe drama triangle theory, first proposed by Karp-\nman (1968), describes the three primary roles that\nindividuals can play in a conflict: the perpetra-\ntor (or villain); the victim, who is affected by the\nAU IN UK US0.00.20.40.60.81.0318 404 270 1078\nSCIENCE_EXPERTS_SCI.REPORTS\nMEDIA_JOURNALISTS\nLEGISLATION_POLICIES_RESPONSES\nENV.ORGS_ACTIVISTS\nINDUSTRY_EMISSIONS\nGREEN_TECHNOLOGY_INNOVATION\nCLIMATECHANGE\nGOVERNMENTS_POLITICIANS_POLIT.ORGS\nANIMALS_NATURE_ENVIRONMENT\nGENERALPUBLICFigure 5: Distribution of entity groups portrayed as\nvictims across countries.\nvillain\u2019s actions; and the rescuer, who acts as the\nvictim\u2019s helper. This theory was later adapted to\nanalyse narrative roles in news stories (Gerbner and\nGross, 1976; Van Dijk, 2013; Jones et al., 2014).\nIn NLP, researchers have also explored the auto-\nmatic prediction of narrative roles (Jahan et al.,\n2021; Stammbach et al., 2022), including in the\ncontext of climate change (Frermann et al., 2023).\nHere, we investigate the victim role in HI stories\nabout climate change, arguing that it is a crucial\nand emotionally evocative aspect of climate change\nnarratives. We use the narrative frames corpus (Fr-\nermann et al., 2023), which includes entity group\nannotations (stakeholders in their paper), to anal-\nyse the character roles in these stories. The corpus\ncategorises entities into ten entity groups, e.g. map-\nping the earth orthe oceans toANIMALS NATURE\nENVIRONMENT , and climate protests toENV.ORG\nACTIVIST . The original mapping was done by a\nhuman annotator.\nIdentifying these entity groups in each story en-\nables us to find trends and patterns of entities being\npictured as the victim in climate change articles\nacross cultures. We automatically map victims in\nour HI stories to their entity group with Mixtral,\nand use the gold mappings from Frermann et al.\n11386(2023) to validate our method. We prompted Mix-\ntral to identify the most prominent entity portrayed\nas a victim in each HI story, and mapped it to a cli-\nmate change entity group from the narrative frames\ncorpus.\nFigure 5 illustrates the proportion of entity\ngroups presented as victims in HI stories across\ncountries. Unsurprisingly, the GENERAL PUBLIC is\nthe most prominent victim group, with higher pro-\nportions in India and the United States. The United\nKingdom has the highest proportion of stories fea-\nturing ANIMALS AND NATURE as victims while\nAustralia has the most articles depicting GOVERN -\nMENT entities and SCIENCE EXPERTS as victims.\nWe also present this analysis across news outlets\n(see Figure 11 in Appendix E).\n4.5 Sentiment Analysis\nAs quantified in previous studies from the commu-\nnication and political sciences, HI framing evokes\nemotions and is more prone to impact the behaviour\nof readers, such as article sharing in social me-\ndia (Trifiro et al., 2023) than articles without a hu-\nman angle. Here, we investigate the difference of\nsentiment distributions over the averaged sentence\npolarity of individual articles.\nWe used a pre-trained version of RoBERTa (Liu\net al., 2019b) \u2014fine-tuned on Twitter data for sen-\ntence sentiment analysis (Barbieri et al., 2020) \u2014\nto predict a sentiment score at the sentence level.\nThese scores are averaged to obtain a score per ar-\nticle. Figure 6 presents a distribution comparison\nof HI and non-HI articles per country. We observe\nthat in general, news articles tend to have a nega-\ntive averaged sentiment for both categories, with\nthe exception of India. This trend is stronger for\nnon-HI stories. This analysis also shows that HI sto-\nries tend to have a wider range of sentiment, with\nAustralia and the United Kingdom being slightly\nmore biased towards positive sentiment. The fact\nthat HI articles have a broader sentiment spectrum\naligns with findings in previous research (Trifiro\net al., 2023; Valenzuela et al., 2017) that this type\nof story tends to evoke emotion with the purpose\nof impacting readers\u2019 behaviour. The control cor-\npus exhibits similar patterns (see Figure 12 in the\nAppendix), with minor differences in the breadth\nof sentiment in HI stories for India and the UK.Model/Features Accuracy\nMajority class 0.52\nMixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 0.82\nMLP using:Fine-Tuned Off-the-Shelf\nAcc.

Bottom: MLP trained with only embed-\ndings (Embs.) and additional features. Embeddings\nwere either extracted from a Fine-Tuned or an Off-the-\nShelf version of RoBERTa.\n5 HI Framing Classification\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the analysed fea-\ntures, we conducted a final experiment to automat-\nically classify HI framing articles. We trained a\nsingle-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier\nusing a combination of RoBERTa embeddings (Liu\net al., 2019b) and linguistic features (topics, pro-\nnouns, and sentiment). We further fine-tuned a\nRoBERTa base (Liu et al., 2019b) model on 3,600\nautomatically-labelled articles, and use the result-\ning embeddings in a similar MLP model, combined\nwith linguistic features. All models were tested on\nthe human-labeled testset of 100 articles. The re-\nsults, presented in Table 2 show, first, that it is pos-\nsible to predict HI stories in the news with a very\nhigh F1 score and accuracy exceeding 90%. We fur-\nther find that adding topic information improves the\nperformance over direct RoBERTa fine-tuning,11\nwhile the other features are less effective. We note\nthat the fine-tuned RoBERTa models outperform\nprompt-based Mixtral.\n6 Discussion\nOur study reveals systematic differences in the way\nclimate change is reported in news articles across\nthe four investigated countries. The results of the\ntopic modelling indicate that India stands out as the\ncountry with the lowest rank similarity across the\nfour nations, which may reflect its distinct environ-\nmental context and socio-economic characteristics,\n11We release our models here to support future work on HI\nframing.\n11387\n1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.0DensitySentiment Score Distribution in Australia\nNon-HI\nHI\n1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.0DensitySentiment Score Distribution in India\nNon-HI\nHI\n1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.0DensitySentiment Score Distribution in United Kingdom\nNon-HI\nHI\n1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0DensitySentiment Score Distribution in United States\nNon-HI\nHIFigure 6: Comparison of sentiment analysis across countries.

In addition, India has been identified\nas one of the most vulnerable countries to climate\nchange, with a high risk of heat-related diseases,\nwater scarcity (Hijioka et al., 2014), and food in-\nsecurity (Ortiz et al., 2008). It is interesting to\nnote that Australia and the UK are closer to the\nUSA than to each other in terms of topic similarity,\ndespite both nations sharing a common monarchy\nand historically being culturally closer. This re-\nsult may be influenced by historical leanings of the\nmedia landscape, and centralisation of outlet own-\nerships i.e. the Wall Street Journal in the USA and\nThe Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun, and The Aus-\ntralian are all owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News\nCorporation (see Table 3 for a list of owners for all\nincluded outlets). This may have resulted in shared\neditorial perspectives and influences across both\nnations. Additionally, both Australia and the USA\nspan large areas with diverse climate conditions\nand are thus affected by significant weather events\nranging from extreme heat and bush fires to floods,\nwith wide-ranging impacts on agriculture.\nOur analysis of entities portrayed as victims in\nnews articles exposes that the general public is the\nmost frequently depicted group in a victim roleacross all four countries. This finding is consistent\nwith previous research from the communication\nsciences, reporting the use of HI framing to hu-\nmanise stories and influence public opinion (Zhao\net al., 2019). It is noteworthy that Australia distin-\nguishes itself from other countries by having the\nhighest proportion of articles portraying govern-\nmental entities, legislation policies, and science\nexperts as victims, which seems counter-intuitive\ngiven their typically authoritative roles. This ob-\nservation raises questions for future work, investi-\ngating the media\u2019s portrayal of these groups in the\ncontext of climate change, and its potential impact\non public perception of climate change.\nSentiment analysis showed that non-HI climate\nchange news articles tend to exhibit more negative\nsentiment. This phenomenon is more evident in\nAustralia, UK, and USA, where sentiment analy-\nsis suggests a more pronounced negative tone in\nnews articles. In contrast, HI stories have a wider\nsentiment spectrum and lean towards more positive\nsentiment, specially in Australia and UK.\nTaken together, these findings lead us to better\nunderstand the use of HI framing across English-\nspeaking cultures and reveal characteristics that can\ninform future computational or manual analysis\n11388of this topic. Prior research has shown that the\nway climate change is framed and reported can\nhave a significant impact on public perceptions and\nattitudes towards the issue (Cho and Gower, 2006).\nBy developing tools that automatically identify HI\nstories, and by understanding their characteristics\nour study can support future efforts to study their\neffects in more detail, and link HI stories to the\nphenomenon of media bias.\n7 Conclusion\nOur cross-cultural analysis of climate change HI\nstories in news articles has provided insights into\nthe ways in which climate change is framed and re-\nported in different parts of the world. Through\ntopic modelling, entity, and sentiment analyses\nwe were able to expose systematic differences in\nnews articles across the four nations. Our study\nrevealed interesting findings like the diversity of\ntopics across countries, the different victim roles\nin all countries, and the broader sentiment in HI\ncompared to non HI stories.\nOverall, our study demonstrates the value of\ncombining multiple NLP approaches to gain a\ndeeper understanding of complex issues like cli-\nmate change. By integrating topic modelling, en-\ntity analysis, and sentiment analysis, we can gain a\nmore comprehensive picture of how climate change\nis framed and reported in different parts of the\nEnglish-speaking world.\n8 Limitations\nThe scope of this work is limited to news articles in\nEnglish from the listed outlets in Australia, India,\nUK, and USA. We are aware that our work does\nnot necessarily represent each country\u2019s perspec-\ntive but rather those of the examined outlets. We\nare also aware that large language models manifest\na wide variety of biases that we might not be aware\nof, and that could be harmful. We hope that with\nthis research we can shed light on systematic differ-\nences in the use of HI framing in different countries\nin English. We also understand that ProQuest data\nis licensed and that reproduciability might be af-\nfected. We will release ProQuest ids along with our\nlabels and a script to reproduce our data set from\nproquest to support future research.\nReferences\nMohammad Ali and Naeemul Hassan. 2022.

Our fine-tuning data comprises 3,600\nsamples divided into 2144 articles for training and\ntwice 528for development and training. We used\na batch size of 4articles, truncated articles to 512\ntokens and fine-tuned for 3 epochs. Our MLP clas-\nsifier was implemented using scikit-learn13and we\ntrained for 10to20epochs using early stopping.\nC Topic Modelling Details\nWe conducted a cross-country comparison of the\nrank-biased overlap (RBO) in the top 15 most com-\nmon topics (Figure 7) and the control corpus (Fig-\nure 8). Interestingly, the top 15 topics yielded\nconsistent results with the broader analysis. How-\never, results on the control corpus revealed a higher\ndegree of overlap between the UK and Australia,\nwhen compared to the USA, recall that this is op-\nposed to the results with climate change topics (Fig-\nure 2). This finding suggests that the UK and Aus-\ntralia share a high degree of similarity in their agen-\ndas, although this convergence is not the case in\nthe domain of climate change.\nWe list top 15topics in each country\u2019s HI arti-\ncles (Tables 4 to 7).

The results, as depicted in Fig-\nure 11, show that certain entity groups are under-\nrepresented in specific outlets. This pattern may be\nattributed to the varying number of articles by each\noutlet.F Sentiment Analysis Details\nFigure 12 presents the distributions of sentiment\nanalysis scores across countries for articles with\nand without HI framing. Results are consistent\nwith the sentiment analysis conducted on the CC.\nWe observed a slightly broader range of sentiment\nin all countries in HI stories. Although the effect\nis more pronounced in climate change articles, this\ntrend is also evident in the current analysis.\nG Annotation Details\nOur annotation task includes examples and reasons\nwhy articles should and should not be labelled as\ncontaining HI stories. We also included a train-\ning phase in which we provide annotators with\nmore examples. In this section, we provide a visual\noverview of the platform and task through a series\nof screenshots. Figure 13 shows the annotation in-\ntroduction page, where annotators were presented\nwith a clear explanation of the task requirements,\nincluding the number of samples to be annotated\n(10 articles and 3 training samples). All annotators\nagreed to the use of this data for research purpose.\nFigure 14 provides examples of articles with\nand without HI framing, accompanied by explana-\ntions of the classification rationale and highlighting\nthe key signals to consider. Figure 15 illustrates a\nsample annotation from the training phase, which\nmirrors the format of the actual examples. To min-\nimise annotator fatigue, we deliberately selected\nshorter examples for the training phase.\n11394\nSydney Morning Herald\nThe Age\nThe Australian\nThe Hindustan Times\nThe Times of India\nDaily Mail\nThe Daily Mirror\nThe Daily T elegraph\nThe New York Times\nThe Washington Post\nUSA T oday\nWall Street Journal0.00.20.40.60.81.081 71 99 100 290 88 95 120 575 246 125 106\nSCIENCE_EXPERTS_SCI.REPORTS\nMEDIA_JOURNALISTS\nLEGISLATION_POLICIES_RESPONSES\nENV.ORGS_ACTIVISTS\nINDUSTRY_EMISSIONSGREEN_TECHNOLOGY_INNOVATION\nCLIMATECHANGE\nGOVERNMENTS_POLITICIANS_POLIT.ORGS\nANIMALS_NATURE_ENVIRONMENT\nGENERALPUBLICFigure 11: Distribution of entity groups portrayed as victims across outlets.\nH Prompting Details\n11395\n1.00\n 0.75\n 0.50\n 0.25\n 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.02.5DensityAustralia\nNon-Hi\nHI\n1.00\n 0.75\n 0.50\n 0.25\n 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.02.5 India\nNon-Hi\nHI\n1.00\n 0.75\n 0.50\n 0.25\n 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.02.5DensityUnited Kingdom\nNon-Hi\nHI\n1.00\n 0.75\n 0.50\n 0.25\n 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\nSentiment Score0.00.51.01.52.02.5 United States\nNon-Hi\nHIFigure 12: Comparison of sentiment score distribution in the control corpus across the four countries: Australia,\nIndia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nFigure 13: Introduction to the annotation task.\n11396\nFigure 14: Examples presented in the annotation task.\nFigure 15: First question in annotation task.\n11397[INST] You are a journalist analyst, and your task is to assess whether an article provides a human story.\nThis means to examine if the article provides a human example or \u201dhuman face\u201d on the story\u2019s issue or\nwhether the story goes into the private or personal lives of the entities involved. Your output should be\nANSWER: yes, or ANSWER: no. Please provide your REASON justifying your answer. In the case of\nanswering yes, give a short SUMMARY of the sentences containing the human example or private story.\nHere are three examples, one positive and two negatives. [/INST]\n[EX]EXAMPLE1:\nARTICLE: Prince Harry defends use of private jets: \u201dIt\u2019s to keep my family safe\u201d The Duke of Sussex has\ndefended his use of private jets. \"I came here by commercial. I spend 99% of my life travelling the\nworld by commercial,\" he said. \"Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique\ncircumstance to ensure that my family are safe - it\u2019s generally as simple as that.\" During his opening\nspeech, the duke said \"no one is perfect\" in terms of his impact on the environment needs to ensure\nhis family is safe.\nANSWER: yes\nREASON: The article provides a human story by mentioning the Duke of Sussex\u2019s use of private jets to\nensure his family\u2019s safety, triggering feelings of empathy and understanding.\nSUMMARY: In the article, Prince Harry defends his use of private jets, stating that he primarily travels\ncommercially but occasionally opts for private jets for safety reasons to protect his family. He\nacknowledges his environmental impact but emphasizes the priority of ensuring his family\u2019s safety.\nEXAMPLE2:\nARTICLE: Juli\u00e1n Castro, the first 2020 Democratic presidential candidate at the CNN climate town hall,\nthe self-professed \"climate candidate\" whose six-part plan is said: \"When I was mayor of San Antonio, I\ndid believe that there were opportunities to be had with fracking that was going on in South Texas.\"\n\"We\u2019re coming to the end of the bridge,\" Mr. Castro said. He said while he isn\u2019t calling for an immediate\nnational ban on fracking, he supports local communities that do so and called for moving to cleaner\nsources. Mr. Castro won some of his strongest applause with the need to protect low-income communities\nfrom environmental damages.\nANSWER: no\nREASON: The article does not provide a human personal story. It primarily focuses on Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s\nstance on fracking and environmental policies, without delving into any personal anecdotes or experiences.\nSUMMARY:\nEXAMPLE3:\nARTICLE: Greta Thunberg FAILS her \u2019zero emissions\u2019 promise after climate summit moves to Spain\nGreta Thunberg tried really hard to keep her \"zero emissions\" promise, but it has collapsed like\nall hypocritical left-wing plans because it was just too difficult.

Thunberg, 16, has been on a tour of North America to raise awareness for\nclimate change.\nANSWER: no\nREASON: The article does not provide a human story. the article criticizes Greta Thunberg for not being able\nto keep her promise of zero emissions, but it does not mention or provide any private anecdote\nor emotional language that would trigger feelings.\nSUMMARY: [/EX]\n[TASK ]ARTICLE:\n{article} [/TASK ]\nFigure 16: Mixtral prompt for labelling articles with HI stories. {article} represents a placeholder for each of the\narticle samples.

Please provide your REASON justifying your answer. Take into account the criteria below\nto assess each article. Climate change relevant information includes the science behind climate change,\nits impacts, relevant political discussion, climate-related disasters, ways to address climate change, or\nrelated topics. Answer yes, if the article directly addresses one or more of these topics, as its other\nprimary focus. Answer no if the article does not mention climate change, or only indirectly addresses it\n(e.g., one or two mentions of climate change in a poem or a person\u2019s story, who happens to be also climate\nchange activist).

In a\ncomprehensive, large-scale analysis of 4.2 million political\nand 29.6 million non-political ads from 215,030 advertisers,\nwe identify ads correctly detected as political ( true positives ),\nads incorrectly detected ( false positives ), and ads missed by\ndetection ( false negatives ). Facebook\u2019s current enforcement\nappears imprecise: 61% more ads are missed than are de-\ntected worldwide, and 55% of U.S. detected ads are in fact\nnon-political. Detection performance is uneven across coun-\ntries, with some having up to 53 times higher false negative\nrates among clearly political pages than in the U.S. Moreover,\nenforcement appears inadequate for preventing systematic\nviolations of political advertising policies: for example, ad-\nvertisers were able to continue running political ads without\ndisclosing them while they were temporarily prohibited in\nthe U.S. We attribute these \ufb02aws to \ufb01ve gaps in Facebook\u2019s\ncurrent enforcement and transparency implementation, and\nclose with recommendations to improve the security of the\nonline political ad ecosystem.\n1 Introduction\nOnline political advertising is a powerful tool for enabling en-\ngagement in the political process, but with this power comes\nthe risk of abuse that can harm the integrity of the demo-\ncratic process. Scrutiny of major online advertising platforms\nintensi\ufb01ed due to foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. elec-\ntions [87] as well as broader concerns on disinformation, voter\nsuppression, and inauthentic behavior [89].

Platforms therefore developed self-regulatory\npolicies [71] that include verifying and revealing advertisers\u2019\nidentity [48, 57], creating public archives of political ads [6],\nor even banning political ads altogether [1, 64].\nA baseline requirement for platforms to protect integrity\nand reduce harm is then to properly identify advertisements\nthat seek to in\ufb02uence public opinion, and adequately enforce\ntheir policies on those ads and their advertisers. Failing to do\nso correctly, rapidly, and consistently leaves an opportunity\nfor ill-spirited advertisers to impede public scrutiny, spread\nviolating content, and evade restrictions on political ads. Con-\nversely, well-meaning advertisers are disadvantaged if their\nads are unduly made unavailable due to incorrect enforce-\nment, or if they (over-)comply with policies while others do\nnot [72], especially when policies are unclear or ambiguous.\nGiven the large number of submitted ads, platforms usually\ndeploy automated methods for policy review, complemented\nby human review when needed [23, 38, 75].\nIn this paper, we audit whether Facebook makes accurate\nenforcement decisions for ads that may be in scope of its polit-\nical ad1policies, but were not declared as such by the respec-\n1In this paper, we use \u2018political ads\u2019 as shorthand for ads in scope of\nFacebook\u2019s policy, i.e., \u201cads about social issues, elections or politics\u201d [11].\nUSENIX Association 31st USENIX Security Symposium    607\ntive advertisers. Facebook is the most popular social media\nplatform worldwide among users [66] and advertisers [103],\nand its political ad policies and transparency are considered\nto be among the most developed for major technology com-\npanies [71, 101], allowing us to analyze the effectiveness\nof self-regulation through one of the most advanced deploy-\nments. We build a novel large-scale data collection pipeline\nthat retrieves all currently active ads running on Facebook\u2019s\ncore advertising platforms2from the Ad Library , its ad trans-\nparency tool. Our comprehensive and representative data set\ncontains 4.2 million political and 29.6 million non-political\nads from all 215,030 pages3that ran political ads during the\nsecond half of 2020 and beginning of 2021, covering major\nelections in the U.S. and Brazil. We analyze the prevalence\nof ads that Facebook correctly detects to violate policies after\nthey start running ( true positives ), ads that Facebook detects\nbut are not political ( false positives ), and ads that Facebook\nfails to detect even though they are political ( false negatives ).\nIn prior work, the Ad Library has been used to study ad-\nvertisers evading Facebook\u2019s transparency requirements [36],\nwhile other research sought to quantify enforcement errors\nthrough anecdotal evidence [33, 97, 108, 111], or through\ncrowdsourced [96, 102] or self-published [75] ads; however,\nthese studies inherently cover only a small sample of ads. To\nthe best of our knowledge, no previous study has quanti\ufb01ed\ntheperformance of Facebook\u2019s political ad policy enforce-\nment in detecting non-compliance at a large and representa-\ntive scale . A study such as ours is essential to understanding\nwhether Facebook\u2019s current self-regulation effort is suf\ufb01cient\nto maintain the integrity of its political ad ecosystem.\nOverall, we \ufb01nd that policy violations detected after an\nad starts running represent a small share (1.7%) of political\nads on Facebook. Detection happens rather quickly; yet it\nis worth noting that these violating ads failed to be detected\nduring Facebook\u2019s initial ad review, which allowed them to\naccumulate over 2 billion user impressions before being taken\ndown. Unfortunately, this detection of violating ads seems\nto have little visible impact on advertisers. Despite a history\nof violations, we observe that the top violating advertisers\nwere able to continue running new ads and accumulate more\nviolations for long periods of time, even while political ads\nwere banned in the U.S. [1, 70, 94].\nAmbiguities in Facebook\u2019s policies and \ufb02aws in Face-\nbook\u2019s existing detection appear to cause many unrelated\nads to be incorrectly labeled as political: We estimate that\namong U.S. advertisers, 55% of ads detected as \u201cpolitical\u201d\nby Facebook are in fact false positives. Conversely, we iden-\ntify 39% of advertisers in Facebook\u2019s Ad Library Reports\nas clearly political. While such advertisers are subject to a\nblanket rule in Facebook\u2019s ad policy requiring them to declare\nalltheir ads as political, these pages ran a total of 116,963\n2Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and the Audience Network.\n3Anadvertiser runs ads from their Facebook page [6]. In this paper, we\nuse \u2018advertiser\u2019 and \u2018page\u2019 interchangeably.ads that were not declared as political and not detected by\nFacebook. In addition, signi\ufb01cant differences in the rates of\nundetected ads arise between countries: While performance\nis best in the United States at 0.85%, Facebook may fail to\ndetect up to 45% of undeclared political ads in other countries.\nWhen considering only the running ads where Facebook\nneeded to make an enforcement decision, that is, ads not vol-\nuntarily disclosed by their advertisers, we \ufb01nd 61% more ads\nthat are missed than are detected by Facebook within 14 days,\nand 55% of detected ads are likely false positives (Table 1).\nWith more errors than correct decisions, Facebook\u2019s current\nenforcement approach appears inadequate: users are left vul-\nnerable to ads that seek to in\ufb02uence their opinion without\nproper disclosure, while legitimate advertisers regularly see\ntheir ads unjustly taken down. We attribute these \ufb02aws to\ninsuf\ufb01cient attention for an advertiser\u2019s political intent, the\npossibility for advertisers to continue running violating ads,\ninadequate localization in many countries, and ambiguity in\npolicies, worsening transparency. Based on these observa-\ntions, we make a number of recommendations to improve\npolicy enforcement (section 7).\nIn summary, our main contributions are:\n\u2022We develop a novel data collection pipeline through which\nwe obtain a comprehensive and representative view on all\nactive political and non-political ads running between July\n2020 and February 2021 across 215,030 pages (section 4).\n\u2022From an ad-level perspective, we \ufb01nd 1.7% of all \u201cpolitical\u201d\nads to have been detected post-hoc by Facebook, but detec-\ntion is imprecise: we estimate through manual labeling that\nin the U.S., 55% of detected ads were incorrectly marked\nas political ( false positives) and taken down (section 5).\n\u2022From an advertiser perspective, we \ufb01nd that detection of\nviolating ads does not appear to prevent future violations,\nand that Facebook misses 116,963 ads from clearly politi-\ncal advertisers ( false negatives) , with considerably worse\nperformance outside the United States (section 6).\n\u2022We identify \ufb01ve factors where our \ufb01ndings suggest that\nFacebook\u2019s current enforcement and transparency imple-\nmentation is lacking, and suggest improvements that would\nstrengthen enforcement and improve the security of the\nonline political ad ecosystem (section 7).\n2 Background\n2.1 Political ad policy\nFacebook imposes increased authenticity and transparency re-\nquirements for \u201cads about social issues, elections or politics,\u201d\nby requiring advertisers to con\ufb01rm their identity and location\nand declare who funded the ads. These requirements are only\nmandatory and therefore proactively or reactively enforced in\n608    31st USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Association\naround460 countries and territories for ads about social issues,\nelections or politics, and in around 60 additional countries for\nads about elections or politics only [18], with these sets of\ncountries expanding over time. In all other countries, adver-\ntisers are currently \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to get authorized\nand declare ads, but this is voluntary and not enforced [18].\nFacebook considers ads to be \u201cabout social issues, elections\nor politics\u201d if they are [12]:\n\u2022\u201cmade by, on behalf of or about a candidate for public\nof\ufb01ce, a political \ufb01gure, a political party, a political action\ncommittee or advocates for the outcome of an election to\npublic of\ufb01ce; or\n\u2022about any election, referendum or ballot initiative, including\n\"get out the vote\" or election information campaigns; or\n\u2022about any social issue in any place where the ad is being\nrun; or\n\u2022 regulated as political advertising.\u201d\nFacebook further speci\ufb01es \u2018social issues\u2019 as \u201csensitive top-\nics that are heavily debated, may in\ufb02uence the outcome of an\nelection or result in/relate to existing or proposed legislation\u201d\nand requires disclosure for these \u201csocial issue ads that seek to\nin\ufb02uence public opinion\u201d [5]. Facebook de\ufb01nes a list of top-\nlevel \u2018social issues\u2019 per country (where applicable), which\ncan change over time [5]; Facebook further clari\ufb01es these\ntopics with examples of ads that are in and out of scope [56].\nBefore an advertiser can run ads about social issues, elec-\ntions or politics in an applicable country, they must complete\ntheauthorization process there and con\ufb01rm their identity and\nlocation [12, 24, 38, 48]. Once authorized, they can cre-\nate \u2018disclaimers\u2019 to indicate which funding entity (individual,\npage or organization) paid for a given ad [22, 28, 38]. When\nrunning a political ad, the advertiser must then select it as a\n\u201cSpecial Ad Category\u201d [24] and add a disclaimer [24, 38].5\nAs shorthand, whenever we mention \u2018political ads\u2019 we refer\nto \u201cads about social issues, elections or politics\u201d that were\nproperly declared (i.e., having a disclaimer) or detected (i.e.,\nlacking a disclaimer but marked as political by Facebook).\n2.2 Policy enforcement\nFacebook requires advertisers to self-determine that an ad is\nin scope of its ad policy on social issues, elections or politics,\nbut also reviews any other submitted ad for policy compli-\nance [38]. This \u201crelies primarily on automated review (arti\ufb01-\ncial intelligence) [...] and, in some cases, [they] have trained\nglobal teams to review speci\ufb01c ads\u201d [38]. If an undeclared ad\ngets caught during this initial review, it never runs and is not\narchived in the Ad Library; the attempted violation will never\nbe publicly known. This paper excludes such early detections.\n4Lists of countries are inconsistent between the web portal [6] and docu-\nmentation [18].\n5Certain Facebook-vetted news publishers are exempt from declaring ads\neven if their content is political but not opinionated [7, 12].If an undeclared ad passes review and is running, it can\nstill \u201cbe \ufb02agged by AI or reported by [Facebook\u2019s] commu-\nnity\u201d as political [38]. Facebook then \u201cdisapproves\u201d the ad\nretroactively, meaning they deactivate the ad, so it is no longer\nshown to any user. This is the type of ad detection that we\nstudy in this paper. Facebook also archives the violating ad\nin the Ad Library with a message that \u201cthis ad ran without a\ndisclaimer,\u201d regardless of whether the advertiser completed\nthe ad authorization process [4, 6]. While the ad will remain\npublicly archived even when inactive, it will therefore never\nbe known who paid for the ad. Violating pages may also be\nrestricted from running new (political) ads or be disabled [12].\n2.3 Transparency tools\nFacebook emphasizes transparency as a means to hold them\nand their advertisers accountable [38], enabling users to be\naware of who is trying to in\ufb02uence them as well as enabling\njournalists, organizations, and researchers (including us) to\naudit online political advertising [38]. To support this trans-\nparency, Facebook provides three core tools [113]:\n1.TheAd Library [8] is a web portal where users can search\nall currently active ads for any Facebook page in any coun-\ntry, as well as all active and inactive ads about social issues,\nelections or politics. Only for the latter, provided metadata\nincludes the disclaimer provided (if any), the identity of\nan authorized advertiser and how this was veri\ufb01ed, and\nbinned estimates of ad spend, reach, and impressions. A\nnon-political ad disappears from the Ad Library once it\nbecomes inactive; a political ad is archived for 7 years [6].\nAppendix A shows how the web portal displays ads.\n2.The Ad Library API [9] provides an interface for auto-\nmated queries for all active and inactive ads about social\nissues, elections or politics for any page in a given country.\n3.The Ad Library Report [10] aggregates advertiser data\nfor all ads about social issues, elections or politics for\ncountries where Facebook requires disclosure, listing all\npages with at least one political ad in the chosen time span.\n2.4 Related work\nPrior work used crowdsourced or self-published ads to analyze\nthe correctness of Facebook\u2019s political ad policy enforcement.\nSilva et al. [96] developed a system to crowdsource Facebook\nads in Brazil and classify them as political using a supervised\nmachine learning model. Across 38,110 ads during the 2018\nBrazilian elections, this model found 835 ads (2.2%) that had\nnot been correctly declared nor detected as political. Matias\net al. [75] conducted an audit study on Facebook and Google\u2019s\npolitical ad policy enforcement through self-published ads,\n\ufb01nding that Facebook applies their policies too restrictively,\nleading to 10 mistakenly prohibited ads (out of 238), while\nGoogle prohibited no ads. Sosnovik and Goga [102] com-\npared platform, advertiser, and user perceptions of the def-\nUSENIX Association 31st USENIX Security Symposium    609\ninition of online political ads on Facebook through 63,400\ncrowdsourced ads labeled by volunteers. They found that\nsocial issue ads in particular see the highest error rate due\nto unclear policies, although users largely perceive them as\npolitical, and observe disagreement between automated clas-\nsi\ufb01ers for political ads trained on differently sourced sets of\n(non-)political ads. Moreover, several media reports have\ngiven anecdotal evidence of ads missed by Facebook\u2019s en-\nforcement, both from politicians [33, 97, 108] and social\nissue organizations [97, 111]. Using the Ad Library, Cecere\net al. [23] found that COVID-19-related ads were more likely\nto be detected by Facebook, suggesting that these may have\nbeen falsely detected, and that ad policies were confusing to\nadvertisers. Our study quanti\ufb01es the performance of Face-\nbook\u2019s enforcement on a larger and more representative scale\nthan these previous studies, as we gather all active ads for all\npages with at least one political ad, to analyze the prevalence\nofboth false positives and false negatives.\nFrom a transparency perspective, Edelson et al. [37] de-\nscribed and compared the efforts by Facebook, Google, and\nTwitter on a technical level. They later conducted a secu-\nrity analysis on transparency for Facebook\u2019s Ad Library in\nthe U.S. [36], \ufb01nding that adversarial political advertisers\ncould evade transparency requirements through erroneous dis-\nclaimers and undisclosed coordinated behavior. We assess\nhow advertisers may evade declaring their ads as political\naltogether, through which they also avoid transparency.\nFurther audits of Facebook\u2019s advertising platform found\nthat advertisers can exploit ad targeting to infer private or sen-\nsitive user information [43, 50\u201352, 109], or to deploy highly\ntargeted and biased ad campaigns [16, 49, 87], with users re-\nceiving inadequate targeting explanations from Facebook [16].\nFacebook\u2019s ad delivery may also skew which users see which\nads, potentially leading to discrimination based on gender or\nrace [14, 60, 69], including for political ads [15].\n3 Enforcement Errors and Their Impact\nWe introduce the two error types that affect the security of\nFacebook\u2019s political ad platform, i.e., the \u2018threat model,\u2019 and\ndescribe the actors that may either exploit these errors to\ninduce harm, or that are themselves harmed by these errors.\nFirst, ads may not be detected as political by Facebook, i.e.,\narefalse negatives . Once they are allowed to run, these missed\nads harm the integrity of the online political ad ecosystem and\nof Facebook\u2019s transparency efforts. They result from Face-\nbook failing to discover ads that advertisers did not properly\ndeclare, whether deliberately to avoid scrutiny or acciden-\ntally due to misinterpreting (ambiguous) policies [33, 97, 102,\n111]. Malicious advertisers may have an incentive to not\ndeclare politically motivated ads, as this relieves them of the\naccompanying restrictions. They would not need to get au-\nthorized by Facebook (requiring identi\ufb01cation) nor display\nwho paid for the ad [38]. Moreover, users will be unawarethat the advertiser is attempting to in\ufb02uence them as the ad\ninterface will not re\ufb02ect that the ad is political [38], and they\nmight be shown the ad even if they requested to see fewer\npolitical ads [58]. The advertiser can then abuse these \ufb02aws\nto spread disinformation or prohibited content (e.g., voter\nsuppression), or engage in \u2018coordinated inauthentic behav-\nior\u2019 where accounts conspire to run in\ufb02uence campaigns [36,\n89], without being publicly identi\ufb01ed. Moreover, such an\nadvertiser can circumvent bans on political ads, as was (tem-\nporarily) the case after the 2020 U.S. elections [1]. Finally,\nadvertisers may want to evade transparency and accountabil-\nity: undetected ads disappear from the Ad Library once they\nbecome inactive, leaving researchers and journalists unable\nto discover policy-violating content or hold advertisers and\nFacebook accountable for compliance with and enforcement\nof the political ad policy.\nSecond, ads may be incorrectly detected as political by\nFacebook, i.e., are false positives . As detected ads are taken\ndown and may even result in pages being restricted from run-\nning ads or being deleted, Facebook reduces the availability\nof legitimate advertisements through these errors, whether the\nads concern social issues (but do not in\ufb02uence public opinion)\nor are purely commercial. On the one hand, these can result\nfrom Facebook applying their policies too restrictively or er-\nroneously and detecting ads that are in fact not political. For\nexample, Facebook\u2019s enforcement errors were found to hinder\npublic health messages related to COVID-19 [23, 95] and vac-\ncines [63, 79, 104]; were thought to unduly insinuate political\ndivision for social themes [47, 53, 80, 90, 99, 100, 114]; or\nresulted from false name matches [45, 74\u201376]. On the other\nhand, advertisers themselves may introduce false positives\nby (voluntarily) over-declaring ads that are not in scope of\nthe political ad policy [102], possibly due to incorrectly or\noverly cautiously interpreting this policy or because they fear\nthe ad will otherwise be erroneously detected and taken down.\nFalse detections also erode trust in enforcement as a whole,\nas they suggest that the automated decision models are unable\nto properly distinguish political ads, and further reduce the\nquality of input data to these models.\nThroughout this paper, we label ads as follows:\nConsidered as political by\nadvertiser Facebook us Label Type\n3 N/A 3 declared True positive\n3 N/A 7 (over-)declared False positive\n7 3 3 detected* True positive\n7 3 7 (over-)detected* False positive\n7 7 3 undetected* False negative\n7 7 7 \u2013 True negative\n7 (3OR3) *undeclared\n610    31st USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Association\n4 Data Collection\nTo understand the dynamics and possible shortcomings of\nFacebook\u2019s ad policy enforcement, we must capture the full\nlifespan for all relevant ads. The Ad Library API is insuf\ufb01-\ncient for this purpose: it only returns ads once they are known\nto be political, which crucially excludes the period before\nFacebook enforces upon an ad, and omits ads that Facebook\nnever enforces upon altogether. We therefore develop a novel\nlarge-scale data collection pipeline using the Ad Library web\nportal, which lists all active ads for a given page, regardless of\nwhether they are political. In this section, we \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the\nscope of our study and present our data collection method. We\nthen describe and validate the resulting data set, and discuss\nthe ethics of our data collection as well as the impact of its\nlimitations on our study.\n4.1 Scope and method\nOur data collection started on July 9, 2020, and was initialized\nwith all pages that were present in any Ad Library Report for\nthe past week since April 21, 2020, i.e., all pages that had\npublished any political ads relatively recently. Until January\n12, 2021, we continuously added pages newly appearing in\nthe most recently available Ad Library Report. We consider\nthe resulting set of pages as the scope of our study. We\ncontinued collecting ads for these pages for four more weeks,\ni.e., until February 9, 2021. This period therefore covered the\npause on political ads in the United States after the elections\non November 3, 2020 [1]. Our data collection covered all\n71 countries with an Ad Library report at the time of our\nmeasurement. Appendix G lists the dates when reports were\n\ufb01rst available and when we started tracking their pages.\nFor every page that is in scope, we scrape its ads from the\nAd Library web portal [8] with a target period of 24 hours,\nas well as page metadata with a target period of 14 days. We\nrequest all currently active ads which had impressions in the\nprevious 7 days in any country; we do not apply any other\n\ufb01lter. Additionally, for every ad, we gather its contents and\nmetadata 14 days after its \ufb01rst observation through the ad\nsnapshot tool used in the Ad Library API. As this endpoint\nreports the ad\u2019s most recent state, even if already inactive, this\nallows us to observe any enforcement by Facebook within 14\ndays of the ad\u2019s publication. For an ad detected within 14\ndays, we assume that ad detection led to its deactivation. We\nthen calculate the activity period of an ad as the time between\nits \ufb01rst and last (daily) observation, assuming that the ad was\npublished just before the former and detected just after the\nlatter, with a 24-hour margin due to our scraping frequency.\nMoreover, whenever we analyze the activity period of an\nad, we require that we likely captured the full lifespan of\nan ad, and therefore exclude ads active during the \ufb01nal four\nweeks of our data collection (reducing right censoring) or\nbefore/during our \ufb01rst scrape for a given page (reducing leftTable 2: Page/ad counts for the top 10 and other countries.\nFor spend and impressions, we calculate the lower and upper\nbound based on the ranges available in our data.\nfor political ads\nCountry # pages O with ad # ads # adsSpend\n(106USD)Impressions\n(109)\nU.S. 90,018 69,815 21,934,716 1,902,473 810\u20131,146 45\u201353\nBrazil 39,675 33,459 1,039,109 696,612 13\u201327 8.4\u201310\nIndia 13,798 10,722 779,670 121,269 2.9\u20133.6 3.9\u20134.4\nItaly 11,758 10,049 384,808 124,767 6.5\u201322 2.7\u20133.2\nU.K. 10,558 8,016 2,456,921 96,660 17\u201333 2.4\u20132.8\nGermany 10,223 8,501 782,078 121,482 13\u201330 2.8\u20133.2\nUkraine 8,632 7,437 315,425 133,006 3.2\u201317 3.4\u20134.0\nMexico 7,229 6,145 275,028 88,406 4.9\u20136.9 3.8\u20134.4\nCanada 6,352 5,198 529,107 76,076 13\u201322 1.8\u20132.1\nRomania 5,708 4,927 189,389 104,228 5.8\u20139.1 2.8\u20133.3\nOther 61,873 50,761 5,142,518 726,382 54\u2013109 18\u201321\nTotal 265,824 215,030 33,828,769 4,191,361 944\u20131,426 95\u2013112\n110100 1k10k100k 1M\nNumber of ads0102030405060708090100Cumulative proportion\nof pages (%)\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n% of pages, sorted by # ads0102030405060708090100Cumulative proportion\nof ads (%)All ads\nPolitical ads\nFigure 1: Distributions of observed ads and pages.\ncensoring). Finally, we retrieve all political ads that were\nactive during our measurement period through the Ad Library\nAPI on March 30, 2021, in the subset of countries where\nAPI data was available to us (covering 80% of scraped ads,\nAppendix G).\n4.2 Data set description\nIn total, we observed 33.8 million unique ads during our mea-\nsurement, of which 4.2 million were declared or detected as\npolitical (Table 2). As Facebook only provides ranges for\nad spend and impressions for political ads, we estimate that\nthese had around 100 billion impressions and cost around 1 to\n1.4 billion U.S. dollars. We see that United States advertisers\ndominate our data in terms of the number of ads placed over-\nall, as well as in political ad count, spend, and impressions\nuntil the 2020 U.S. elections (Appendix B), when Facebook\nrestricted U.S. political ads [1].\nWe observed ads across 215,030 pages (by de\ufb01nition, all\nof these pages had at least one political ad ever); we never\nobserved any ads for 50,794 additional pages in scope. Small\nadvertisers represent the majority of these pages: the median\npage posts fewer than 6 ads and 1 political ad respectively\n(Figure 1). Conversely, a small percentage of pages account\nfor the majority of ads: the top 20% advertisers posted 92.5%\nof all ads and 81.9% of all political ads. Distributions are\nsimilar between U.S. and non-U.S. advertisers. To conserve\nUSENIX Association 31st USENIX Security Symposium    611\nresources, we manually analyzed the largest advertisers up\nto then on four occasions (Appendix B), and discarded those\nthat we considered unlikely to intentionally publish political\nads. Before discarding, these advertisers placed 5,862,808\nads (17.3% of all ads). Our analysis in Appendix C con\ufb01rms\nthat these pages minimally placed political ads (0.011% of\ntheir observed ads), supporting our decision to discard them.\n4.3 Data set validation\nWe assess the coverage of our data set both internally and\nexternally to determine how often we were unable to retrieve\nall available ads. As an internal validation, we compare the\nexpected number of available ads included in Facebook portal\ndata to the number of actually observed ads. As an external\nvalidation, we compare the observed political ads with those\nretrieved from the Ad Library API.\nWe summarize our coverage in Figure 2. We missed 19.8%\nof ad observations, most often due to a limitation in Face-\nbook\u2019s systems: even though the portal is able to report that a\npage has over 50,000 ads, it fails to actually load more than\n7,800 ads per scrape. Very large advertisers therefore bear the\nbulk of missing observations. We also miss the \ufb01rst ads from\nnewly seen advertisers due to a delay of usually three days\nbetween a page\u2019s \ufb01rst political ad impression and its appear-\nance in the Ad Library Report [32]. Otherwise, discrepancies\nare due to our scraping frequency or setup: we miss ads that\ndisappear during a scrape, that only appear between scrapes\nor after the last scrape, or when the scraper (partially) failed.\nFor 7.5% of ads, we could not make the 14-day snapshot:\nthis is largely due to resources being unavailable or restricted\nthrough Facebook\u2019s snapshot tool, or because the 14-day in-\nterval was outside our measurement period. Finally, for 184\npages (0.07%), we failed to retrieve page metadata.\nBased on the maximum number of missed observations per\npage, we estimate to have missed at least an additional 6.4%\nof ads. Weighted by the observed proportion of political ads\nper page, we estimate to have missed 11.4% of political ad\nobservations. We note that the (unknown) number of unique\nads that we were unable to retrieve is signi\ufb01cantly lower\nthan the number of missed ad observations, since many ads\nare active for more than one day. Finally, based on the API\ndata, we missed around 1 million political ads (24.8%), with\nan estimated combined spend between 188 and 550 million\nUSD, and 24 to 31 billion impressions. While missing data\nmay introduce risks to research validity [46], our \ufb01ndings\nare lower bounds mainly calculated in the aggregate, which\nare less affected by our data gaps. We therefore believe that\nour data and results remain suf\ufb01ciently representative for the\nFacebook political ad ecosystem.All ads Political ads\nSuccessful ad observations\n285,804,497 obs.Political ad observations\n28,023,938 obs.\nUnexpected observations\n53,163 (0.02%)\nMissed ad observations\n56,692,679 obs.

Our data collection does\nnot affect any non-advertiser Facebook users and we do not\nobserve any personally identi\ufb01able information on them. Our\nresearch received an IRB exemption as it does not involve\nhuman subjects. As part of publicly available metadata, we\ncollect the disclaimer that the advertiser provides to Facebook\nfor the ad authorization process [48]; in the case of individuals,\nthis may include personally identi\ufb01able information such as\ntheir legal name. We only process this data in the aggregate\nand do not use it to identify any individual. Similarly, we\ndo not name any speci\ufb01c advertiser to avoid in\ufb02icting harm\nresulting from \ufb02aws in Facebook\u2019s enforcement.\nWe collect only publicly accessible data. As Facebook\nstates that \u201cmore than 2 million people visit the Ad Library\nevery month\u201d [3], we do not expect this data collection to\nsigni\ufb01cantly affect the availability of the Ad Library, and\nwe did not observe any service outage possibly caused by\nour scraping. While Facebook\u2019s \u2018Automated Data Collection\nTerms\u2019 [17] may prohibit scraping, we believe that our re-\nsearch is in the public interest, and that its societal bene\ufb01ts\njustify the technical resources consumed from Facebook, as\nwell as potential reputational and \ufb01nancial harm on Facebook.\nInstitutions, civil society organizations, and researchers have\npreviously called for improved transparency for all ads [2, 26,\n612    31st USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Association\n35, 39, 59, 62, 64, 65, 71, 88, 110], con\ufb01rming the value\nof our data set. We share our data and methods with other\nresearchers at https://osf.io/7tw3e/ . In the context of\nprior work, we already communicated with Facebook to dis-\ncuss their ad review and transparency, and presented to them\nthe overall issues and recommendations that we also analyze\nin this paper.\n4.5 Limitations\nThe de\ufb01nition of our scope leads us to only track pages with at\nleast one known political ad (declared or detected) as recorded\nin the Ad Library Report. If a page never gets caught or is\nexempt (news pages [7]), we will therefore not track its ads,\npotentially missing their false negatives. Likewise, we cannot\ncover advertisers in countries where declaration is voluntary,\nas Facebook does not publish an Ad Library Report there [6].\nAs quanti\ufb01ed in subsection 4.3, we do not achieve full cov-\nerage of the ads published by advertisers within our scope. On\nthe one hand, coverage is affected by the trade-off between\nlimited resources on our side and the large number of pages\nin scope. The 24-hour scraping period means we miss ads\nthat were active only between two scrapes, and limits the\ngranularity of observed activity periods. Our snapshot delay\nleads us to miss ad status changes beyond 14 days. How-\never, we consider any changes after 14 days less likely to\nbe due to Facebook\u2019s own enforcement system,6but rather\ndue to external reporting. We also request ads shown in any\ncountry; Facebook provides a \ufb01lter by country, but this would\nprohibitively multiply the required resources.7We therefore\nassign pages and their ads to a country based on a heuristic,\ni.e., top spend on political ads. On the other hand, delays,\n\ufb02aws and changes in Facebook\u2019s systems further reduce cov-\nerage. Delays in the publication of the Ad Library Report [32]\nand a limit on the number of retrievable ads cause us to par-\ntially miss ads from newly added and very large advertisers,\nrespectively. We also experience infrequent failures of our\nscrapers, due to changed request methods or unavailable re-\nsources, or race conditions during one scrape (e.g., leading\nto duplicate ads). Beyond these unobserved ads in scope, we\ndo not know the total number of ads on Facebook, which\nprevents us from quantifying true negatives and calculating\nmetrics that depend on it. However, we expect true negatives\nto be much more prevalent, and therefore select classi\ufb01cation\nmetrics that are more robust against this class imbalance.\nFinally, limitations result from Facebook\u2019s transparency\nimplementation. Without full metadata on all ads, we can-\nnot quantify the impact in terms of spend and impressions\nof undetected political ads. We also have no visibility into\nads that are caught during initial review and are therefore pre-\n6Facebook started its pause on political ads 7 days before the 2020\nU.S. election, a.o., to \u201cre-review[ ads] for policy violations\u201d [107].\n7However, we \ufb01nd that this \ufb01lter can also be unreliable, with some ads\nonly being available when no country \ufb01lter is set.vented from running altogether. More abstractly, we rely on\nFacebook\u2019s Ad Library functioning properly, i.e, returning the\nactual, complete set of (non-)political ads from all pages [21,\n110, 112]. While we have no reason to believe this is not the\ncase, we also have no way to con\ufb01rm this for our data set,\ndue to a lack of transparency into Facebook\u2019s architecture.\nCrowdsourced ads may allow to audit the accuracy of the Ad\nLibrary, albeit not completely [21, 30]. Moreover, while we\nare the \ufb01rst to conduct large-scale data collection through the\nweb portal, researchers and organizations have documented\nconsistency, completeness, and reliability issues with the Ad\nLibrary API [22, 25, 32, 36, 39, 41, 91, 93]. These chal-\nlenges in comprehensively obtaining all currently active ads\nultimately harm Facebook\u2019s transparency efforts.\n5 Ad-level Enforcement\nWe \ufb01rst examine enforcement of individual ads, independent\nfrom the advertiser. We start by quantifying the prevalence\nof enforcement, that is, how frequently Facebook is taking\ndown ads for not having the required disclaimers, and deter-\nmine the exposure that violating ads had before detection.\nWe then survey how often an enforcement decision made by\nFacebook is appropriate, especially with regard to ads that\nlikely should not have been taken down ( false positives ) and\nwhere incorrect enforcement harmed advertisers.\n5.1 Current ad policy enforcement\nWithin our measurement data, 72,678 ads were marked at\nsome point as \u2018detected,\u2019 i.e., political but not properly de-\nclared, within 14 days after the ad\u2019s \ufb01rst activity. These\ndetected ads therefore represent a minor share (1.7%) of all\n4.2 million observed political ads. Edelson et al. [36] reported\na 9.7% detection rate for May 2018\u2013June 2019, suggesting\npolicy awareness and compliance may have since improved.\nMoreover, Facebook has stated that \u201cbetween March 1[, 2021]\nand Election Day, [they] rejected about 3.3 million ad sub-\nmissions that targeted the US without completing the autho-\nrization process before they could run\u201d [3], suggesting that\nFacebook\u2019s initial ad review already catches most violations,\nalthough the lack of detail makes a reliable comparison dif-\n\ufb01cult (e.g., authorization may be subject to separate review,\nand an advertiser could try and resubmit an ad until it passes).\nNext, we analyze whether Facebook prevents violating ads\nfrom gaining much exposure by measuring how quickly Face-\nbook takes down an ad that should have been declared as\npolitical. Detection of ads that slipped through the initial ad\nreview is relatively fast (Figure 3): 40% of ads were detected\nwithin less than 1 day, with the median activity period being\nless than 2 days. Detected ads are also active for shorter peri-\nods than any political ad, for which the median activity period\nis less than 3 days, suggesting that ads are primarily detected\nwhile they are still active. However, violating ads may still\nUSENIX Association 31st USENIX Security Symposium    613\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14\nNumber of days since first active observation0255075100Cumulative\nincidence (%)Time until detection\nActivity period across all political adsFigure 3: Activity period for detected and all political ads\nwhere we likely observed the full lifespan (subsection 4.1)\nand observed detections within 14 days.\nenjoy signi\ufb01cant exposure in budget, impressions, and time.\nWe estimate the detected ads to have accumulated spending\nbetween 12.2 and 20.7 million U.S. dollars and between 2.1\nand 2.4 billion impressions, i.e., instances where a user saw\nthe ad without the proper context that it was political. 5,885\nads (8.1%) were active for over a week, meaning detection\noccurred very late. Moreover, we \ufb01nd 49,263 ads that were\nlikely detected only after they became inactive, as they be-\ncame inactive within 14 days, were not yet marked as political\nafter 14 days, but were present in the Ad Library API. The\nadvertiser could therefore display their violating ad for the\ndesired duration. These 55,148 combined detections do not\nprevent most or any user harm, as most or all intended ad\nimpressions still occur. Instead, they are only useful for the\nsecondary goal of transparency (as the ads are then included\nin the Ad Library) and for any potential disciplinary measures\ntaken against the page.\n5.2 Ads incorrectly detected as political\nWhen Facebook takes down ads for a lack of disclosure of\ntheir political nature, some of these decisions are incorrect,\ni.e.,false positives . For example, the takedown of 1,413 ads\n(1.16% of all detected ads) was later undone, possibly after\nan appeal by the advertiser. These re\ufb02ect admissions by Face-\nbook that the ads were false positives and should not have\nbeen disabled. To study false positives more systematically,\nwe labeled a randomly selected sample of 300 correctly de-\nclared and 300 detected ads. We restricted these samples\nto advertisers in the United States to ensure that annotators\ncould interpret ad text and context. Three authors determined\nwhether each ad was within or outside the scope of Face-\nbook\u2019s political ad policy. They were instructed to adhere as\nclosely as possible to Facebook\u2019s de\ufb01nition, i.e., not apply\ntheir own interpretation of what should be a political ad. In a\nsubsequent meeting, the annotators revisited disagreed-upon\nads, and reassigned a \ufb01nal agreed-upon label in the case of\nsimple labeling errors (agreement on the de\ufb01nition, but for\nexample a missed reference to a politician). Otherwise, if they\nconsidered Facebook\u2019s de\ufb01nition too ambiguous, in particular\non whether an ad sought to in\ufb02uence public opinion, they\nrecorded \u201cdisagreement\u201d as the \ufb01nal outcome. Using Krip-pendorff\u2019s a[68], we achieve an inter-rater reliability of 0:81,\ni.e., suf\ufb01ciently strong agreement for reliable conclusions.\nTable 3 lists the results of our labeling. For declared ads,\na false positive indicates that an advertiser unnecessarily de-\nclared that ad. Across our sample, we observe 3.3% over-\ndeclared ads, suggesting the practice is rare. 80% of declared\nads are related to politics and elections, which are clearly in\nscope of Facebook\u2019s ad policy and should therefore be de-\nclared. Across all observed ads, Facebook does not appear\nto retroactively mark declared ads as non-political, i.e., Face-\nbook does not (need to) check whether a declared ad falls\nwithin the scope of its policy. For detected ads, a false posi-\ntive indicates over-enforcement by Facebook, unduly taking\ndown the ad. Across our sample, a majority of detected ads\n(55%) should not have been enforced upon; if we extrapolate\nthis rate to all detected ads, 67,433 ads should not have been\ntaken down. This suggests that Facebook\u2019s ad detection is\noverly aggressive. Edelson et al. [36] observed a 79% false\npositive rate through a similar manual analysis, corroborating\nour \ufb01nding that this rate may be very high.\nThe annotators also described the ad topic, using an induc-\ntively developed codebook that was aligned in their meeting\n(Appendix E). 24% of false positive detected ads concern\ncommercial products or services, and it was not immediately\nobvious why Facebook detected those ads as political. Among\nads where the likely cause of error was more discernible, most\nerrors concerned COVID-19-related and health ads, for which\nthe ambiguity in the de\ufb01nition of \u2018social issues\u2019 (\u201cseek to in-\n\ufb02uence public opinion\u201d) makes confusion for advertisers and\nFacebook\u2019s review more understandable. It appears that these\npolicy ambiguities account for most errors; we attribute only 6\nfalse positives to a likely false \u201ckeyword\u201d match (e.g., a shop\ncalled \u2018Mayors\u2019). Matias et al. [75] observed a 4.2% false\npositive rate across ambiguous issue ads and false matches.\nOur \ufb01ndings suggest that in addition, commercial ads, where\nthe reason for detection is less clear, represent a signi\ufb01cant\nshare of false positives. Finally, the annotators could not\nagree on the label for 5% of declared and 23% of detected\nads, highlighting the dif\ufb01culty of interpreting Facebook\u2019s ad\npolicy consistently. This disagreement mainly involved ads\nrelating to social issues, where it was unclear whether the\nad sought to in\ufb02uence public opinion, or ads with incidental\nreferences to politics, such as a candidate\u2019s yard sign being\nvisible in a real estate listing.\nSummary We \ufb01nd that detected politicaladswithoutadis-\nclaimer account for only asmall share (1.7%) of observed\npolitical ads, and that Facebook detected them rather quickly.\nStill, we see 55,148 detected ads running for more than a week\nor for their full intended duration, making detection largely\nineffective at preventing users from seeing these violating\npolitical ads. In addition, detection appears to be very impre-\ncise: we \ufb01nd that 55% ofdetected adsintheU.S. should not\nhave been taken down ( false positives ), harming advertisers\nby making their legitimate ads unavailable to users.\n614    31st USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Association\nTable 3: Manual categorization of 300 declared and 300 detected ads, grouped by annotators\u2019 assessment of whether these are\npolitical per Facebook\u2019s ad policy. \f: Related to social issues.

We start by describing how\nadvertisers react to takedowns of a page\u2019s ads. We then clas-\nsify pages to describe the current composition of Facebook\u2019s\nAd Library based on a page\u2019s likely political intent, and iden-\ntify likely false negatives as ads published by pages with a\nclear political purpose that Facebook failed to detect.\n6.1 Reaction to enforcement\nWe \ufb01rst analyze whether advertisers are able to repeatedly\nviolate Facebook\u2019s ad policy. We observe detections of un-\ndeclared political ads for 13,900 pages (5.2%), again lower\nthan the 68.3% rate observed by Edelson et al. [36] for May\n2018\u2013June 2019. Overall counts of detected ads per pagewere low (Figure 4, left). However, 7,535 pages (54.2%) did\nnot declare any political ads, so their only political ads were\nthose that were detected (Figure 4, top), suggesting they may\nhave unintentionally posted ads that were deemed to be polit-\nical, possibly due to insuf\ufb01cient awareness of or ambiguity\nin ad policies. No advertisers appear to have placed many\nand mostly political ads without declaring them (Figure 4,\ntop right); high absolute counts of detected ads are an artifact\nof an overall high volume of ads (Figure 4, bottom right). It\ndoes not appear that Facebook frequently banned pages as\nan enforcement action after detecting undeclared ads: only\n458 pages were deleted some time after an ad detection, or\n3.3% of pages with detected undeclared ads. (For reference,\n7.2% of all pages in scope were ever deleted.) 373 of these\n458 pages even continued placing new ads between their last\ntaken down ad and deletion of the page.\nNext, we analyze whether advertisers declare more ads\nafter ads have been taken down, i.e., whether Facebook\u2019s en-\nforcement increased adherence to its ad policies. Ideally, this\nreaction should prevent future violations and protect users\nfrom being exposed to unmarked political ads. Out of the\ntop 75 pages ranked by detected ad count (listed by class\nin Figure 5), 22 increased their proportion of ads declared\nas political after being detected ( 1\r\u20134\r): 5 started declaring\ncontinuously ( 1\r) and 5 others only shortly did not declare\n(2\r). However, increased declaration was only short-lived\nfor 12 pages ( 3\r\u20134\r). Furthermore, 48 pages ( 5\r\u20136\r) barely\ndeclared any ad as political and often had a steady stream\nof violating ads taken down by Facebook. (This includes 39\nnews aggregator pages ( 6\r) that are likely not exempt from\ndeclaration, unlike more traditional news organizations [7].)\nThis suggests that the most frequent offenders (in absolute\nterms) did not face any durable restriction in their ability to\nrun ads as a potential disciplinary measure imposed by Face-\nbook to increase compliance. Despite sometimes frequent\nand prolonged violations, all pages in the top 75 continued\npublishing ads after detection.\nAfter the 2020 U.S. election, Facebook temporarily disal-\nlowed political ads on their platform [1].

Each row corresponds to an advertiser, with\nshades of blue indicating the proportion of ads the respective advertiser declared as political over time (aggregated daily). Red\nmarkers at the bottom of each row denote when ads were detected and taken down by Facebook. Advertisers are grouped into\nseven classes (denoted by #\r) based on their reaction to enforcement (start/increase/resume declaring political ads) and the\nduration of increased declaration (continuously/temporarily/no reaction). For example, group 6\rcontains advertisers that have a\nsteady stream of ads taken down by Facebook but do not show any apparent reaction to enforcement (they continue not declaring\nany ads as political). These advertisers are news aggregator pages; we show three examples and omit 36 similar pages (*).\nadvertise, 5 of the top 75 violating pages continued running\nads but stopped declaring them as political ( 7\r), even though\nthey were clearly of political nature as they had previously\ndeclared (nearly) all their ads as political. Even though these\n5 pages advertised merchandise such as T-shirts with political\nmessages, or were advocating for civil rights and environ-\nmental policy, Facebook only detected and took down 3%\nof their ads running after the election. Overall, 1,018 pages\nran 71,426 undeclared ads after the U.S. election, whereas\nthey only ran declared political ads before then. These pages\ndid not appear to be deterred by the political ad pause, and\nFacebook did not effectively prevent them from running ads\nthat were very likely political. This failure of enforcement\nrendered the ad pause less effective, and put these violating\npages at an unfair advantage over advertisers who did comply\nand ceased running political ads as required [70, 94].\n6.2 Current enforcement by advertiser class\nFacebook\u2019s policy on ads that require disclosure is broader\nthan just ads published by obvious political actors such as\nparties or candidates [64]. Consequently, the Ad Library\nReport also lists advertisers beyond those actors, such as those\nplacing ads about social issues, in partnership with (on behalf\nof) political actors, or with (non-partisan) calls to vote, next\nto advertisers with incorrectly detected ads (subsection 5.2).6.2.1 Page classi\ufb01cation\nTo quantify the prevalence of different types of advertisers,\nwe match internal and external data sources with observed\nFacebook page metadata to classify pages into one of four top-\nics. If a page is listed in multiple sources, we select its main\nclass using the following order: (1) political, (2) government,\n(3) media, and (4) issue-related.\n\u2022We retrieve political committees for the 2020 U.S. elections\nfrom Facebook\u2019s Ad Spending Tracker [106] (matched on\npage name) and the OpenSecrets project of the Center for\nResponsive Politics [85] (matched on page ID).\n\u2022We retrieve political candidates and parties registered for\nthe 2020 Brazilian municipal elections from the Superior\nElectoral Court [98] (matched on CNPJ).\n\u2022We retrieve pages who identi\ufb01ed themselves during Face-\nbook\u2019s advertiser authorization process through a Federal\nElection Commission identi\ufb01cation number (FEC ID) for\nU.S. political pages or U.S. government credentials for U.S.\ngovernment pages from our data (matched on page ID).\n\u2022We retrieve media organizations from Media Bias/Fact\nCheck [77] and NewsGuard [83] (matched on page alias),\nwith local pages for large news aggregators manually added.\n\u2022We retrieve U.S. nonpro\ufb01t (tax-exempt) organizations as\npotential issue-related pages from National Center for Char-\nitable Statistics [20, 81] and Internal Revenue Service [40]\n616    31st USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Association\ndata (matched on disclaimer and ZIP code).\n\u2022We retrieve manually curated Explore lists [86] containing\npolitical,government, media, and issue-related pages from\nCrowdTangle [29] (matched on page ID).\n\u2022We enumerate the most common Facebook page categories\nfor pages within the previous data sets, manually select\nthose categories that are suf\ufb01ciently speci\ufb01c to a class, and\nthen retrieve all pages within those categories (Appendix F)\nfrom our data (matched on page ID).\n\u2022We retrieve all pages that completed Facebook\u2019s advertiser\nauthorization process from our data (matched on page ID).\nOverall, 59.7% of pages fall into one of the four categories.\nWe distinguish an additional 11.3% of pages outside these\ntopics that completed the authorization process, as this implies\na genuine intent to at least sometimes place political ads.\n6.2.2 Distribution of political ads over classes\nWe \ufb01rst analyze the composition of advertisers listed in the\nAd Library Report globally, i.e., within our scope of pages\nwith at least one recent (declared or detected) political ad\n(subsection 4.1). We expect mostly political and issue pages\nto appear in the Report; however, based on our classi\ufb01cation\n(Table 4), \u2018obvious\u2019 political advertisers only represent 39%\nof measured pages, with a further 8% that are issue advertisers;\nthese combined account for 73% of observed political ads.\nOnly 53% of all pages were authorized to declare ads as\npolitical. Unauthorized pages may have no political motive,\nsuggesting they inadvertently published ads that fall under\nthe political ad policy,8or their ads were incorrectly detected\nas political by Facebook. Alternatively, they may be political\nactors that refuse to authorize themselves, or may be unable\nto do so due to Facebook\u2019s policies, e.g., if they are outside\nthe country in which they want to run political ads [36].\nWe further analyze whether certain page classes are more\nlikely to have such \u201cunintentionally\u201d undeclared and detected\nads by comparing detected with overall ad counts (Table 4).\nGovernment (6% detected vs. 4% overall) and issue (16%\nvs. 8%) pages are overrepresented, hinting at discrepancies\nbetween their and Facebook\u2019s understanding of which ads\nshould be declared. Media pages account for the most de-\ntected ads in absolute numbers (34%), but place ads in simi-\nlarly high volumes (35% of all ads). 46% of authorized pages\nand 21% of political pages failed to declare at least one ad that\nwas later detected, even though Facebook\u2019s ad policy requires\nall ads from or on behalf of political \ufb01gures to be disclosed.\nNext, we measure the proportions of political ads over all\nads per page and class. If an advertiser is political in nature,\nwe expect them to have 100% political ads, either because\nthey properly declare all their ads or because Facebook de-\ntects their undeclared ads. Indeed, this largely holds for iden-\nti\ufb01ed political pages (Table 4), where 81% had only political\n8These ads then likely triggered inclusion in the Report; due to delays in\nthis inclusion, we cannot observe these one-off political ads (subsection 4.5).\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nProportion of ads that are (declared or detected as) political (%)0102030405060708090100Cumulative distribution of pages (%)Pages with at least\n1 ad    (n=215030)\n10 ads (n=106592)\n50 ads (n=36005)100 ads (n=21380)\n250 ads (n=10946)\n500 ads (n=6496)Figure 6: Distribution of political ad proportion over pages.\nads. However, for government, issue, and media pages, this\nshare is much lower, at 23%, 22%, and 12% respectively, and\nmedian proportions of political ads of 20%, 25%, and 0% re-\nspectively, showing that the Report contains many (classes of)\npages whose ads are mostly non-political. Across all pages\nwith observed ads (Figure 6), we similarly see that 44% had\nonly political ads, while 33% had no political ads observed\nduring our measurement, with the latter increasing for larger\nadvertisers, suggesting these may not have political intent.\nOverall, we \ufb01nd that 47% of pages in the Ad Library Report\nare not authorized, with over 33% of pages hardly publishing\npolitical ads over time. These pages may have had incorrectly\ndetected ads ( false positives ) or placed an ad that they did\nnot consider political even though Facebook did. Indeed,\ngovernment and issue pages are much more likely to have ads\ndetected by Facebook. When pages have no clear political\nmotive, the advertisers as well as Facebook must determine\nat the individual ad level whether the ad is in scope of the\npolitical ad policy, which may be more prone to interpretation\nerrors and disagreements and therefore lead to enforcement\nerrors. Conversely, we consider 39% of pages to be core\npolitical actors. Although Facebook\u2019s policies require any ad\nmade bya political actor to be declared [11], enforcement is\nstill necessary as 21% of such pages have at least one detected\nad. Next, we analyze whether these pages had any ads that\nwere neither declared nor detected by Facebook.\n6.3 Missed ads by political advertisers\nThrough our classi\ufb01cation from subsubsection 6.2.1, we can\nidentify advertisers that are known or self-declare to be po-\nlitical actors. For these advertisers, Facebook\u2019s ad policy\nexplicitly mandates that alltheir ads be declared (\u201cads made\nby\u201d a political actor). If these advertisers fail to disclose all\ntheir ads, Facebook should detect them. With this premise,\nwe can measure whether those pages had any undetected ads\nthat Facebook\u2019s enforcement missed within 14 days after the\nad\u2019s \ufb01rst activity. By taking a more holistic approach where\nwe identify groups of pages and ads where enforcement is\nrequired, we avoid introducing any interpretation of our own\nof what should be a \u2018political ad\u2019 [102], as well as errors from\nmachine learning models that detect political ads [34, 96].

To ensure the preci-\nsion of these lists, one author manually veri\ufb01ed all pages with\nundetected ads from the three U.S.-based lists and removed\nentries that were not political actors. One such example was\na media page that ran a few one-off ads on behalf of a pres-\nidential campaign and disclosed them using the campaign\u2019s\nFEC ID. For the larger list of advertisers that self-declare\na political Facebook page category, such as \u2018Politician\u2019 or\n\u2018Political Organization,\u2019 we randomly sampled 50 pages from\nthe U.S. (to ensure interpretability) for which one author man-\nually con\ufb01rmed that all 50 pages belonged to core political\nactors. We conclude that these lists are a reliable source of\npolitical pages that are required under Facebook\u2019s policy to\ndeclare all of their ads as political.\nAcross federal and state-level U.S. political advertisers,\ni.e., those that Facebook included in its Spending Tracker\nor veri\ufb01ed through an FEC ID as well as major committees\ntracked by OpenSecrets, performance is nearly perfect with at\nmost 0.17% missed ads, depending on the list (Table 5).

As these additional lists also cover\nadvertisers for local elections, the increase in missed ads\nsuggests that Facebook is less successful at identifying smaller\npolitical actors. In absolute terms, out of the combined 11,356\nads that U.S. core political actors failed to declare, Facebook\nwas only able to detect for 416 (3.7%) that they were political\nand therefore enforce its ad policy. Facebook failed to detect\nthe remaining 10,940 electoral ads, including ads from a U.S.\nsenator and former presidential primary candidate with almost\n10 million dollar in ad spend, who was able to run undisclosed\n(and undetected) ads after the U.S. elections.\nWe now analyze whether Facebook\u2019s enforcement is con-\nsistent globally through international lists of political actors,\ncomparing performance in particular to that in the United\nStates. For candidates and parties registered in the 2020\nBrazilian municipal elections [98], 1.57% of ads went unde-\ntected, even though Facebook could easily match their pro-\nvided CNPJ ID with the of\ufb01cial list of political advertisers.\nSilva et al. [96] observed a slightly higher false negative rate\nof 2.2% in the 2018 Brazilian elections, albeit across all ad-\nvertiser types. Across global lists of political actors curated\nby CrowdTangle, 2.15% of ads were missed. Across pages\nthat classify themselves in a political Facebook page category,\n4.3% of ads were neither declared nor detected. (Note that\nthis is a lower bound, as pages could select generic categories\nthat we do not include here. Within the other lists of political\npages, we \ufb01nd 3,311 \u2018Public Figure\u2019 and 715 \u2018Personal Blog\u2019\npages, for example.) All of these false negative rates are worse\n618    31st USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Association\nthan even the most broadly de\ufb01ned set of political actors in\nthe United States. Across all political advertisers worldwide,\nwe \ufb01nd a false negative rate of 4.5%, almost \ufb01ve times that\nof the U.S. 16.4% of pages published at least one political ad\nthat was not detected, more than three times as many as in the\nU.S., even though they are obvious political actors.\nWe further break down rates of undetected ads for adver-\ntisers in political Facebook page categories by country (Fig-\nure 7), as these advertisers cover all countries in our scope.\nAgain, Facebook misses the fewest ads in the United States\n(0.85% false negatives), whereas enforcement can be consid-\nerably worse in other countries: in absolute terms, Argentina,\nBrazil, and India have over 10,000 undetected ads each, while\nin relative terms, Argentina, North Macedonia, and Malaysia\nhave between 30% and 45% undetected ads. This further sug-\ngests that Facebook does not succeed in enforcing its policies\nconsistently worldwide, leaving some users more exposed\nto violating political ads. This inconsistency may be due to\nlanguage-speci\ufb01c model de\ufb01ciencies [92], in particular if lit-\ntle training data is available [82]. Additionally, the review\nmodel may fail to incorporate different cultural contexts, with\ncertain topics being considered politically sensitive only in\nsome countries, as Facebook itself recognizes [84]. However,\nother confounding factors exist, such as the importance of\nindividual pages, the reach of ads, or heightened attention\ndue to ongoing elections [61]. These prevent us from reliably\nattributing performance differences to one or more causes.\nOverall, of all 122,973 ads that political actors do not de-\nclare, Facebook only succeeds in detecting a very minor share\nof 6,010 ads or 4.9%, while failing to detect 116,963 ads,\nmeaning that Facebook\u2019s enforcement is ineffective at discov-\nering violating ads even from advertisers with a clear political\nintent. Moreover, if an advertiser properly declares their ad,\nFacebook does not have to make an enforcement decision,\nincreasing the signi\ufb01cance of any error made for an unde-\nclared ad. In terms of potential exposure, the activity period\nfor these undetected ads is similar to that for detected ads\n(subsection 5.1). While Facebook does not disclose spend\nand impressions metadata for ads not known to be political,\nwe use the average ad spend and impressions across each\npage\u2019s political ads to estimate that advertisers likely spent\nbetween 4.6 and 9.2 million U.S. dollars on undetected ads,\nand that these ads had between 2.2 and 2.4 billion impres-\nsions. As with detected ads, users are therefore exposed in\ngreat quantities to these violating ads. However, undetected\nads lack even the transparency that comes with after-the-fact\ndetection, since these ads disappear from the Ad Library and\ncan no longer be scrutinized once they become inactive.\nSummary Detection led 22 of the 75 pages with the most\ndetected ads to correctly declare more political ads. How-\never, the remaining pages cananddocontinue publishing\nundeclared politicaladseven afterFace book detected their\nundeclared ads,andafterFacebook prohibitedpoliticaladsin\ntheU.S. Facebook\u2019s policies appear to result in non-politicalpages being listed in the Ad Library Report as having political\nads, which may have been inadvertently published or erro-\nneously detected. Conversely, we consider only 39% of pages\nto be core political actors, who we expect to declare all their\nads or else get detected by Facebook. Unfortunately, we \ufb01nd\nat least 116,963 adsfrom these clearly politicaladvertisers\nthatwere missed byFace book\u2019s detection ( false negatives ).\nMoreover, these missed ads are unevenly distributed world-\nwide: while for U.S. advertisers only 0.85% of ads are missed,\nwe see a false negative rate of up to 45% in other countries.\nPut differently, for political pages only 4.9% ofundeclared\nadsaredetected, resulting in at least 2.2 billion (estimated)\nimpressions that expose users to ads that hide their political\nnature and avoid disclosing who paid for the ad.\n7 Discussion\nAcross the ads where Facebook has to make an enforcement\ndecision, we observe 61% more undetected ads (across po-\nlitical pages; subsection 6.3) than detected ads (across all\npages; subsection 5.1) within 14 days after their \ufb01rst activ-\nity. In addition, we observe that 55% of detections in the\nU.S. are likely false (subsection 5.2). Translated into classi-\n\ufb01cation metrics, we estimate a precision of 0:45, a recall of\n0:22, and subsequently an F1score of 0:29, all indicative of\ninsuf\ufb01ciently accurate classi\ufb01cation, and calling into question\nwhether Facebook\u2019s enforcement is truly effective.\nIncidentally, these error estimates are conservative and bi-\nased favorably towards better performance by Facebook. We\nquantify false negatives only across clearly political pages,\nwhere all ads must be declared, and enforcement is likely eas-\nier. If Facebook were to implement detection of every ad from\nsuch pages, our conservative estimate of the false negative rate\nwould become zero. However, our estimate does not include\npotentially missed ads from other (non-political) advertisers;\nif these publish political ads without disclosing them, the\nads would likely be more dif\ufb01cult to detect, given that they\nmust be evaluated individually. Sosnovik and Goga [102]\nfound 4% of \u2018strong political\u2019 ads to be undeclared, similar\nto our false negative rate. However, 7% of \u2018political\u2019 and\n26% of \u2018marginally political\u2019 ads were also undeclared, and\nsuch ads were more often placed by NGOs, advocacy groups\nand charity organizations. This suggests that we would also\n\ufb01nd a non-zero false negative rate if we were to extend our\nestimate to include individual ads from non-political actors.\nNevertheless, our results present a baseline for ads currently\nmissed by Facebook. Conversely, we conservatively estimate\nworldwide false positives based on our \ufb01ndings among adver-\ntisers in the United States. We found that the false negative\nrate was lowest in the United States; if a similar trend holds\nfor false positives, Facebook\u2019s worldwide false positive rate\nis likely higher than in the U.S. Therefore, Facebook\u2019s global\nperformance is likely worse than our estimate.\nWe now discuss \ufb01ve factors that enable more effective\nUSENIX Association 31st USENIX Security Symposium    619\nenforcement, and highlight how our \ufb01ndings suggest that\nFacebook\u2019s implementation is lacking in these areas. We also\noutline recommendations to Facebook for improving its en-\nforcement and reduce erroneously missed or detected ads, as\nwell as improve researchers\u2019 ability to audit its enforcement.\nFirst, in terms of technical capability, Facebook\u2019s enforce-\nment approach appears insuf\ufb01cient for the task of classifying\npolitical ads. Its automated moderation systems apparently\ndo not learn or incorporate obvious signals of political intent,\nsuch as a page\u2019s self-categorization (subsection 6.3), and this\ndespite a high false positive rate (subsection 5.2). Even if\nFacebook\u2019s review were more performant, the scale of its ad\nbusiness means that low error rates still result in large absolute\ncounts of missed political ads. Recommendation: Facebook\nshould expand its enforcement approach to taketheadvertiser\nintoaccount, e.g., by monitoring pages in political categories\nmore strictly [36, 64]. Such simple, clearly enforceable rules\ncould complement the current automated review.\nSecond, policy enforcement should be timely and come\nwith appropriate consequences to prevent future violations.\nHowever, pages were still able to repeatedly run undeclared\nads, even during the pause on political ads in the U.S. (sub-\nsection 6.1). Moreover, violating ads sometimes run for a\nlong period or are already inactive by the time of detection,\nresulting in large exposure (billions of impressions) before\nthey are caught, if ever (subsection 5.1). Recommendation:\nFacebook should ensure stricter consequences for repeatedly\nviolating advertisers, such as (temporarily) restricting them\nfrom running ads.\nThird, enforcement must be consistent in order to be fair\nand effective for all users and advertisers. However, next to\nthe overall enforcement errors that suggest inadequate review-\ning resources, it appears that missed ads are more common\noutside the United States, where Facebook\u2019s enforcement suf-\nfers from higher false negative rates (subsection 6.3), leaving\nusers there more vulnerable to obscured political ads. Recom-\nmendation: Facebook should ensure consistentperformance\nglobally, independent of an ad\u2019s language. To capture cul-\ntural differences, they should engage with local governments,\nregulators and organizations to adapt policies and enforce-\nment strategies tothelocalcontext [64, 101]. This includes\nidentifying country-speci\ufb01c sensitive topics. Furthermore,\nthey should mandate ad declaration worldwide, to ensure that\nno users in any country are unnecessarily left vulnerable to\nmalicious political advertisers [84, 101].\nFourth, enforcement errors could result from insuf\ufb01cient\nadpolicies . We \ufb01nd many largely non-political advertisers\nwho appear to (possibly unintentionally) violate these policies\nand have detected ads (subsubsection 6.2.2), even though they\nmight have good intentions and be unaware that their ad was\n\u2018political.\u2019 This may be due to ambiguity in ad policies, in\nparticular whether social issue ads \u201cseek to in\ufb02uence public\nopinion.\u201d Our \u2018expert\u2019 annotators did not always agree on\nwhether an ad was political (subsection 5.2), suggesting thatadvertisers may also \ufb01nd this dif\ufb01cult, in particular as poli-\ncies are spread out across many resources [1, 4, 5, 7, 11\u201313,\n18, 27, 28, 48, 56, 57]. Recommendation: Facebook should\nfurther clarifyandsimplify itspoliticaladpolicies, making it\nvery obvious whether an ad is in scope or not [22, 101]. In\naddition, policies should be collected in one easily discover-\nable location [67, 78], with updates being clearly indicated\nand previous versions remaining available [22].\nFinally, the quality of enforcement also affects the trans-\nparency into the political ad ecosystem that the Ad Library is\nmeant to provide. Missed political ads disappear from the Ad\nLibrary once they become inactive, and additional metadata\nsuch as its spend and impressions are unavailable. Conversely,\nfalsely detected non-political ads result in unrelated advertis-\ners and ads appearing in the Ad Library, which may result\nin overestimating political ads on Facebook, and increases\nthe (infrastructural and human) resources required to retrieve,\nprocess and analyze data for all advertisers (subsection 4.5).\nRecommendation: Although we commend Facebook for their\ncurrent transparency efforts, as they enable our audit and\nallow us to suggest improvements, they should expand trans -\nparency by including all ads in their archive and API to enable\nreproducible and scalable analysis of their enforcement [2,\n26, 35, 39, 59, 62, 64, 65, 71, 88, 110]. For detected ads, they\nshould also disclose which policy was violated and how they\ndetermined this [22], instead of the current binary signal.\nHowever, changes to enforcement and transparency should\nbe balanced with legitimate commercial and privacy concerns\naround sharing ad metadata, as well as consider adversarial\ncounteractions from advertisers, who for example could at-\ntempt to evade efforts to identify them as a political actor (e.g.,\nby selecting an unrelated page category). Actors beyond Face-\nbook may therefore also need to intervene: legislators could\nharmonize de\ufb01nitions of both political and issue ads across\nplatforms [67] as well as set enforcement and transparency re-\nquirements [2, 26] that would be overseen by regulators [110]\n(Appendix D). Ultimately, such regulatory pressure would\nentail a shift away from the current self-regulatory model to\nco-regulation [39, 110]: being allowed to self-regulate poli-\ncies requires being able to enforce them well, which we show\nFacebook currently fails to achieve.\n8 Conclusion\nThrough a large-scale collection of all ads from 215,030 pages\nwith political ads over seven months, we conduct an audit\nof Facebook\u2019s political ad policy enforcement. We study\nwhether this enforcement prevents negligent or malicious ad-\nvertisers from weakening the integrity of the online political\nad ecosystem by running political ads without disclosing them\nas required, and whether enforcement unnecessarily harms\nlegitimate advertisers. Unfortunately, we \ufb01nd that Facebook\u2019s\ndetection of political ads is \ufb02awed: Facebook misses more\nads than they detect, and over half of those detected ads are\n620    31st USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Association\nincorrectly \ufb02agged. This enables advertisers to violate poli-\ncies for an extended time or even evade bans on political ads.\nWe attribute these \ufb02aws to limitations in Facebook\u2019s approach\nthat does not suf\ufb01ciently take into account the political intent\nof advertisers, allows pages to continue running violating\nads, does not appear to be localized well in many countries,\nand is based on ambiguous policies that are harder to comply\nwith and to enforce. These \ufb02aws then result in worse trans-\nparency into the online political ad ecosystem, as undisclosed\nand undetected political ads are neither accounted for in the\nsummary statistics of the Ad Library Report, nor archived in\nthe Ad Library so that the ads could be scrutinized after they\nbecome inactive. Yet, despite its \ufb02aws, it is also due to this\ntransparency that we can audit Facebook\u2019s enforcement and\nformulate our recommendations to improve it: By being able\nto hold platforms accountable, we can work towards more\nsecure online political speech.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd Mainack\nMondal for their valuable feedback.
