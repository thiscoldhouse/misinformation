It was held in a hybrid format, with some participants on-site in\nDagstuhl and most others joining remotely via the video conferencing system Zoom.\nIn order to maximize discussion and allow the interests of the group to drive the direction\nof the seminar, we did not plan for formal talks. Participants were asked to prepare a single\nslide, few-minute introduction about their research interests and methodologies related to\ndigital disinformation, and a \u201cburning question\u201d they have in the space.\nExcept where otherwise noted, content of this report is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons BY 4.0 International license\nDigital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation, Dagstuhl Reports , Vol. 11, Issue 09, pp.\n28\u201344\nEditors: Claude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner\nDagstuhl Reports\nSchloss Dagstuhl \u2013 Leibniz-Zentrum f\u00fcr Informatik, Dagstuhl Publishing, Germany\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 29\nParticipants included the following individuals, spanning a range of expertise from\ncomputer science to law:\nEsma A\u00efmeur (University of Montr\u00e9al, Canada)\nJos Baeten (CWI Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nAsia Biega (Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, Germany)\nCamille Darche (CNPEN, Inria and Universit\u00e9 Paris Nanterre, France)\nS\u00e9bastien Gambs (Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Canada)\nKrishna Gummadi (Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany)\nClaude Kirchner (CNPEN/CCNE and Inria, France)\nVladimir Kropotov (Trend Micro, Russia)\nJean-Yves Marion (Lorraine University, France)\nEvangelos Markatos (University of Crete, Greece)\nFil Menczer (Indiana University, USA)\nTrisha Meyer (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium)\nFranziska Roesner (University of Washington, USA)\nKav\u00e9 Salamatian (University of Savoie, France)\nJuliette S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (University of Lille, France)\nDimitrios Serpanos (University of Patras, Greece)\nSerena Villata (CNRS, France)\nBased on our preliminary discussions, we identified four topics of interest to many\nseminar participants: trustworthiness algorithms (i.e., how to build systems that assess\ntrust automatically), friction as a technique in platform design (e.g., to allow for people\nto take time and a step back when consuming information on social media), the ethics of\ninterventions (e.g., the ethics of blocking or content moderation), and how to educate users\n(e.g., without creating over-skepticism). We then structured the rest of the seminar around\nfour deep-dive conversations on these topics, described in the subsequent sections of this\nreport.

While automated\nmis/disinformation algorithms are often framed in terms of such fact-checking, seminar\nparticipants repeatedly made the observation that assessing truth can be challenging.\nAutomating truth assertion is difficult since the level of specification of a statement to\ncheck can vary from formal (as in 2 + 2 = 4 ) to nearly formal (as in \u201c 2 + 2 = four\u201d) to\nimprecise and complex (such as \u201cCOVID-19 is a hoax\u201d). Even for formal statements, we\nknow since Turing and Post that some facts are even undecidable: for some (rather rare) facts\nthere exists no algorithm able to decide if they are true or false. And for complex, informal\nstatements, establishing truth can be hard or impossible, even if we could transform them\ninto formalized statement by explicitly describing all needed details of the context under\nconsideration. The context of particular statement may depend on time, culture, history,\neducation, current availability of verified information or knowledge (e.g., as we have seen\nscientific knowledge evolving since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic), etc.\nMoreover, misinformation is rarely something to which we can assign a binary truth value.\nOften we find a mix of truth with misleading suggestions, implications, attribution, or false\ncontext. There is significant nuance that makes it hard even for expert humans to fact-check\nsome claims. Often the best a human fact-checker can do is to observe there there is no\nevidence in support of a claim, rather than conclude that the claim is false.\nThus, since establishing truth can be very hard (possibly undecidable), participants\nsuggested that we could instead consider automated assessments of trustworthiness. As\nan example: not everything on Breitbart News or Occupy Democrats is \u201cfalse\u201d, but these\nsources have low credibility according to fact-checking organizations.\n3.2 Assessing Trustworthiness\nMoving, then, from fact-checking or truth assessment to the assessment of trustworthiness,\nwe discussed several aspects:\nWhat is being evaluated? Approaches for assessing trustworthiness might target content\n(e.g., might this image be a deep fake?), content producers (e.g., does this website or social\nmedia account have a reputation for sharing truthworthy content?), or even content consumers\n(e.g., does this user have a history of re-sharing misinformation?).\nWho is assessing trustworthiness? Trustworthiness assessments might be heavily impacted\nby factors such as the background, education, and biases of the annotators \u2013 either humans,\nor automated processes that may embed such bias in their design.\n21402\n32 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\nWhat makes something trustworthy? Or rather, what signals might a trustworthiness\nalgorithm use to assess content or sources? Participants mentioned potential signals including:\nAdherence to journalistic standards\nFalsifiability (see Popper)\nAccountability, e.g., a history of correcting errors when they are confirmed as such\nPrimary knowledge domain or level of expertise of a source being relevant to the topic at\nhand\nConfidence that an account is not compromised\nUser feedback (though this may be manipulated [12])\nBehavior of users who are known to be good at distinguishing mis/disinformation\nUse of techniques (e.g., clickbait, sensationalism) known to play into human cognitive\nbiases\nThere is a growing number of news and fact-checking organizations that compile credibil-\nity metric for sources according to the above criteria, e.g., https://mediabiasfactcheck.\ncom,https://www.newsguardtech.com ,https://iffy.news , and https://factcheck.\nafp.com.\nWho is the audience for trustworthiness information? We can consider different audiences\nfor the outputs of trustworthiness algorithms. One potential audience is a social media or\nother platform itself, for use in amplifying or de-amplifying certain content. Beyond this, the\ntargets of such interventions are often end users themselves, e.g., labels on content to help\nthem assess information as they see it. For any user-facing interventions, the designers must\nconsider whether they are targeting users who are receptive to additional information (e.g.,\nconscientious consumers of information trying to make sense of the information ecosystems)\nor not (e.g., people already convinced of a false conspiracy theory). And in addition to\ndifferent kinds of people, there are quite different kinds of information. One size will obviously\nnot fit everyone.\nBuilding systems assessing trust automatically will rely (i) on the many factors listed\nabove, but also on (ii) ways to allow people to have time to take a step back (e.g., using friction\nas described in Section 4) and (iii) on thinking about the many ethics issues concerning the\nplatforms (Section 5).\n3.3 Technical Approaches\nParticipants also brainstormed specific technical approaches that might be used to support\ntrustworthiness assessment or other verification. The observation was made that online\nplatforms are already doing some of this work, but not much about their techniques or\nalgorithms is public or transparent; therefore the research community cannot assess the\nsoundness and appropriate application of platform regulation based on these metrics.\nAutomated property proving could be used on sufficiently formal statements, possibly with\nspecific pre-processing of them.\nThe pagerank technique is an early example, initially used by search engines. These types\nof algorithms could be used on Twitter graph data, for example, starting with initial\ntrustworthiness labels from existing sources.\nCryptographic techniques can be used to trace the provenance of content, identify the\nsources of content, and/or attest to attributes of content (e.g., metadata like when\nand where a video was shot, or when and by whom it was published online). While\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 33\ncryptographic techniques like digital signatures do allow attribution of content to a\n(possibly trusted) source, participants pointed out that there are limitations to these\napproaches because we still need a root of trust \u2013 e.g., we might be able to verify the\nprovenance of a video, but we still need to know whether we can trust the source.\nDeep fake detection is useful, but needs continuous adaptation to technical improvements\nin deep fake creation (i.e., an \u201carms race\u201d).\n3.4 Reflections on Harms from Untrustworthy Content\nAs part of this deep dive conversation, participants also reflected on the potential harms of\nuntrustworthy content \u2013 both what those harms are, as well as how they might be used to\nprioritize different types of sources or content for intervention.\nSpread and targeting\nThe current social internet allows both brute force broadcasting (i.e., everyone receives the\nsame (mis)information) as well as highly targeted (mis)information dissemination. Highly\ntargeted information can be sent to many different people, and they will not see the same\nthing as it will be automatically tailored to their unique profile \u2013 a unique phenomenon in\nour new digital ecosystem. We observed that both mis/disinformation with broad reach, as\nwell as highly targeted mis/disinformation, can create substantial harm, but may require\ndifferent approaches to combat.\nAssessing and prioritizing potential harms\nDifferent types of mis/disinformation may have have different harms. For example, ill-founded\ndistrust in vaccines has clear potential harms [ 18], while on its face it seems less problematic\nif some people believe that the earth is flat \u2013 though the distinctions are not so simple, as\nit has been show that beliefs in different conspiracy theories may be correlated. Moreover,\ndifferent populations may be more vulnerable to certain harms. With a good characterization\nwe could use that to prioritize limited resources. But characterizing and measuring harm in\nonline content could be very hard and remains an active research area (e.g., [ 31,21]). Even\nirrespective of harm prediction, any prioritization that makes a judgment on which harms to\nwhich populations are more \u201cimportant\u201d than others will have ethical impacts.\nLong-term impacts of content despite awareness that source is untrustworthy\nEven with trustworthiness information, people might not remember the provenance of\ninformation they have seen \u2013 they might assume something is true even though they were\nexposed to it from an untrustworthy source. For example, it has been shown in the context of\nads [17] that people do not necessarily remember the sources of information. This observation\nraises a more general related question: how are people influenced by bad information they\njust see in their information ecosystem but do not engage much with, such as posts they scroll\nby or ads they think they ignore? Does that information (especially with source provenance\nlater lost) make it into their worldviews? Is this effect worse when people read only catchy\nheadlines, but not the underlying articles?\n21402\n34 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\n3.5 Challenging Trustworthiness\nWe also noted that trustworthiness is challenged in various ways. First, disinformation\nis fundamentally an attack on the human brain, taking advantage of aspects of human\nneuro-cognition, culture, behaviors, and potentially fault or non-rational heuristics. Simply\nsurfacing information about trustworthiness to people will not, on its own, suffice to overcome\nthese issues. A second challenge comes from traditional computer security: information\nmaybe altered on purpose, e.g., via the criminal alteration of data stored in compromised\ncomputers in order to support disinformation and falsely justify fake news. For example, a\nparticipant pointed to recent targeted attacks on research against COVID-19 vaccines [ 23].\nAndfinally, whileAIandMLcanprovidetoolstohelpcombatdisinformation(e.g., supporting\ntrustworthiness assessment), their advancement may also increase the volume and the quality\nof fake news, as well as bringing new disinformation vectors. These challenges compound the\ncomplexity of understanding and controlling the context in which we would like to increase\ntrustworthiness, and require for further research.\n4 Deep Dive 2: Friction as a Technique in Platform Design\nOur second deep dive conversation focused on the topic of \u201cfriction\u201d as a technique in (social\nmedia or other information) platform design. The idea of friction involves slowing down some\nhuman interaction with the platform, either on the information producer side (e.g., limiting\ndown how often someone can post) or on the information consumer side (e.g., limiting how\nmuch time someone spends on the platform).\n4.1 Argument for Friction\nSome participants presented evidence for why the idea of friction might be fruitful. One piece\nof evidence: while one might imagine that platform behavior might self-regulate, in the sense\nthat higher quality content should become more popular, in fact, the correlation between\nquality and popularity is very weak as long as people have finite attention (i.e., are unable\nto see everything that is posted on the platform) [ 13]. This reality is problematic from the\nperspective of misinformation, because it makes us vulnerable to bad actors flooding the\nnetwork with more information. Indeed, there is empirical evidence that adversaries flood\nthe network with lots of volume of problematic content [25, 22].\nAt the same time, we know from many examples in other domains and in our own lives\nthat what might be good for a person\u2019s well-being in general, and what they want or choose\nto do in a given moment, are not always aligned, making us vulnerable to addictive online\nplatforms. Related to this, the question was raised: is there an equivalent to the \u201cprivacy\nparadox\u201d [ 3] for misinformation? Seminar participants posited that the answer is likely\nyes: that people are not as conscientious about consuming information as they say they are\nor want to be (e.g., they may still click on clickbait content even though they recognize it\nas clickbait). However, just as the privacy paradox is not truly a paradox (because people\nare forced into the impossible choice between opting out of crucial online platforms and\nagreeing to their privacy ultimatums) [ 24], we posit that in the context of misinformation,\npeople\u2019s actual choices and behavior are deeply influenced by the platforms. In other words,\nthe situation is not so much a paradox as a failure of platforms to design for their users\u2019\nwell-being.\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 35\nTowards that end, we thus considered \u201cfriction\u201d as a potential tool in platform design to\nreduce mis/disinformation and increase well-being. In the extreme, as a thought experiment,\na platform might have no friction (i.e., anyone can post or view anything) or only friction\n(i.e., everything is blocked). The latter case is clearly nonsensical, but as a practical matter,\nso is the former: participants stressed that platform designs are never neutral . Particularly\nbecause there is finite time and attention that an individual can spend on a platform, the\ndesign choices about who is shown what content in what way, and the affordances for how\ncontent is posted and shared, naturally shape people\u2019s consumption and production behaviors.\n4.2 Examples and Proposals for Friction in Platform Design\nWe considered existing examples of friction, as well as our own new proposals, for different\nstakeholders.\nFriction for Information Consumers\nConsumers are users who use social media or other information platforms to read and/or\nview content. Examples of friction for consumers include:\nMost generally, the platform\u2019s algorithm for what is shown to whom when is a form of\nfriction for certain types of content.\nLabeling content (e.g., with \u201cfalse\u201d labels if something was able to be explicitly fact-\nchecked, or with other information, such as about the trustworthiness of the source as\ndiscussed in Section 3) as a nudge for people to think about it a second time.\nMinor changes in an interface can have impacts on how people consume information (e.g.,\nthe presence or absence of a search box might change people\u2019s ability to act on their\npreferences in content consumption [16]).\nHelping people limit how much they interact with platforms, e.g., how much time they\nspend on social media. Existing tools include screen time capping tools (e.g., smartphone\napps or browser extensions), including tools with additional incentives (e.g., planting real\nor virtual trees). A proposal was to surface the climate impact for use of platforms per\nunit time, as a new type of incentive/motivation.\nProposal: Some kind of platform guidance for helping shape discourse (e.g., like an\nongoing project designing a tool to help local actors intervene in mis/disinformation\nrelated conversations [26]).\nProposal: Design social media platforms for more intent-driven interactions. Today, people\nvisiting social media sites are inundated with content on all sorts of topics interleaved on\ntheir feeds, which can create information overload, reduce motivation to assess information\nquality [10], and other potential harms. Imagine instead a platform that greets a user with\nan empty search box, asking them to take an active role in shaping the topics and types\nof content that they see. However, we note a potential privacy-related side effect here:\nactive interactions with the platform will also provide more information about the user\u2019s\ninterests and habits that could be exploited for targeted advertising or manipulation;\nthus, any such approach should be coupled with robust privacy protections.\nProposal: Helping users filter the content they want to see, e.g., on Twitter, to engage on\nacademic research topics but not U.S. politics.\n21402\n36 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\nFriction for Information Producers\nInformation producers are those who create new posts containing mis/disinformation or\nother low-quality or problematic content. Examples of friction for producers include:\nTwitter limits the number of posts per day (though posters may violate this by deleting\nthings they posted earlier). One might also impose other limits, such as rate limits.\nTwitter used captchas to limit posting volume during the 2020 U.S. elections.\nContent moderation in general was considered a general form of friction (e.g., removing\nposts or account, shadow-banning). The Facebook Oversight Board was mentioned, which\nevaluates content removal or account banning decisions.\nOther researchers have highlighted the importance of banning \u201crepeat offenders\u201d, accounts\nthat frequently post or spread mis/disinformation [8].\nProposal: On WhatsApp, a message that has spread beyond a certain number of people\ncould be made public, to allow for scrutiny and content moderation (otherwise challenging\non an end-to-end encrypted platform).\nProposal: Some kind of monetary cost for posting (similar to what advertisers must do\ntoday, or similar to postage stamps for physical messages).\nProposal: Some kind of \u201cfriction score\u201d or \u201ctrustworthiness score\u201d for information produc-\ners, where higher-quality information producers are able to post more, with more reach.\nThe idea would be to create disincentives (cost) for bad actions, and incentives or rewards\nfor responsible use. This proposal comes with many questions and challenges, including\nhow such a score should be computed, by whom, the need to provide transparency about\nits implementation and enforcement, the privacy risks associated with how the score\nmight be misused, etc. Some ideas for factors that might be incorporated into the score\nincluded: the quality of previously shared links, prior track record of posted content\nthat has been flagged or taken down, certain behaviors (e.g., high-frequency posting,\ninauthentic/coordinated behavior), and audience diversity or other audience properties.\nOr could we translate some of the trust indicators developed for news organizations (e.g.,\nas used by Newsguard) to individuals? Using crowdsourced data as part of the score was\ncautioned against, due to risks of coordinated activity or similar [30].\nProposal: Time-based friction for posting, when critical events like elections are happening\nor shortly before a company goes for IPO, friction could be increased to minimize\nmanipulations at the time when they are most impactful. This idea could apply to friction\nfor information consumers and/or intermediaries.\nFriction for Intermediaries\nIntermediaries are users who knowingly or unknowingly re-share mis/ disinformation posted\nby others (e.g., retweeting on Twitter). Examples of friction for intermediaries include:\nWhatsApp limits the number of people to whom someone can forward a message.\nFacebook alerts you if you try to share a link or post that their fact-checkers have labeled\nas false.\nTwitter warns you if you retweet a link without having first clicked on it.\nProposal: Temporarily disable reposting capability for users who ignore warnings with\nhigh frequency.\nProposal: The above-mentioned \u201ctrustworthiness score\u201d could be used for intermediaries\nas well.\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 37\nProposal: Behaviorally identifying users who are good at identifying and/or avoiding\nmis/disinformation, and using that information to, for example, amplify or reduce the\nspread of certain types of content.\n4.3 Practical and Ethics Considerations\nOrthogonal to any specific friction proposals, participants voiced concerns about practical\nconsiderations in deploying such techniques. First, there are questions about the incentives\nof the platform designers, in terms of economic models and business incentives. Indeed,\nafter the seminar, there was the example of a browser extension designed to limit people\u2019s\nFacebook use that was shut down by Facebook [ 20]. The corresponding observation was that\nthese questions are not merely technical challenges but will require regulations to put any\nsolutions into place.\nAdditionally, there are ethical, legal, and political questions around the power of platforms\nto make decisions like promoting or demoting certain types of content or blocking certain\npeople. One participant also noted that the use of \u201cfriction\u201d is, of course, not ubiquitously a\ngood thing, pointing, for example, to work documenting the uses of friction and flooding\nas techniques by authoritarian governments to exert control over information in potentially\nharmful ways [19]. We discuss ethics more in Section 5.\n4.4 Looking Ahead\nClearly, significant work remains to be done to design, implement, and evaluate the impacts\nof different types of friction proposals, compounded with the challenges of platform incentives\nand their limited transparency and oversight. Stepping back, we concluded our discussion\non this topic with a crucial, overarching question: How might we redesign platforms more\nradically? For example, if we wanted to design a \u201cpublic interest social media platform\u201d,\nwhat would that look like? Could it be done? Or, looking further into the future towards\nAR/VR or \u201cmetaverse\u201d interactions: can such platforms be designed in ways that help move\nus more towards (imagined?) ideals of in-person instead of digitally-mediated interactions?\n5 Deep Dive 3: Ethics of Interventions\nOn the second day, we chose to include one formal talk to help seed our discussion on\nethics: Serena Villata gave a talk titled \u201cOnline disinformation: content moderation, ethical\nchallenges, and future work directions\u201d describing in particular the collective thinking held\nwithin the National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics (Conseil National Pilote d\u2019Ethique\ndu Num\u00e9rique \u2013 CNPEN) [4]. The abstract says:\nThe purpose [...] is to identify the ethical issues and challenges arising from the\nwidespread use of these different algorithms and tools, which are part of a complex\nphenomenon with wide-ranging implications. Among others, some questions arise:\nwhat does action or inaction in this domain mean in the context of COVID-19? Is it\nsimply a quantitative shift, or are we seeing a more profound change in the nature\nof the digital solutions designed to fight online disinformation and misinformation?\n21402\n38 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\nMore generally, how do we face the complexity of this phenomenon, which requires\nan analysis that seems to go beyond ethics, or even to challenge the notion of ethics\nitself? Indeed, ethical questions do not arise in the same way depending on whether\none is dealing with actors who act consciously to deceive their target or, on the other\nhand, whether one is dealing with actors who simply get caught up in the flow of\ninformation in digital format and, in particular, participate in the virality of this\ninformation often in an unconscious way. In the first case, ethical reflection questions\nresponsibility, while in the second case it consists mainly in moving towards awareness.\nIn either case, the requirement is to identify \u2013 specifically in the digital domain \u2013\nthe economic, legal, social, political or philosophical dimensions of disinformation or\nmisinformation.\nThe discussion opened by the presentation helped raise fundamental questions about\nethics in the context of mis/disinformation.\n5.1 Which ethics for which purpose?\nAre there existing ethical frameworks/theories that could be applied in this context?\nShall we develop and/or rely on existing philosophical frameworks? Can we take inspiration\nfrom the many AI governance propositions issued from the committees set up, for example,\nby the UE, IEEE or Unesco? How do we resolve some of the fundamental-seeming tensions\n(e.g., free speech vs content moderation for safety)?\nA crucial point concerns the cultural aspects of information. Do we expect a global set of\nethics accepted by everyone, or do we expect ethics to be regional? Clearly, norms and group\nbehaviors are quite often following local customs and they can be influenced or offended by\nother behaviors in different regions. Related works like the Confucian approaches to tech\nethics were mentioned [29].\nWhen looking at ethics as defined by the French Academy [ 6] (\u201cReflection on human\nbehaviour and the values on which it is based, carried out with a view to establishing a\ndoctrine, a science of morality.\u201d), the reflection process may evolve over time and of course in\ndifferent cultures. This highlights the difficulty to answer the question: should we (can we?)\nestablish a common set of rules? And for which purpose?\nAs ethics precedes regulation and laws that are regional or national in many cases, we\nsee the difficulty, but also the interest, to collaborate on these questions and to try to find or\nestablish common views in the context of global digital platforms.\n5.2 What values are behind moderation tools?\nWhen asking which values are behind the moderation tools, the following points were raised.\nAlgorithmic fairness to avoid issues like algorithmic bias (e.g., the Amazon hiring example).\nBias could in particular be introduced when detecting proactively vs noticing the impacts.\nBias could be better understood and avoided when running simulations to help predict\notherwise unforeseen side effects of algorithmic designs.\nTransparency appears as a key value here again. For reference, a talk was mentioned from\nOana Goga (based on work with Krishna Gummadi and others) auditing explanations\nprovided by social platforms on why some content was shown, highlighting also how these\nexplanations can be manipulated to appear \u201cneutral\u201d [11].\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 39\nConsent is key as in bioethics, and it relies in part on thoughtful consent design and on\neducation: how to ensure that people understand what they are consenting for? The role\nof nudging, with much prior work, was also highlighted by participants.\n5.3How can ethics committees help governing social media platforms?\nWe currently see the setting up of ethical committees close to the platform (e.g., Facebook\nOversight Board), possibly acting independently. Can this help? Participants raised the\nfollowing questions for/about the Facebook Oversight Board:\nWhat does Facebook do with the user-generated reports of Facebook takeout data (and\nof course with all the data)?\nWhat data does the Oversight Board actually get access to?\nProcess, data, objectives, consequences (how seriously is this taken)?\nMembership of the board? Multi-stakeholder?\nHow does Facebook\u2019s internal governance interact with the external committee?\nWhat about ethics-washing?\nParticipants also observed:\n1.The role of the Oversight Board is limited to content decisions, not actually oversight of\nFacebook per se, despite its name.\n2.Facebook\u2019splatformisnotneutral: thedesignoftheplatformshapesnotonlyconsumption\nbehaviors but has also shaped content (e.g., from the Facebook whistleblower interview\nwith 60 Minutes [ 1], politicians saying they felt forced to take more extreme positions\nthat will work well with Facebook\u2019s algorithm)\nEvery problem Facebook and others are facing is so complex, with conflicting needs from\ndifferent stakeholders \u2013 could we actually do better, if we were there? Are there examples of\nethics boards in such companies working well? We left the question open but we begin to\nthink about what would be desirable.\nLet\u2019s imagine new, different social media platforms\nSuch a platform might rely on an oversight board accessing information (what?) to make\ndecisions (which?) to be applied. The ethics committee might use tools for being more\ntransparent on data and models without releasing the data and the model, e.g., [ 9,15]. And\nof course it is crucial to involve multiple, globally and otherwise diverse stakeholders.\n6 Deep Dive 4: User Education\nFinally, we discussed the potential role of and strategies for user education against mis/-\ndisinformation. Indeed, many existing educational efforts exist in this space (e.g., several\nefforts at the University of Washington alone [ 28,5], TrendMicro\u2019s internet safety educational\nresources [ 27], the Fakey game [ 14]); our goal here is not to suggest that all of the ideas\nbelow are new, but rather to summarize the discussion at the seminar about the role of and\nimportant considerations in educational interventions.\n21402\n40 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\n6.1 Role of User Education\nWhen considering educational interventions, an important question is always to consider how\nmuch should the responsibility be on users to protect themselves versus how much should\nthe responsibility be on companies and regulators to obviate the need for education and\nself-protection. Beyond responsibility, there is a question of how realistic or appropriate it is\nto expect users to develop deep understandings of the technical systems they use\u2013 indeed,\nmany users do not have such understanding [ 7]. it seems clear to us that the burden cannot\nand should not be on end users alone. Nevertheless, educational interventions may have an\nimportant role to play in a multi-faceted fight against mis/disinformation, and can provide\nusers with agency and empowerment even in the face of slow-moving or otherwise incentivized\nregulators and platforms.\n6.2 Characterizing Education Efforts\nSeminar participants considered different ways to characterize or scope educational interven-\ntions, and different options for their aims and implementations. These included:\nWho is the audience of an education effort? This might include vulnerable populations,\nsuchaskids, teenagers, olderadults, peoplewithlowerliteracy. Thismightincludeparticularly\npowerful individuals, such as politician, local influencers, C-level executives, business owners,\nor people in charge of platform design and implementation. And this might include everyone,\ncontinuously, who interacts with online information ecosystems.\nWhat is the goal of an education effort? At first blush, the core goal of an anti-\nmisinformation educational effort might seem to be to help people learn how to identify\nmis/disinformation . However, participants were quick to point out that one should avoid\nteaching only skepticism, which risks cultivating cynicism [ 2] and undermining trust in infor-\nmation ecosystems altogether. Instead, educational efforts should also include the opposite\ngoal:helping people identify trustworthy information and sources .\nOther potential educational goals articulated by seminar participants included: helping\npeople thinking critically andhelping people learn situational awareness online , as well as\nspecifically helping people identify manipulative techniques being used in the content that\nthey see (e.g., Cialdini\u2019s principles of inflence or persuasion). Another goal might be to help\npeople engage with others productively about misinformation (e.g., teaching skills for how to\ninteract with someone when they have posted something false).\nParticipants also observed that educational goals towards online literacy in general might\nhave benefits regarding mis/disinformation, in terms of helping people understand how\ninformation flows online and how mis/disinformation may spread or be targeted at them. For\nexample: educating people about how online systems and information ecosystems work in\ngeneral; helping people understand how information about them is collected, processed, and\nused online; helping people understand what it means when they consent to online services.\nThe question was also raised about whether misinformation education efforts can take\nlessons from educational efforts in other domains, e.g., cybersecurity.\nHow to deliver educational interventions? Education might be (for example): embedded as\npart of platforms themselves (e.g. for a chatbot platform, by the chatbot itself); incorporated\ninto existing courses across different levels of education; presented in stand-alone workshops;\nincorporated into existing or stand-alone websites; presented as public service announcements\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 41\n(e.g., similar to public health messaging by public health agencies); included as part of\nentertainment media (e.g., TV shows); or delivered through educational games or apps\n(e.g., [5, 14]).\n7 Conclusion and Looking Ahead\nThis Dagstuhl workshop, occurring right after the main assault of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwas held in hybrid mode. It was quite different from \u201cstandard\u201d Dagstuhl meetings which\nbenefit from more informal and direct in-person interactions. Still, thanks to our engaged\nparticipants and the quality of the technical video conferencing support provided by the\nDagstuhl organisation, we found our conversations fruitful, with much involvement and\ninteractions between geographically (and time zone) distant participants.\nIt is clear that there are more questions than answers about mis/disinformation in our\nonline ecosystems at this time, and we add our voices to the growing and interdisciplinary\nresearch community in this space. We look forward to future \u2013 hopefully fully in-person \u2013\nDagstuhl seminars on this topic, as well as future collaborations between seminar participants\nand within the research community more broadly.\nReferences\n160 Minutes.

At the same time, social media also platforms pseudo-experts\nwho may promote contrarian views. Despite the significance of social media, key ele-\nmentsofcommunicationsuchastheuseofmoraloremotionallanguageandmessaging\nstrategy, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has not been explored.\nObjective: This study aims to analyze how notable public health experts (PHEs)\nand pseudo-experts communicated with the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur focus is the emotional and moral language they used in their messages across a\nrange of pandemic issues. We also study their engagement with political elites and\nhow the public engaged with PHEs to better understand the impact of these health\nexperts on the public discourse.\nMethods: We gathered a dataset of original tweets from 489 PHEs and 356 pseudo-\nexperts on Twitter (now X) from January 2020 to January 2021, as well as replies to\n1arXiv:2406.01866v2  [cs.CL]  10 Jun 2024\ntheoriginaltweetsfromthePHEs.WeidentifiedthekeyissuesthatPHEsandpseudo-\nexperts prioritized. We also determined the emotional and moral language in both the\noriginal tweets and the replies. This approach enabled us to characterize key priorities\nfor PHEs and pseudo-experts, as well as differences in messaging strategy between\nthese two groups. We also evaluated the influence of PHE language and strategy on\nthe public response.\nResults: Our analyses revealed that PHEs focus on masking, healthcare, education,\nand vaccines, whereas pseudo-experts discuss therapeutics and lockdowns more fre-\nquently. PHEs typically used positive emotional language across all issues, expressing\noptimism and joy. Pseudo-experts often utilized negative emotions of pessimism and\ndisgust, while limiting positive emotional language to origins and therapeutics. Along\nthe dimensions of moral language, PHEs and pseudo-experts differ on care versus\nharm, and authority versus subversion, across different issues. Negative emotional and\nmoral language tends to boost engagement in COVID-19 discussions, across all issues.\nHowever, the use of positive language by PHEs increases the use of positive language\ninthepublicresponses.PHEsactasliberalpartisans:theyexpressmorepositiveaffect\nin their posts directed at liberals and more negative affect directed at conservative\nelites. In contrast, pseudo-experts act as conservative partisans. These results provide\nnuanced insights into the elements that have polarized the COVID-19 discourse.\nConclusion: Understanding the nature of the public response to PHE\u2019s messages on\nsocial media is essential for refining communication strategies during health crises.\nOur findings emphasize the need for experts to consider the strategic use of moral\nand emotional language in their messages in order to reduce polarization and enhance\npublic trust.\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a world-wide public health crisis, disrupting daily\nlives and overwhelming healthcare facilities. During this time the need for com-\nmunicating reliable medical information and public health guidance became very\nimportant. Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provided a space for pub-\nlic health experts (PHEs) in government, academia, and think tanks to communicate\ntimely, reliable information about the pandemic to the public, to discuss research, and\nto provide guidance [1, 2].\nHowever, as the pandemic progressed, discussions around the pandemic grew\nhighly contentious and ideologically polarized [3, 4]. As public\u2019s trust in institutions\nandexpertseroded,health-relatedmisinformationproliferatedaboutallaspectsofthe\npandemic, from its origins to alternative treatments and the efficacy of nonpharma-\nceutical interventions, and eventually the vaccine [5]. At the heart of this proliferation\nwere influential pseudo-experts , like the \u201cDisinformation Dozen\u201d [6], who amplified\ncontrarian perspectives and challenged the recommendations made by PHEs. When\nPHEs advocated masking and social distancing, pseudo-experts promoted alternative\ntreatments like Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin. When PHEs advocated vacci-\nnation as a method for reaching herd immunity, pseudo-experts emphasized vaccine\ninjury.\n2\nIn this paper, we examine the messages shared by influential accounts posting\nabout public health through the lens of affect. In psychology, \u201caffect\u201d is the experi-\nence of feeling or emotion, and it significantly shapes individual\u2019s attitudes, beliefs\nand behaviors. In online interactions, affect influences how a message is crafted and\nhow it resonates with audiences, ultimately affecting the message\u2019s spread and impact.\nResearch shows that people respond to the emotions expressed in online messages [7],\nalthough due to an asymmetry in human cognition [8], posts expressing negative emo-\ntions receive more engagement than positive posts [9, 10]. It has also been shown\nthat emotionally charged messages, especially ones tapping into moral sentiments\nlike outrage, spread farther online [11, 12]. Affect provides reliable indicators for\ngauging public response to major events and policy decisions [13\u201317] and interacts\nwith ideology to fuel polarization. In fact, political scientists have identified affective\npolarization\u2014a phenomenon in which each party likes and trusts members of its own\nparty by dislikes and distrusts members of the other party\u2014as a fundamental threat\nto effective governance [18, 19]. Public\u2019s reactions to the pandemic, as measured via\nattitudesandsentimentsexpressedinonlinemessages,weremultifaceted[20]andgrew\npolarized early in the pandemic [3]. Moreover, there was an ideological asymmetry\nwherein conservatives shared more low quality health information than liberals [21]\nandwerealsoexposedtomoremisinformation[5].Inaddition,conservativesexpressed\nmore negative moral sentiments in online posts about the pandemic than liberals [4].\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, few works have focused on online influencers\nand experts who shaped public health policy and disseminated health-related infor-\nmation to the public. As a result, we know little about the messaging strategies they\nused, the role that affect played in these messages, and how the public responded to\nthe messages.\nTo address these knowledge gaps, we examined messages posted by public health\nexperts and pseudo-experts on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified\na set of 489 PHEs and 356 pseudo-experts and collected over 372K original tweets that\ntheypostedbetweenJanuary21,2020toJanuary20,2021.Collectively,theseaccounts\nhad a vast reach: each PHE had on average 94K followers (estimated reach around\n45M)andpseudo-expertshadonaverage78Kfollowers(estimatedreacharound30M).\nIn addition, we also collected replies to over 19.5K original tweets posted by PHEs\nduring this time period. Our objectives were two-fold: Identify whatpublic health\ninfluencers talk about online, and howthey talk; (ii) Identify factors that impacted\npublic engagement with the PHEs.\nWe leverage methods introduced in [4] to identify tweets about seven important\npandemic-related issues: origins of the virus, lockdowna and stay-at-home orders,\nmasking mandates, online schooling and education, healthcare, alternative treatments\nand therapeutics, and vaccines. We use state-of-the-art classifiers [22, 23] to iden-\ntify emotional and moral language used tweets. We then use regression to compare\nhow affect shapes the health-related messages on different issues posted by PHEs and\npseudo experts. Finally, we collect all replies for a sample of PHE tweets to study\nhow the use of emotional and moral language impacts engagement by the public with\nthese messages. These analyses yield the following key findings:\n3\n1. PHEs focus on masking, healthcare, education, and vaccines, whereas pseudo-\nexperts discuss therapeutics and lockdowns more frequently.\n2. PHEs typically used positive emotional language across all issues, expressing opti-\nmism and joy. Pseudo-experts often utilized negative emotions of pessimism and\ndisgust, while limiting positive emotional language to origins and therapeutics.\n3. Along the dimensions of moral language, PHEs and pseudo-experts differ on care\nversus harm, and authority versus subversion, across different issues.\n4. Negative emotional and moral language tends to boost engagement in COVID-\n19 discussions, across all issues. However, the use of positive language by PHEs\nincreases the use of positive language in the public responses.\n5. PHEs act as liberal partisans: they express more positive affect in their posts\ndirected at liberals and more negative affect directed at conservative elites. In\ncontrast, pseudo-experts act as conservative partisans.\nOur study examines the inherent complexities in public health communication\ndynamics during the pandemic. Our analysis reveals disparities in not only the issues\npromoted by public health entities and pseudo experts who advance contrarian per-\nspectives but also, highlight differences in the use of emotional and moral language\nalong these issues. Furthermore, our observations reveal asymmetries in emotional\nand moral language directed towards political elites, indicative of underlying ideolog-\nical schisms amongst the scientific elite. This diverges from established practices that\nestablish the efficacy of positive framing techniques for fostering consensus. These dis-\nparities and asymmetries may contribute to exacerbate public distrust towards public\nhealth messaging.\nRelated Work\nPublic Health Messaging during COVID-19\nPrevious literature [24, 25] shows that the public follows cues from in-group elites and\noften oppose cues from the out-group. Effective messaging strategies can be crucial in\ntimes of public health crises. Individuals with higher COVID-19 knowledge practiced\nmore protective behaviors [26, 27]. Messaging that highlights risks to younger adults,\nin addition to risks to older adults was found to bring about a higher threat perception\nabout COVID-19 [28]. On the other hand, messaging that appeals to the audience\u2019s\nmorals or fears for compliance was found to be polarising, divisive and undermined\nsocial cohesion [29]. Latino vaccination rates saw significant increases in one Maryland\nCounty following the adoption of a cartoon grandmother [30]. Messaging comprised\nof vaccine safety and/or efficacy information and political leaders\u2019 endorsement of\nvaccination were found to be highly effective strategies [31]. Unvaccinated [32] found\nthat Republicans who were exposed to enodrsements from Republican elites witnessed\nhighervaccinationintentionsthanthosewhoviewedtheDemocraticeliteendorsement\nwith out-group elite exposures proving counter-productive.\n4\nCOVID-19 Pseudo-Science and Conspiracy Theories\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was used by a large number of PHEs\nand healthcare providers to communicate best practices and information to the peo-\nple, as well as to gain quicker access to healthcare information [33]. The pandemic,\nhowever, was a multifaceted public health crisis, presenting society with unprece-\ndented challenges for which there was no established playbook. This coupled with the\npolarization [5, 21, 34] of the pandemic laid bare a fractured public health messaging\napparatus [35\u201338]. The emergence of contradictory theories and two polarized groups\nof influential elites and experts [39, 40], conspiracy theories about the origins of the\npandemic, its severity and, the efficacy of prophylactic measures started to take hold\n[41, 42]. Initial theories revolved around the severity of the virus with several calling\nit a \u201choax\u201d and \u201cplandemic\u201d [43]. A study by the Pew Research Center [44] found\nthat nearly 25% of the survey responders believed in the conspiracy theory propa-\ngated online that COVID-19 was probably created intentionally by powerful people.\nAnother study found that nearly 3 in 10 Americans believe that COVID-19 was arti-\nficially created in a lab [45]. Theories about virus transmission being connected to\n5G, bats, pangolins and wet-markets were widely propagated by conspiracy theorists\non social media [46, 47]. As the pandemic progressed, we also witnessed the prop-\nagation of pseudo-scientific cures for COVID-19 [48, 49]. With increased pandemic\nrelated engagement from the general public, these conspiracy theories soon started\nto proliferate on social media platforms [50\u201355]. [56] highlights the role of influential\naccounts in mitigation efforts. As influential elites, often holding advanced medical\ndegrees began contradicting with other PHEs on various aspects of the pandemic,\nconsensus amongst the general public suffered as a consequence and at times resulted\nin grave outcomes [57\u201359].\nEmotions and Moral Language Use During COVID-19\nExpression of fear and anger were found to indicate support for restrictive COVID-19\nmitigation policies such as lockdowns to limit the spread of COVID-19 [13], while anx-\niety predicted support for economic policies. Anger was found to indicate support for\naggressive responses to transgressors [14, 60]. [61] found fear to be a strong underlying\nfactor in anti-immigration and pro-segregation stances. Previous studies [62] relied\non surveys to show an increase in distress and uncertainty during the pandemic. [63]\ninvestigated sentiments of Tweets about the COVID-19 vaccine, post-Covid health\nfactors, and health service providers. Among the three topics, healthcare providers\nhad the largest positive sentiment, resulting in an inference that posters were happy\nwith their care and appreciated the work of health providers. [64] found that public\nemotions in Twitter shifted from fear to anger early in the pandemic. [65] revealed\nthat greater susceptibility to emotion contagion was associated with greater concern\nabout the spread of COVID-19. The care and fairness moral foundations were found\nto correlate with compliance of COVID-19 health recommendations including mask-\ning, staying at home and social distancing [66, 67]. Moral attitudes were also able to\npredict county-level vaccination rate [68] and vaccine hesitancy [69]. [70] found that\ncare/harm was associated with pro-vaccine sentiment, whereas liberty/oppression was\n5\ncorrelatedwithanti-vaccineattitudes.Whilevaccinationsareacriticalpolarizingissue\nin the discussion of COVID-19, no work as of yet has explored differences in moral\nappeals across a broader range of contentious COVID-19 issues.\nCOVID-19 Engagement on Social Media\nSocial sharing of opinions and emotions is ubiquitous, and social media has greatly\nexpanded its scope [71, 72]. [72] investigated how responses to what a user shared\naffected their feeling of satisfaction. The authors argue that while sharing emotions\nwith large groups of users online is often viewed as over-sharing, it is likely a means to\nincrease the likelihood of receiving responses from virtual listeners. Analyzing Face-\nbook status updates, [73] found that posts with positive emotions received more likes.\nThe comments associated with these posts were also more positive [73]. Positive emo-\ntion words were also shown to have a positive correlation with the number of retweets\n[74]. [75] reports that while social connections dominate reply behavior, for authors\nwith large ego networks, there is a separation between who replies based on the topic\nof the post. Early thematic analysis of public replies to the pandemic found themes\nof prevention, symptoms, views on politicians and, humor [76]. Replies by anti-vaxx\nusers were found to be more toxic than users with other beliefs about vaccines [77].\n[78] found groups to preferentially amplify elites that are demographically similar to\nthem.\nData and Methods\nWe begin by describing our data collection procedure, and present statistics and basic\ncharacteristics of the dataset. We believe that this description provides the reader\nwithadditionalinsightstobetterinterprettheresults.Finally,wedescribeourcontent\nanalysis procedure and models used to produce results.\nIdentifying Public Health and Pseudo Experts\nWe identified a seed set of 30 PHEs and 30 pseudo-experts who were active on social\nmedia platforms during the pandemic (see Table 1. While the seed set of PHEs\ncomprised largely of individuals who hold advanced degrees in medicine, epidemi-\nology, genomics, infectious diseases or vaccine development, allowing them to offer\nwell-informed, scientifically grounded perspectives on the pandemic, pseudo-experts\ninclude individuals with or without medical degrees, proposing pseudo-scientific\ntheories, alternative treatments and therapeutics. The group also includes the \u201cDisin-\nformation Dozen\u201d, a group of individuals and organizations identified by the Center\nfor Countering Digital Hate as being responsible for promoting false claims about\nCOVID-19 [6].\nIn order to expand these sets of experts, we rely on a publicly available COVID-\n19 Twitter dataset [79] comprising of over 1B COVID-19 tweets gathered between\nJanuary 21, 2020 to January 20, 2021. Previous studies have shown that retweet\ninteractions where users repost or reshare content originally generated by other users,\nindicates an endorsement of the content [80, 81].

Twitter Handles of Accounts Associated with\nPublic Health Experts and Pseudo Experts\nPHEsPseudo Experts\nFig. 1: Retweet interactions. Nodes represent PHEs (green) and pseudo-experts\n(orange) and retweet interactions between them. Green edges represent interactions\nwhere a PHE was retweeted, and orange edges represent interactions where a pseudo-\nexpert was retweeted. The size of the node is proportional to the number of times the\nexpert was retweeted.\nindividuals often agree with others who share identical beliefs [5, 82\u201384], we isolate\nretweet interactions involving PHEs and pseudo-experts to construct two networks\n\u2014 one involving accounts retweeted by PHEs and the other accounts retweeted by\npseudo-experts. We use Eigenvector centrality [85] to rank influential accounts who\nare retweeted by at least one PHE or pseudo-expert, and select the top-500 most\ninfluential accounts. We remove organizations from this list, which leaves us with 489\nand356accounts corresponding to individual PHEs and pseudo-experts respectively.\nHavingidentifiedthegroupofhealthandpseudo-experts,wethenextracttheirtweets.\nOverall, we have 340Ktweets from PHEs and 175Ktweets from pseudo-experts.\n7\nFigure1showstheretweetinteractionsnetworkbetweenPHEsandpseudo-experts\n(845nodes and 107Kedges). The color of the edge is dependent on the target node.\nGreen edges represent interactions where a PHE was retweeted, whereas orange edges\nrepresent interactions where a pseudo-expert was retweeted. The size of the node is\nproportional to how many times the account was retweeted: highly retweeted experts\nhave larger node sizes. The network shows two tightly knit communities, one for\neach group, with sparse between-community interactions. This structure is typical of\nonline echo chambers and suggests that each community mainly listens to their own\ncommunity.\nFigure 2 shows the wordclouds of 100 most popular hashtags used by PHEs\nand pseudo-experts. There are notable similarities and differences. While \u201cvaccine\u201d\nis the most important topic for both groups, PHEs unsurprisingly mention \u201cvac-\ncineswork\u201d and \u201cvaccinate,\u201d in contrast to tweets from pseudo-experts that mention\n\u201cvaccineinjury\u201d, \u201cvaccinefreedom\u201d and urge people to \u201clearntherisk\u201d of vaccines.\n(a) PHEs\n (b) Pseudo Experts\nFig. 2: Hashtag usage. Wordclouds highlight the most prominent 100 hashtags used\nby PHEs and pseudo-experts on Twitter.\nFurther analyzing the content shared by PHEs and pseudo experts, we extract\nthe URLs they shared in their posts and identify the pay-level domains (PLDs) these\nURLs point to. We compute the log-odds ratio to identify which group is more likely\nto share each PLD. Supplementary Figure 12(a) shows the top-15 PLDs for both\ngroups. we find that PHEs were more likely to share URLs from highly reputable\nsources such as Journal of American Medical Association, Nature, Boston Review and\nNew York Times. On the other hand, pseudo experts share more questionable sources\nsuch as The Gateway Pundit, Childrens Health Defense, Patriot Project and Russia\nToday among others. PLDs often have ideological leanings, ranging from liberal ( 0)\nto least-biased ( 0.5) to conservative ( 1) [86]. Supplementary Figure 12(b) compares\nthe distribution of ideological leanings of information sources shared by PHEs and\npseudo-experts. While, PHEs tended to share more liberal sources, pseudo experts\nshared more conservative sources.\n8\nIdentifying Issue-Relevant Tweets\nWe decompose the multi-faceted discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic along\nvarious contentious issues: COVID-19 origins, lockdowns and business closures, mask\nmandates,schoolclosures,therapeutics,healthcareand,vaccines.Inordertodoso,we\nrely on methods discussed in [4, 87] to extract issue-relevant keywords from Wikipedia\narticles. Once we identify keywords, we identify tweets that explicitly mention any of\nthese keywords as being issue-relevant. This approach was validated in [4] as being\nable to accurately identify issue-relevant content. Table 2 illustrates sample tweets\nfrom our dataset discussing each issue.\nIssue Tweet\nEducation My take: If you want your child to return to in-person classes so far\nNM = only state across the Southern US doing things right [...]\nHealthcare \u2018Our neighbors, our family members\u2019: Small-town hospitals over-\nwhelmed by COVID-19 deaths\nLockdowns Children\u2019s screen time had doubled compared to a year ago.

Discussions related to\nmasking are defined by considerations of face coverings, mask mandates, shortages,\nand anti-mask sentiment. Education-related content involves tweets regarding school\nclosures, the reopening of educational institutions, homeschooling, and online learning\nduring the pandemic. The healthcare issue deals with conversations on the state of the\nhealthcare system, availability of personal protective equipment, ventilators, oxygen\nsupplies and intensive care units.

SpanEmo, using a transformer-based\narchitecture. It surpasses previous methods in its ability to capture the correlations\namongvariousemotions.Whenpresentedwiththetextofatweet,themodelgenerates\nconfidence scores for the presence of a wide spectrum of emotions. We later bin these\nconfidence scores using a 0.5threshold to binarize the output. The emotions it can\nidentify include anticipation ,joy,love,optimism ,anger,disgust,fear,sadnessand,\npessimism . The definitions for these emotions are borrowed from [88] as follows:\n\u2022anticipation (also includes interest, vigilance)\n\u2022joy (also includes serenity, ecstasy)\n\u2022love (also includes affection)\n\u2022optimism (also includes hopefulness, confidence)\n\u2022anger (also includes annoyance, rage)\n\u2022disgust (also includes disinterest, dislike, loathing)\n\u2022fear (also includes apprehension, anxiety, terror)\n\u2022sadness (also includes pensiveness, grief)\n\u2022pessimism (also includes cynicism, no confidence)\nPrior research has shown that emotional and moral language in social media\nmessages impacts how they are received by the audiences and engagement [7, 12].\nThe Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) [89] provides a framework for understand-\ning how moral values shape people\u2019s political attitudes and behaviors. MFT proposes\nthat individuals\u2019 values and judgments can be described by five moral virtue/vice\npairs - care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and\nsanctity/degradation. More specifically,\n\u2022Care/harm: This foundation revolves around the concept of empathy and compas-\nsion. People who prioritize this foundation value caring for others and preventing\nharm. They are sensitive to the suffering of others and strive to promote their\nwell-being.\n\u2022Fairness/cheating: This foundation is concerned with issues of justice, reciprocity,\nand fairness. Individuals who emphasize this foundation are attuned to issues of\nequality, fairness, and proportionality. They believe in treating others fairly and\noppose exploitation and unfair advantage.\n\u2022Loyalty/betrayal: People who prioritize loyalty value group cohesion, allegiance,\nand solidarity. They are inclined to support and defend their in-groups, whether\nit be family, community, or nation, and perceive betrayal or disloyalty as morally\nreprehensible.\n10\n\u2022Authority/subversion: This foundation centers on respect for authority, tradition,\nand hierarchy. Individuals who emphasize this foundation value social order, respect\nfor authority figures, and obedience to legitimate institutions and norms. They\nbelieve that maintaining authority and order is essential for a stable society.\n\u2022Sanctity/degradation: This foundation involves the reverence for purity, sanctity,\nand sacredness. People who prioritize this foundation are concerned with issues\nrelated to cleanliness, moral purity, and spiritual transcendence. They may view\ncertain actions, objects, or behaviors as inherently sacred or profane.\nOur morality detection model is trained on the BERT transformer-based pre-\ntrained language model by [90]. The training process involves three Twitter datasets,\na manually annotated COVID dataset [91], the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus\ndataset covering six different topics [92], and a dataset of political tweets from US\ncongressmembers[93].Byincorporatinganin-domaintrainingsetfocusedonCOVID-\n19, along with other diverse datasets spanning various topics, we enhance the model\u2019s\ngeneralizability for application to target data as discussed in [23].\nOrigins Lockdowns Masking Healthcare Education Therapeutics Vaccines0.00.20.40.6Mean Daily Proportion****\nns************\n********PHE\nPseudo Experts\nFig. 3: Comparing the activity of PHEs and pseudo-experts along each issue.\nBox plots compare the daily proportion of issue related tweets from PHEs and\npseudo-experts.

Figure 3 compares the average daily share\nof tweets from both groups on each issue. Overall, we find that pseudo-experts tend\n11\nto be more vocal on the issues of lockdowns, therapeutics and vaccines while, PHEs\ngenerate more content about masking, healthcare and education. We do not witness\nany significant differences in the discourse about origins of the virus. These trends\nreflect the attention to issues by each group prior to President Biden\u2019s inauguration,\nwhich is the period covered by this study.\nTo better summarize the varied perspectives expressed by PHEs and pseudo\nexperts on the seven issues of interest, we randomly sample 25 tweets for the two\ngroups across these issues and prompt ChatGPT to provide the broad perspective\nbeing expressed using the prompt:\nSummarize the perspectives being expressed about <Issue> in these tweets:\n<T>\nwhere <Issue> is one of [Origins, Lockdowns, Masking, Education,\nHealthcare, Therapeutics, Vaccines] and<T>represents a concatenation of the\n25 tweets that were randomly sampled for each issue and group pair.\nThe results presented in Supplementary Table 3 demonstrate the contrasting view-\npoints between the two groups on various issues. Regarding the origins of the virus,\nPHEs generally lean towards the belief that it originated in a laboratory, albeit\nwith some skepticism, while pseudo-experts heavily criticize China and its potential\ninvolvement in gain of function research. PHEs emphasize the importance of ongoing\nvigilance, adherence to stay-at-home orders, and widespread use of masks, whereas\npseudo-experts question the effectiveness of lockdowns and mask mandates and crit-\nicize government intervention in these areas. On the topic of therapeutics, PHEs\nurge caution against self-prescribing drugs like Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin,\nand Ivermectin without evidence of their efficacy in treating COVID-19, whereas\npseudo-experts advocate for the use of these medications.\nConcern Activity \u2013 Pseudo ExpertsConcern Activity \u2013 PHEs(b)(a)\nFig. 4: Timeline of attention to issues.

Figure 4(a)\nand (b) shows the daily share of posts from each group about the issues. When stay-\nat-home orders start being issued in mid-March 2020, we see a rise in lockdown related\ndiscussions from PHEs. Lockdowns-related discourse from pseudo experts picked up\nsteam mid-April amidst the calls for reopening the economy and further accelerated\nin early June 2020 during Black Lives Matter protests, when they were critical of mass\nprotests. As COVID-19 cases rose in late March 2020, we see a spike in healthcare\nrelateddiscoursefromPHEswithgrowingcallsforemergencypreparednessintermsof\nimproving access to personal protective equipment and ventilators. We do not observe\na corresponding increased from pseudo-experts. We see a small spike in therapeutics\nrelated discussions among PHEs following President Trump\u2019s April 24, 2020 comment\non using bleach to ward off the COVID-19 virus. Almost immediately following the\nFederal Drug Administration (FDA)\u2019s issuance of a Emergency Use Authorization\non various therapeutics such as Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on March 28, 2020, we\nsee an immediate increase in therapeutics related discussions from pseudo-experts.\nHowever, we see highest share of posts from them on July 26, 2020 when then-White\nHouse Chief of Staff Mark Meadows announced that alternative therapeutics would\nbe coming soon. We also see spikes in education related discussions from PHEs and\npseudo experts following President Trump\u2019s July 8, 2020 call to reopen educational\ninstitutions. However, the spikes were for very different reasons - PHEs expressed\nincreased skepticism towards reopening schools while pseudo-experts supported the\nreopening call. The largest spikes for both groups are for vaccine-related discussions\nfollowing Pfizer\u2019s announcement of successful COVID-19 Phase-3 vaccine trials (10%\nto 37% for PHEs and 20% to 32% for pseudo-experts).\nAnticipation Joy Love Optimism Disgust Anger Sadness Fear Pessimism0.00.20.40.6Mean Daily Proportion\n********\n****\n************\n******** PHE\nPseudo Experts****\nFig. 5: Comparing emotions expressed by PHEs and pseudo-experts in messages\nabout the issues.

Interestingly, we do not see much love or pessimism\nin our data.\nDynamics of Affect\nEmotions fluctuate over time and in response to events. Figure 6 illustrates the tem-\nporal dynamics of positive emotions expressed by PHEs and pseudo-experts. We\nleverage ChatGPT to summarize changes in emotions expressed and are discussed fur-\nther in Supplementary Table 4. Optimism and joy among PHEs surge following the\nannouncement of stay-at-home orders post March 15, 2020. This can be attributed to\nfactors such as gratitude for guidance by then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo\nand enhanced accessibility to COVID-19 testing. Similarly, we note a corresponding\nalbeit smaller increase among pseudo-experts, particularly in response to President\nTrump\u2019s management of the pandemic and France\u2019s endorsement of HCQ as a viable\nCOVID-19 treatment.\n14\nAnothersurgeinjoy,anticipation,andoptimismamongPHEsoccursafterNovem-\nber 9, 2020, following Pfizer\u2019s announcement of successful Phase-3 trials for its\nCOVID-19 vaccine. PHEs hailed this development as a remarkable achievement and\nanticipated emergency use authorization from the FDA. While positive emotions also\nincreased among pseudo-experts, the magnitude was notably lower. Pseudo-experts\nexpressed optimism regarding the success of Operation Warp Speed, the imminent\nreopening of businesses, and the introduction of Lilly\u2019s monoclonal antibody drug.\nNegative emotions such as disgust and anger escalated for both groups post March\n15, 2020, with a more pronounced increase among pseudo-experts. The upsurge in\nanger and disgust within each group stemmed from different reasons. PHEs expressed\ndisappointment with the measures taken by the Trump administration to combat\nthe virus, whereas pseudo-experts voiced skepticism concerning the World Health\nOrganization\u2019s interactions with China, Governor Cuomo\u2019s management of public\ntransportation in New York, and the effectiveness of lockdowns in containing COVID-\n19. Although both groups experienced parallel declines in anger and disgust after US\nelections on November 9, 2020, the reductions were more significant among PHEs.\nWe also examine the use of moral language by the two groups. Supplementary\nFigure 13 compares the distribution of the daily share of tweets expressing each moral\nfoundation. Overall, PHEs use more positive moral language, emphasizing the dimen-\nsionsofcare,fairness,authority,loyaltyandpurity,whilepseudo-expertstendtoprefer\nthe negative moral dimensions of harm, cheating, subversion and betrayal. The dif-\nferences in use of moral language are more subdued compared to those for emotions.\nSupplementary Figure 14 illustrates the temporal dynamics of positive and negative\nmoral language used by PHEs and pseudo-experts. We summarize the positive spikes\nusing ChatGPT in Supplementary Table 5.\nWe witness an increase in the expression of care from PHEs post stay at home\norders. This increase is marked by calls for widespread lockdown measures, testing\nand relief proposals for low-income households. However, there is a marginal decline\nin care language from pseudo-experts. Harm moral language decreases for both groups\nbut more so for PHEs. In response to Pfizer\u2019s successful phase-3 trials, the use of care\nlanguage increases for both PHEs and pseudo-experts coupled with a decline in the\nuse of harm language. Both groups express care in discussing how the introduction\nof vaccines could bring an end to the pandemic. Additionally, pseudo-experts express\nconcerns about the safety of the mRNA vaccines and criticize Bill Gates\u2019 call for\nvaccine mandates.\nAsymmetries in Emotions and Moral Language\nPublic health experts and pseudo-experts had conflicting priorities. PHEs promoted\nvaccination and advocated for stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the\nspread of the virus. In contrast, pseudo-experts expressed skepticism towards such\ninterventions, emphasizing personal choice. We examine how these differences were\nmanifested in the emotional and moral language used by the two groups.\nTo quantify issue-specific variation in emotions and moral language use by the two\ngroups, we conduct a multivariate logistic regression analysis at the tweet level for\neach emotion and moral foundation. We examine the relationship between the issue\n15\nFig. 7: Comparing emotions conveyed by PHEs and pseudo-experts across various\ntopics. Displays the odds ratio of a tweet\u2019s relevance to a particular issue based on\nthe expression of specific emotions by PHEs.

Additionally, the model incorporates a categorical variable to\ndelineate between different groups. To account for potential differences in the emo-\ntional responses of the two groups, we introduce an interaction term between issues\ndiscussed and the group variable. We formulate the model separately for each issue\nas follows:\n<Emotion>\u223corigins +lockdowns +masking +education +healthcare +therapeutics +vaccines +\n(origins +lockdowns +masking +education +healthcare +therapeutics +vaccines )\u2217group,\nwhere, groupdistinguishes between PHEs and pseudo-experts. We run separate\nregression models for each emotion. The coefficients for the main effects represent the\nchange in the log-odds of the emotion for the PHEs when discussing an issue while\nholding all other issues constant. On the other hand, the sum of coefficients of the\nmain effects and interaction effects, quantify the change in log-odds for the pseudo-\nexperts. For example, if the coefficient for lockdowns is positive, it suggests that when\nlockdowns are being discussed there is an increase in the expression of a particular\nemotion from when they do not discuss lockdowns.\nFigure 7 compares the log-odds along with the corresponding standard errors of\nestimation, to show which group used more emotional language to frame a specific\nissue. The plot highlights differences between the two groups and gives insights into\n16\nFig. 8: Comparing moral foundations conveyed by PHEs and pseudo-experts across\nvarious topics.

The biggest gap in emotions appears on the issue of lock-\ndowns, where pseudo-experts are far more likely to express anger, disgust and sadness\nthan PHEs. This position is consistent with the efforts to end the lockdowns (see\nGreat Barrington declaration [94]). The second largest gap in emotions appears in\nthe discussion of therapeutics, where PHEs are more likely to express anger and dis-\ngust, but pseudo-experts are less likely to use these emotions. Pseudo-experts also use\nmore positive language with more joy and optimism when talking about therapeu-\ntics, in contrast to PHEs, consistent with the highly contentious debates about this\nissue. Other notable differences include pseudo-experts expressing more fear and less\njoy about vaccines, while PHEs express less fear and more optimism.\nWe carry out a similar analysis of the moral language used by the two groups of\nusers. The coefficients for the main effects represent the change in the log-odds of the\nmoralfoundationforthePHEswhenanissueisbeingdiscussedwhileholdingallother\nissues constant and the sum of coefficients of the main effects and interaction effects\nquantifies the change in log-odds for the pseudo-experts. Figure 8 compares the log-\nodds, along with the corresponding standard errors of estimation, to illustrate which\ngroup relied more heavily on a given moral foundation when framing a specific issue.\nThedifferencesinmorallanguageusagearelesspronouncedcomparedtoemotions.\nPHEs tend to emphasize care and loyalty in discussions of lockdowns and masking,\nconsistent with their use of prosocial messaging focusing on the collective benefits\nof these measures. Conversely, pseudo-experts tend to convey more notions of harm,\nfairness, authority, and subversion when addressing lockdowns. This is in line with\nthis issue being extremely contentious for them. Surprisingly, pseudo-experts are more\nlikely to use fairness to frame their discussions of all issues, except vaccines.\nThe comparison of emotions and moral foundations between PHEs and pseudo-\nexperts, makes evident their conflicting positions on key issues pandemic related\n17\nEmotionsMoral Foundations(a)(b)Fig. 9: Asymmetries in affect towards elites. (a) PHEs direct more negative emotions\n(anger, disgust) toward conservative elites and more positive emotions (joy, optimism)\nin their mentions of liberal elites, which is a hallmark of affective polarization. In\ncontrast pseudo-experts direct more negativity toward liberal elites.

PHEs tend to focus on discussions related to vaccines, healthcare, and\neducation and these are issues on which we see more negative emotional framing by\nthe pseudo-experts. In contrast, pseudo-experts are more focused on therapeutics and\nalternative treatments. Similarly, their negative framing of lockdowns and vaccines\nreflects their disapproval of the issues that were heavily promoted by PHEs. This\ndivergence of affect underscores the polarization in the society at large. Understand-\ning these differences is crucial for informing public health communication efforts that\npromote consensus within different segments of the population.\nAffective Polarization in Health Communication\nStudies show that public response to the pandemic became polarized fairly quickly,\nwith political partisanship shaping online activity and discussions about the pandemic\nalready in the early stages of the pandemic [3, 21]. Online discussions also became\nemotionally polarized: when interacting with members of the opposite party, Twitter\nusers expressed more anger and disgust, more toxicity, and less joy than in their\ninteractions with same-party members [95]. Such interactions are characteristic of\naffective polarization [18], patterns of in-group love and out-group hate that have\ncontributed to the growing partisan divide and the erosion of trust between the two\nparties in US. As a result, partisanship predicted the adoption of pandemic prevention\nmeasures more than other factors [96].\nTo measure affective polarization, we analyze the emotional language PHEs and\npseudo-experts directed at the political elites in their original tweets. We use a pre-\nviously curated list of Twitter handles of over 1.7K political elites,1which include\ncurrent and former Senators, Representatives, and media pundits. Figure 9 shows the\n1https://github.com/sdmccabe/new-tweetscores\n18\nproportion of tweets from each group with mentions of political elites that express var-\nious affect. For instance, PHE-Lib indicates the share of PHEs\u2019 tweets with a greater\nfrequency of references to liberal elites compared to conservative ones, expressing a\nspecific emotion or moral foundation.\nThe figure reveals that PHEs post as liberal partisans: when they mention conser-\nvative elites in their tweets, they use more negative emotions and moral subversion,\nbut when they mention liberal elites, they express more positive emotions. In con-\ntrast, pseudo-experts are conservative partisans: they direct more negativity toward\nliberal elites while expressing more positivity towards other conservative elites.\nFigure 15 lists the top ten accounts that are more likely to be mentioned by PHEs\nand pseudo-experts positively or negatively. We then assess the retweet interactions\nof public health and pseudo-experts with political elites. To this end, we construct a\nbipartite network comprising of directed edges from PHEs/pseudo-experts to political\nelites with each edge indicating the political elite retweeted by a PHE or pseudo-\nexpert. Supplementary Figure 16(a) shows the distribution of ideology estimates for\npolitical elites active on Twitter during COVID-19. The ideology estimates are were\nobtained from1and were calculated using methods described in [97]. The median\nideology score of political elites on Twitter is \u22120.56which is consistent with the past\nreportsidentifyingtheliberalskewofTwitter[98].Themedianliberalandconservative\nelite have an ideology score of \u22120.73and1.28respectively. Interestingly, the median\nideology score of the elites retweeted by PHEs and pseudo-experts are \u22120.76and\n1.54indicating that a considerable share of the elites retweeted by PHEs and pseudo-\nexperts are more liberal and more conservative respectively, than the median liberal\nand conservative elite. In Supplementary Figure 16(b) we visualize this network to\nfind two highly clustered interactions. The color of the edge indicates the color of the\nsource node i.e., PHEs (green) or pseudo-experts (orange). We find that PHEs mostly\nretweet liberal elites whereas, pseudo-experts mostly retweet conservative elites. This\nhighlights the ideological clustering of the scientific elite in the United States.\nOverall, these findings highlight the existence of a partisan divide within the scien-\ntific community, as evidenced by the differential use of emotional and moral language\nby both PHEs and pseudo-experts towards liberal and conservative elites. Such polar-\nization within the public health elites has implications for the perceived credibility of\nhealth messaging, and ultimately, the ability to foster consensus and cooperation in\naddressing public health challenges.\nPublic Engagement with PHEs\nEffective public health communication relies not only on the dissemination of accurate\ninformationbutalsoonhowthatinformationisreceivedandinterpretedbythepublic.\nTo investigate this, we extracted original tweets (excluding retweets, reply tweets and\nquotedtweets)fromPHEs,yieldingusacorpusof 144Ktweets.Wethencollectreplies\nto these tweets, aiming to understand the engagement in response to these tweets from\nPHEs. However, our efforts were hindered by challenges encountered when Twitter\n(now X) restricted access to their academic API, limiting our ability to gather reply\ninteractions to all original tweets.\n19\n(a) Emotions(b) Moral FoundationsFig. 10: Engagement with PHEs. Dot and whisker plots show the regression coeffi-\ncients and standard errors. The coefficients represent the increase in number of replies\nwhen an (a) emotion or (b)moral foundation is used by the PHE in the original tweet\nwhile keeping others constant.\nWe were able to collect replies for 19.5Koriginal PHE tweets, a total of 786K\nreplies from 345Kunique users. On average, each tweet received approximately 40.24\nreplies. The distribution of replies ranged widely, from a minimum of 1reply to a\nmaximum of 11.7Kreplies, with a median per tweet reply count of 5. To quantify\nthe effects of emotions and moral language use on the number of replies a tweet from\nPHEs receives, we use linear regression with the number of replies as the dependent\nvariable and emotions or moral foundations expressed in the original tweet as the\nindependent variables. With different PHEs having varying number of followers, the\nengagement their tweets garner will also be varied. In order to control for this we add\nthe number of followers a tweet\u2019s author has as an independent variable. We execute\ntwomodels,oneforassessingtheimpactofemotionsandtheotherformoralattitudes.\nThe emotions model is formulated as follows:\nreplies\u223cfollowers +anger +anticipation +disgust +fear+joy+love+optimism +pessimism +sadness\nwhere, replies represents the dependent variable, the number of replies to an\noriginal tweet from a PHE, followers is the number of that PHE\u2019s followers, and\nanger,anticipation ,disgust,etc., are binary variables indicating whether that\nemotion is present in the original tweet. A similar model can be written for moral\nfoundations.\nFigure 10(a) and (b) compares the impact of various emotions and moral founda-\ntionsonengagementrespectively.Wefindthat,controllingforthenumberoffollowers,\npresence of anger and disgust in the original tweet generates more replies. This is also\ntrue for negative moral language: presence of harm, cheating, betrayal and subversion\nover its corresponding moral virtues is associated with more replies. These findings\nadd important nuance to previous research showing that tweets expressing negative\nemotions[99]andmoraloutrage[11]aremorelikelytoberetweeted.Specifically,while\nnegative emotions and moral language also receive more engagement in the form of\n20\nreplies, not all negative language leads to higher engagement: pessimism and sadness\nin the original tweets is associated with fewer replies. Importantly, positive language\ncan even suppress engagement, as is the case for original PHE tweets expressing joy\nandlove.SupplementaryTables6and7tabulatetheresultsofthisregressionanalysis.\n(a) Emotions(b) Moral Foundations\nFig. 11: User engagement with PHEs and Pseudo Experts.

We look at whether the use of a particular emotion (or moral\nfoundation) in a PHE tweet triggers similar language in the replies. We use multi-\nvariate logistic regression models to quantify the odds-ratio of a user expressing an\nemotion or moral attitude when presented with a tweet from the PHE containing\ncertain emotional language (similarly extended to morals):\n<Emotion> reply\u223canger orig+disgust orig+fear orig+sadness orig+pessimism orig+\nanticipation orig+joyorig+optimism orig+love orig+followers\nFigure 11(a) shows the odds ratio of users expressing a specific emotion in response\nto the emotion conveyed in a PHE\u2019s original tweet. We observe that users are more\nlikely to express the same emotions as the original tweets. Interestingly, when PHEs\nexpress joy and love, users are more likely to express joy, love and optimism, and\nless likely to express anger and disgust. Conversely, when PHEs convey negative emo-\ntions, users are more likely to express anger and disgust. Respondents generally match\nthe emotion tone of the original tweets, except when PHEs express sadness, which\nrespondents counter with optimism. Figure 11(b) illustrates the odds ratio of users\n21\nexpressing a specific moral foundation in response to the moral foundation conveyed\nin a PHE\u2019s original tweet. Similar to emotions, we observe a mirroring effect in the\nusage of most moral foundations between PHEs and ordinary users. Surprisingly, we\nnotice a higher odds ratio of care being expressed when subversion is used by PHEs.\nThese findings underscore the impact of emotional resonance in shaping user\nresponses to public health messaging. When PHEs rely on positive framing, users tend\nto echo these positive sentiments. This suggests that the emotional and moral framing\nused by public health experts influences the emotion expressed by other users. Con-\nversely, when negative framing is employed, users tend to reflect these sentiments with\nincreased negative expressions. These insights illuminate the importance of carefully\ncrafting public health messaging so as to foster cohesive online discourse.\nDiscussion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic not only brought about an unprecedented global health\ncrisis but also highlighted the critical role of effective communication in navigating\npublic health challenges. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, emerged as\nvital channels for health experts to disseminate timely and reliable information to\nthe public. However, as the pandemic unfolded, discussions surrounding it became\nincreasingly polarized, leading to the proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy\ntheories, often propagated by pseudo-experts. By analyzing a substantial dataset of\nover515Ktweetsgeneratedbyroughly 845elites,thisstudydelvesintothisinfodemic,\ncomparing the emotional and moral appeals employed by public health experts and\npseudo-experts on Twitter across various pandemic related issues.\nPrincipal Results\nFirstly, we categorized tweets from PHEs and pseudo-experts to seven different\nissues\u2014originsofthepandemic,stay-at-homelockdownmandates,maskingmandates,\nhealthcare infrastructure, reopening the education system, therapeutics and vaccina-\ntions. Our analysis of Twitter discourse from public health experts and pseudo-experts\nshows that they focused on different subsets of issues, similar to what was found in\nother work [40]. While PHEs predominantly focused on promoting public health mea-\nsures such as social distancing, masking, improving healthcare infrastructure, safer\nreopening of schools, pseudo-experts opposed lockdowns and mask mandates and\npromoted alternative views on therapeutics and virus origins.\nOur study goes beyond previous works to reveal emotional and moral divides\nsurrounding key COVID-19 issues. While, PHEs expressed more positive emotions,\nand emphasize moral virtues when discussing lockdowns, masking, healthcare, and\nvaccines, pseudo-experts expressed more anger and disgust in their posts on these\nissues and instead were more positive about therapeutics and alternative cures. The\ndisparate use of emotional and moral language towards ideological elites, showed that\nPHEs were aligned with liberal elites and pseudo-experts with conservative elites,\npotentially signalling the role of health influencers in growing polarization.\nFinally, our study identifies a clear trend in how people react to tweets from public\nhealth experts. When these experts express anger, disgust, or moral values, they tend\n22\nto get more replies from users. Additionally, we found that it\u2019s more likely for replies\nto echo the same emotional or moral sentiments as in the original tweets from PHEs.\nLimitations and Future Work\nWe note several areas of future work. Given that Twitter users are not a representa-\ntive sample of the United States population, our findings may primarily reflect the\nperspectives of a specific demographic (i.e., younger, more liberal, better educated,\nmore interested in politics) [100]. Future studies can instead focus on multiple plat-\nforms and incorporate multimodal data. While our study examines COVID-19-related\ndiscourse, there\u2019s potential for investigations into scientific divisions in perspectives\non polarized topics such as climate change and genetically modified foods. Moreover,\nexploring the growing debate on the factors contributing to the decline in adolescent\nmental health presents another avenue for inquiry.\nDespite being state-of-the art models to identify emotions and moral language\n[22,23],thethesemodelsaren\u2019toracles.Theadventofmorepowerful,albeitexpensive,\ninstruction-tuned language models like ChatGPT, future works can leverage them\nat scale to identify emotions and moral attitudes more accurately. However, given\nthese tasks\u2019 inherent ambiguity, this application might not be straightforward. We\nemphasize that the event related shifts in use of emotions and moral language allows\nus to make observational assertions rather than causal ones. Future work can attempt\nto run natural experiments to quantify the impact of events on different cohorts.Aside\nfrom this, the disruption in our access to Twitter\u2019s Education Access API resulted in\nus only being able to collect replies for a subset of the PHEs tweets in our dataset.\nHowever, it is important to note that the subset of tweets we collected replies for were\nnot intentionally sampled or biased in any way. Finally, our dataset, despite being\nextensive, is between January 2020 and January 2021, limiting our findings to this\nperiod and excluding potential shifts in perspectives that occurred later on.\nConclusions\nIn summary, our study offers valuable insights into the dynamics of public health\ncommunication on social media amidst the unfolding pandemic, exploring viewpoints\nfrom both health experts and pseudo-experts. The identification of an ideological and\nemotional division in the scientific community poses a potential barrier to consensus-\nbuilding and undermines public trust in health messaging. Nevertheless, policymakers\ncan leverage findings from interactions with public health experts to devise tai-\nlored strategies aimed at enhancing consensus. Tackling these obstacles demands a\nmultifaceted approach, integrating fact-checking, debunking initiatives, and targeted\ncommunication efforts designed to cultivate trust and encourage critical thinking\namong the public.\n23\nAbbreviations\nPHE:PublicHealthExperts;MFT:MoralFoundationsTheory;HCQ:Hydroxychloro-\nquine; CDC: Center for Disease Control; EUA: Emergency Use Authorization; FDA:\nFood and Drugs Administration; mRNA: Messenger Ribonucleic Acid\nReferences\n[1] Tang, Q., Zhang, K. & Li, Y.

Although several\nexperts presented indispensable outcomes of the con \ufb02ict, it is\nimportant to note that the current situation between Russia and\nUkraine is not merely a short-term outcome (Brunk and Hakimi,\n2022 ). The Russian government claimed that Ukraine fell into the\nhands of extremists after the dethronement of pro-Russian for-\nmer Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. As a\nresult, the Russian government took action to annex Crimea\n(Kudelia, 2022 ). In late 2021, the Russian government began\nbuilding up military forces near the Ukrainian border, escalating\ntension (Kirby, 2022 ) due to Ukraine \u2019s attempts to join the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Consequently, the Russian\ngovernment launched an invasion of Ukraine (Vajriyati et al.\n2022 )\nFollowing the invasion, the United States condemned Russia \u2019s\nactions (Whitehouse, 2022b ) and garnered international support\nfor imposing sanctions against Russia (Whitehouse, 2022a ).\nEconomic pressure was exerted on Russia \u2019s energy, mining,\n\ufb01nance, defence, and industrial sectors, with export and import\nrestrictions imposed on Russia and its supportive countries. On\nthe military front, the U. S. provided weapons with related sys-\ntems and supported equipment to help Ukraine \u2019s security directly\nor indirectly (Whitehouse, 2023 ). However, depending on poli-\ntical orientations, there have been doubts in the United States\nabout the appropriateness of aiding Ukraine (Pew Research\nCenter, 2023 ).\nIn fact, Pew Research Center ( 2023 ) conducted a survey in\nJanuary 2023, revealing that Republicans perceived aid to Ukraine\nas excessive compared to Democrats. This survey highlighted how\nviewpoints can differ based on the political orientation within a\nnation. This is the central proposition of our research.\nTraditionally, various news media outlets, including CNN and\nFOX, engage in ongoing discourse and re \ufb02ect their own stances\non speci \ufb01c issues (Blanchard, 2013 ), with each news media having\nits own political orientation (Entman, 2007 ).\nTheoretical frameworks, such as Framing Theory (Entman,\n1993 ) and Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt and Graham,\n2007 ), provide a deeper understanding of why media outlets\nexhibit distinct political orientations through their choice of\nlanguage. Framing Theory, proposed by Entman ( 1993 ), posits\nthat media organizations selectively emphasize certain aspects of\nan issue while ignoring others, effectively shaping public per-\nception and interpretations. Different news outlets, in \ufb02uenced by\ntheir ideological perspectives, may present the same event\nthrough varying frames, thus embedding their political leanings\nin their articles.\nAdditionally, Haidt \u2019s Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt and\nGraham, 2007 ) suggests that individuals and groups differ sys-\ntematically in their moral values, which in \ufb02uences political\nideology and discourse. According to this theory, conservative\nmedia may highlight moral dimensions, such as loyalty, authority,and sanctity, whereas progressive media may emphasize care,\nfairness, and social justice. Such moral framing inherently shapes\nthe language used in media coverage of politically contentious\nissues, such as the Russia-Ukraine con \ufb02ict.\nBased on this observation, we assumed that articles produced\nby the news media might indicate their political leanings, parti-\ncularly concerning the Russia-Ukriaine con \ufb02ict.\nConsequently, we formulated the following Research Questions\n(RQs) to investigate this assumption\n\u25cfRQ1: Do the articles produced by the news media on theissue contain their own political orientations?Governments inherently possess their own political orienta-\ntions (Potrafke, 2018 ). Presidents typically have prior political\nexperience within a party, which informs their perspectives and\ndecision-making framework (Walker, 2009 ). Consequently, the\nadministration led by the president formulates policies and\nimplements decisions based on these orientations. Based on this\npremise, we de \ufb01ne the second research question:\n\u25cfRQ2: To what extent do government documents\nannouncing and implementing speci \ufb01c policies re \ufb02ect\npolitical ideology on the issue?\nWe used two methodologies to address these research ques-\ntions. Initially, we employed sentiment analysis, which is a\ncomputational approach that assesses opinions, emotions, and\nsubjectivity in text (Medhat et al., 2014 ). Building on previous\nstudies on sentiment analysis, we re \ufb01ned our methodology to\nexplore whether articles mirror the political leanings of news\nmedia. Furthermore, to adopt a computational approach, we\nintegrated arti \ufb01cial intelligence models. Arti \ufb01cial intelligence\nencompasses technologies such as machine learning and deep\nlearning, enabling systems to accurately interpret external data,\nlearn from it, and \ufb02exibly adapt to achieve speci \ufb01c goals and tasks\n(Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019 ). In this study, we incorporated\nmachine learning and deep-learning models to perform compu-\ntational tasks. By training these models with articles concerning\nthe Russia-Ukraine con \ufb02ict from various U.S. media outlets, we\nconducted experiments to evaluate their effectiveness in detecting\nthe political orientation embedded within news articles, achieving\nan accuracy rate of 94.88%.\nWe designed the following study to address these two research\nquestions:\nFirst, we applied statistical methodologies to examine whether\nt h e r ew e r es i g n i \ufb01cant differences among the articles produced\nby media outlets with distinct political orientations. Speci \ufb01cally,\nwe employed a psycholinguistic analysis. Psycholinguistic ana-\nlysis investigates the relationship between language and cogni-\ntive processes by focusing on how linguistic structures in \ufb02uence\nperception, memory, and thought. This \ufb01eld explores how lan-\nguage shapes cognitive function, and in turn, how these func-\ntions affect language use (Altmann, 1998 ). Based on previous\nstudies, we re \ufb01ned our methodology to assess whether news\narticles re \ufb02ected the political orientation of their respective\nmedia sources. Second, we employed natural language proces-\nsing (NLP) models to classify media articles and evaluate their\naccuracy in capturing political orientations. Arti \ufb01cial intelli-\ngence (AI) encompasses technologies such as machine learningand deep learning, enabling systems to accurately interpret\nexternal data, learn from it, and \ufb02exibly adapt to achieve speci \ufb01c\ntasks and objectives (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019 ). In this study,\nwe integrated machine-learning and deep-learning models to\nconduct computational analyses. Third, to determine whether\ngovernment documents contain implicit political intentions, we\napplied the aforementioned statistical methodologies and AI\nmodels for veri \ufb01cation. Finally, we applied topic modeling to\nu n c o v e rh i d d e nt h e m e si nt h ed o c u m e n t sf o ram o r ei n - d e p t h\nanalysis.\nLiterature review\nSeveral scholars explored textual political differences. For\ninstance, (Kangas, 2014 ) conducted an experiment during the\n2008 presidential election and analyzed the relationship between\ndiscourse and the personalities of presidential and vice-\npresidential candidates in the United States. They collected\n144 speech samples and employed the Linguistic Inquiry and\nWord Count (LIWC) dictionaries to apply one-way analysis ofARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y\n2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |         (2025) 12:1169 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y\nvariance (ANOVA). Based on these results, linguistic differences\nbetween candidates were observed.\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Abe ( 2018 ) investigated the\nunderlying reasons for the strong association between evaluationsof candidate personalities and voting preferences. They collected\na dataset from 160 participants and utilized four LIWC-based\ncustomization dictionaries based on Haidt \u2019s moral foundation\nmodel (Graham et al., 2009 ), and four customized dictionaries\nbased on Schwartz \u2019s basic human values model (Jones et al.,\n2018 ). The results revealed that Trump supporters scored sig-\nni\ufb01cantly higher on measures of authenticity, collectivist pro-\nnouns, and basic human conservative values. They also scored\nsigni\ufb01cantly lower on moral foundation liberal values than\nClinton supporters. Interestingly, the two groups did not show\nsigni\ufb01cant differences in their use of positive emotion words, but\nClinton supporters used signi \ufb01cantly higher levels of negative\nemotion words than Trump supporters did.\nIn the 2020 presidential election, K\u00f6rner et al. ( 2022 ) explored\nthe linguistic differences between Donald Trump and Joe Biden\nusing 500 speeches and 15,000 tweets from the U.S. presidential\nelection. They focused on their distinct forms of power and\nanalyzed data from speech and tweets using the LIWC categories.\nThey found that Biden \u2019s linguistic style was analytical, whereas\nTrump \u2019s had a positive emotional tone. Moreover, they indicated\nthat Biden \u2019s tweets contained more social- and virtue-related\nwords.\nIn addition, several scholars conducted a series of sentimental\nanalyses in the political \ufb01eld. For instance, Rodriguez ( 2020a )\napplied the moral politics theory proposed by Lakoff ( 2010 )t o\nanalyze the retrospectives of Republican and Democratic pre-\nsidential candidates \u2019campaigns between 2000 and 2016. K\u00fclz\net al. ( 2023 ) analyzed the evolution of the linguistic tone of the\nU.S. politicians reported in online media between 2008 and 2020.\nSterling et al. ( 2020 ) investigated the spontaneous, naturally\noccurring use of language to observe signi \ufb01cant differences in the\nlinguistic styles of liberals and conservatives. Lee et al. ( 2023 )\naimed to investigate the presence of media bias in nonpoliticalarticles. To this end, the researcher examined articles from the\ntwo most biased news outlets. Through a human evaluation\nprocess, scholars measured and compared the differences between\ntwo groups of articles.\nRelated to RQ2, several prior studies attempted to classify\nwhether speci \ufb01c news outlets and articles have political orienta-\ntions. Park et al. ( 2011 ) identi \ufb01ed the commentator \u2019s pattern and\npredicted the political orientation of the news articles. Over the\ncourse of one year, they collected 4780 news articles from Naver \u2019s\npolitical news section. Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document\nFrequency (TF-IDF) representation and a Support Vector\nMachine (SVM) classi \ufb01er, they built a classi \ufb01\ncation model that\nachieved 80% accuracy. Moreover, (Devatine et al., 2022 ) con-\nducted a similar approach using 27,146 news articles, and\nemployed deep-learning models such as Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) to predict political orientation. Conover et al.\n(2011 ) attempted to predict the political orientation of Twitter\nusers based on their political communication content and struc-\nture, speci \ufb01cally before the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. They\nused annotated data from 1000 users based on their political\norientation, and trained an SVM model using hashtag metadata.\nAdditionally, they applied latent semantic analysis to the content\nof user tweets, achieving an accuracy of 95%.\nSeveral scholars also attempted to address tasks related to\npolitical orientation by considering the stance of governments\n(Alturayeif et al., 2023 ; Biesbroek et al., 2020 ). However, only a\nfew studies speci \ufb01cally examined of \ufb01cially introduced documents\nof governments to assess their political orientation. On the other\nhand, this study is distinct in that it analyzes hidden politicalbiases in of \ufb01cial U.S. government documents using a powerful\ntransformer-based deep-learning model. In particular, by\nattempting a novel analysis that connects news and government\ndocuments, it expands the boundaries between political linguis-tics and policy analysis. Therefore, in line with this gap in existing\nresearch, our aim was to \ufb01ll this gap by examining our RQs.\nMethodology\nData collection . We used the Selenium library in Python for data\ncollection and collected two types of data: articles produced by\nnews media and of \ufb01cial documents released by the U.S. govern-\nment. Before data collection, four criteria were established. First,\nwe collected data from February 24, 2022, to February 24, 2023,\nafter the Russia-Ukraine con \ufb02ict broke out. Second, we deter-\nmined the political orientation of news media based on infor-\nmation from the Pew Research Center1and Media Bias Fact\nCheck2. These organizations employ highly quali \ufb01ed journalists\nwho follow carefully designed guidelines to make informed\njudgments (Baly et al., 2020 ). Third, we collected of \ufb01cial docu-\nments of the U.S. government from press releases on the of \ufb01cial\nwebsites of the White House and three administrative depart-\nments highly relevant to the Russia-Ukraine con \ufb02ict: the\nDepartment of State (State), the Department of Defense\n(Defense), and the Department of Treasury (Treasury).\nFinally, for data collection, we searched for the keywords\n\u201cUkraine, \u201d\u201cRussia, \u201d\u201cPutin, \u201dor \u201cZelensky. \u201dWe speci \ufb01cally\nfocused on gathering information related to the Russia-Ukraine\nwar, such as real-time updates on the war situation, the United\nStates \u2019economic sanctions against Russia, or U.S. economic\nsupport for Ukraine. Only content directly associated with the\nspeci\ufb01ed keywords was included, while data unrelated to the\nRussia-Ukraine war was excluded.\nLastly, we searched for the keywords \u201cUkraine, \u201d\u201cRussia, \u201d\n\u201cPutin, \u201dor\u201cZelensky \u201dand only selected data related to Russia-\nUkraine con \ufb02ict such as economic sanctions or U.S. economic aid\nto Ukraine, while data unrelated to the Russia-Ukraine con \ufb01ct\nwas excluded.\nUltimately, 8104 articles were collected from various media\noutlets. Among them, 4789 articles were collected from four\nconservative news sources and 3315 articles were collected from\nnine progressive news sources. To ensure a balance between\nideological perspectives, we applied random undersampling to the\nconservative news dataset, resulting in an equal number of articles\nfrom both the conservative and progressive sources. In addition,\nwe collected 291 of \ufb01cial documents from the U.S. government:\n119 from the White House, 67 from the Treasury, 65 from the\nDefense, and the remaining from the State. The detailed data\ndescriptions are presented in Table 1.\nPsycholinguistic analyses . In this study, we conducted a com-\nparative analysis to identify the characteristics of progressive and\nconservative articles through psycholinguistic analyses. To\naccomplish this, we utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word\nCount (LIWC) method. LIWC is a transparent analysis program\nthat categorizes words into psychologically meaningful categories\nincluding word count, summary language variables, linguistic\ndimensions, other grammar, and psychological processes\n(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010 ). With the help of LIWC,\nresearchers can count the number of sentiment words in a text,\naiding in determining the overall sentiment level of the text\n(Pennebaker et al., 2015 ).\nAdditionally, we created LIWC categories based on previous\nstudies that compared textual differences according to political\norientation. Using these categories as references, we conducted aHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y ARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |         (2025) 12:1169 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y 3\ncomparative analysis to discern the distinctions between\nprogressive and conservative articles in terms of sentiment.\nClassi \ufb01cation\nExperiment setting . In this study, we conducted experiments using\nGoogle Colab, which offers a cloud-based Jupyter notebook. This\nplatform provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, enabling the\nef\ufb01cient training and evaluation of machine learning models\n(Bisong and Bisong, 2019 ). The experiments used Python version\n3.10.12, and the PyTorch framework was employed to construct\nthe BERT model.\nPreprocessing . To apply articles to the model, we converted the\ntext into a numerical format. First, tokenization was applied to\nbreak down the text into individual words. We then removed stop\nwords to exclude common words that did not carry signi \ufb01cant\nmeaning. We then converted the text to lowercase to ensure\nuniformity in the data. Additionally, we used lemmatization to\ntransform words into their base or root forms, thereby reducing\nin\ufb02ections and variations. In the \ufb01nal stage, we addressed the\nchallenge of balancing the data classes. Class imbalance issues,\ncommon in various classi \ufb01cation tasks, often cause a signi \ufb01cant\nbias toward larger classes, leading classi \ufb01ers to frequently over-\nlook smaller classes (Ko et al., 2023 ). As our research dealt with\nimbalanced data classes, we executed a balancing task using a\nrandom sampling method to address this issue.\nClassi \ufb01er. Once the text was preprocessed, it was transformed into\na numerical format suitable for machine learning and deep-\nlearning models. In our study, we utilized two different archi-\ntectures: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). These\nmodels allowed us to analyze and predict the characteristics and\nsentiments of the articles effectively.\n\u25cfXGB is a widely used ensemble algorithm to achieve state-\nof-the-art results (Chen and Guestrin, 2016 ). Boosting is an\nensemble technique in which new models are added to\nadjust the errors generated by existing models (Ogunleye\nand Wang, 2019 ).\n\u25cfBERT is\ufb01rst introduced by Devlin et al. ( 2018 ). It uses a\nbidirectional transformer network for pre-training on a\nlarge corpus and \ufb01ne-tuning speci \ufb01c tasks. The bert-base-uncased, which is pre-trained BERT, is single layer feed-\nforward and the encoder is pre-trained with case-\ninsensitive English text (Kim and Johnson, 2022 ).\nThe XGB model-IDF transformation method was used as the\nrepresentation technique for the XGB model. On the other hand,\nfor the BERT model, we utilized BERT embeddings as the\nrepresentation.\nEvaluation metric . To assess the performance of each model, we\nconsidered four vital performance metrics: accuracy, precision,\nrecall, F-score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics are calculated\nbased on a confusion matrix, which is a table that compares\npredicted and actual values (Hossin and Sulaiman, 2015 ).\nTopic modeling . Topic modeling is a powerful tool capable of\nreading and understanding texts (Kherwa and Bansal, 2020 ). It is\nwidely used as a statistical technique for extracting latent vari-\nables from large datasets (Agrawal et al., 2018 ). By analyzing\nword co-occurrence patterns within a collection of documents,\ntopic modeling can uncover hidden topics (Wang et al., 2017 ). In\nthis study, a pretrained BERTopic model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) was\nemployed, which is a neural topic modeling technique designed to\nextract coherent topics from text data. It utilizes pretrained\ntransformer models to generate document embeddings that\ncapture semantic nuances. These embeddings are then clustered,\nand a class-based TF-IDF is applied to generate topic repre-\nsentations (Grootendorst, 2022 ).\nExperiment\nComparing two groups of media articles . The relationship\nbetween language and politics is reciprocal because it is closely\ninterconnected (Chen and Madiyeva, 2022 ). Consequently, lin-\nguistic characteristics often re \ufb02ect political orientations (Geis,\n2012 ). Previous research extensively explored the connection\nbetween political orientations and linguistic features. Summariz-\ning these studies, conservatives tend to employ linguistic features\nsuch as family-related language (Preo \u0163iuc-Pietro et al., 2017 ;\nRodriguez, 2020b ), positive emotion words (Preo \u0163iuc-Pietro et al.,\n2017 ; Slatcher et al., 2007 ) and a focus on the past (Robinson\net al., 2015 ; Rodriguez, 2020b ). Conversely, progressives are more\ninclined to use language related to anxiety (Preo \u0163iuc-Pietro et al.,\n2017 ), affect (Rodriguez, 2020b ), negative emotional wordsTable 1 Summary of the collected dataset.\nCategory Political orientation Data source Quantity URL\nArticles Conservative Fox 1891 https://www.foxnews.com/\nWall Street Journal 1202 https://www.wsj.com/\nForbes 1061 https://www.forbes.com/\nBreitbart 95 https://www.breitbart.com/\nProgressive New York Times 854 https://www.nytimes.com/\nPolitico 678 https://www.politico.com/\nPBS 493 https://www.pbs.com/\nThe Guardian 463 https://www.theguardian.com/\nCNN 311 https://www.edition.cnn.com/\nMSNBC 298 https://www.msnbc.com/\nNPR 239 https://www.npr.com/\nThe Washington Post 163 https://www.washingtonpost.com/\nVox 73 https://www.vox.com/\nTotal 8104\nOf\ufb01cial documents \u2013 White House 119 https://www.whitehouse.gov/\nDepartment of Treasury 67 https://www.home.treasury.gov/\nDepartment of Defence 65 https://www.defence.gov/\nDepartment of State 40 https://www.state.gov/\nTotal 291ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y\n4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |         (2025) 12:1169 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y\n(Slatcher et al., 2007 ), and focus on the future (Robinson et al.,\n2015 ; Rodriguez, 2020b ). Building on insights from these previous\nstudies, the researchers constructed LIWC categories. Figure 1\npresents the categories and comparison results based on these\nlinguistic features and their associations with political\norientations.\nIn the conservative group, the results showed the following\naverages and standard deviations for the LIWC categories: family\n(M=0.15, SD =0.40), positive emotion ( M=1.79, SD =1.04),\npast focus ( M=3.59, SD =1.68), anxiety ( M=0.32, SD =0.36),\naffect ( M=4.42, SD =1.71), negative emotion ( M=2.58,\nSD=1.38), and future focus ( M=0.91, SD =0.70).\nFor the progressive group, the results were as follows: family\n(M=0.13, SD =0.41), positive emotions ( M=1.76, SD =1.10),\npast focus (M =3.93, SD =1.97), anxiety ( M=0.38, SD =0.43),\naffect ( M=4.70, SD =1.68), negative emotions ( M=2.89,\nSD=1.41), and future focus ( M=0.93, SD =0.76). In compar-\nison to the \ufb01ndings of previous studies, this study found similar\nrelationships with previous \ufb01ndings. Speci \ufb01cally, conservative\nindividuals showed higher average values than progressives in the\ncategories of family and positive emotions, consistent with earlierresearch. On the other hand, progressives exhibited higher values\nfor anxiety, affect, negative emotions, and future focus, consistent\nwith the results of previous studies. However, one notable\ndifference was observed in past focus, where progressives\ndemonstrated higher values than conservative individuals, differ-\ning from previous \ufb01ndings.To conduct a more rigorous veri \ufb01cation of the statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant differences, we performed a t-test comparison, and the\nresults are presented in Table 2. The analysis con \ufb01rms that\nconservative media use more family-related expressions, while\nprogressive media employ signi \ufb01cantly more emotional expres-\nsions, anxiety-related terms, and negative expressions. However,\nunlike previous studies, our \ufb01ndings indicate that progressive\nmedia use past-focused expressions more frequently, whereas no\nsigni\ufb01cant differences were observed in positive emotion and\nfuture-oriented expressions.\nConstruction of classi \ufb01cation model with media text . In this\nsection, we describe the construction of the classi \ufb01cation model\nand assess its performance. The dataset was divided into an 8:2\nratio for training and evaluation. The evaluation results are listed\nin Table 3and Fig. 2. Based on the model evaluation, the BERT\nmodel outperformed the XGB model in almost all performance\nmetrics. Thus, our results indicate that the BERT model is most\nsuitable for this task.\nGovernment text classi \ufb01cation . Before performing classi \ufb01cation\nwith the models, we attempted to cluster vectorized documents\nusing the K-means algorithm (Lloyd, 1982 ).K-means is a clus-\ntering algorithm widely used in data science, aiming to identify\ncluster structures characterized by high similarity within the same\ncluster and signi \ufb01cant dissimilarity between different clusters\nFig. 1 Comparison of seven LIWC categories between conservative and progressive media. The bar chart shows the mean values for seven LIWC\ncategories (Family, Positive Emotion, Past Orientation, Anxiety, Affect, Negative Emotion, and Future Orientation) in conservative outlets (blu e bars)\nversus progressive outlets (red bars).\nTable 2 T-test results comparing conservative and progressive media.\nValue Family Positive Emotion Past Focus Anxiety Affect Negative Emotion Future Focus\nT-value 2.4351 \u22121.2553 \u22128.4220 \u22127.7478 \u22127.5169 \u221210.1455 \u22121.3981\np value 0.0149 0.2094 <0.0001 <0.0001 0.0013 0.0037 0.1159\nTable 3 Results of model evaluation.\nModel Label Precision (%) Recall (%) F1-score (%) Accuracy (%)\nXGB Conservative 95.98 89.88 92.83 93.06\nProgressive 90.49 96.24 93.27\nBERT Conservative 93.06 97.03 95.00 94.88\nProgressive 96.87 92.71 94.74\nValues that are comparatively higher have been set in bold.HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y ARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |         (2025) 12:1169 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y 5\nwithin a dataset (Sinaga and Yang, 2020 ). The clustering results\nare shown in Fig. 3, where we observed a skewed distribution of\nthe data points. Subsequently, in Table 3, we con \ufb01rmed that the\nBERT model achieved the best performance among the models\nconsidered.\nBased on these results, we conducted a classi \ufb01cation using the\nBERT model. The classi \ufb01cation revealed a biased outcome, with\n64 classi \ufb01ed as conservative (21.99%) and 227 as progressive(78%), which is consistent with the clustering results. Upon\ndetailed scrutiny, all institutions exhibited a bias toward the\nprogressive side, with White House showing the most progressive\noutcome at 88.23%. The classi \ufb01cation results are listed in Table 4.\nSimilar to the clustering results, the classi \ufb01cation results display a\nskewed distribution.

In this section, we compare\nthe similarities between government documents and texts pro-\nduced by progressive and conservative media through topic\nmodeling. This allowed us to verify whether the results aligned\nwith those of the classi \ufb01cation model.\nTo measure similarity, we used the Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence (JSD), which quanti \ufb01es the similarity between\ntwo probability distribution s. JSD is widely used to compare\nword distributions across different corpora or documents,\nhelping analyze differences in themes and writing styles\n(Lin, 1991 ).\nThe experimental results (Table 5) show that the average JSD\ndistance over \ufb01ve trials between government documents and\nprogressive media was 0.6787, whereas the distance from\nconservative media was 0.6602. Statistical validation further\ncon\ufb01rms that Of \ufb01cial Documents exhibit a textual distribution\nthat is more similar to that of conservative media.\nVeri\ufb01cation of inherent intention in government text . This study\naims to analyze the key opinions and core topics present in\nof\ufb01cial documents issued by the U.S. government. To this end, we\n\ufb01rst examined the classi \ufb01cation of documents and similarities in\ntopic distributions; however, no distinct political inclinations\nwere identi \ufb01ed.\nAccordingly, we employed BERTopic to extract the predomi-\nnant topics in the government documents and identify the most\nsalient terms within each topic. Our analysis revealed that out of a\ntotal of 291 documents, 279 were classi \ufb01ed into speci \ufb01c topics,\nwith key terms such as \u201cRussian, \u201d\u201cstate, \u201d\u201cUnited, \u201d\u201cRussia, \u201d\n\u201ccompany, \u201d\u201ctoday, \u201d\u201cpresident, \u201d\u201calso, \u201d\u201cdesignated, \u201dand\n\u201csanction \u201demerging as the most signi \ufb01cant. These \ufb01ndings\nsuggest that U.S. government documents predominantly address\nissues related to international relations, economic sanctions,\ngovernment policies, and administrative measures. Notably, the\nfrequent recurrence of terms like \u201cRussian \u201dand \u201cRussia \u201dindicates\na strong connection to geopolitical developments, while the\nprominence of words such as \u201csanction \u201dand \u201cdesignated \u201d\nunderscores the substantial emphasis placed on discussions\nregarding economic and political measures.\nThrough this analysis, we systematically identi \ufb01ed recurring\nconcepts and their interrelations within U.S. government\ndocuments. This study provides valuable insights that may\nfacilitate a more effective exploration of key issues in of \ufb01cial\ngovernment discourse and contribute to informed decision\nmaking in policy formulation.Conclusions\nIn this study, our main objective was to assess the political\norientation of news media concerning the Russia-Ukraine con-\n\ufb02ict. To achieve this, we collected news articles related to the\nRussia-Ukraine war through media outlets representing con-\nservative and progressive perspectives in the United States, and\nselected and compared LIWC categories, taking into account the\nlinguistic features previously observed in conservative and pro-\ngressive contexts based on earlier research. The comparativeresults con \ufb01rmed that news media articles produced based on the\nRussia-Ukraine con \ufb02ict incorporated their unique political\norientations and addressed RQ1 in this study.\nFollowing a comparative analysis of articles from both per-\nspectives, we trained the ML/DL models on a politically labeled\ndataset. The BERT model outperformed the conventional ML\napproaches (94.88% accuracy). Subsequent BERTopic analysis\nand JSD-based similarity measurement between the classi \ufb01cation\nand topic models produced incongruent results. Examination of\nthe dominant topics uncovered intentional framing around eco-\nnomic/political sanctions, offering partial but substantive insights\nfor addressing RQ2.\nGovernments communicate their decisions and intentions both\ndomestically and internationally through formalized documents.\nAs texts are typically coherent and consistent to ful \ufb01ll the pro-\nducer \u2019s intentions (De Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981 ), in this\nexperiment, we utilized the constructed model to examine the\nU.S. government \u2019s intentions concerning the Russia-Ukraine\ncon\ufb02ict. The analysis suggests that the nature of the U.S. gov-\nernment \u2019so f\ufb01cial documents regarding the Russia-Ukraine war is\na result of strategic framing aimed at fostering international\nsolidarity and garnering domestic and global support. This\nunderscores the need for further in-depth research on how gov-\nernment discourse in \ufb02uences the formation of public opinion.\nThis approach provided valuable information about the govern-\nment \u2019s stance and policies regarding the Russia-Ukraine con \ufb02ict.\nAlthough this study makes signi \ufb01cant academic contributions,\nit has several limitations. First, news media coverage of the\nRussia-Ukraine con \ufb02ict may include fact-based informational\ncontent, without explicit political nuances. The analysis of poli-\ntical orientation in neutral articles faces methodological\nconstraints.\nSecond, the constructed dataset has methodological limitations,\nas it merely categorizes content into progressive or conservative\nclassi \ufb01cations, without re \ufb02ecting gradations in political learning.\nWhen texts exhibit similar probability scores for both con-\nservative and progressive orientations, the model \u2019s forced binary\nclassi \ufb01cation may overlook nuanced complexities and subtle\nvariations in political stance.Table 4 Classi \ufb01cation result of governments \u2019of\ufb01cial documents.\nLabel White House Treasury Defense State Total\nConservative 14 (11.76%) 23 (34.32%) 20 (30.76%) 7 (17.50%) 64 (21.99%)\nProgressive 105 (88.23%) 44 (65.67%) 45 (69.23%) 33 (82.50%) 227 (78.00%)\nThe overall \u201cTotal \u201dresults are highlighted in bold.\nTable 5 Comparison of JSD Values with Mean and t-test.\nJSD with Of \ufb01cial Documents 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Mean Tvalue Pvalue\nProgressive .6777 .6796 .6795 .6756 .6809 .6787 2.7986 0.0468\nConservative .6593 .6653 .6782 .6603 .6377 .6602\nBoldface is used to denote the lower JSD values.HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y ARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |         (2025) 12:1169 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05535-y 7\nTherefore, future research should develop a multidimensional\nanalytical framework capable of quantifying bias intensity in\ntexts. Such an approach would enable a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of media representation patterns and the under-lying political implications in the coverage of the Russia-Ukraine\ncon\ufb02ict.\nEthical and Societal Considerations\nThis study acknowledges potential ethical concerns in categoriz-\ning of \ufb01cial government documents as conservative or progressive.\nWhile political orientation analysis is useful for understanding the\nideological elements embedded in texts, excessive simpli \ufb01cation\nor misuse may exacerbate political polarization. Therefore, the\ufb01ndings of this study should be interpreted responsibly with\ncaution against their misuse as tools for deepening political\ndivisions.\nData availability\nAll datasets in this study are available at https://github.com/\ndxlabskku/Russia-Ukraine-con \ufb02ict.\nReceived: 13 December 2024; Accepted: 9 July 2025;\nNotes\n1https://www.pewresearch.org/\n2https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\nReferences\nAbe JAA (2018) Personality and political preferences: the 2016 us presidential\nelection.

Den valgte case \ner den kontroversielle hollandske julekarakter, \u2018Zwarte Piet\u2019 eller p\u00e5 engelsk, \u2018Black Pete\u2019, og \nskildringen af denne. Skildringen har i en \u00e5rr\u00e6kke, p\u00e5 grund af sin tilsyneladende \ndiskriminerende aspekter, ledt til en heftig debat p\u00e5 tv\u00e6rs af forskellige medier rundt om i \nverden.  \nUd fra et teoretisk grundlag baseret p\u00e5 Norman Faircloughs teori, foretages en komparativ \nanalyse af fire udvalgte artikler, der d\u00e6kker emnet; to fra USA og to fra Storbritannien.

The war in Syria and the following migration has led to a \nwidening of the political divide across Europe and i n the United States. Parties that were once \nconfined to the fringes of the political spectrum have gained increased popularity, on the left \nwing as well as the right. This, in turn, has led to an increasingly polarised debate on any \nmatter that can, even i n the slightest, be considered political. The rhetorics and discourse \npractices used in such debates bear the marks of this, we believe.  \nThis project investigates discourse within English speaking media. Our chosen subject is this \nmedia\u2019s coverage of the D utch Christmas tradition, and its controv ersial depiction of the \nfigure,  Zwarte Piet, or Black Pete. This case is an interesting one, because it has garnered a \ngreat deal of attention from American and British media, even though the tradition in \nquestion predominantly concerns people in the Netherlands. As such, english speaking media \ncovering this phenomenon will invariably take the role of the outsider looking in, which, we \nbelieve, will hold interesting implications for the practiced discourse.  \nIt seems  to us that the rhetorics used in reporting and debating the tradition has varied \ndepending on the media. This is a main point of interest for us, and as such, we would like to \nexamine how these different ways of reporting on Black Pete are related to diff erent \ndiscourses on concepts like racism, political correctness and ideology in, respectively, the \nUnited States and Great Britain. We have selected two articles from each nation, one from the \nWashington Post, one from the New York Times, one from the UK b ranch of the Huffington \nPost and one from the Daily Star. These articles have been selected on a criterion we set for \nourselves to include two from each nation, but also as far as possible, two from each side of \nthe political spectrum. The particulars of e ach article will be further laid out in the Data -\nchapter.  \nThe aim of our analysis is to uncover the underlying ideologies that form the basis of the \ndifferent discourses, which will lead to a discussion of how these discourses contribute to new \nand existin g discourses. We are interested in examining possible differences  between \nAmerican and British news coverage in a comparative analysis, and thereby, the discourse of \neach article in relation to racism, among other themes. How do the different articles cov er the \nPage 5 of  56 \n tradition in terms of discourse? Are there differences in portrayal between the individual \ncountries, or internally? Do they condemn the foreign tradition, or tolerate it?  \n \n1.1 Problem statement  \nThese considerations have led us to the following prob lem statement:  \n \nHow does the selected articles\u2019 coverage of the Black Pete tradition exemplify discourses on \ndiscrimination? And what, if any, are the differences between these discourses?  \n \nThe first question will serve as a guiding point for our project a s a whole, since it encapsulates \nour main point of interest, i.e. that which first caught our attention when we looked into the \nsubject. Moreover, it will naturally be the question of focus for the analysis, especially. By the \nphrasing \u2018discourses on discr imination\u2019, we mean the sort of discourse practised when writing \nabout discrimination as a subject, or theme, as opposed to a discriminating discourse. The \nterm, \u2018discrimination\u2019, is chosen in favour of \u2018racism\u2019 due to its, by comparison, mitigating \nnature . While the phrasing could suggest that there are specific, fixed characteristics \nattributed to any discourse on the subject, this is not our intention. Rather, we simply wish to \nexamine what these particular discourses look like. The second question is ai med at a \ndiscussion of the results of the analysis. Again, a mitigation is present, in the wording \u2018if any\u2019, \nsince we admit to the possibility of the discourses being overall similar. The two questions \ncombined represent both our interest in the subject, a s well as our focal points.  \n \nIn order to answer the above questions we will be using the book Critical Discourse Analysis \n(2010)  by Norman Fairclough, to establish our theoretical foundation, and Lesley Jeffries\u2019 \nCritical Stylistics  (2010) to provide the n ecessary tools for analysis. In order to perform a \nthorough analysis comparing different news\u2019 outlets separated by different political views as \nwell as nationality, it is important to first establish the political points of view of the individual \nnewspape rs or outlets. This will be done in the Data -chapter, where a short introduction to \neach newspaper and article will be provided.  \n \nPage 6 of  56 \n As mentioned above, the reason we chose this subject for our project is on account of its \ncontroversial nature and the debates  this has generated, both in the Netherlands, but also \nespecially in English -speaking countries. Additionally, we hypothesised that there might be a \nconsiderable difference between how these two countries with their vastly different histories, \nespecially i n regard to subjects such as slavery and segregation, would react to Black Pete \nbeing an ongoing tradition in the year of 2015 and 2016. As such, whether the historical \ndifferences between the two nations is apparent in their discourse or not, might be an \ninteresting point for discussion later.  \n \n1.2 The Tradition of Black Pete  \n\u2018Black Pete\u2019, or \u2018Zwarte Piet\u2019, is a part of the Dutch Christmas tradition and is said to partially \nstem from the Dutch colonial - and slave period. First of all, it is important to no te that the \nbasic concept of Santa Claus and Christmas is different in the Netherlands than for example in \nDenmark. The Danish tradition holds that Santa Claus arrives from Greenland in a sled with all \nhis reindeer the 24th of December and hands out presen ts, whereas the Dutch Santa Claus, \nSinterklaas, arrives in the beginning of December on a ship from Spain with all his helpers, the \nBlack Petes (Tavares).  \nThe Black Pete character is usually played by a person who paints their face black, lips red \nand dons  a curly, black wig and big earrings. The figure\u2019s colourful attire is reminiscent to that \nof a 16th century page (Tavares).  \nThe role and concept of Black Pete has changed over time, where at one time it was only a \nsingle character who tended to Sinterklaa s, it is now a whole host of characters, each with \ntheir own characteristics (Tavares). Originally, the role of Black Pete was only to help \nSinterklaas know which children were good and which were bad and also to deal out \npunishment for bad behavior. In to day\u2019s tradition, however, he is a more comical character. \nHe still helps Sinterklaas hand out presents and holds his cane, but he also performs tricks \nand generally acts in a whimsical manner (Tavares).  \nIt is usually a big event in the Netherlands where ea ch city has a parade on the 5th of \nDecember to symbolize the arrival of Sinterklaas and the Black Petes. Here actors walk in \nprocession dressed as Black Pete, while jumping around a single white and elder actor, who \nPage 7 of  56 \n plays Sinterklaas. Furthermore the tradi tion entails that if children around the Netherlands \nput their shoes in front of their fireplaces, the Black Petes will jump down through the \nchimney and leave presents (Tavares). Overall, Black Pete is seen as a comical, kind and \nsomewhat foolish helper t o Sinterklaas, a view that lends itself to the discrepancy between \nmodern, liberal Dutch society and the discriminatory undertones of the tradition. When \nviewed as an innocent children\u2019s character, any allegations of racism against the tradition are \ntreate d as hysterical and over the top.  \nThe idea of Saint Nicholas having a black helper goes back, at least, to the middle of the 19th \ncentury where the writer Jan Schenkman wrote a children\u2019s book called \u2018Saint Nicholas and \nHis Servant\u2019 (Tavares). Before this,  different versions of the Saint\u2019s stories, across Europe, \nsometimes included him having a servant, some of these depicting Saint Nicholas as travelling \naround with a devil on a leash. In any case, Schenkman\u2019s story is the first one known where \nthe helper is a black man, although the idea is thought to stem from earlier in the 19th \ncentury. Following this book\u2019s popularity, other writers of Sinterklaas stories took up the \ncustom and as such, the name \u2018Zwarte Piet\u2019 is seen for the first time in a children\u2019s book in \n1891 (Tavares).  \nGiven the time in which the idea of a black helper arose, it is unlikely that this idea can be \nconsidered entirely separated from the prejudices that pervaded the European mentality in \ncolonial times. Slavery in the Netherlands and its colonies was abolished in 1863, although the \nslave trade industry had been stopped by international agreement in 1814. Even though the \ntradition arose when slavery was declining, it can hardly be denied that it harkens back to a \ntime when the ridicule and enslavement of African people was entirely legitimate. Opposers of \nthe tradition, nowadays, point to the Netherlands\u2019 history with slavery in their critique. One of \nseveral points being that Black Pete is portrayed as a fool, founded on the old Europea n idea \nof the indigenous African people as intrinsically less cultured and enlightened than Europeans \n(Tavares). The dressing up of the \u2018savage\u2019 black man in civilised garb is, besides being comical \nto Europeans in the 1800s, related to said idea. The main  point of this line of argumentation is \nof course the simple fact that the foolish and silly black Zwarte Piet is the servant of the calm, \nwise and white Sinterklaas.  \nModern adherents of the tradition oppose these sentiments and dismiss them , stating that  \nwhile the tradition was racist in origin, it is now an innocent tradition for the sake of the \nchildren, pointing to the joyous and giving nature of Black Pete. In the 21st century there has \nPage 8 of  56 \n been some outphasing of the character in schools as well as demon strations against it. A \nsurvey conducted in the Netherlands and Belgium in 2013 indicates a strong opposition to \nchanging the appearance of Zwarte Piet (Telegraaf).  \n \n1.3 Data  \nThe following is a presentation of the articles selected for analysis. It will in clude a short \npresentation of each article, followed by a small section on the publishing paper of each \narticle. This includes  details on public opinion and political placement of the paper. These \nopinions have been deduced from surveys from the newspaper  survey website, \nmediabiasfactcheck.com (MBFC) as well as other relevant websites.  \n \nArticle 1, Huffington Post:  \n\u2018Tis the Season to Don Blackface: How My Friends Celebrate Christmas - Published December \n10, 2016.  \nIn this article, Fisayo Fadahunsi relays how  a friend\u2019s recent experience has caused her to \ncontemplate her own experiences with racism, thinking back to when she was living in the \nNetherlands and how she experienced the tradition of Sinterklaas and his helpers Zwarte \nPieten. She describes how she a ccepted the cultural differences between Britain and the \nNetherlands with no problem except for this tradition which she is still, years later, bothered \nby. \nThe tradition of Zwarte Piet is briefly described and the arguments for the tradition are \npresented . The writer, however, still struggles to accept that people she cares for, in the \nNetherlands, would support such a tradition. She describes how she often argues with her \nDutch friends about the tradition, which made her question what really constitutes r acism, is \nit the intention or the act? She finally arrives at the conclusion that neither her friend\u2019s \ncolleague nor the supporters of Zwarte Piet are excusable in their racism. (Fadahunsi, 2015).  \nThe Huffington Post : \nThe Huffington Post is an American onl ine news aggregator and blog, with affiliates in many \nother parts of the world such as The United Kingdom, which typically has left -wing bias \nPage 9 of  56 \n through their story selection as well as their word choices.  According to MBFC their writing is \nnot evidence base d regarding certain scientific issues, however it is generally well sourced \noverall. (MBFC4).  \nArticle 2, The Daily Star  \nIs THIS the weirdest Christmas tradition ever? Festival -goers black up for \u2018racist\u2019 parade - \nPublished December 5, 2016.  \nThe article is written by Jess Bell and briefly explains who Black Pete is and his role during the \nAnnual Feast of St Nicholas and also explains that a lot of people demonstrate against the \ntradition. It goes on to describe how an organiser in the UK has left out the Bla ck Pete \ncharacter because she did not have a black person to fill the role and she felt that blackface \nwas racist. However, according to the article, polls state that most Dutch people support \nkeeping blackface, even so most organizers planned to use soot rather than make -up. (Bell, \n2016).  \nThe Daily Star : \nThe Daily Star is a UK based tabloid style newspaper. Though the Daily Star has limited \narticles regarding politics, as it focuses more on sensational press, it is still considered a right -\nwing, pro -conser vative daily tabloid newspaper. (Thepaperboy). This source publishes some \nlegitimate news, but also conspiracies and pseudoscience articles (MBFC3).  \nArticle 3, New York Times  \nU.N. Urges the Netherlands to Stop Portrayals of \u2018Black Pete\u2019 Character - Publish ed August 28, \n2015.  \nThe article, written by Somini Sengupta,  is about how a U.N. committee is asking the Dutch \ngovernment to get rid of Black Pete. It starts off with a quick summary of what could arguably \nbe wrong with the tradition. After this, the arti cle quotes the reason for U.N.\u2019s request and \nfollows with the Dutch government\u2019s response of how they are open to a discussion of the \ntradition. The article mentions several more aspects of the tradition which might arguably be \nracially insensitive. The ar ticle then quickly refers to the Dutch government\u2019s response once \nmore, but also how the debate on social media has been \u2018unruly\u2019. The article ends with \nmentioning how a specific Dutch department store is making strides in how to celebrate the \ntradition in  a more racially sensitive way. (Sengupta, 2015).  \nPage 10 of  56 \n  \nNew York Times : \nThe New York Times newspaper was founded in September 1851. The newspaper has won \n117 pulitzer prizes, which is more than any other news organisation in America. The paper is \nviewed as havi ng a fairly strong left -wing editorial bias, but it is still considered one of the \nmost reliable sources of information (MBFC2).  \n \nArticle 4, The Washington Post  \nThe Dutch are slowly recognizing that their blackface tradition of Zwarte Piet is racist and \nweird - Published October 2, 2016.  \nThe article, written by Ishaan Tharoor, briefly explains what Black Pete is and how some \npeople protest it because they see it as racist and harking back to the days of colonialism and \ntrading on \u201cgarish racial stereotypes\u201d , while others defend the tradition by saying it predates \nthe times of colonialism and is simply an innocent children\u2019s pastime. It also talks about how \nthe opposition to Black Pete has protested the tradition in recent years.  \nWays to appease both sides ha ve, according to the article, been attempted by removing the, to \nsome, offensive physical markings such as blackface. Furthermore, the law is involved on both \nsides of this debate; on the pro side there are talks of creating a law to protect the image and \ntradition of Black Pete. On the other side, protesting the tradition in its current state, there is \ntalk of the Netherlands risking \u201c(...) contravening conventions on children's rights to equal \ntreatment and protection from discrimination.\u201d (Tharoor, 2016) . \nThe Washington Post : \nThe Washington Post is one of the major newspapers in America and is generally considered \nvery credible in its reporting. According to Yale professor Allan Gerber the post leans to the \nleft. (Riddell, 2015). Supporting this statement  is the fact that The Washington Post has \nsupported Barack Obama and endorsed Hillary Clinton. According to MBFC : \u201cThe Washington \nPost has a liberal bias in reporting choices, however they are typically well sourced to credible \ninformation.\u201d (MBFC1).  \n \nPage 11 of  56 \n 2.0 Theory and Method  \nThis chapter will cover two different aspects of the project. The first part will present our \ndefinition of some of the concepts related to critical discourse analysis, based on the book \nCritical Discourse Analysis by Norman Fairclough. T he reason for this is that some of the \nconcepts we are working with are very fluid and can be interpreted in a number of different \nways and as such, we felt it necessary to make it clear how we are going to use them. The \nsecond part of this chapter will be  a summarisation of selected tools defined in the book \nCritical Stylistics  by Lesley Jeffries which will help us perform a critical discourse analysis. It is \nimportant to note that we are not going to have a complete summary of all the terms \npresented in t he book since it would not be possible to cover all of them in this project and it \nwill therefore only consist of the terms that we have deemed crucial in order to perform this \nanalysis.  \n \n2.1 Theoretical basis of  the project  \nIn this chapter, we will define the  important concepts of the theoretical foundation of our \nproject and give a guiding description of the theory and account for the object of investigation, \ni.e. discourse.  \nCritical Discourse Analysis  (CDA) examines how social situations are affected by a sh ared \nbackground knowledge among agents, meaning interlocutors or writers. This is typically so \npowerfully implemented in daily speech that it is somehow natural and thereby invisible or \nunquestionable to the agents themselves who are in turn influenced by them (Fairclough, \n2010: 26). This is related to power -relations and hegemony which will be defined below. This \napproach entails the view that there is a dialectical relationship of discourse, between \nstructure and action. Structure is the shared background  knowledge, and action is the \nspeaking or writing behavior of the agents involved, whereas it is given that language is a \nform of social action. (Fairclough, 2010: 27).  \nBackground Knowledge  (BGK) is described as the beliefs, values, ideologies and facts kn own \nby the agents in a given social speaking or writing situation (Fairclough, 2010: 46). It could be, \nfor instance, politeness conventions.  \nPage 12 of  56 \n Various theorists describe Ideology  as a system of underlying language practice - a \u201ccode\u201d, \n\u201cstructure\u201d, \u201csystem\u201d o r \u201cformation\u201d(Fairclough, 2010: 57). There are certain ideologies \nconnected to special events, entities and institutions beforehand. Furthermore, several \ndifferent ideologies exist at the same time - and these ideologies are structured in power \nrelations o r hegemony. Hegemony  means that some ideologies are more valued than others \nand the most valued is the norm. (Fairclough, 2010: 58). The hegemonic discourse is the one \nthat is seen as \u201cthe correct one\u201d, and what the correct one is depends on the agents\u2019 \nideological position.  \nDiscourse is shaped by the structures of ideology and is at the same time shaping, reshaping, \nreproducing and transforming them (Fairclough, 2010: 59). One could say that discourse is \nthe practice of ideology, the meaning or the content  in a speaking or writing situation \n(Fairclough, 2010: 60). In addition, this will be structured in a certain way to make mutual \nsense to the agents.  \nNaturalisation  is a way through which norms are sustaining and maintaining themselves. \nWhen speaking of na turalisation, it is the BGK that is naturalised to become invisible to the \nspeakers. Norms of social situations are so strongly implemented that interlocutors take them \nfor granted or even as natural and not only as \u201ccommon -sense\u201d (Fairclough, 2010: 34).  \nOn the basis of Gramsci\u2019s study (1971: 328 in Fairclough, 2010: 62), Fairclough argues that \nthe hierarchy of ideologies is also naturalised. However, he does not clarify whether it is \nfavourable or unfavourable. Moreover this must depend on who you ask, sin ce ideology is \nconnected to interests or intentions, as will be described later. Hegemony constitutes social \nrelations through discourse, however, it is important to note that hegemonies and ideologies \ncan change over time, for instance through social stru ggles (Fairclough, 2010: 64).  \nMediation  is a term Fairclough uses in the understanding \u201cmovement of meaning\u201d as \nsuggested by Silverstone (1999: 13 in Fairclough, 2010: 72); meaning can move from one text \nor context to another. Also, one text, discourse or event is always linked to other texts, \ndiscourses and events, i.e. intertextuality, and is in the same way affecting others, new as well \nas old, in which we as people make sense of how the world is linked together. At another \ntaxonomical level, this is als o affected by meta -texts, -events and -discourses. Fairclough adds \nthat mediation is also both concrete, general and abstract and exists in all kinds of different \nPage 13 of  56 \n media. Fairclough also points out that it is important to note that mediation contains both \ncontinuity as well as changes. Components of meaning are maintained from one text to \nanother; other components change. He suggests an addition to the definition of mediation \nwhich is \u201cmovement of resources for meaning -making\u201d (Fairclough, 2010: 73).  \nAfter t his short introduction of the main terms in CDA, we will explain the advantage of using \nCDA as method and theoretical basis.  \nA primary issue of CDA is the fact that both ideology and hegemony as phenomena are \nnaturalised because they become invisible, and therefore people tend to ignore critical \nthinking towards them. The theory is a helpful tool in overcoming this. Here the modifier \n\u201ccritical\u201d in the term critical discourse analysis plays an important part. That is because \ncritique: \u201c (\u2026) grasps things \u2026 e ssentially in their interconnection, in their concatenation, \ntheir motion, their coming into and passing out of existence (...)\u201d (Engels, 1976: 27 in \nFairclough, 2010: 38), and makes this interconnectedness of cause and effect, visible. \n(Fairclough, 2010: 39).  \nWhen being critical in this respect, it is necessary to understand that firstly, social action in \nspeaking or writing situations is a product of BGK, but also secondly, that the these structures \nare also a product of action, which is exactly how norms  are reproducing themselves. \nTherefore there is this duality of structure (Giddens, 1981). (Fairclough, 2010: 38).  \nOne could say that the macro structures (society, history, power -relations and social \ninstitutions, etc.) affect the micro structures (the s pecific incident or happening) and, as \npointed out, again affects the macro structures. In the micro aspect of discourse, discourse is \nformed by an agent who, Fairclough decides, has full conscious control over their actions. \nThese actions are formed by th e intended goals of the speakers, their will or intention. \n(Fairclough, 2010: 47).  \nThe goal of Critical Discourse Analysis is therefore to examine how structures reproduce \nthemselves through discourse and is less concerned with the effects of this process \n(Fairclough, 2010: 45).  \nAn important concern of Fairclough\u2019s theory is, that agents are not equal from the start, as \nthey are in other studies. Rather, they are unequal and are, therefore, also reproducing power -\nrelations. In studying this, a critical view  is necessary in order not to take these differences in \nPage 14 of  56 \n status for granted. (Fairclough, 2010: 49 -50). This can be seen in connection to agents\u2019 \nintentions; that those who have power want to maintain their power, which is also a way for \npower to be reprodu ced (Fairclough, 2010: 49 -50). The object of CDA is social practice, \ndiscoursal practice (text production, distribution and consumption) and text. More concretely, \nit is a study of content and meaning, and form and style. (Fairclough, 2010: 59).  \nTo apply C DA it is important to note that social structures (BGK) contain possibilities of what \nis socially accepted in a social event - whereas the social event, the concrete incident, \nconstitutes what is actual. These are mediated by social practices, that is, ord ers of discourse \nwhich are affected by hegemony, which \u201c(...) control the selective actualisation of potentials.\u201d. \n(Fairclough, 2010: 74). Moreover, texts are affected by agents, and also, texts are contributing \nto meaning -making (Fairclough, 2010: 75).  \n \n2.2 Methodology - A set of tools  \nThe following is a list of linguistic features and tools that will function as a way of describing \nthe way \u2018texts\u2019 represent the world and its ideologies. We have selected nine tools which all \nprovide different ways of analy sing a text.  \n \n2.2.1 Naming and Describing  \nThis tool looks at how Naming and Describing  can create ideological meaning in text. Namely \nhow nouns or even verbs converted into nouns have certain ideological consequences when \nused in a text i.e \u201cmy sister\u201d ver sus \u201c my cold -hearted sister\u201d.  \nIn order to find these ideological meanings Jeffries divides the text according to the \ngrammatical structures of Noun - and Verb phrases and how these phrases represent different \nentities or processes.  \nEntities are the parts o f a sentence that function as either the Subject or Object of the \nPredicator and are further categorised by being either the initiator of the action, called the \n\u2018actor\u2019, or the recipient of the action, which is known as the \u2018goal\u2019.  \nThese entities can eith er be single words or they can be further modified with pre - and/or \npostmodifiers in an effort to further name  the entity.  \nFor example:  \nPage 15 of  56 \n 1. The prime minister reduced benefit payments  \n2. the new, energetic prime minister reduced child benefit payments to the rich  \n(Jeffries, 2010: 19)  \n \nThis noun phrase (2) has been expanded to include a number of identifiers of the entity and is \na way of delivering more information. \u201c(...)the main ideological importance of noun phrases is \nthat they are able to \u2018package up\u2019 ideas or  information (...)\u201d (Jeffries, 2010:19).  \nJeffries argues that Naming covers a broad number of linguistic practices, including:  \n\u2022 The choice of a noun to indicate a referent  \n\u2022 The construction of a noun phrase with modifiers to further determine the nature of \nthe referent.  \n\u2022 The decision to use a \u2018name\u2019 rather than, for example, express a (verbal) process.  \n \nIn everyday life we can encounter this process of Naming in how we describe things: \u201c I bought \na heap of clothes\u201d where \u2018heap\u2019 is used to express the amount of clothes you bought or when \nyou express your opinion of something, whether it is negative, neutral, or positive, i.e. \u201c She \ngave me a smile\u201d or \u201cShe gave me a leer\u201d  (Jeffries, 2010:20).  \n \nNaming  can also be used to pack ideological content into the head noun through the process \nof nominalization . Jeffries gives a good example of this:  \n1. The British invaded Iraq  \n2. The invasion of Iraq by the British  \nIn example 1 the recipient could question, debate or comment on the action (invaded): \u201cdid \nthey?\u201d \u201care you sure?\u201d etc . But in example 2 the actor has been syntactically removed because \nnominalization of the verb has turned it into a noun phrase and made it function more as an \nascertainment.  \n \n2.2.2 Equating and Contrasting  \nThis chapter looks at how authors use text to cre ate a version of the world for us to read \nabout. They show us what they see as equivalent and what they see as contrastive. For \nPage 16 of  56 \n example: \u201cthe incompetent government\u201c, here equalizing incompetent and government  or: \u201cthe \ngovernment is not smart\u201c , here making  a contrast between government and smart.  This is a \nway to shape the image presented in the text to reflect the author's ideology (Jeffries, 2010: \n51).  \nThe tool is based on finding triggers in the structure of the texts and the relationship between \ntwo ite ms. Jeffries gives a list of triggers but argues that this is only a small representation of \nsome of the more common triggers. She also notes that several triggers may occur in a single \nexample. In the following examples, the two items examined will be ref erred to as X and Y and \nfollowed by an example sentence. Her list of triggers includes, but is not limited to:  \n\u2022 Negated opposition  \n\u2022 X not Y = Home not dry  \n\u2022 Concessive opposition  \n\u2022 Despite X, Y = Despite her anger, she danced  \n\u2022 Explicit oppositions  \n\u2022 X by contrast w ith Y = Steel by contrast with water  \n\u2022 Parallelism  \n\u2022 He liked X. She liked Y = He likes beer. She likes wine  \n\u2022 Contrastives  \n\u2022 X, but Y = She was young, but ugly  \nBy using these triggers an author can create an alternate perspective of a given situation and \npush her  own ideology on the reader (Jeffries, 2010: 58)  \n \n2.2.3 Exemplifying and Enumerating.  \nExemplifying and Enumerating  are ways of listing a number of items and the two can be hard \nto distinguish because of the similar structure. A simple way of showing the di fference is:  \n1. The whole household turned out to welcome us: Mum, Dad, Uncle Sam and the twins.  \n2. The whole town was there: The Mayor and his wife, the City Councillors and the \nrepresentatives of every trade and business you could imagine.  \n(Jeffries,  2010: 66 ) \nExample 1 shows how enumerating functions as a way to list items where we know that \neveryone involved in the situation is mentioned, i.e. there is not another member of the family \nPage 17 of  56 \n who is not mentioned. In example 2 it is clear that \u201c the whole town\u201d  is an  exaggeration and is \njust a way to exemplify the amount of people who showed up. As mentioned before, the \nstructure of the two is very similar and will usually consist of a list following a colon which \nexpands upon the subject (Jeffries, 2010: 66). A marke r for enumerating is usually when it is \nclear that the list is complete.  \n \nListing items can have very different effects depending on the amount of items included in the \nlist. The most common use of a two -part list is to construct an image of opposites (Jef fries, \n2010: 70). The three -part list is a ubiquitous list that has the ability to indicate that all \npossibilities have been covered and therefore implies completeness without being \ncomprehensive. This list is often used by politicians who want to create a  positive image \n(Jeffries, 2010: 70 -72). An example of such a list is: \u201cCommunities and Local Government\u2019s \nvision is to create great places where people want to live, work and raise a family\u201d (Jeffries, \n2010: 73). This is a three -part list and has a number  of different functions. The sentence is \nsupplanting the real content but it still implies completeness. By implying that the sentence \nencompasses it all, it also creates the image of \u201c this is a party that will make everything right!\u201d \n(Jeffries. 2010: 73).  Furthermore a three -part list is easier to remember and is therefore \nuseful for creating a more permanent image.  \nThe four -part list is often used as an instruction manual for different sorts of everyday things, \ni.e. putting together some furniture. For ex ample: \u201cCheck all bolts, screws, legs and castors \nregularly to make sure they haven\u2019t loosened.\u201d  (Jeffries, 2010: 72). It is intended to be \ncomprehensive and there is no question in the reader\u2019s mind that this list is complete. Jeffries \nnotes that there ar e situations where the list might not include everything individually but \nthat these kinds of lists usually include a \u201ccatch -all category\u201d so as to cover anything missing \nfrom the list.  \nTo summarise; the function of enumerating and exemplifying is to creat e an image of either \nopposites, completeness or comprehensiveness.  \n \n2.2.4 Prioritising  \nThe choice of Prioritising certain information is something everyone does when producing \ntext, either on purpose or unconsciously. It is a way of controlling what the re ader focuses on \nPage 18 of  56 \n and hopefully what they will take with them after reading the text. It can be by leaving out \nthings or by placing information at the end of the clause (Jeffries, 2010: 77). The following \nsentences are examples of different prioritising:  \n1. The government reduced unemployment benefit  \n2. Unemployment benefit was reduced (by the government)  \nThese two sentences are more or less the same, one being passive and the other being active, \nthe difference is in what information is being prioritised. In exampl e 1, the focus is on the last \nelement of the clause ( unemployment benefit ) and in example 2, it is on the predicator ( was \nreduced ). Jeffries (2010: 78) also argues that another important thing has happened in \nexample 2, namely that the actor responsible fo r the action is hidden since \u201cby the \ngovernment\u201d  has been made into an optional adverbial.  \nAnother way of using prioritising is to put specific information into a subordinate clause and \nthereby controlling which information the reader focuses on. For examp le: \u201cSenator McCain \ngave Americans specifics on how he will increase jobs, while Barack Obama was unable to give a \nstraight answer to this question\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 88). Doing this creates the image of the first \nsentence being more important, while the su bordinate clauses function as a way to enforce \nthe main clause.  \n \n2.2.5 Implying and Assuming  \nThe terms, Implying and Assuming , deal with presuppositions and implicatures: in a sense the \naspects of hidden meaning and general assumptions a given text relies on to make its point. \nJeffries has based this chapter on theory drawn from the field of Pragmatics, which is \u201cmore \nabout what is implicit in language than what is explicit (...)\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 93). She goes on to \nstate that \u201cone of the main powers of la nguage in general and English in particular is the \nability to use assumption and implication to make ideologies appear to be common sense.\u201d \n(Jeffries, 2010: 93). This is achieved in a text by making assumptions of the world implicit \nenough that a reader wi ll go along with them. This is done in a variety of ways, as we shall see, \nbut the main point is that the assumption or implicature is often removed from the main \nproposition of a given sentence, and are as such \u2018out of focus\u2019 (Jeffries, 2010: 93).  \n \nPage 19 of  56 \n The te rm presupposition refers the to built -in assumptions of a text and falls generally into \ntwo categories; existential and logical assumptions (Jeffries, 2010: 94). Existential \npresuppositions are the more basic of the two, but potentially more dangerous. In any given \nconversation, it is altogether natural to make some general assumptions about the world and \nthe knowledge of one\u2019s conversational partner (Jeffries, 2010: 94). Communication would be \nseverely hamstrung if we did not make such assumptions. The tro uble is that it is possible to \nmake ideological assumptions in the same way that we make everyday conversational \nassumptions. Jeffries uses the following example to demonstrate how an existential \npresupposition can be ideologically loaded: \u201cThe Prime Minis ter we applauded turns out to be \nthe Headmaster from Hell!\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 95). This clause\u2019s two noun phrases constitute the \npresupposition that both \u2018The Prime Minister\u2019 and the \u2018Headmaster from Hell\u2019 are people that \nexist; presented as a fact given th e definite nature of the noun phrases. The, somewhat \nideological, proposition is then that these two are the same people. As such we see that the \nideological load, as it were, is separate from the main proposition of the sentence.  \nLogical presuppositions f all into a number of categories, each with an open -ended set of \ntriggers from which they can be identified (Jeffries, 2010: 95). These categories include \n\u2018Change of state verbs\u2019, that signify a change in circumstances; \u201cYou have stopped snoring \nsince you l ost weight.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 95). Here the presupposition is that the addressee \nsnored before. Other such trigger -words include started, resigned, finished and so on. As this \nexample illustrates, logical presuppositions rely on the logic of language.  \n \nA simple way of distinguishing between presupposition and implicature is the negation test. \nAny of the above examples will retain some of their presuppositional content if negated. \nImplicatures, however, \u201cwill disappear if the main clause in which they occur is negated.\u201d \n(Jeffries, 2010: 97). Jeffries defines implicatures as \u201c(...) recognisable as cases where the text \nflouts or violates the Gricean maxims of cooperation (...)\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 99). Jeffries here \nrefers to the Co -operative model of interaction,  by Paul Grice. Grice, in his model, puts forth a \nseries of maxims, which are understood to be the rules of conduct by which we converse and \nexpect others to converse. We shall not go into the particulars of the model, nor list its maxims \nhere, as this wou ld be too extensive for present purposes. We believe implicatures can be \nfound and analysed without direct reference to and use of the model.  \nPage 20 of  56 \n In the following example from Jeffries, she exemplifies how a disregard for the Maxim of \nQuality (Truth) can lead to an implicature on the part of the speaker: \u201cThe Honourable \nGentleman in question is a monkey and should answer the question.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 99). This \nstatement is not literally truthful, as all present should be able to identify the Gentleman as \nhuma n, and as such it violates Grice\u2019s Truth Maxim. The implicature then, is that the \nGentleman is thought, by the speaker, to possess some qualities of a monkey (he is like a \nmonkey), which are generally thought to not be positive traits, especially in a poli tical context \n(Jeffries, 2010: 99).  \nPresuppositions and implicatures are important points in discourse analysis due to their \nsubtle nature. They are often placed on the fringes of utterances, so to speak, and can \ntherefore slip by a reader unnoticed. Addit ionally, they are often innocent, ideologically, as we \nuse them all the time in everyday conversation and language. As such, we are often less aware \nof them when they suddenly carry ideological meaning.  \n \n2.2.6 Negating  \nJeffries uses Negating and negation a s generic terms, carrying a broader array of meaning \nthan the grammatical negating of verbs (Jeffries, 2010: 106). Negation produces a \nhypothetical world in the text, a simple example of which is the following from Jeffries: \u201cThe \ndoor is not closed\u201d (Jeffr ies, 2010: 106). With this sentence, the recipient is invited to imagine \na scenario in which the door is in fact closed. If the door, or doors in general, was incapable of \nbeing closed, the sentence, and thereby the negation, would not make sense. Negation  can be \nrealised by grammatical negation, as in the example above, or by an open -ended list of trigger \nwords such as the nouns lack , absence , scarcity , the verbs, fail, omit , refuse , and the adjectives \nabsent , scarce  and so on (Jeffries, 2010: 109). Also i ncluded in this list are words with a \nnegative prefix, such as incomplete , undecided , asocial , anti -depressant  (Jeffries, 2010: 109). \nIdeologically, negation can be used to conjure up images of an unwanted scenario within the \nreader\u2019s mind, creating fear ( Jeffries, 2010: 111). A couple of examples can illustrate this: \n\u201cScientists warn that there may  be no ice  at the North Pole this summer.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 111). \nEven though the modal, may , suggests a hypothetical scenario, the contrast between an \nimagined world with no ice at the pole and the one we live in at the moment is enough to \ncreate fear. Another example is typical of sensationalistic journalism: \u201c No murders  took place \nPage 21 of  56 \n at the care home at the centre of a child abuse investigation, the new police chi ef leading the \ninquiry said today.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 111). Even though it expresses a, after all, positive \nscenario, the negation still conjures up an unwholesome scenario where murders did indeed \ntake place.  \n \n2.2.7 Hypothesising  \nAnother way of conjuring d ifferent scenarios of various description, is by way of \nHypothesising . Here, however, a hypothetical scenario is envisioned through the use of \nmodality, rather than negation. For example, the sentence \u201cThis law ought  to be repealed.\u201d \nexpresses a possible s cenario wherein said law is repealed, on the background of the present \nstate of affairs in which it is not (Jeffries, 2010: 124). The trouble, Jeffries explains, is that \n\u201cThough there are reasons why such statements may be made frequently in the press and \nother media, it is nevertheless their repetition from authoritative sources that make them into \na self -fulfilling prophecy.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 124). Another, more ideologically loaded, example is \nthis: \u201cWhy long -haul food may be  greener than local food with  low air -miles.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: \n125). Such a sentence is typical of, for instance, online click -bait articles. The modality of may \nbe promises nothing more than a hypothetical scenario, but in the case that the source holds a \ncertain degree of authority,  there is a distinct chance of the scenario being accepted as \nrealistic by the reader. Whether or not the recipients read the \u2018why\u2019 promised by the article, \nthe idea is planted in their heads, at least until it is disproved.  \n \n2.2.8 Presenting Others\u2019 Speec h and Thoughts  \nIn relation to presenting others\u2019 speech and thoughts Jeffries discusses the potential \nideological interpretation of \u201c(...) the viewpoint of the participants who are discussed in texts \nbut whose words and thoughts are mediated by the narrati ng voice of the text (..)\u201d (Jeffries, \n2010: 130). Jeffries uses a variety of terms to describe this mediation, ranging from direct \nspeech, using quotations (\u201cHe said \u2018I\u2019m terribly sorry\u2019.\u2019\u2019), to the more interpretive method of \nrelaying utterances through v erbalisation of the speech or speech act (\u201cHe apologised\u201d) \n(Jeffries, 2010: 132). The former is usually considered the more truthful approach, or at least \nmore faithful to the originator of the utterance, whereas the latter leaves room for \nembellishment or  other interpretation on part of the narrator (such as the leaving out of the \nPage 22 of  56 \n adjective in the above example). The latter forms are called Narrator\u2019s Report of Speech and \nNarrator\u2019s Report of Speech Act. It is within this sphere of reporting that a narrato r can \n(mis)construe the words of others to the point where the reader is left with half the picture. \nWords can be left out, as with the adjective above, leaving the reported speech sounding \ndifferent than originally. Additionally: \u201cThe use of connotatively  loaded words instead of the \ndenotative synonyms is one common way of slanting the reporting of another\u2019s speech.\u201d \n(Jeffries, 2010: 140). To exemplify this, Jeffries refers to an opinion piece wherein the narrator \n\u2018quotes\u2019 an owner of a chain of clubs as h aving said that his \u201cclubs were \u2018not sexually \ntitillating\u2019 (\u2026)\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 138). In the original quote, the owner uses the phrase \u2018not \nsexually stimulating\u2019, which is a good deal more neutral than \u2018titillating\u2019.  \n \n2.2.9 Representing Time, Space and So ciety  \nThe last term of Jeffries\u2019 toolset concerns how narrators and text producers create and \nexpress specific points of view, or worldviews, in their texts. Even in everyday speech, people \nuse different words and terms to communicate distance in time and/ or space to/from \nthemselves. This, Jeffries argues, can be analysed using the model of deixis. The term refers to \nthe way in which speakers position themselves in interaction \u201cThus, at a simple level, the \nplace where the interaction is occurring is here , and the time it is occurring is now , the \nspeaker is I and the addressee is you.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 148). This position is called the deictic \ncentre, and is considered default for most everyday interactions. Being empathetic creatures, \npeople will recognise t he deictic centre of others in interaction, and thereby see things from \nothers\u2019 point of view (Jeffries, 2010: 148). Jeffries gives the example of someone guiding a \nfriend to their house over the phone, thereby placing themselves at another\u2019s deictic centr e in \norder to guide them, saying \u2018take a right here\u2019 or \u2018keep straight on\u2019 (Jeffries, 2010: 149).  \nIn relation to written texts, \u201cThe deictic system of English divides the context of interaction \ninto those things (people, times etc.) which are close to the speaker, and those which are more \nremote from the speaker.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 148). Jeffries then gives a list of word categories \nwhich are useful to be on the lookout for when trying to determine the deictic centre of the \nspeaker. This list is as follows:  \n \nPage 23 of  56 \n \u201cPlace \u2013 adverbs ( here , there ), demonstratives ( this, these , that , those ), adverbial (often \nprepositional) structures ( on the right , opposite , further up the road ) \nTime \u2013 verb tenses, adverbs ( then , now ), demonstratives ( this, these  that , those ), time \nadverbials ( later , tomorrow , afterwards , next , soon ) \nPerson \u2013 personal pronouns ( I, me, we, us, you) \nSocial \u2013 titles ( Mr, Dr, Lord  etc.), address forms (first name, nicknames, formal names)\u201d  \n(Jeffries, 2010: 149)  \n \nThe clever text producer will use words from the above list to create a deictic field that the \nreader will in some way identity with: \u201cThe most important effect of deixis in ideological \nterms is the ability of a producer to create a deictic centre that causes the reader to place \nhim/herself mentally at that point in the deictic field created by the text.\u201d (Jeffries, 2010: 156). \nThis is the more advanced use of deixis. At the simplest level, this is just how language works, \nit is simple communication. Jeffries also uses the term, Actual World , to demon strate what \nideologically loaded text usually tries to achieve. By communicating the text producer\u2019s deictic \ncentre in the text, the producer can try to convince the reader that the worldview they are \nconveying is the Actual World, that is, perceived factu al reality.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 24 of  56 \n 3.0 Analysis  \nWhat follows is an analysis of each article, first the British, then the American. The analyses \nwill follow the the structure of the method section. As such, we will be going through the \narticles one tool at a time, starting with Naming and Describing, then Equating and \nContrasting, and so on. It is highly likely that some tools will be less useful than others for \nsome articles, whereas they might feature more in others. Additionally, there is bound to be a \ndegree of overlapping of  terms; it is difficult to describe a presupposition without discussing \nthe naming that makes it possible, for instance. We will reference each individual article by \nline numbers, as found in the appendix.  \n \n3.1 Article 1: Huffington Post  \n\u201c\u2018Tis the Season t o Don Blackface: How My Friends Celebrate Christmas\u201d (l. 2)  \nWith this title, the author (Fisayo Fadahunsi) introduces the reader to both the tone and \nsubject of the article. While the first half of the title creates a catchy hook, playing on the \nwords of a  well -known Christmas lullaby, it also underlines the theme of the article: racism. \nThe naming of the act of putting on a Black Pete costume as \u2018donning blackface\u2019 is what \nintroduces the theme. Obviously, it had to fit with the meter of the song, but there  is \nconnotative difference between painting one\u2019s face black and wearing blackface; the first is \nsomewhat neutral, the second holds historically racist implications. Additionally, the second \nhalf of the title represents an action taken by someone other tha n the author, leading to a \ncertain allocation of blame. The two halves together create a somewhat oxymoronic title, due \nto the apparent incompatibility between wearing blackface makeup and celebrating \nChristmas.  \n \nAround lines 31 -32, the reader\u2019s attention is turned back to the distress of the author\u2019s friend, \nwho, before the reported incident \u201c(\u2026) had not fallen victim to such a remark (...)\u201d, and as such \n\u201c(\u2026) never had to directly confront overt racism.\u201d. Here, the racism is nominalised, being a \ncomplement  of the clause, and as such is assumed to be not only present but \u2018overt\u2019. Indeed, \nthe use of the noun \u2018victim\u2019 and the action verb \u2018confront\u2019 underlines the general tone of \nstruggle present in the text. In fairness, there is no direct indicator (such as \u2018 such\u2019 or \u2018this kind \nPage 25 of  56 \n of\u2019) that this \u2018overt racism\u2019 is referring to the remark in question, but the context implies that \nit is.  \nAt line 34, the author begins a presentation of the more specific subject of the article: The \nDutch tradition of Black Pete. She introduces the tradition as the \u201cLargest celebration in Dutch \nculture\u201d, which is an interesting choice of naming, since it refers not to the Netherlands per se, \nbut specifically Dutch culture. As such, this is both an inclusive and exclusive statement. It is \ninclusive in the fact that it can refer to Dutch -culturally identifying people around the world, \nsuch as in Britain or South Africa, but exclusive in that it implies that there might be people in \nthe Netherlands, who fall outside of this category of \u2018cu lture\u2019. This might suggest the idea that \nthere are people within the Dutch nation who do not participate in this celebration, which is \ntrue, given the substantial opposition to it.  \n \nAdditionally, the writer refers to the celebration by its Dutch name, Pakj esavond, thereby \nunderlining the foreignness of it (l. 35). This can be seen as the easiest way for the reader to \ndistinguish between the two countries\u2019 Christmas celebrations. However, it can also create an \nimage of a foreign and strange custom in the min d of the reader.  \n \nFurther into the article, there is a larger selection of pictures, once more of people dressed as \nBlack Pete, which underlines the previous statement, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but be surprised by the \nscale of the practice\u201d (l. 67). Besides the cl ear message the pictures convey, the naming of the \ntradition as \u2018practice\u2019 is interesting. On one hand, it can be seen as a strictly neutral way of \ndescribing the act, but on the other, it does hold some connotations of disapproval or \ncriticism.  \n \nWhen disc ussing her experienced difficulties in dealing with the acceptance and approval of \nthe tradition from her Dutch friends, the writer states: \u201cMy friends repeatedly told me, and I \nfully accept, that their actions were not intended to offend me.\u201d (l. 98 -99). Here, the use of the \ncomplement, \u2018actions\u2019, which is vague, does hold some accusatory connotations, akin to the \nwording of \u2018practice\u2019.  \n \nPage 26 of  56 \n Towards the end of the article, the author concludes that she is \u201c(\u2026) confident that (\u2026) \nsomething like Zwarte Piet woul d not have survived the evolution of our society [British \nsociety].\u201d (l. 106). The nominalisation in the complement \u2018evolution of our society\u2019 implies \nthat Dutch society is less evolved, as such: a racist society is less evolved than a non -racist \nsociety. While this may be hard to disagree with, it does not exactly foster a healthy debate.  \n \nIn the section beginning at line 46, there is a picture of a man dressed as Sinterklaas \nsurrounded by six people in the traditional Zwarte Piet costume, makeup and all. While we \nare not going to analyse the picture itself, its placement and subtitle, \u201cMeet Sinterklaas\u2019 \ncompanions, Zwarte Pieten (Black Peter).\u201d, does hold some importance, as this is the first \nvisualisation the reader is presented with. Following the pictur e, the writer continues her \npresentation of the tradition: \u201cUnlike Father Christmas, Sinterklaas is accompanied by a band \nof black servants.\u201d (l. 46). Here, we see the explicit opposition using \u2018unlike\u2019, underlining the \ncontrast. Besides the alliterative q uirkiness of \u2018band of black\u2019, the use of servants, is a peculiar \nchoice of naming. While \u2018helpers\u2019 or \u2018assistants\u2019 would have been the more neutral approach, \n\u2018servant\u2019 is heavily connotative in a negative way, especially in this context.  \nThe Black Petes ar e then further described historically as \u201cSanta\u2019s mean sidekicks\u201d (l. 48), \ncontrasting how \u201cSinterklaas rewarded well -behaved [kids]\u201d (l. 49). As such, the writer is \nexplaining the factual historical composition of the characters, but also laying the groun dwork \nfor the implicit hypothesis that maybe this has not changed all that much.  \nAfter this historical clarification, the writer explains that, in relation to the black face paint, \n\u201cthe modern narrative now states that this is due to the soot (\u2026)\u201d (l. 52).  The \u2018now\u2019 implies a \nchange of state. However, the adjective \u2018modern\u2019 should then be redundant, it\u2019s inclusion \npresupposing that while the modern narrative is now stating this, there may be another \nmodern narrative, which used to say something different. T his is once again signifying of the \nidea that the old view of Black Pete as a slave could still exist as a parallel modern narrative. \nThis is further emphasised when the author underlines the fact that the presence of the afro \nwigs and golden earrings in t he costume points to Black Pete as remaining \u201c(\u2026) a not -so-\ndistant relative of the 19th Century Blackface caricature.\u201d (l. 55).  \n \nPage 27 of  56 \n Beginning at line 81, the author discusses her feeling of alienation in face of her Dutch friends\u2019 \nbeliefs: \u201cI simply could not  accept that people I respected and cared for could hold these \nopinions.\u201d. This statement contrasts \u2018friends\u2019 with \u2018racists\u2019, which may seem reasonable, \nhowever, it is a fairly polarising argument, unfairly splitting people into two incompatible \ngroups. In deed, she has evidently experienced that she can care about these people and \nconsider them friends, in spite of their adherence to the tradition.  \nThe author\u2019s following introspection, \u201cBeing faced with racism from friends forces one to \nreally think.\u201d (l. 9 2), once more presupposes that the tradition does indeed equal racism; the \niterative presence of the word leads to its nominalisation and equalisation. On this note, she \ngoes on to explain that it is one thing \u201cwhen a stranger attacks you (\u2026) but when it i s someone \nthat you are invested in it is a lot harder.\u201d (l. 92 -93). With this sentence, she is equating an \nattack from a stranger, presumably a racist remark or slur, with an \u2018attack\u2019 from a friend. This \ncreates an environment where the friend cannot defen d his or her beliefs without being \nlabelled an attacker and a racist, further polarising the debate.  \n \nAs evident from the analysis so far, the article is full of presuppositions and implicatures. For \ninstance, in lines 15 -17, we see the presupposition of a , somewhat specific, set of \u2018indicators of \nracism\u2019, which is interesting in terms of the position of the writer and her worldview. This \npresupposition speaks of an environment where racism is oft -debated and plays a role. Also, it \nis assumed that the reade r would know of such indicators.  \nIn explaining the Dutch tradition to the reader, the writer states that \u201cthe celebrations echo \nthose in the UK very closely\u201d (l. 37). Here, the use of \u2018echo\u2019 implies, in the least, that the writer \nspeaks from a deixis centr ed in the UK, and as such orientates herself from that point of view, \nwhich is natural. On the other hand, it can imply a view of the Dutch celebration as secondary \nor subordinate, compared to that of the UK. This is further underlined when the writer list s \nthe specific differences using phrasing such as \u201cthe earlier date\u201d, \u201cin place of\u2019, \u201c (...) Sinterklaas \nrather than Father Christmas (...)\u201d (l. 41 -42). While not overt, this sort of language does imply \na UK -centred viewpoint.  \nTo back up the report that \u201cT he tradition is a fiercely defended one.\u201d (l. 74) the writer relays \nthe percentage results of a survey from 2013, \u201c(...) reveal[ing] that 92% of the Dutch public do \nnot perceive Zwarte Piet as racist or associate him with slavery (\u2026)\u201d(l. 75). The negated v erb, \nPage 28 of  56 \n \u2018perceive\u2019, implies that perhaps the Dutch public ought  to find the character racist and \nassociate him with slavery. The implication could additionally suggest an admission that \nracism is a matter of perspective.  \nOn the note of this high approval rate  of the tradition, the writer continues \u201cIndeed, I soon \nfound that many [supporters] were people that I classified as friends.\u201d (l. 79). The contrast \nbetween the author\u2019s, by now, explicit view of the supporters of the tradition and the word \n\u2018friends\u2019 seem s to hold the implicature that \u2018perhaps I was wrong to classify them as such\u2019. In \nany case, she goes on to say that many an argument over the tradition has sprung up. The \nauthor relates her friends\u2019 arguments in favour of the tradition, based on their chil dhood \nmemories; \u201cZwarte Piet was not a man in blackface but a fantasy character (\u2026)\u201d (l. 86). The \npast tense indicates the view that while such may have been a child\u2019s interpretation, he is now \nmost certainly a man in blackface.  \nNearing the end of the arti cle, the author states that \u201cI certainly can\u2019t imagine Prime Minister \nDavid Cameron publicly defending the practice, as the Dutch Prime Minister did when \nchallenged just last year.\u201d (l. 108). Here the implicature is quite clear: Cameron is in the right; \nthe Dutch Prime Minister is in the wrong.  \nThe article ends with a nominalisation: \u201c(\u2026) my right to be outraged.\u201d (l. 114), which \nconcludingly presupposes that outrage is a right, and, true or false, it further develops the \nconfrontational nature of the artic le, and the debate as a whole.  \n \nIn relaying the anecdote that leads to the main subject of the article, the writer uses reported \nspeech; \u201c(\u2026) asked her (\u2026)\u201d (l. 9), \u201cShe declined (\u2026)\u201d (l. 9). Only when reporting the comment \nmade by her friend\u2019s colleague d oes she use direct speech, thereby placing focus on this \nutterance (l. 11). After this, the writer resumes the method of reported speech. This structure \nhas a couple of consequences. Firstly, as mentioned, it puts the focus on the incriminating \nutterance, making it clear that this is the important bit. Secondly, it allows the writer some \nfreedom in painting a specific picture. For instance, \u201cHer colleague was going to the shops and \nout of courtesy, or so she thought, asked her if (\u2026)\u201d (l. 8). The \u2018so she th ought\u2019 directly \nindicates that the colleague in question had malignant intent, which, neither writer nor friend \nhad any way of knowing. After the incriminating comment is made, the friend \u201c(\u2026) realised his \nintended implication.\u201d (l. 14). The placement of t he adjective in the complement of the clause \nPage 29 of  56 \n results in the presupposition that the implication was indeed intended, which, again, no one \nbut the utterer could know.  \nThe way the anecdote is reported leaves room for interpretation. What could have happened \nis that the colleague was perfectly genuine in his inquiry, made a thoughtless comment, \nrealised how it could be interpreted by the recipient, and then tried to play it off with \nlaughter. Admittedly, this seems less likely than what is reported, but the po int stands that \nreported speech lets a writer tell their version of a story. The two quotes above illustrate how \nthe text paints the situation in a certain light, without presenting all the facts.  \nThe writer continues the anecdote from the point where her friend is conveying it to her, \ntrying to agree whether or not it was in fact racist: \u201cWe concluded that his eluding to her \nbeing a monkey, his laughter and professing his innocence were all indicators that it was\u201d (l. \n16). Here, the colleague\u2019s intention i s once again presupposed by virtue of said elusion being \nplaced as a complement. Additionally, the naming of the colleague\u2019s speech act as \u2018professing\u2019 \nis not necessarily neutral, but rather, signifying of his presupposed guilt.  \nIn the next section, lines 20-27, the narrator seems to be paraphrasing pieces of advice given \nto her by others in the past. In the face of racist remarks, she is advised to \u201cjust brush it off\u201d \nand \u201cgrow a thicker skin\u201d. However, she then relates how she has come to accept racist \nremarks against her as \u201cjust a fact of life when you\u2019re brown/black\u201d. All of these are placed in \nquotation marks, which leads to some confusion as to whether they are direct speech or \nreported speech. The last \u2018quote\u2019, especially, seems altogether separated from any originator. \nWhile this use of, seemingly, direct speech does not hold ideological implications in this case, \nthey do emphasise a certain image, or role, the author is taking on, which will be elaborated \non further in this analysis.  \nRelating her ex periences with the tradition in the Netherlands, the author describes how \n\u201cChildren and adults alike wore their afro wigs, red lips and gold earrings with pride (\u2026)\u201d (l. \n68). The genitive article directly denotes both ownership and affiliation, while the \u2018 pride\u2019 \nseems an unfair report of other\u2019s perceived thoughts. Although pride is an emotion that can be \nobserved, in this context it gives off a heavily negative connotation. Another report of others\u2019 \nthoughts or emotions follows the above when the descripti on of the event falls on the \naudience who \u201cseemed to be spectating (\u2026) joyously\u201d (l. 70). While the judgement of this \nsentence is mitigated by the copular verb, it does at the very least constitute a generalisation.  \n \nPage 30 of  56 \n The first instance of the writer develo ping deixis further than what is given through her use of \npronouns, is in line 18, where she reports her friend asking for her \u201c(\u2026) opinion as a fellow \nyoung, black female (\u2026)\u201d. This helps establish a perceived identity for the sake of the reader, \nas well as lending credence to the author\u2019s expressed feelings of outrage.  \nIn the paragraph from line 20 -27, the author discusses the various experiences she has had \nwith racism, and the advice she has been given in order to deal with it. As mentioned \npreviously i n this analysis, the author concludes the section with the statement that she has \n\u201c(\u2026) been hardened into acceptance.\u201d (l. 27). This sentence, and others besides, help to \nestablish the writer\u2019s identity, but also, more importantly, her role in the debate; that of a \nvictim. This is important in relation to the deictic centre that the reader is supposed to \nsympathise with, and which is developed throughout the text.  \nIn developing the deictic centre, the author relates how she, when first moving to the \nNetherl ands, was warned about the tradition: \u201cIt is a Dutch tradition, held close to the \nDutchman\u2019s heart. I, as a foreigner, should simply grin and bear it.\u201d (l. 61). Here, the deictic \ncentre is made explicit, the writer is a native Brit and a foreigner in the N etherlands. This \nmaintains the viewpoint of the article as that of an outsider looking in, so to speak, which for \nthe reader will give her credence as being able to view the subject in a different light. \nHowever, the Dutch could equally claim that her fore ignness bars her from understanding.  \nIn summation, as a blog, the text works adequately in drawing in the reader by presenting the \nwriter\u2019s emotional response to the subject, but as a way of objectively reporting on the \ncontroversy that is the tradition, i t falls short. The author is establishing herself firmly in the \nrole of the victim, and while she is indeed a victim of racism, the insistence on this role, and \nthe \u2018us and them\u2019 -mentality it promotes, does not promote a healthy debate. Additionally, the \nwriter falls prey to some of the same rhetoric used by her presumed opposition, such as \ngeneralisation and a, however slight, sense of superiority of one\u2019s own people compared to \nthe opponent.  \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 31 of  56 \n 3.2 Article 2: Daily Star  \n\u201cIs THIS the weirdest Christmas tradi tion ever? Festival -goers black up for \u2018racist\u2019 parade\u201d (l. \n1-4). This is the headline which introduces the article published in the Daily Star. The first \nthing one notices regarding the headline is the fact that \u2018This\u2019 is in all caps, pointing out that \nthe author indeed thinks this is the weirdest Christmas tradition ever. Already, we see the \nopinion that the article leans towards. Another interesting aspect regarding the first sentence \nin the headline is that while the sentence ends with a question mark, it answers its own \nquestion before the readers have a chance to consider it for themselves. Also, the fact that the \nsentence ends with the word \u2018ever\u2019 puts strong emphasis on just how weird the author (Jess \nBell) finds the tradition. Just from reading the first part of the headline it is made clear that \nthe author is of the opinion that the tradition is weird. Another example of the author\u2019s \nopinion shining through via Naming is in the second sentence of the headline (l. 3 -4) where \nyou find buzzwords such a s \u2018black up\u2019 and \u2018racist parade\u2019. The term \u2018black up\u2019 is loaded with \nnegative connotations. If the author had attempted to remain neutral she could have used a \nphrase like \u2018dress up for\u2019. When the author chooses to utilise such buzzwords she leaves the \nreader with no doubts that indeed this tradition must be both the weirdest tradition ever as \nwell as being racist.  \nIn the lead the author again uses the word \u2018weird\u2019 when describing the Dutch Christmas \ntraditions: \u201c(\u2026) the weird and wonderful Christmas tradi tions (\u2026)\u201d (l. 5). The word \u2018weird\u2019 \noften has a negative connotation but in the lead the nouns \u2018weird\u2019 and \u2018wonderful\u2019 are used \ntogether in a noun phrase where weird and wonderful are identifiers of \u2018Christmas traditions\u2019. \nWhen two contrasting nouns are us ed like this, they create a contrastive opposition, which in \nturn forms a two -part list used to exemplify or enumerate. However, here they are used in the \ncapacity of naming.  \nWhen the author mentions Black Pete she is very inconsistent with her modifiers.  Below are a \nfew examples. The first time the author mentions Black Pete by name she describes him as \n\u201c(\u2026) the sidekick of Saint Nicholas (\u2026)\u201d (l. 14). The noun \u2018sidekick\u2019 describes Black Pete as \nsomeone who, although subordinate to Saint Nicholas, chooses  to help him. With this \ndescriptor there does not seem to be anything inherently wrong with the relationship \nbetween the two. Contrasting this a few lines further down, the author makes an attempt at \nneutrality with her choice of words when she describes B lack Pete as being \u201c[a] controversial \nPage 32 of  56 \n figure (\u2026)\u201d (l. 23). When she describes Black Pete this way she avoids using any biased \nmodifiers. However, she soon after breaks from this neutrality when she writes \u201c(\u2026) St Nick \nand his pal Black Pete.\u201d (l. 24). When  she calls Black Pete Saint Nicholas\u2019 \u201cpal\u201d it has a similar \neffect as in the previous example when he is called a \u201csidekick\u201d, although it takes it a step \nfurther by calling them friends. Usually friends are quals and therefore this is very contrastive. \nYet another inconsistency is found within the same sentence when she describes Black Pete as \n\u201c(\u2026) a racist caricature (\u2026)\u201d (l. 25), clearly condemning the character.  \nThe author goes on to describe the arrival of St Nicholas as being \u201c(\u2026) the official arrival  of St \nNicholas.\u201d (l. 29). The \u201cofficial arrival\u201d distinguishes it from any other arrival; St Nicholas\u2019 \narrival is something special.  \nIn the next section of the article the author describes an attempt at appeasing protesters by \navoiding blackface and usin g yellow make -up instead as a \u2018bizarre twist\u2019. \u201cIn a bizarre twist \n(\u2026) Gouda decided to paint some of its Black Pete helpers yellow to represent the area\u2019s \nfamous cheese.\u201d (l. 49 -50). The use of the modifier \u2018bizarre\u2019 creates clear implications because \nbizarre is such a negatively loaded term. So while the author thinks that blacking up is wrong \nshe thinks it is just weird that they would attempt to appease protesters of the tradition by \nusing a different colour. However, naming the Black Petes as \u201chelpers\u201d  (l. 49) somewhat \nlessens the critical tone, compared to other possible epithets.  \nThe fact that the word \u201c\u2019racist\u2019\u201d (l. 4) is in quotation marks in the headline shows that the \nauthor attempts to lessen the force behind the word racism but the fact that the  word is even \nin the sentence means that it is the message put into the mind of the reader before they even \nstart reading the article itself, which is a clear instance of Implying. Another example of \nimplying is when the author uses the words \u201cweird and wo nderful\u201d (l. 5) to describe the Dutch \nChristmas traditions she uses two, somewhat, contradictory terms and through these shows \nthat there are people who think this tradition is wonderful as well as people who think it is \nweird.  \nAs mentioned earlier in the analysis the author is not always consistent in her ideological \npresentation of Black Pete. Another point where the author is unclear in her message \nregarding this tradition is when she writes the following: \u201cBlack Pete (\u2026) is the sidekick of \nSaint Nichola s (\u2026) according to tradition.\u201d (l. 10 -11) The author finishes the same sentence \nPage 33 of  56 \n with the words \u201caccording to tradition\u201d which implies that Black Pete being Saint Nicholas\u2019 \nsidekick has always been the case. However, as we see later in the article that is n ot how the \ncharacter was originally portrayed.  \nOn line 16 \u201cFor years festival -goers have covered their faces in blackface make -up, chucked on \na wig and traditional clothing to get into the character.\u201d we have another example of the \nauthor utilising naming  as a tool in order to imply something without outright saying it. The \nfirst instance of this within this sentence is when the author writes: \u2018covered their faces\u2019. This \nimplies some attempt at disguise, which in turn, could imply shame on the part of the festival -\ngoers. By writing the sentence as such it allows the author to express underlying currents \nwithout directly reporting them. It is not necessarily the case that the festival -goers feel that \nthey need to hide behind their make -up during the festivit ies, but when the author chose to \nwrite it in the way that she did, the implicature is that they do in fact feel this way. Another \nexample is found a few words later in the same sentence when the author uses the word \n\u2018blackface\u2019 (l. 16). The fact that the author chose to use the single word \u2018blackface\u2019 rather than \ntwo words implies that the festival goers wore blackface rather than that they wore face paint \nthat happened to be black. Blackface is a very negative word and it does not show the festival \ngoers in a good light when it is described in this way. Further in line 16, we see the phrase \n\u2018chucked on a wig\u2019, which implies carelessness; they are not considering the consequences, or \nthey simply do not care about said consequences. This is an especially not eworthy choice of \nwords when one considers the amount of protests that take place within the country itself and \nthe adverse reaction it gets from around the world.  \nAs mentioned earlier Black Pete is at one point described as being Saint Nicholas\u2019 \u2018Pal\u2019. Th is \nword choice is an example of how the author creates an ideology though her modifiers. When \nthe author describes Black Pete as a pal she not only negates the true origins of the character \nbut she also implies that, not only is Pete choosing to help Saint  Nicholas, he is his friend. \nBlack Pete and Saint Nicholas being friends rather than slave and master is one of the \narguments people use when they are defending the use of Black Petes.  \nPreviously in the article the author mentions that the Black Pete tradi tion is controversial but \ndoes not mention that people protest against the character, she only implied it. The first \nmention of protest comes in the following: \u201c(...) protesters have slammed the 19th century \ncharacter as a racist caricature \u2013 sparking clas hes between demonstrators and cops (\u2026)\u201d (l. \nPage 34 of  56 \n 25). Using the verb \u2018slammed\u2019, rather than a synonym like criticise, or protest, implies that \nprotesters are unfairly attacking the character. While using the word \u2018caricature\u2019 implies that \npeople dressing up as Black Pete are consciously making fun of, or stereotyping black people. \nTherefore, this sentence is implying two very different things at the same time. The first \nimplication is that demonstrators are unfairly attacking the traditions and the second is tha t \nportraying a black person the way that they are doing it, by making Black Pete a caricature, is \ninherently wrong.  \nAnother example where the author failed to maintain neutrality is in her use of \u201cfolklore\u201d in \nthe following sentence: \u201cFolklore states that Zwarte Piet is black because he was a Moor who \ntravelled to the Netherlands from Madrid.\u201d (l. 42 -43). The use of the noun folklore implies that \nthe sources are not very credible, or it implies that the author might not know the sources \nfrom which this info rmation is gained. This puts Pete\u2019s origins as a Moor into question and \nsupports the defenders of the tradition.  \nThe following is also an example of failed neutrality: \u201cIn Harwich  organisers were forced to \nabandon the character last year after they failed to recruit a black person for the role.\u201d(l. 44 -\n45). \u2018Forced to abandon\u2019 implies that the organisers were not given a choice in the matter. It \nalso implies that they would continue with the tradition given a choice. \u2018they failed to recruit a \nblack person fo r the role\u2019 implies that they are not against the tradition itself but that they \nmight not agree that it is alright for a white person to be wearing black face paint.  \nIn the third to last paragraph the author makes use of some unspecified polls. \u201cPolls sho w the \nmajority of Dutch people support blackface for the character, and most parades will keep the \ncharacter despite the outrage.\u201d(l. 51 -52). That these polls are unspecified, means that it is an \nunfounded claim since no sources are given. This further sup ports the previous analysis that \nthe article has questionable trustworthiness. Additionally, this example the author, once \nagain, underlines the negative connotations associated with the term blackface, presupposing \nthat there is outrage: \u201c(...) will keep the character despite the outrage\u201d. This wording gives the \nreader the impression that keeping the character as it is, is offensive.  \nIn the last section, the author writes about how the Dutch media, NOS, \u201c(...) questioned 223 \norganising committees and disco vered only two plan to ban blackface completely.\u201d (l. 55 -56). \nThe use of the word \u201conly\u201d implies that the author thinks that there should have been more \nPage 35 of  56 \n organisers willing to ban blackface. This further demonstrates the ambivalence dominating \nthis article regarding the tradition.  \nReturning to line 14 -15 where Black Pete is described as \u201c(\u2026) the sidekick of Saint \nNicholas(\u2026)\u201d, when one describes Black Pete like this, who is the focus of so much talk of \nracism, it makes the issue seem inconsequential. It neg ates the actual story of Pete being a \nblack slave to the white Saint Nicholas. It buries the true origins of the tradition. This seems \nsomewhat contradictory as the article previously emphasised the negative aspects regarding \nthe tradition. Another such ex ample is found in line 42 -43 with the use of the noun folklore. \nThis negates the fact that Black Pete was a Moor and therefore it does not emphasise why the \ntradition is wrong, rather it makes it seem as though it might not be true that Black Pete was \ninde ed originally a Moor.  \nIn the lead the author writes that the Christmas tradition \u201cappears to go one step too far\u201d (l. \n6). Here the author is distancing herself from her previous loaded sentences (the headline) by \nusing the modifier \u2018appears to\u2019. In other w ords, the author is hypothesising that it is possible \nthat the festival has gone too far, but she does not outright express this opinion. This is a \nstrong contrast to the headline.  \nAnother interesting aspect regarding the lead is the author\u2019s choice of put ting the word racist \nin quotation marks. Perhaps this was done in an attempt to make it function as reported \nspeech. This way it is clear that the writer herself is not responsible for that description and \ntherefore cannot be held accountable. This makes i t obvious that someone thinks this \ntradition is racist but the quotation marks clarify that it is not necessarily the author herself \nwho has this point of view.  \nThe second instance of reported speech is a much clearer example as it is an actual quote with \na source included: \u201cWe have stopped it this year as we can\u2019t get anybody who is black to do it.\u201d \n(l. 46 -47). In the entire article, there is only one person quoted and this quote condemns the \ntradition. If the author attempted to write from a neutral stand point it would have been a \ngood choice to quote from both sides of the conflict.  \nIn line 24, we see the shorter version of Saint Nicholas, \u201cSt Nick\u201d, this places the character \ncloser to the deictic centre of the reader as most people are familiar with the alternative name \nfor Santa Claus. For most people the name Santa Claus has a lot of positive connotations and \nPage 36 of  56 \n by using this name the author helps the reader relate to the character and by extension \nfamiliarises the character of Saint Nicholas for western p eople.  \n \nIn summation, the headline of the article leaves the reader with the impression that the article \nwill be written from the point of view of someone who is against the tradition but the author \ndoes not succeed in convincing the reader of this by the end of the article. The text is far from \nconsistent in how it portrays the character and tradition of Black Pete. It attempts to present \nboth sides of the controversy but rather than doing this in a neutral way it uses buzzwords \nlike racist and blackface a longside words like sidekick and pal, but it also uses words like \ncontroversial in an attempt to appear neutral. All of these conflicting terms and descriptors \nleave the reader unsure as to what point the article is actually trying to make.  \n \n3.3 Article 3 : New York Times  \nThis chapter will examine a part of the discourses represented in the article U.N Urges the \nNetherlands to Stop Portrayals of \u2018Black Pete\u2019 Character  with the help of the terms described \nby Lesley Jeffries.  \n \nThe author (Somini Sengupta) of  the article from The New York Times uses language in a \nvariety of ways to spread her message and by extension her own ideology. This is for example \nthe case in the headline of this article. The author starts by naming the actor and in extension \nof this, m arks the seriousness of the situation. The actor in the headline is named \u201cU.N.\u201d (l. 1) \nwhich is its formal name and a name most people know. U.N. is known as a global organisation \nworking on an official level and this helps set a more serious tone for the  article. The author \nslowly elaborates on the identity of the actor where U.N. is named respectively as \u201cA United \nNations committee (...)\u201d (l. 4) and \u201cThe United Nations Committee on the Eliminations of \nRacial Discrimination (...)\u201d (l. 8 -9).This might just  be a courtesy to the reader, but it also \nfunctions as a way of enforcing the serious tone of the article. The noun \u201ccommittee\u201d (l. 4) is a \nvery formal description and shows the reader that the arguments against the tradition are \nPage 37 of  56 \n made by professionals. In addition to marking the tone of the article this also helps the reader \nunderstand the situation since the actor is already known, this will be elaborated on later.  \n \nThe use of the verb \u2018urges\u2019 in the headline aims to create the idea of a problem that need s to \nbe solved quick and this idea is further strengthened when it is repeated later (l. 4). The \nproblem in question is the character of Black Pete and here it is interesting to note how the \nauthor describes it: \u201c(...) Stop Portrayals of \u2018Black Pete\u2019 Chara cter\u201d (l. 1 -2). The verb \u2018portrayal\u2019 \nmeans a representation or description of a character and by using this word the writer might \nbe implying that it is not the tradition, or character, itself that is racist, but the people's \nrepresentation of it.  \n \nThe au thor uses various words with strong connotations as a way of embedding the \nimportance of the article for the reader, for example with the use of the noun \u2018Eliminations\u2019 (l. \n9) combined with the buzzword \u2018Racial discrimination\u2019 (l. 9 -10). This is especially  the case in \nthe first paragraph which informs the reader of the more negative aspects of the tradition \nwith the use of \u201cblackface\u201d (l. 7) which is a word loaded with racist connotations. The negative \ntones of this is further enhanced by the use of the des criptors: \u201cexaggerated red lips\u201d and \n\u201cgold hoops\u201d (l. 7) This also creates a three -part list which has two functions: firstly, it creates \nthe idea of completeness, meaning that the writer is implying that this is reason enough to \nsupport U.N. Committee\u2019s r equest even though this is not a comprehensive list of the reasons \nthe tradition might be racist. Secondly, the whole argument is summarized here in a way that \nis easy to remember since it has been simplified into concrete characteristics.  \n \nThe function of  the sixth paragraph is also more informative, but it gives an expressive image \nof the discussion regarding the tradition. The author describes Black Pete as \u201cfodder\u201d and the \ndiscussion as a \u201cculture war\u201d (l. 28). These are both harsh words with strong con notations. \nThe author is equating the discussion to a real war  which indicates a battle presumably \nbetween only two different points of view. In a war one is always either for or against, there is \nno 'in between'. In addition, it is described as a war of \u2018 culture\u2019 which is a wide and important \nsubject that concerns every human -being. This could be understood as a simplification of the \nPage 38 of  56 \n case but is still pointing out importance . By using the noun \u201cfodder\u201d she is also showing how \nthis character is just a small  part of a big discussion and will only fuel it.  \n \nAnother way that the author underlines the tone of the article is by using the verb \u201cget rid of\u201d \n(l. 5) in the first paragraph, which implies that the tradition is unequivocally a problem. This is \nreported speech and therefore might simply be the author's interpretations of U.N\u2019s request \nbut it still suggests that they are not just asking them to stop portraying \u2018Black Pete\u2019 but that \nthey get rid of him all together and this enforces the serious tone and imp ortance of the \nsubject.  \n \nEarly in the article the author uses direct speech to relay how the Dutch government \ndescribes the discussion regarding racism as \u201cuncomfortable\u201d (l. 18).  \nFirst of all the author denies responsibility for claiming the discussion i s \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 but \notherwise she stays neutral in terms of whether she thinks that is true. It is only later in the \narticle that she argues that the discussion on, for instance, social media has been \u201cmore unruly \nthan uncomfortable\u201d (l. 38 -39). This fun ctions as a counterargument to the aforementioned \nquote (l. 18) by using an example of how the discussion before has been \u2018unruly\u2019 and not \n\u2018uncomfortable\u2019. That it is something that has already happened is indicated by the past tense \nof the verb \u2018engaged\u2019.  This is followed by quotes from both sides of the discussion which might \nimply that the author is placing responsibility for the current negative state of the discussion \non both sides, since neither of them have shown that they can have a rational discuss ion. \nAdditionally these two sentences (l. 16 -18, 38 -39) also function respectively as concessive - \nand negated opposition. In the first quote it is made clear, that even though the Dutch \ngovernment has dismissed \u201c (...) the idea of banning the character (.. .)\u201d (l. 18) they are still \nwilling to discuss it. Here the author is positive towards the actions of the Dutch government \nand shows it by subtly saying that they are not racist, just because they did not ban the \ncharacter. In the latter (l. 38 -39) a contra st is made between how the Dutch government \ndescribes it and how it factually is (according to the author), i.e. it is \u201cunruly\u201d not \n\u201cuncomfortable\u201d. By doing this the author takes a negative stance towards the Dutch \ngovernment's argument, not that she is n ecessarily arguing that they are in fact racist, but \nmore that they are using poor excuses.  \nPage 39 of  56 \n  \nThe author also utilizes this use of opposites in the fifth paragraph, but here it functions more \nas an attempt to really show the negative aspects of the Black Pe te character by comparing \nhim to another character who attends the Christmas celebration, St. Nicholas. It starts of by \nnaming the character by its dutch name \u2018Zwarte Piet\u2019 and how he \u201caccompanies\u201d St. Nicholas \n(l. 23 -24). That the author uses the verb \u2018ac companies\u2019 in describing so is interesting because \nit might imply a relationship of equals but the rest of the paragraph gives an opposing image. \nFirstly St. Nicholas is described as \u201calways [portrayed by] a white man in a red suit (...) [and \nhe] arrives o n horseback\u201d (l. 25 -26) which might not have a negative function in itself, but in \nrelation to the last part of the sentence, the function changes. The second part of the sentence \ndescribes how Pete \u201cwalks alongside distributing candy\u201d and he is also named  as \u201chis servant\u201d \n(l. 26 -27). This creates a strong contrast to the first part. The function of both the first and \nsecond sentence is therefore to create opposites through the use of parallelism. The first \nsentence is neutral in the sense that the relation ship is indicated through the use of the verb \n\u2018accompanied\u2019 and the second sentence is negative because it shows a shift in relationship \nwhere one walks and another rides on horseback. One could argue that this is a \npresupposition on part of the author, i. e. just because someone is walking and another one is \nriding a horse does not necessarily mean that one is subordinate to the other.  \n \nThe author does not only use opposites in her attempt to influence the reader with her \nideology but also comparisons. Ther e is an example of this in the tenth paragraph. The debate \nsurrounding Black Pete is described with the modifier \u201cemotional\u201d (l. 42) which helps magnify \nthe significance of this debate and this is further supported when the author equates this with \n\u201cthis o ne character\u201d (l. 42). When she puts these two as equals she helps strengthen the idea \nthat this has a huge impact on the Dutch.  \n \nIn order to make her point clear the author also prioritizes in the text. This is the case in the \nlast sentence of the second paragraph: \u201cIt urged the Netherlands to \u2018actively promote the \nelimination\u2019 of the racial stereotyping.\u201d (l. 13 -15). This does not only function as a way of \nsummarising the committee\u2019s statement, but also as a way of reinforcing the important part of \nthe ar gument. This shows how the writer is prioritising information and how, by ending the \nPage 40 of  56 \n paragraph with a summarisation, the writer makes sure that the reader remembers the \nimportant parts. Furthermore, she makes use of the verb \u2018urge\u2019 once more and the buzzwo rd \n\u201cracial stereotyping\u201d which is an effective way of enforcing the message of the first part of the \narticle.  \nThe author also does this in the eleventh paragraph (l. 45 -51) where she ends it with \ndescribing the goal of this change and how the character sho uld eventually resemble \n\u201csomeone who had climbed through a chimney\u201d (l. 50 -51). By using this example it shows that \nshe prioritises the compromise of not getting rid of the tradition but just changing it. This is a \nneutral way to end the article.  \n \nThrough out the article there are also several examples of the author assuming or implying \nthings, whether they are intentional or not is not clear, but they are nonetheless important to \nmention.  \nIn the beginning of the article Black Pete is described as a \u201cpopula r children\u2019s character\u201d (l. 5). \nThis description presupposes firstly that Black Pete is a character existing for the enjoyment \nof children, and secondly, that he is a popular one.  \nBy doing so, the writer is creating a strong incentive for the reader to ag ree with the argument \nthat it should stop. The noun \u2018children\u2019 creates connotations to innocence, purity and \nsomething one should aim to protect. When the character is described with the noun \u2018racism\u2019, \nwhich has a lot of negative connotations, it serves to  underline the point that they are \noppositions that should not be intertwined. Therefore it functions as a sort of \u2018think of the \nchildren\u2019 -trigger and helps to create support for the writer's ideology.  \n \nThis also happens in the seventh paragraph. It is a brief paragraph and consists mostly of \nreported speech. The interesting thing to note though, is how the author describes the cited \nperson: \u201cMr. Asscher spoke carefully\u201d (l. 33). Here the modifier \u2018carefully\u2019 functions as a way \nof describing the sensitivit y to the issue, while also being an interpretation of his manner of \nspeech. That the author uses this modifier might also imply that her conviction is in line with \nthis and that one has to be careful what they say when one discusses subjects like this.  \nPage 41 of  56 \n Further along in the article it is stated that the argument is about: \u201cthe limits of \nmulticulturalism in Dutch society\u201d (l. 43 -44). This is a presupposition and is her attempt to \ncreate a scenario where the statement is true.  \n \nThe author is consistently usin g either reported - or direct speech in order to relay the \narguments from both sides of this discussion. Some of them have already been mentioned, but \nthere are several more and they all enable the author to avoid responsibility for what is said \nin the arti cle.  \nThis happens in the majority of the paragraphs where they start off by naming the actor and \nby extension of this the source of the statement. For example in the first paragraph where the \ndescription of the actor as \u201cA United Nations committee\u201d (l. 4)  is followed by their statement \nand functions as reported speech. Here the writer is disclaiming responsibility for what is said \nand places it on the U.N. Committee.  \nIn the next paragraph the author uses direct speech and quotes the U.N Committee directly  by \nusing quotation marks (l. 10 -13). Basically, this has the same function as reported speech, that \nis, denying responsibility for the statement but stronger since it is exactly how and what they \nsaid.  \nThe author makes use of direct - and reported speech several times throughout the article and \nthe way it is used in the fourth paragraph is interesting to note:  \n\u201cThe Dutch are already reinventing the way they portray the controversial character, said \nLodewijk Asscher (...)\u201d (l. 19 -20). The first interesting word to note is \u201creinventing\u201d which \nfunctions as a way to represent it as an action and something that is already happening. \nAdditionally this also aims to create support for the actor. This is followed by the description \nof the character as \u2018controversial \u2019 (l. 20), which is ubiquitous in terms of functions. First of all \nwe do not know if it is the author\u2019s description or the cited person\u2019s since it is a part of a \nsentence that also functions as reported speech, indicated by the verb \u2018said\u2019 (l. 20). Therefo re \nit might just be a way of disclaiming responsibility, but if it is the author\u2019s choice of words \nthen it is very interesting since it is the first time the author directly describes the tradition. \nThis is a very cautious and neutral way to describe the t radition and shows how the author \ntakes strides so as to not offend anyone, perhaps even by placing the responsibility on the \ncited person, even though he might not have said it. Afterwards the cited person is further \nPage 42 of  56 \n named: \u201cminister for social affairs an d employment\u201d (l. 20 -21), which helps strengthen the \ncredibility of him and in extension of this the claim that the tradition is \u2018controversial\u2019. This is \nfollowed by another use of direct speech, this time indicated by quotation marks, which shows \na more h umorous perspective on how a reinterpretation of the Black Pete character meant \nthat they were orange instead (l. 21 -22). This functions as a way of lightening the mood and \nmight even create connotations to oompa loompas since they are also comical and goo fy \ncharacters.  \n \nOne of the ways to create a good flow in the text and make sure that the reader understands \nwhat is being said and by whom, is to continually position themselves in regards to who is \ntalking. This is done in almost every paragraph of the ar ticle and often functions in \ncoordination with reported - or direct speech. The actor in the headline is named \u201cU.N.\u201d which \nis, as mentioned before, its formal name and a name most people know. This means that the \nreader will have an easier time relating to  the situation since most people will have an idea of \nwho they are and what they stand for. The author slowly elaborates on the actor in the article \nwhere U.N. is named respectively as \u201cA United Nations committee (...)\u201d (l. 4) and \u201cThe United \nNations Commi ttee on the Eliminations of Racial Discrimination (...)\u201d (l. 8 -9). By doing this the \nauthor is placing the following statements away from her own deictic center and effectively \nshowing the reader that this is something that someone else is saying and not t he author \nherself.  \nThe author also utilises this distancing technique when describing the arguments from the \nother side of the discussion, i.e. \u201cThe Dutch government\u201d (l. 16), \u201cThe Dutch\u201d (l. 19) and \u201cMr. \nAsscher\u201d (l. 33). This works in collaboration with reported - and direct speech in order to \nenforce the authors unaccountability for what is being said. By doing this the author is not \nonly showing who the speaker is but also at what time they spoke, or an event took place. This \nis the case in the last para graph of the article where the author writes about how several \nDutch institutions have already tried to remove some of the negative aspects of the tradition, \nwhich is done by placing the deictic center in the past with \u201cEarlier this month\u201d (l. 45) and \nther eby showing that this has already happened. Here, the character is described as just \n\u201cPete\u201d (l. 46) and not \u2018Black Pete\u201d and that he will now wear \u201cgold makeup\u201d (l. 46 -47). The \nsecond sentence places the deictic center further back in the past: \u201cIn 2013\u201d ( l. 47). Here \u2018Pete\u2019 \nPage 43 of  56 \n is described as \u201cPete without golden earrings\u201d (l. 48) and shows another attempt to remove \nthe more negative aspects of the tradition. The significance of this is enforced by use of the \nmodifier \u201cofficial\u201d (l. 47) which creates the noti on that this is not just something that \nhappened once and that capable people are willing to change the tradition. This is further \nenforced with the naming of the actor in the last sentence as \u201ccity officials\u201d (l. 48 -49) and that \nthey will continue changin g the character in order to remove its inherent racist implications.  \n \nThe author of this article is very careful in describing the tradition and the people criticizing \nit. Every time the tradition is described in a negative or positive manner it is throug h the use \nof reported - or direct speech so as not to have any responsibility for what is said. The author \nis mostly trying to be neutral but it is clear that most of the arguments are against the \ntradition. The majority of the arguments that are not direct ly against the tradition are the \nones that argue that the changing of such an old tradition takes time. This seems to represent \nthe main message of the article: that the tradition needs to change, but that the opposition \nneeds to be patient while it happen s \n \n3.4 Article 4: Washington Post  \nThe article, \u201cThe Dutch are slowly recognizing that their tradition of Black Pete is both racist \nand weird\u201c by Ishaan Tharoor, chooses to complicate the matter in different ways \u2013 for \ninstance, through naming and describi ng. The first sentence is as follows: \u201cOver multiple years \nnow, WorldViews has run stories about the problematic Dutch tradition of Zwarte Piet.\u201d (l. 1 -\n2). \nHere the case is presented to have been discussed over a longer period. It is not limited to a \nnumbe r of years, but \u2018over multiple years\u2019. This is led by the phrase: \u2018the problematic \n[tradition]\u2019, where \u2018the\u2019 decides the case as something that is already well -known, \n\u2018problematic\u2019 strengthens the purpose for discussion, and the phrase heightens the idea o f \nimportance. This is emphasised by the following sentence which states that it involves a \n\u2018myriad\u2019 of people: \u201c(\u2026) myriad Dutch adults and childre n [attend this tradition]\u201d (l. 9 -10).  \nBlack Pete as a figure, is also described in a way that problematises the  matter. In the main \nhead -line, the character is directly described as being \u201c(\u2026) racist and weird\u201d. To directly state \nPage 44 of  56 \n that Pete is racist is a strong claim. This is toned down with the use of \u2018weird\u2019 which is a \nweaker accusation. It is a word often used i n the understanding of being \u2018funny\u2019 or used \ntogether as in \u2018funny and weird\u2019, but here, because of the word that comes before, the \nconnotation is without doubt negative. Black Pete is also portrayed as \u201c(\u2026) the trickste r \nfigure, they say (...)\u201d (l. 1 8-19) wh ich can have the negative connotation of being a \u2018fraud\u2019. \nThese choices stand in contrast to the idea of Black Pete being enjoyable and the tradition \nbeing amusing.  \nBlack Pete is described as a \u2018helper of Sinterklaas or Saint Nicholas\u2019, as opposed to, for  \ninstance, as \u2018companion to\u2019. The difference is essential. \u2019Helpers of someone\u2019 can come across \nas if the helpers are subjected to the one they are helping, whereas \u2018companion\u2019 means to have \ninfluence on equal terms. This choice is in accordance with the t radition being racist.  \nThe article uses negation to emphasise its argument: \u201c(\u2026) many people think the tradition is \nracist \u2014 one that is shaped by the country's not -so-distant colonial past and trades on gar ish \nracial stereotypes.\u201d (l. 13 -15). Here, \u2018not -so-distant\u2019 with its negation tries to accommodate \nthe presumed presupposition of the reader: that the days of slavery were a long time ago \n(more than 150 years) and should not have any or much impact today. The argument here, \nhowever, is that it is not far away and therefore still has influence.  \n\u201cOthers, including a significant proportion of the Dut ch public, are less sure.\u201d (l. 16 ). Here the \nphrase \u2018less sure\u2019 is quite an underestimate of the real situation. It implies firstly, that the \nDutch public is in d oubt, and secondly, that they are close to being sure. It creates the image of \na Dutch majority weighing the matter which is incorrect. In general, it is problematic to use a \ndefinition like \u2018less sure\u2019. To be in doubt is a state of mind that is inaccessib le to others unless \nthe state of mind is directly articulated which is not the case here. A quotation is simply \nmissing. We know that the Dutch follow this tradition despite other opinions. This action must \nreflect a prevailing positive attitude towards it  because participation in this tradition is \nvoluntary.  \nIn regards to implicit arguments, this article makes a correlation between people and \npoliticians, and makes it evident that the tradition should be seen as racist: \u201cFor reasons that \nare both obvious and complicated, many people think the tradition is racist (...)\u201d (l. 13 -14). \nThis is a presupposition implying that obvious reasons exist and that despite these \nPage 45 of  56 \n complicated reasons, there are people who still think the tradition is racist. It is problematic \nto use the word \u2018people\u2019 in this respect, because it is not stated what exact people are being \nreferred to. And when in other parts of the article there is reference to \u2018the Dutch people\u2019, the \npeople concerned, this is confusing. On the other hand, \u2018people\u2019  used in general like this, gives \nthe impression that this concerns a lot of people, rather than just the Dutch people who in that \nsense come across as an irrational minority.  \nIn the next section, the Dutch people are also portrayed as not having a free w ill or not having \na shared, clear -cut opinion for or against the tradition: \u201cAround Christmastime, myriad Dutch \nadults and children have customarily donned frilly wigs, patted themselves in blackface, \npainted their lips red and japed around in costumes as \u2018Black Pete,\u2019 (\u2026)\u201d (l. 9 -11). \n\u2018Customarily\u2019 is a biased word, and here it takes away the power of the people who follow the \ntradition as if they were forced to do so. One must presume that they have their own power of \nwill and can judge for themselves what is okay and what is not. This quote disregards the fact \nthat the Dutch must consider some amusement to this tradition since they keep following it.  \nThe implicit argument here, is that the Dutch do not have any self -determination, and \ntherefore they must be  suppressed by something or somebody, i.e. the politicians, whom are \nin control of whether this tradition is allowed or not and also how it is celebrated. In this \nsense, the politicians come across as dictating what the people are allowed to do, and have \nsubstantial control over them. This is an unfair statement because the Netherlands has \ndemocracy and power is shared by politicians and the people. \u201cDutch politicians have largely \ntried to dismiss controversy surrounding Zwarte Piet as inconsequential, but one's attitude \nabout such blackface antics is increasingly part of a political fault  line in the country.\u201d (l. 43 -\n45). Here the reason for the people\u2019s attitude is directly given: the politicians. The issue here \nhowever, is that attitudes are personal and cannot necessarily be changed by other people\u2019s \nopinions, i.e. a people does not equal its politicians.  \nThe article ends quite abruptly, focusing on the fact that some Dutch politicians have the \nintention to change the tradition. One could make the connect ion that because some \npoliticians are concerned with the matter, the Dutch in general are, as written in the head -\nline: \u201c(...) slowly recognizing that their blackface tradition of Zwarte Piet is racist (\u2026)\u201d. \nHowever, the rest of the argument is simply miss ing. The assumption is made that it is \ncommon sense and it is therefore not necessary to mention it directly. The fault in the \nPage 46 of  56 \n argumentation is that politicians and a people do not equal each other. The situation is also \nbilateral, since the article states  that the situation, as of now, is that there are still different \nopinions between the politicians in the Netherlands as well as for the Dutch people.  \nRegarding the matter of black people\u2019s attitude towards the tradition, it is stated that: \u201cEven \nminoritie s in the Netherlands embrace the  tradition, some say.\u201d (l. 19 -20). \u2018Even\u2019 implies that \nit is malplaced when minorities do so, and that it obviously should be criticized. This again, \ngives the idea that the Dutch people as a whole are in the wrong. In addit ion, it is problematic \nto use the word minorities here because the discussion is only regarding one particular \nminority -group, i.e. black people. And if black people do not feel offended, the tradition is \nsomewhat harmless.  \nIn spite of this, the article a lso states the opposing view: \u201c\u2019Many children of colour say they \nexperience discrimination in their daily lives and that it is worse around the time of \nSinterklaas ,\u2019 the report states.\u201d (l. 39 -40). If there are children of colour who feel \ndiscriminated, an d if there is a correlation between this experience and the tradition, this \nseems a strong argument against the Black Pete tradition. However, the argument is somehow \nweek, using the relative \u2018many\u2019 and the personal \u2018experience\u2019 which are undefinable terms . \nThe question of how many and what exact experiences they have, are prominent in this issue \n\u2013 and in order to make a strong argumentation. Of course, some black people today might feel \nsome kind of discrimination, but how severe, how many, and when and wh y are questions to \nbe taken into account. These parameters are not sufficient. It is difficult to investigate \nsomething as individual attitudes and experiences without doing any concrete research.  \nThe article in general lacks references, and the choice of words and construction of arguments \nare problematic. It also functions as a second source with references to other sources for a lot \nof the argumentation which obviously means that information is left out.  \nIn many ways, the article emphasises the idea that  tradition is going from being legal to being \nabolished. It communicates the idea that things are about to change. The title, \u201cThe Dutch are \nslowly recognizing that their tradition of Black Pete is both racist and weird\u201d, shows this \nindication as well as t he purpose of the article. Here a state of movement in the Dutch people\u2019s \nexperience is described, which results in the hypothesis that the Dutch people could end up in \ndirect opposition to the tradition which, in turn, could lead to an abolition of the tr adition.  \nPage 47 of  56 \n A hypothesis of what could happen in such a likely situation is for instance stated with the \nelaboration of the concrete idea of building a museum: \u201c(\u2026) a burgeoning leftist, pro -\nimmigrant party has called for a wider Dutch reckoning with the nat ion's multicultural \nidentity that would include a museum about the history of slavery as well as the abolition of \nthe b lack minstrel figure.\u201d (l. 48 -51). The article also suggests an answer which seems to be a \ncompromise of both opponent\u2019s opinions: \u201cChang ing the long -standing characteristics of \nZwarte Piet would enable all children to \u2018experience the j oy of the tradition\u2019.\u201d (l. 40 -42).  \n \nThis article is contributing to the discourse of Black Pete being racist but also shows that \ndivided opinions exist. In spite of the articles title and overarching proposition, it is difficult to \nsay something generally valid about attitudes towards the tradition of Black Pete. It would \ninclude a large study of interviews and investigations because attitudes are personal an d \ncomplex.  \n \n3.5 The Articles Compared  \nIn this section we will look at all four articles in comparison to each other. For the sake of \nreadability, we will name each article the same way we did in the data -chapter, with the \nnumbers 1 -4. We will look at the articles in connection to pivotal subjects and where we see \nsimilarities or variations in the analysis. This will provide an overview of vital points.  \nBoth article 1, 3 and 4 state the overall argument that the tradition of Black Pete is \ndiscriminating, w here article 2 is more ambivalent in its statement. All articles use negative \nbuzz -words like \u201cracist\u201d, \u201cblackface\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d, and represent the negative point of view in \nthe discussion. While article 2 seems to have the intention only to write about som ething \ncontroversial for its newspaper to create sensation, the other articles seem to have the \nunequivocal intention to patronize. However, the articles differ in how this is done. Both \narticle 3 and 4 try to represent both the opinion for or against the tradition because of it being \nracist, and describes it as a two -sided issue. Both try to give the impression of being neutral \nand to show both sides of the case. Article 2 is more indistinct and describes both the tradition \nin positive, negative and neutra l terms and in that sense gives, a three -sided story. Article 1 \nPage 48 of  56 \n gives a personal point of view on the tradition and is in that sense has a complex perception \non the tradition, even though her view is explicitly negative.  \nIn general, the articles\u2019 lack sour ces and are biased in relation to who says what. In 2 and 4, \nthe sources are missing all together and what could be useful, like direct quotes is left out. In 1 \nand 4 it is difficult to know who says what because article 1 is written from a subjective poin t \nof view, whereas 4 has another source to refer to, U.N., which makes the author understood in \nrelation to the organisation but can also make it unclear whether it is the author or the \ninstitution who says what. This article nonetheless seems to be trustw orthy with references \nand it uses direct speech. In relation to evidence, article 2, 3 and 4 have second -sources to \nwhat other people involved have said as well as polls, whereas article 1 has as the only article, \na subjective view -point which in that sens e, makes the view more valid when it comes to \nobjective of investigation. While one cannot question the validity of other\u2019s feelings, due to \ntheir subjective nature, you can question if they are reasonable. One could say that article 3 \nand 4 try to argue t hrough rational arguments while article 1 uses pathos. In article 1 the \npoint of view is subjective, the quotes and references can be slanted and her reactions \nquestioned. In addition, the other articles, to a higher degree, need to have clear references \nand evidence regarding their quotes and inequities.  \nIt is also important to note that article 1, is the only one that has the viewpoint of a black \nperson and is in that sense, related to the discussion in a way that is different from the others. \nIt seems to  play an important role that the author of article 1 is black because this is the \narticle that is the most negative. However, it is somewhat difficult to say something about the \ntradition according to black people in general from it, when she is the only s ource.  \nEvery author is from another country than the Netherlands and have not grown up there. In \nthat sense, none of them, barring Fadahunsi, are targets of the ridicule that the tradition \npresents and none of them have grown up with this tradition or hav e any personal relation to \nit. Based on this, it is interesting to notice how the Dutch people and their government, in the \narticles, are presented as inferior. In article 1, the Dutch are seen as not as developed a \ncountry as the U.K. and in article 4, as  an irrational minority in opposition to people in general.  \nAll articles agree that the main problem with the tradition is how the character is portrayed \nand that as it is now, because of its traits, is offensive. It is different from article to article h ow \nPage 49 of  56 \n the character of Black Pete is described. In article 1, it is very negative, with descriptions such \nas \u201cSanta\u2019s mean sidekicks\u201d and \u201cblack servants\u201d, while article 3 and 4 describe the character \nin a more positive light but still as inferior: as a \u201chelp er of\u201d or someone who \u201caccompanies\u201d \nSaint Nicholas. Article 2 is self -contradictory, using both \u201csidekick\u201d and \u201cpal\u201d.  \nWhen it comes to the intentions of the people involved, article 1 describes the tradition as \nsomething that the people are doing as an act  which is a strong way of showing opinions, i.e. \npresenting the tradition as an act committed against an implied victim. Article 4 describes it \nmore like something that is done because of custom or because of the politicians which means \nwithout intention, and article 2 and 3 state that celebrating this tradition is not due to spiteful \nintentions.  \nIt is also different what solutions, the articles present and how. Article 4 offers the \ncompromise of wanting to change the character\u2019s traits but still keep the t radition, where \narticle 3 starts out by wanting to \u201cget rid of\u201d the character completely to end up arguing that \njust changing it would be sufficient. In article 1 it seems more as if the author is forced to \naccept the tradition if it is not changed or elim inated, which is definitely something that she \ncannot accept, as if it were the only possibility. Article 2 focuses on showing the different sides \nof the case, but does not suggest any solutions.  \nHaving laid bare the discourses of the articles, the questio n is now whether these discourses \ncontribute to a constructive debate or leads to a stagnation of the discussion.  \n  \nPage 50 of  56 \n 4.0 Conclusion  \nThe purpose of the project was to examine the way the selected articles from Britain and USA \ncovered the Black Pete tradition a nd how this coverage both creates and sustains discourses \non discrimination. Based on this, we wanted to look at these discourses comparatively and \ndiscuss potential differences. Originally, we had sought to answer our, admittedly optimistic, \nhypothesis of  historical differences between the two nations. However, while not actively \ndisproved, this hypothesis cannot be validated on the basis of our analysis.  \n \nIn describing the tradition the articles make use of several tools. The authors use buzz -words \nwith negative connotations in order to criticise the tradition. All the articles build their \npremises on the presupposition that the tradition is racist, rather than attempt to weigh the \nissue and let the reader decide. Furthermore, it is clear that the authors  are prioritising \ninformation in order to focus on the negative aspects of the tradition, thereby promoting their \nideology, further cementing its hegemonic status.  \nThey use either arguments that are rational or emotive and try to be either neutral, person al, \nor a combination of the two. However, they all come across as presenting the tradition in a \nprevalently unfavourable way, which neglects other views on the case, describing it as \ndiscriminating. In that sense, there is a tendency within the covered art icles, that instead of \nresolving or discussing the matter in a constructive manner, they end up further \ndisambiguating the discussion and thereby sustaining an undesirable situation.  \n \n  \nPage 51 of  56 \n 5.0 Discussion  \nThis chapter will discuss the underlying ideology of the  authors in question based on the \ndiscourses prevalent in the articles. Additionally, we will discuss how the concept of political \ncorrectness dictates how the authors present their arguments.  \n \n5.1 Black Pete and the Discourse on Racism  \nWhether any given s ubject can be considered racist or not must be a matter of consensus. If \nenough people agree that it is, then it will be so. To put it another way, it is a matter of \nsubjectivity. This is exemplified so clearly in the case of the Black Pete controversy. On  the one \nhand, we see a substantial opposition to it in Western media, but on the other we seemingly \nhave the majority of a nation supporting the tradition. The question is then, if this is a case of \nconflicting ideologies. Perhaps the Dutch have a much br oader margin for what they consider \nracist, or perhaps the papers in question were a bit too quick to pass judgement. Ideologically \nspeaking, it is hard to imagine that the general Dutch public would uphold their tradition out \nof spite, recognising the rac ist implications, but simply not caring. Indeed, as we have seen \nfrom the articles, the Dutch do not perceive the tradition as racist, to paraphrase the oft \nquoted poll from 2013. As such, it is not necessarily a matter of the Dutch believing that \nracism i s acceptable, nor necessarily a disagreement as to what in general constitutes racism, \nbut simply that they consider this particular subject to not be overtly, or problematically, \nracist.  \nThus, we believe that the Dutch cannot be considered a racist peopl e, at least not based on \nthis subject alone, but rather they simply ascribe a wealth of positive connotations to the \ntradition that, while not necessarily blinding them, does make it hard for them to recognise \nthe issue. As such, while there may be a diffe rence of ideology at work, it is not a matter of an \noverall ideology, but merely one pertaining to this specific tradition. To emphasise, we believe \nthat the controversy springs from a difference between the Dutch populace\u2019s background \nknowledge of the tra dition and that of the authors in question, rather than an ideologically \nbased condoning of racism in general.  \nOn the subject of racism in relation to the tradition, one could ask the very same question that \nFisayo Fadahunsi poses in the Huffington Article : is it the intention behind the act, or the act \nPage 52 of  56 \n in itself that constitutes the racism? If an action is perceived as racist by the opposing party, \nbut not in any way by the actor, one could ask who is truly accountable.  \nCase in point, not many years ago th e US legalised same -sex marriage. This sparked a great \ndeal of debate across all kinds of media. A general sentiment among those who applauded the \nact was that if anyone had a problem with, for instance, two men marrying each other that \nwas their problem a lone, not the couple in question\u2019s. Similarly, if someone finds a tradition \nlike Black Pete offensive, one could question if it is anyone\u2019s problem but their own. We are \nnot taking a stance for either viewpoint here, we are merely trying to shed some light  on what \nmakes the issue multifaceted. Obviously, the case of Black Pete is different in that it entails the \ndanger of systematically condoning racism, amongst other issues, but this sort of discussion \nis, we believe, necessary to promote a constructive de bate that has the potential of solving the \nissue to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.  \nWhile there seems to be, within the Netherlands, a hegemonic ideology whereby Black Pete is \nseen as innocent, in the articles we have analysed, it seems clear th at an opposing ideology \nholds the hegemonic status. The presupposition put forth in both Huffington Post, the Daily \nStar and the Washington Post is a dangerous one. It reinforces the idea that the tradition is \nracist without letting the reader make up thei r own mind, or at least, they do not go to any \ngreat lengths to do so.  \nIf one goes out and proclaims that \u2018Black Pete is racist and should be outlawed\u2019, they are \ncontributing to the same sort of polarising discourse that the political right is often accuse d of \nwhen they make similar generalising statements. Discursively, there is no difference between \nthe aforementioned utterance and a statement such as \u2018Muslims are bad and should go back \nhome\u2019. Both are, as mentioned, generalising, polarising and unnuanced . They are discourses of \nconflict that in no way contribute to solving of the issue.  \nIn conclusion we are not saying that the tradition is unproblematic in terms of racism. On the \ncontrary, it is a complex issue with a dangerous array of racist overtones. What we are saying, \nand hope to have proved by now, is that the language used in some of these articles does \nnothing to promote a healthy and constructive debate on the subject. Quite the opposite, it \ncreates a confrontational environment that only makes t he issue harder to solve.  \n \n \nPage 53 of  56 \n 5.2 Political Correctness  \nThe subject of racism is a tricky one and discussing it through a public medium like a blog or \nnewspaper can be difficult and we therefore thought it prudent to discuss how this is shown \nin the four a rticles that we have analysed.  \nThe articles show different levels of how freely they dare discuss whether the tradition is \nracist or not. The article from the New York Times is cautious not to make any claims in this \nregard, only daring to call it \u2018contro versial\u2019, and even then it is not clear if this is the writer\u2019s \nor a source\u2019s word. The articles from the Daily Star and Washington Post are somewhat less \ncautious, going as far as directly calling it racist, while the Huffington post article is the most \ncondemning towards the tradition, having no qualms criticising it. This is interesting \nconsidering how one must often \u2018thread the needle\u2019 when discussing racism. Given the \nmedium of the Huffington article, that of a blog, the author is given a lot more leew ay in \ndiscussing the subject from a personal point of view.  Additionally, the author of the Huffington \nPost, Fadahunsi, is black, and identifies herself as such, while the Daily Star author is \ncaucasian and the last two are of indian descent, which could ar guably have had an impact. As \nsuch, Fadahunsi is part of the minority that is being ridiculed by the tradition, meaning that \nshe is entitled to feel offended or at least that is how she feels. This is something she utilises \nthroughout her text, emphasising  her role as a victim and thereby giving credence to her \ncondemning the tradition. The fact that the other authors do not choose to write this way \nabout the tradition may have something to do with the hegemonic discourse of racism that \nexists in society to day. We believe it is fair to say that racism is, in general, thought of as \n\u2018something white people do to black people\u2019 and usually not the other way around. So by not \nbeing part of the minority in question, the authors may well feel that they have no righ t to \nexpress whether or not they themselves think it is racist. Hence, they can either write in \nsupport of the minority or write an article so saturated by quotes that the author cannot be \nheld accountable for any opinion expressed. This is the case with t he New York Times article \nwhere the author subtly argues that the tradition is racist by always using quotes when \ndefending the tradition. This is not necessarily surprising, as the New York Times is known to \nbe somewhat noncommittal in discussing such mat ters because of the fear of \u2018opening a can of \nworms\u2019. This mentality arguably functions as a part of a process of stagnation, because the \nhegemonic ideology is borrowed from the minority, and any would -be new inputs are \nPage 54 of  56 \n suppressed to the point where they a re compatible with said ideology. So it is that we see this \nprocess as partly preventing a constructive debate on the subject and, in doing so, reinforcing \nand sustaining this hegemonic discourse. Additionally, as we have stated, this promotes an \u2018us \nversu s them\u2019 mentality instead of striving to create an objective debate.  \nThe problem here, that the authors in some sense seem to be aware of, is how they, by taking \nup this whole discussion, complicate black people\u2019s position in this. Hence, they portray blac k \npeople in general as being more sensitive in this regard and thereby uphold the discourse of \nblack people as being an outsider -group.  \n  \nPage 55 of  56 \n 6.0 Bibliography  \n \nBooks:  \n\u2022 Fairclough, N (2010).

It was held in a hybrid format, with some participants on-site in\nDagstuhl and most others joining remotely via the video conferencing system Zoom.\nIn order to maximize discussion and allow the interests of the group to drive the direction\nof the seminar, we did not plan for formal talks. Participants were asked to prepare a single\nslide, few-minute introduction about their research interests and methodologies related to\ndigital disinformation, and a \u201cburning question\u201d they have in the space.\nExcept where otherwise noted, content of this report is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons BY 4.0 International license\nDigital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation, Dagstuhl Reports , Vol. 11, Issue 09, pp.\n28\u201344\nEditors: Claude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner\nDagstuhl Reports\nSchloss Dagstuhl \u2013 Leibniz-Zentrum f\u00fcr Informatik, Dagstuhl Publishing, Germany\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 29\nParticipants included the following individuals, spanning a range of expertise from\ncomputer science to law:\nEsma A\u00efmeur (University of Montr\u00e9al, Canada)\nJos Baeten (CWI Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nAsia Biega (Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, Germany)\nCamille Darche (CNPEN, Inria and Universit\u00e9 Paris Nanterre, France)\nS\u00e9bastien Gambs (Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Canada)\nKrishna Gummadi (Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany)\nClaude Kirchner (CNPEN/CCNE and Inria, France)\nVladimir Kropotov (Trend Micro, Russia)\nJean-Yves Marion (Lorraine University, France)\nEvangelos Markatos (University of Crete, Greece)\nFil Menczer (Indiana University, USA)\nTrisha Meyer (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium)\nFranziska Roesner (University of Washington, USA)\nKav\u00e9 Salamatian (University of Savoie, France)\nJuliette S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (University of Lille, France)\nDimitrios Serpanos (University of Patras, Greece)\nSerena Villata (CNRS, France)\nBased on our preliminary discussions, we identified four topics of interest to many\nseminar participants: trustworthiness algorithms (i.e., how to build systems that assess\ntrust automatically), friction as a technique in platform design (e.g., to allow for people\nto take time and a step back when consuming information on social media), the ethics of\ninterventions (e.g., the ethics of blocking or content moderation), and how to educate users\n(e.g., without creating over-skepticism). We then structured the rest of the seminar around\nfour deep-dive conversations on these topics, described in the subsequent sections of this\nreport. Due to the relatively small size of the gathering, and most participants\u2019 broad interest\nin all four topics, we did not break out into smaller discussion groups but rather continued\nto discuss as a full group.\n21402\n30 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\n2 Table of Contents\nExecutive Summary\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28\nDeep Dive 1: Trustworthiness Algorithms\nReflections on Truth versus Trustworthiness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\nAssessing Trustworthiness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\nTechnical Approaches . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\nReflections on Harms from Untrustworthy Content . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\nChallenging Trustworthiness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34\nDeep Dive 2: Friction as a Technique in Platform Design\nArgument for Friction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34\nExamples and Proposals for Friction in Platform Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\nPractical and Ethics Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\nLooking Ahead . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\nDeep Dive 3: Ethics of Interventions\nWhich ethics for which purpose? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\nWhat values are behind moderation tools? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\nHow can ethics committees help governing social media platforms? . . . . . . . . . 39\nDeep Dive 4: User Education\nRole of User Education . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\nCharacterizing Education Efforts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\nConclusion and Looking Ahead . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41\nParticipants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\nRemote Participants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 31\n3 Deep Dive 1: Trustworthiness Algorithms\nOur first deep dive conversation focused on the question of how to build systems that assess\ntrustworthiness automatically.\n3.1 Reflections on Truth versus Trustworthiness\nHelping people to understand the information they have access to in the digital world\ncould be facilitated by algorithms designed to check veracity of statements, to detect\nincorrect statements, or to find inconsistencies in a given set of knowledge. While automated\nmis/disinformation algorithms are often framed in terms of such fact-checking, seminar\nparticipants repeatedly made the observation that assessing truth can be challenging.\nAutomating truth assertion is difficult since the level of specification of a statement to\ncheck can vary from formal (as in 2 + 2 = 4 ) to nearly formal (as in \u201c 2 + 2 = four\u201d) to\nimprecise and complex (such as \u201cCOVID-19 is a hoax\u201d). Even for formal statements, we\nknow since Turing and Post that some facts are even undecidable: for some (rather rare) facts\nthere exists no algorithm able to decide if they are true or false. And for complex, informal\nstatements, establishing truth can be hard or impossible, even if we could transform them\ninto formalized statement by explicitly describing all needed details of the context under\nconsideration. The context of particular statement may depend on time, culture, history,\neducation, current availability of verified information or knowledge (e.g., as we have seen\nscientific knowledge evolving since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic), etc.\nMoreover, misinformation is rarely something to which we can assign a binary truth value.\nOften we find a mix of truth with misleading suggestions, implications, attribution, or false\ncontext. There is significant nuance that makes it hard even for expert humans to fact-check\nsome claims. Often the best a human fact-checker can do is to observe there there is no\nevidence in support of a claim, rather than conclude that the claim is false.\nThus, since establishing truth can be very hard (possibly undecidable), participants\nsuggested that we could instead consider automated assessments of trustworthiness. As\nan example: not everything on Breitbart News or Occupy Democrats is \u201cfalse\u201d, but these\nsources have low credibility according to fact-checking organizations.\n3.2 Assessing Trustworthiness\nMoving, then, from fact-checking or truth assessment to the assessment of trustworthiness,\nwe discussed several aspects:\nWhat is being evaluated? Approaches for assessing trustworthiness might target content\n(e.g., might this image be a deep fake?), content producers (e.g., does this website or social\nmedia account have a reputation for sharing truthworthy content?), or even content consumers\n(e.g., does this user have a history of re-sharing misinformation?).\nWho is assessing trustworthiness? Trustworthiness assessments might be heavily impacted\nby factors such as the background, education, and biases of the annotators \u2013 either humans,\nor automated processes that may embed such bias in their design.\n21402\n32 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\nWhat makes something trustworthy? Or rather, what signals might a trustworthiness\nalgorithm use to assess content or sources? Participants mentioned potential signals including:\nAdherence to journalistic standards\nFalsifiability (see Popper)\nAccountability, e.g., a history of correcting errors when they are confirmed as such\nPrimary knowledge domain or level of expertise of a source being relevant to the topic at\nhand\nConfidence that an account is not compromised\nUser feedback (though this may be manipulated [12])\nBehavior of users who are known to be good at distinguishing mis/disinformation\nUse of techniques (e.g., clickbait, sensationalism) known to play into human cognitive\nbiases\nThere is a growing number of news and fact-checking organizations that compile credibil-\nity metric for sources according to the above criteria, e.g., https://mediabiasfactcheck.\ncom,https://www.newsguardtech.com ,https://iffy.news , and https://factcheck.\nafp.com.\nWho is the audience for trustworthiness information? We can consider different audiences\nfor the outputs of trustworthiness algorithms. One potential audience is a social media or\nother platform itself, for use in amplifying or de-amplifying certain content. Beyond this, the\ntargets of such interventions are often end users themselves, e.g., labels on content to help\nthem assess information as they see it. For any user-facing interventions, the designers must\nconsider whether they are targeting users who are receptive to additional information (e.g.,\nconscientious consumers of information trying to make sense of the information ecosystems)\nor not (e.g., people already convinced of a false conspiracy theory). And in addition to\ndifferent kinds of people, there are quite different kinds of information. One size will obviously\nnot fit everyone.\nBuilding systems assessing trust automatically will rely (i) on the many factors listed\nabove, but also on (ii) ways to allow people to have time to take a step back (e.g., using friction\nas described in Section 4) and (iii) on thinking about the many ethics issues concerning the\nplatforms (Section 5).\n3.3 Technical Approaches\nParticipants also brainstormed specific technical approaches that might be used to support\ntrustworthiness assessment or other verification. The observation was made that online\nplatforms are already doing some of this work, but not much about their techniques or\nalgorithms is public or transparent; therefore the research community cannot assess the\nsoundness and appropriate application of platform regulation based on these metrics.\nAutomated property proving could be used on sufficiently formal statements, possibly with\nspecific pre-processing of them.\nThe pagerank technique is an early example, initially used by search engines. These types\nof algorithms could be used on Twitter graph data, for example, starting with initial\ntrustworthiness labels from existing sources.\nCryptographic techniques can be used to trace the provenance of content, identify the\nsources of content, and/or attest to attributes of content (e.g., metadata like when\nand where a video was shot, or when and by whom it was published online). While\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 33\ncryptographic techniques like digital signatures do allow attribution of content to a\n(possibly trusted) source, participants pointed out that there are limitations to these\napproaches because we still need a root of trust \u2013 e.g., we might be able to verify the\nprovenance of a video, but we still need to know whether we can trust the source.\nDeep fake detection is useful, but needs continuous adaptation to technical improvements\nin deep fake creation (i.e., an \u201carms race\u201d).\n3.4 Reflections on Harms from Untrustworthy Content\nAs part of this deep dive conversation, participants also reflected on the potential harms of\nuntrustworthy content \u2013 both what those harms are, as well as how they might be used to\nprioritize different types of sources or content for intervention.\nSpread and targeting\nThe current social internet allows both brute force broadcasting (i.e., everyone receives the\nsame (mis)information) as well as highly targeted (mis)information dissemination. Highly\ntargeted information can be sent to many different people, and they will not see the same\nthing as it will be automatically tailored to their unique profile \u2013 a unique phenomenon in\nour new digital ecosystem. We observed that both mis/disinformation with broad reach, as\nwell as highly targeted mis/disinformation, can create substantial harm, but may require\ndifferent approaches to combat.\nAssessing and prioritizing potential harms\nDifferent types of mis/disinformation may have have different harms. For example, ill-founded\ndistrust in vaccines has clear potential harms [ 18], while on its face it seems less problematic\nif some people believe that the earth is flat \u2013 though the distinctions are not so simple, as\nit has been show that beliefs in different conspiracy theories may be correlated. Moreover,\ndifferent populations may be more vulnerable to certain harms. With a good characterization\nwe could use that to prioritize limited resources. But characterizing and measuring harm in\nonline content could be very hard and remains an active research area (e.g., [ 31,21]). Even\nirrespective of harm prediction, any prioritization that makes a judgment on which harms to\nwhich populations are more \u201cimportant\u201d than others will have ethical impacts.\nLong-term impacts of content despite awareness that source is untrustworthy\nEven with trustworthiness information, people might not remember the provenance of\ninformation they have seen \u2013 they might assume something is true even though they were\nexposed to it from an untrustworthy source. For example, it has been shown in the context of\nads [17] that people do not necessarily remember the sources of information. This observation\nraises a more general related question: how are people influenced by bad information they\njust see in their information ecosystem but do not engage much with, such as posts they scroll\nby or ads they think they ignore? Does that information (especially with source provenance\nlater lost) make it into their worldviews? Is this effect worse when people read only catchy\nheadlines, but not the underlying articles?\n21402\n34 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\n3.5 Challenging Trustworthiness\nWe also noted that trustworthiness is challenged in various ways. First, disinformation\nis fundamentally an attack on the human brain, taking advantage of aspects of human\nneuro-cognition, culture, behaviors, and potentially fault or non-rational heuristics. Simply\nsurfacing information about trustworthiness to people will not, on its own, suffice to overcome\nthese issues. A second challenge comes from traditional computer security: information\nmaybe altered on purpose, e.g., via the criminal alteration of data stored in compromised\ncomputers in order to support disinformation and falsely justify fake news. For example, a\nparticipant pointed to recent targeted attacks on research against COVID-19 vaccines [ 23].\nAndfinally, whileAIandMLcanprovidetoolstohelpcombatdisinformation(e.g., supporting\ntrustworthiness assessment), their advancement may also increase the volume and the quality\nof fake news, as well as bringing new disinformation vectors. These challenges compound the\ncomplexity of understanding and controlling the context in which we would like to increase\ntrustworthiness, and require for further research.\n4 Deep Dive 2: Friction as a Technique in Platform Design\nOur second deep dive conversation focused on the topic of \u201cfriction\u201d as a technique in (social\nmedia or other information) platform design. The idea of friction involves slowing down some\nhuman interaction with the platform, either on the information producer side (e.g., limiting\ndown how often someone can post) or on the information consumer side (e.g., limiting how\nmuch time someone spends on the platform).\n4.1 Argument for Friction\nSome participants presented evidence for why the idea of friction might be fruitful. One piece\nof evidence: while one might imagine that platform behavior might self-regulate, in the sense\nthat higher quality content should become more popular, in fact, the correlation between\nquality and popularity is very weak as long as people have finite attention (i.e., are unable\nto see everything that is posted on the platform) [ 13]. This reality is problematic from the\nperspective of misinformation, because it makes us vulnerable to bad actors flooding the\nnetwork with more information. Indeed, there is empirical evidence that adversaries flood\nthe network with lots of volume of problematic content [25, 22].\nAt the same time, we know from many examples in other domains and in our own lives\nthat what might be good for a person\u2019s well-being in general, and what they want or choose\nto do in a given moment, are not always aligned, making us vulnerable to addictive online\nplatforms. Related to this, the question was raised: is there an equivalent to the \u201cprivacy\nparadox\u201d [ 3] for misinformation? Seminar participants posited that the answer is likely\nyes: that people are not as conscientious about consuming information as they say they are\nor want to be (e.g., they may still click on clickbait content even though they recognize it\nas clickbait). However, just as the privacy paradox is not truly a paradox (because people\nare forced into the impossible choice between opting out of crucial online platforms and\nagreeing to their privacy ultimatums) [ 24], we posit that in the context of misinformation,\npeople\u2019s actual choices and behavior are deeply influenced by the platforms. In other words,\nthe situation is not so much a paradox as a failure of platforms to design for their users\u2019\nwell-being.\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 35\nTowards that end, we thus considered \u201cfriction\u201d as a potential tool in platform design to\nreduce mis/disinformation and increase well-being. In the extreme, as a thought experiment,\na platform might have no friction (i.e., anyone can post or view anything) or only friction\n(i.e., everything is blocked). The latter case is clearly nonsensical, but as a practical matter,\nso is the former: participants stressed that platform designs are never neutral . Particularly\nbecause there is finite time and attention that an individual can spend on a platform, the\ndesign choices about who is shown what content in what way, and the affordances for how\ncontent is posted and shared, naturally shape people\u2019s consumption and production behaviors.\n4.2 Examples and Proposals for Friction in Platform Design\nWe considered existing examples of friction, as well as our own new proposals, for different\nstakeholders.\nFriction for Information Consumers\nConsumers are users who use social media or other information platforms to read and/or\nview content. Examples of friction for consumers include:\nMost generally, the platform\u2019s algorithm for what is shown to whom when is a form of\nfriction for certain types of content.\nLabeling content (e.g., with \u201cfalse\u201d labels if something was able to be explicitly fact-\nchecked, or with other information, such as about the trustworthiness of the source as\ndiscussed in Section 3) as a nudge for people to think about it a second time.\nMinor changes in an interface can have impacts on how people consume information (e.g.,\nthe presence or absence of a search box might change people\u2019s ability to act on their\npreferences in content consumption [16]).\nHelping people limit how much they interact with platforms, e.g., how much time they\nspend on social media. Existing tools include screen time capping tools (e.g., smartphone\napps or browser extensions), including tools with additional incentives (e.g., planting real\nor virtual trees). A proposal was to surface the climate impact for use of platforms per\nunit time, as a new type of incentive/motivation.\nProposal: Some kind of platform guidance for helping shape discourse (e.g., like an\nongoing project designing a tool to help local actors intervene in mis/disinformation\nrelated conversations [26]).\nProposal: Design social media platforms for more intent-driven interactions. Today, people\nvisiting social media sites are inundated with content on all sorts of topics interleaved on\ntheir feeds, which can create information overload, reduce motivation to assess information\nquality [10], and other potential harms. Imagine instead a platform that greets a user with\nan empty search box, asking them to take an active role in shaping the topics and types\nof content that they see. However, we note a potential privacy-related side effect here:\nactive interactions with the platform will also provide more information about the user\u2019s\ninterests and habits that could be exploited for targeted advertising or manipulation;\nthus, any such approach should be coupled with robust privacy protections.\nProposal: Helping users filter the content they want to see, e.g., on Twitter, to engage on\nacademic research topics but not U.S. politics.\n21402\n36 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\nFriction for Information Producers\nInformation producers are those who create new posts containing mis/disinformation or\nother low-quality or problematic content. Examples of friction for producers include:\nTwitter limits the number of posts per day (though posters may violate this by deleting\nthings they posted earlier). One might also impose other limits, such as rate limits.\nTwitter used captchas to limit posting volume during the 2020 U.S. elections.\nContent moderation in general was considered a general form of friction (e.g., removing\nposts or account, shadow-banning). The Facebook Oversight Board was mentioned, which\nevaluates content removal or account banning decisions.\nOther researchers have highlighted the importance of banning \u201crepeat offenders\u201d, accounts\nthat frequently post or spread mis/disinformation [8].\nProposal: On WhatsApp, a message that has spread beyond a certain number of people\ncould be made public, to allow for scrutiny and content moderation (otherwise challenging\non an end-to-end encrypted platform).\nProposal: Some kind of monetary cost for posting (similar to what advertisers must do\ntoday, or similar to postage stamps for physical messages).\nProposal: Some kind of \u201cfriction score\u201d or \u201ctrustworthiness score\u201d for information produc-\ners, where higher-quality information producers are able to post more, with more reach.\nThe idea would be to create disincentives (cost) for bad actions, and incentives or rewards\nfor responsible use. This proposal comes with many questions and challenges, including\nhow such a score should be computed, by whom, the need to provide transparency about\nits implementation and enforcement, the privacy risks associated with how the score\nmight be misused, etc. Some ideas for factors that might be incorporated into the score\nincluded: the quality of previously shared links, prior track record of posted content\nthat has been flagged or taken down, certain behaviors (e.g., high-frequency posting,\ninauthentic/coordinated behavior), and audience diversity or other audience properties.\nOr could we translate some of the trust indicators developed for news organizations (e.g.,\nas used by Newsguard) to individuals? Using crowdsourced data as part of the score was\ncautioned against, due to risks of coordinated activity or similar [30].\nProposal: Time-based friction for posting, when critical events like elections are happening\nor shortly before a company goes for IPO, friction could be increased to minimize\nmanipulations at the time when they are most impactful. This idea could apply to friction\nfor information consumers and/or intermediaries.\nFriction for Intermediaries\nIntermediaries are users who knowingly or unknowingly re-share mis/ disinformation posted\nby others (e.g., retweeting on Twitter). Examples of friction for intermediaries include:\nWhatsApp limits the number of people to whom someone can forward a message.\nFacebook alerts you if you try to share a link or post that their fact-checkers have labeled\nas false.\nTwitter warns you if you retweet a link without having first clicked on it.\nProposal: Temporarily disable reposting capability for users who ignore warnings with\nhigh frequency.\nProposal: The above-mentioned \u201ctrustworthiness score\u201d could be used for intermediaries\nas well.\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 37\nProposal: Behaviorally identifying users who are good at identifying and/or avoiding\nmis/disinformation, and using that information to, for example, amplify or reduce the\nspread of certain types of content.\n4.3 Practical and Ethics Considerations\nOrthogonal to any specific friction proposals, participants voiced concerns about practical\nconsiderations in deploying such techniques. First, there are questions about the incentives\nof the platform designers, in terms of economic models and business incentives. Indeed,\nafter the seminar, there was the example of a browser extension designed to limit people\u2019s\nFacebook use that was shut down by Facebook [ 20]. The corresponding observation was that\nthese questions are not merely technical challenges but will require regulations to put any\nsolutions into place.\nAdditionally, there are ethical, legal, and political questions around the power of platforms\nto make decisions like promoting or demoting certain types of content or blocking certain\npeople. One participant also noted that the use of \u201cfriction\u201d is, of course, not ubiquitously a\ngood thing, pointing, for example, to work documenting the uses of friction and flooding\nas techniques by authoritarian governments to exert control over information in potentially\nharmful ways [19]. We discuss ethics more in Section 5.\n4.4 Looking Ahead\nClearly, significant work remains to be done to design, implement, and evaluate the impacts\nof different types of friction proposals, compounded with the challenges of platform incentives\nand their limited transparency and oversight. Stepping back, we concluded our discussion\non this topic with a crucial, overarching question: How might we redesign platforms more\nradically? For example, if we wanted to design a \u201cpublic interest social media platform\u201d,\nwhat would that look like? Could it be done? Or, looking further into the future towards\nAR/VR or \u201cmetaverse\u201d interactions: can such platforms be designed in ways that help move\nus more towards (imagined?) ideals of in-person instead of digitally-mediated interactions?\n5 Deep Dive 3: Ethics of Interventions\nOn the second day, we chose to include one formal talk to help seed our discussion on\nethics: Serena Villata gave a talk titled \u201cOnline disinformation: content moderation, ethical\nchallenges, and future work directions\u201d describing in particular the collective thinking held\nwithin the National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics (Conseil National Pilote d\u2019Ethique\ndu Num\u00e9rique \u2013 CNPEN) [4]. The abstract says:\nThe purpose [...] is to identify the ethical issues and challenges arising from the\nwidespread use of these different algorithms and tools, which are part of a complex\nphenomenon with wide-ranging implications. Among others, some questions arise:\nwhat does action or inaction in this domain mean in the context of COVID-19? Is it\nsimply a quantitative shift, or are we seeing a more profound change in the nature\nof the digital solutions designed to fight online disinformation and misinformation?\n21402\n38 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\nMore generally, how do we face the complexity of this phenomenon, which requires\nan analysis that seems to go beyond ethics, or even to challenge the notion of ethics\nitself? Indeed, ethical questions do not arise in the same way depending on whether\none is dealing with actors who act consciously to deceive their target or, on the other\nhand, whether one is dealing with actors who simply get caught up in the flow of\ninformation in digital format and, in particular, participate in the virality of this\ninformation often in an unconscious way. In the first case, ethical reflection questions\nresponsibility, while in the second case it consists mainly in moving towards awareness.\nIn either case, the requirement is to identify \u2013 specifically in the digital domain \u2013\nthe economic, legal, social, political or philosophical dimensions of disinformation or\nmisinformation.\nThe discussion opened by the presentation helped raise fundamental questions about\nethics in the context of mis/disinformation.\n5.1 Which ethics for which purpose?\nAre there existing ethical frameworks/theories that could be applied in this context?\nShall we develop and/or rely on existing philosophical frameworks? Can we take inspiration\nfrom the many AI governance propositions issued from the committees set up, for example,\nby the UE, IEEE or Unesco? How do we resolve some of the fundamental-seeming tensions\n(e.g., free speech vs content moderation for safety)?\nA crucial point concerns the cultural aspects of information. Do we expect a global set of\nethics accepted by everyone, or do we expect ethics to be regional? Clearly, norms and group\nbehaviors are quite often following local customs and they can be influenced or offended by\nother behaviors in different regions. Related works like the Confucian approaches to tech\nethics were mentioned [29].\nWhen looking at ethics as defined by the French Academy [ 6] (\u201cReflection on human\nbehaviour and the values on which it is based, carried out with a view to establishing a\ndoctrine, a science of morality.\u201d), the reflection process may evolve over time and of course in\ndifferent cultures. This highlights the difficulty to answer the question: should we (can we?)\nestablish a common set of rules? And for which purpose?\nAs ethics precedes regulation and laws that are regional or national in many cases, we\nsee the difficulty, but also the interest, to collaborate on these questions and to try to find or\nestablish common views in the context of global digital platforms.\n5.2 What values are behind moderation tools?\nWhen asking which values are behind the moderation tools, the following points were raised.\nAlgorithmic fairness to avoid issues like algorithmic bias (e.g., the Amazon hiring example).\nBias could in particular be introduced when detecting proactively vs noticing the impacts.\nBias could be better understood and avoided when running simulations to help predict\notherwise unforeseen side effects of algorithmic designs.\nTransparency appears as a key value here again. For reference, a talk was mentioned from\nOana Goga (based on work with Krishna Gummadi and others) auditing explanations\nprovided by social platforms on why some content was shown, highlighting also how these\nexplanations can be manipulated to appear \u201cneutral\u201d [11].\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 39\nConsent is key as in bioethics, and it relies in part on thoughtful consent design and on\neducation: how to ensure that people understand what they are consenting for? The role\nof nudging, with much prior work, was also highlighted by participants.\n5.3How can ethics committees help governing social media platforms?\nWe currently see the setting up of ethical committees close to the platform (e.g., Facebook\nOversight Board), possibly acting independently. Can this help? Participants raised the\nfollowing questions for/about the Facebook Oversight Board:\nWhat does Facebook do with the user-generated reports of Facebook takeout data (and\nof course with all the data)?\nWhat data does the Oversight Board actually get access to?\nProcess, data, objectives, consequences (how seriously is this taken)?\nMembership of the board? Multi-stakeholder?\nHow does Facebook\u2019s internal governance interact with the external committee?\nWhat about ethics-washing?\nParticipants also observed:\n1.The role of the Oversight Board is limited to content decisions, not actually oversight of\nFacebook per se, despite its name.\n2.Facebook\u2019splatformisnotneutral: thedesignoftheplatformshapesnotonlyconsumption\nbehaviors but has also shaped content (e.g., from the Facebook whistleblower interview\nwith 60 Minutes [ 1], politicians saying they felt forced to take more extreme positions\nthat will work well with Facebook\u2019s algorithm)\nEvery problem Facebook and others are facing is so complex, with conflicting needs from\ndifferent stakeholders \u2013 could we actually do better, if we were there? Are there examples of\nethics boards in such companies working well? We left the question open but we begin to\nthink about what would be desirable.\nLet\u2019s imagine new, different social media platforms\nSuch a platform might rely on an oversight board accessing information (what?) to make\ndecisions (which?) to be applied. The ethics committee might use tools for being more\ntransparent on data and models without releasing the data and the model, e.g., [ 9,15]. And\nof course it is crucial to involve multiple, globally and otherwise diverse stakeholders.\n6 Deep Dive 4: User Education\nFinally, we discussed the potential role of and strategies for user education against mis/-\ndisinformation. Indeed, many existing educational efforts exist in this space (e.g., several\nefforts at the University of Washington alone [ 28,5], TrendMicro\u2019s internet safety educational\nresources [ 27], the Fakey game [ 14]); our goal here is not to suggest that all of the ideas\nbelow are new, but rather to summarize the discussion at the seminar about the role of and\nimportant considerations in educational interventions.\n21402\n40 21402 \u2013 Digital Disinformation: Taxonomy, Impact, Mitigation, and Regulation\n6.1 Role of User Education\nWhen considering educational interventions, an important question is always to consider how\nmuch should the responsibility be on users to protect themselves versus how much should\nthe responsibility be on companies and regulators to obviate the need for education and\nself-protection. Beyond responsibility, there is a question of how realistic or appropriate it is\nto expect users to develop deep understandings of the technical systems they use\u2013 indeed,\nmany users do not have such understanding [ 7]. it seems clear to us that the burden cannot\nand should not be on end users alone. Nevertheless, educational interventions may have an\nimportant role to play in a multi-faceted fight against mis/disinformation, and can provide\nusers with agency and empowerment even in the face of slow-moving or otherwise incentivized\nregulators and platforms.\n6.2 Characterizing Education Efforts\nSeminar participants considered different ways to characterize or scope educational interven-\ntions, and different options for their aims and implementations. These included:\nWho is the audience of an education effort? This might include vulnerable populations,\nsuchaskids, teenagers, olderadults, peoplewithlowerliteracy. Thismightincludeparticularly\npowerful individuals, such as politician, local influencers, C-level executives, business owners,\nor people in charge of platform design and implementation. And this might include everyone,\ncontinuously, who interacts with online information ecosystems.\nWhat is the goal of an education effort? At first blush, the core goal of an anti-\nmisinformation educational effort might seem to be to help people learn how to identify\nmis/disinformation . However, participants were quick to point out that one should avoid\nteaching only skepticism, which risks cultivating cynicism [ 2] and undermining trust in infor-\nmation ecosystems altogether. Instead, educational efforts should also include the opposite\ngoal:helping people identify trustworthy information and sources .\nOther potential educational goals articulated by seminar participants included: helping\npeople thinking critically andhelping people learn situational awareness online , as well as\nspecifically helping people identify manipulative techniques being used in the content that\nthey see (e.g., Cialdini\u2019s principles of inflence or persuasion). Another goal might be to help\npeople engage with others productively about misinformation (e.g., teaching skills for how to\ninteract with someone when they have posted something false).\nParticipants also observed that educational goals towards online literacy in general might\nhave benefits regarding mis/disinformation, in terms of helping people understand how\ninformation flows online and how mis/disinformation may spread or be targeted at them. For\nexample: educating people about how online systems and information ecosystems work in\ngeneral; helping people understand how information about them is collected, processed, and\nused online; helping people understand what it means when they consent to online services.\nThe question was also raised about whether misinformation education efforts can take\nlessons from educational efforts in other domains, e.g., cybersecurity.\nHow to deliver educational interventions? Education might be (for example): embedded as\npart of platforms themselves (e.g. for a chatbot platform, by the chatbot itself); incorporated\ninto existing courses across different levels of education; presented in stand-alone workshops;\nincorporated into existing or stand-alone websites; presented as public service announcements\nClaude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner 41\n(e.g., similar to public health messaging by public health agencies); included as part of\nentertainment media (e.g., TV shows); or delivered through educational games or apps\n(e.g., [5, 14]).\n7 Conclusion and Looking Ahead\nThis Dagstuhl workshop, occurring right after the main assault of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwas held in hybrid mode. It was quite different from \u201cstandard\u201d Dagstuhl meetings which\nbenefit from more informal and direct in-person interactions. Still, thanks to our engaged\nparticipants and the quality of the technical video conferencing support provided by the\nDagstuhl organisation, we found our conversations fruitful, with much involvement and\ninteractions between geographically (and time zone) distant participants.\nIt is clear that there are more questions than answers about mis/disinformation in our\nonline ecosystems at this time, and we add our voices to the growing and interdisciplinary\nresearch community in this space. We look forward to future \u2013 hopefully fully in-person \u2013\nDagstuhl seminars on this topic, as well as future collaborations between seminar participants\nand within the research community more broadly.\nReferences\n160 Minutes.

Carley, Chair, Carnegie Mellon University\nAnanya Sen, Carnegie Mellon University\nHong Shen, Carnegie Mellon University\nJeff Hemsley, Syracuse University\nSubmitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements\nfor the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Christine Sowa Lepird\nAbstract\nIn the past twenty years, journalism has had to evolve to keep up with the digital era that\npublishes stories not on print mediums but on online websites that are shared via social media\nin order to be consumed by the public. Unfortunately the smallest of journalistic outlets - those\nserving local communities - have been hit the hardest. Many local newspapers have closed due\nto budget cuts, but the trust in local news reporting remains high. In their place, some unsavory\nactors have decided to exploit this trust to share national messaging under the guise of local news.\nThey have created hundreds of websites designed to appear as part of small American communi-\nties - particularly communities in swing states and those of national electoral importance. With\nlittle to no actual reporters, these sites are largely filled with automated reporting on community\nbudgets, weather, and sports. The primary pull for these websites are their political articles which\nare shared on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.\nThis thesis is a comprehensive study into these sites that are masquerading as local news\nwhile pushing a national agenda and spending significant money to do so. Each element of\nthis research aims to answer the questions: how is the behavior of those creating and sharing\npink slime sites different from that other news sites (be it local, real, or low credibility news)?\nFurthermore, how can I leverage their defining characteristics to train others to find and be wary\nof these sites? I start by concretely defining this phenomenon of \u2018pink slime\u2019, how it gained\nfooting in the online news ecosystem, and what gaps in current literature inform the research I\nconducted. I then utilize computational social science and social network analysis methods to\nquantify the impacts and characteristics of these sites (in comparison to real news, local news,\nand low credibility news sites) in the first large scale empirical assessment of pink slime. From\nan information operations perspective, I categorize the network and narrative BEND maneuvers\nutilized by pink slime across multiple social media platforms and compare it to three other news\ntypes. Applying natural language processing, machine learning, and network analysis, I propose\na network feature that can find new sources of these sites and prove its effectiveness. In a study\non human subjects, I learn how a reader\u2019s trust in pink slime and local news differs and how\ntraining impacts their ability to find pink slime. Finally, I summarize the findings and relevant\nliterature to make policy recommendations to counter this threat to local communities.\nAcknowledgments\nTo my research collaborators who have brainstormed with and inspired me to find new solutions.\nTo my advisor for supporting me in researching a topic I believe is important and understudied.\nTo my parents for encouraging their daughter to be curious and look to science for answers.\nTo my husband, my greatest collaborator, for the thousands of dinner-time conversations about\npink slime (an unappetizing phrase) and unending support.\nii\nContents\n1 Introduction 1\n1.1 Overarching Thesis Goals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n2 Data and Tools 2\n2.1 Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n2.1.1 News Type Datasets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n2.1.2 Facebook Datasets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n2.1.3 Twitter Datasets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.2 Tools Used . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.3 Internal Review Board (IRB) Approval . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n3 Research Plan 7\n3.1 Background and Motivation (Ch. 1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n3.1.1 Research Questions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n3.1.2 Methods and Proposed Work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n3.1.3 Challenges and Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n3.2 Characteristics of Pink Slime (Ch. 2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n3.2.1 Research Questions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n3.2.2 Methods and Proposed Work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n3.2.3 Challenges and Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.3 BEND Maneuvers of Pink Slime (Ch. 3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.3.1 Research Questions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.3.2 Methods and Proposed Work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.3.3 Challenges and Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.4 Finding New Sources of Pink Slime (Ch. 4) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.4.1 Research Questions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.4.2 Methods and Proposed Work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.4.3 Challenges and Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28\n3.5 Training Humans to Detect Pink Slime (Ch. 5) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n3.5.1 Research Questions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n3.5.2 Methods and Proposed Work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n3.5.3 Challenges and Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\n3.6 Conclusions and Recommendations (Ch. 6) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\n3.6.1 Research Questions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\niii\n3.6.2 Methods and Proposed Work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n3.6.3 Challenges and Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n4 Contributions 33\n4.1 Theoretical Contributions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n4.2 Methodological Contributions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n4.3 Empirical Contributions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n4.4 Data Contributions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n4.5 Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34\n5 Proposed Timeline 35\nBibliography 36\niv\nChapter 1\nIntroduction\n1.1 Overarching Thesis Goals\nWhile the digitization of the news industry has allowed more people to access information at the\ntip of their fingertips, there has been a dark downside to the ease at which companies can register\ndomain names and populate a website with automated filler content. Pink slime journalism has\noozed its way into the media diet of unsuspecting Americans who still place a higher trust in\nlocal news institutions [36] to keep them informed on issues that matter to them.\nAcademic research on the topic has been largely limited to consumption and answering the\nquestion of who is likely to click on these websites [47]. Furthermore, the publications have not\nanalyzed the phenomenon past the 2020 U.S. Presidential election [27] [47] despite the ad spend\nand impressions on their largest social media sharer (Facebook) more than doubling from 2020\nto the 2022 midterms and January 2024 ad spend reaching over 10x that of January 2022.\nIn this thesis I will apply social network analysis to answer the following questions: how is\npink slime fundamentally different from other news types vying for attention on social media?\nFurthermore, by answering the first question, can I use the characteristics to inform algorithms\nto more quickly discover new sources of these pink slime websites? Finally, with the first two\nquestions answered, can I take the results and effectively teach others to recognize pink slime\nwhen it is encountered?\n1\nChapter 2\nData and Tools\n2.1 Data\nThis thesis largely analyzes how users interact and engage with pink slime sites as they are shared\non various social media platforms. The following Fig 2.1 summarizes where each of these data\nsources are used throughout the chapters of the thesis, and they are explained in greater depth\nbelow.\nFigure 2.1: Summary of data used in the chapters of the thesis\n2\n2.1.1 News Type Datasets\nCASOS Thesaurus Dataset consists of posts from the media thesaurus compiled by the CA-\nSOS University Center at Carnegie Mellon University. The media thesaurus has been compiled\nfrom multiple publicly available lists of news media URLs and media organizations\u2019 Twitter ac-\ncounts: Media Bias/Fact Check [6] lists many news sites and rates how factual and credible the\nreporting is for many; the George Washington University Dataverse [44] has a list of over 9600\nTwitter accounts for media organizations, derived from over 160 million tweets between 2016\nand 2020; there is also a Github repository [11] of unreliable, misleading, and/or low credibil-\nity news sources that includes lists from Snopes Field Guide, Melissa Zimdars\u2019 OpenSources,\nWikipedia, and others. There is often overlap between these sources, particularly for the less\nfactual news outlets; to resolve any conflicts that emerge between the sources, the thesaurus errs\non the side of not labeling a news source in question as low credibility news. From this thesaurus,\nthe labels of low credbility and real news domains are utilized.\nPink Slime Dataset consists of domains from the Tow Center of Digital Journalism\u2019s study\nof pink slime and published on Github [9]. While not all of these sites ended up meeting the\ndefinition of pink slime set forth by this thesis, this was used as a baseline for data acquisition\nfrom APIs. The targeted state column was also utilized for geospatial analysis.\nLocal News Dataset contains a list of domains that are classified as local news in the United\nStates. They can be found on Github [32]. Additionally, a set of authentic local news sites owned\nby larger companies are compiled from [12].\nLow \nCredibility \nNewsReal News\nPink Slime Local News\nCredibility\nScope\nLocal\nNational\nFigure 2.2: Relationships between news types\n3\n2.1.2 Facebook Datasets\nFacebook Group and Page Posts to Pink Slime Domains Dataset consists of posts from the\nPython CrowdTangle API ([18]. For each pink slime domain listed in [9], the API was called\nto return all of the posts linking to them from public Facebook groups, pages, and profiles from\n2019-2023. It should be noted that the API limits the response to 1,000 posts per call, so the\ndata was dynamically and recursively pulled; if a date range had more than 1,000 posts to a pink\nslime domain, then the date range was halved until the response would be under 1,000 posts. The\nminimum date range that the API would allow is one day, so if a domain had more than 1,000\nposts from these sources on a given day, the additional posts were not included. Overall this\nyielded 1.2 million posts.\nFacebook Pink Slime Ad Dataset consists of posts that pink slime parent organizations paid\nto promote on Facebook Pages. It was acquired through the Facebook Ad Library [2]. The\namount paid for these posts and impressions garnered was taken as the average of the minimum\nand maximum values listed. When a majority of the ad impressions were in one state, this was\nlisted in this research as the targeted state.\nFacebook COVID 2020 Dataset consists of posts made in 2020 to Facebook Pages and Groups\npertaining to the \u201creopen\u201d movement and general \u201celections\u201d from the Python Crowdtangle API\n([18]. It is used as a training set in Chapter 4.\nMidterms 2022 Dataset consists of posts from Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter pertaining to\nthe United States 2022 Midterm Elections in regions with the most contention elections. The\nposts pulled from each of the platforms contain URLs to external sites for further analysis. The\nelections took place on November 8, 2022, and the data was collected from October 1, 2022 to\nDecember 1, 2022. Elections selected for this analysis included the most competitive districts\nand regions in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin [38].

The tweets were collected from October 22, 2018 to November 13, 2018 via\nthe Twitter API [10] and included the hashtags: #tridentjuncture, #nato, and their non-English\nvariants. It represents 81,555 unique Twitter users and is used as a training dataset in the OMEN\ngame experiment detailed in Chapter 5.\nMarch 2020 Covid Dataset consists of 1.2 million tweets from the Twitter API [10] in March\nof 2020 with the following keywords: \u201ccoronaravirus\u201d, \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201cwuhan virus\u201d, \u201cwuhan-\nvirus\u201d, \u201c2019nCoV\u201d,\u201cNCoV\u201d,\u201cNCoV2019\u201d. It is used as a training dataset in the OMEN game\nexperiment detailed in Chapter 5.\nBalikatan 2022 Dataset consists of Tweets pulled from the Twitter API [10] in April 2022\nrelated to the annual military exercise between the Philippines and the United States. It is used\nas a training dataset in the OMEN game experiment detailed in Chapter 5.\n2.2 Tools Used\nA series of computational tools are used throughout this thesis to identify bots, characterize their\nactivity and their interactions.\nORA is a dynamic network analysis and visualization tool with capabilities to import data from\nseveral social media sites [31]. It is used in this thesis visualize social media networks, calculate\ncentrality metrics, and implement the BEND framework.\nNetMapper is a text-based software [31] used to extract linguistic cues pertaining to emotion,\npronouns, and icons in a set of input text files. It appends this metadata to the original text files\nso that it can be imported into ORA to help classify which BEND maneuvers are taking place.\nBotHunter [23] is a bot detection algorithm utilized to segment posts made on social media\nplatforms as those from bots and humans. It outputs a probability ranging from 0 to 1, where\na score closer to 0 is likely a human and a score closer to 1 is likely a bot. The cut-off for bot\nlabeling in this thesis was 0.7 [51].\n2.3 Internal Review Board (IRB) Approval\nThe collection of datasets and human subjects research were performed under the following\nIRBs.\nThe Midterms 2022 dataset was collected with IRB approval in the Fall of 2022 Federalwide\nAssurance No: FWA00004206 IRB Registration No: IRB00000603\n5\nThe Facebook Pink Slime dataset was collected with pending IRB approval in the Spring of\n2024 Federalwide Assurance No: FP00010535.\nThe Media Literacy Test was conducted with IRB approval in the Spring of 2024 and deter-\nmined to be Exempt under the 2018 Common Rule 45 CFR 46.104.d.\n6\nChapter 3\nResearch Plan\nThis thesis is organized into six chapters. It begins by defining pink slime, what we know about it\nfrom previous research, and motivating why it is worth studying (Ch. 1). From there, it measures\nthe impact that these sites are having and defining the network characteristics they present (Ch.\n2). By including the text as well as network elements, it dives into which information operations\nare being conducted by the controlling pink slime organizations (Ch. 3). It establishes a new\nmetric to find these sites and tests its performance (Ch. 4). It then reports on experimental\nfindings to assess human trust of pink slime and the effectiveness of training on detection (Ch. 5).\nFinally, it draws on findings from the earlier chapters and case studies from similar phenomenon\nthat has been observed internationally to make policy recommendations to address the issue in\nthe United States (Ch. 6).\n3.1 Background and Motivation (Ch. 1)\n3.1.1 Research Questions\nThis chapter serves as an introduction to pink slime journalism. In defining the phrase pink slime,\nit establishes what will be analyzed and researched throughout the thesis. It will describe the on-\nline landscape of these sites and how casual viewers may come into contact with them. It surveys\nthe current landscape of academic and journalistic research surrounding the topic and identifies\nwhere the gaps in research exist. By identifying the gaps, it explains how the subsequent chapters\nof this thesis will address them.\n\u2022What is pink slime?\n\u2022What do we know from previous research about pink slime?\nWho owns these sites and with what goal?\nWhere are these sites shared?\nWhat gaps exist in current research? How will they be addressed in this thesis?\n7\n3.1.2 Methods and Proposed Work\nDefining Pink Slime and \u2018Local\u2019 For the purposes of this research, pink slime is defined as\nmedia outlet websites that include the following:\n\u2022are run by national, partisan groups\n\u2022have a local term in their name (i.e. \u201cEast Michigan News\u201d)\n\u2022are shared on social media platforms\n\u2022include aggregated and automated news reporting\n\u2022have a majority of their articles written by non-local reporters\nFurthermore, the concept of something being \u2018local\u2019 is defined as:\n\u2022a region in the United States that is either a state or a sub-community within the state\n\u2022sub-communities within the state are referred to as hyper-local but are also considered\n\u2018local\u2019\nBackground Hundreds of regional news sources that appear to be reliable local news have\nbeen spreading since 2019 [20]. These news websites consist of largely automated, low-quality\npartisan reporting and were nicknamed \u201cPink Slime\u201d by journalist Ryan Smith in 2012 [55]. The\nterm was coined as a comparison to the cheap fillers added to beef, here with cheap reporting\nbeing added to a self-reported news outlet. In 2015, the article From Pink Slips to Pink Slime:\nTransforming Media Labor in a Digital Age was published highlighting the dangers of news\naggregation and \u201crobot reporters\u201d (a term used before the invention of ChatGPT) [33].\nAmerican trust in local news organizations has remained higher than that of national news\norganizations [36]. To exploit the trust in local reporting, organizations like Metric Media LLC\nhave created almost 1,000 local news sites [21]. While there is a dearth of authentic local re-\nporting by local reports, it remains highly trusted, and creators of these networks are taking\nadvantage of this trust. A New York Times investigation focusing on sites under Metric Media\u2019s\ncontrol highlighted that while pink slime sites may seem insignificant on a national scale with\ntens of thousands of shares on social media, the focus on small towns require less readership for\nthe impact to be felt [15]. Which is perhaps why 30% of the links pushed by the Russian troll\nfarm, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election were to\nstories on local news websites (occasionally fake local news sites created by the Russians) [34].\nThe organizations like Media Metric that control vast swaths of pink slime sites do not appear\nto have foreign ties [21], but they are currently financed by political candidates and political ac-\ntion committees with the hope of swaying election results. When speaking of threats to election\nintegrity, Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, remarked \u201cThe issue ... is\nnot going to be foreign interference. It\u2019s much more likely that legitimate domestic actors possi-\nbly operating under their own name \u2014 with LLCs or corporations with very shady funding that\nare not required to disclose what that funding is \u2014 are going to dominate the online conversation\nabout the outcome of the election. [48]\u201d\nIn discussing the 2022 U.S. Midterm elections, the co-CEO of NewsGuard (an organization\ndedicated to countering misinformation using online tools) Gordon Crovitz stated that: \u201cParti-\nsan sites masquerading as independent local news publishers are designed to fool readers into\n8\ntrusting untrustworthy sources of information, which has the result of reducing trust in all local\nnews as people realize they\u2019ve been targeted for biased reporting...The partisan groups secretly\nsolicit millions of dollars from donors who are willing to undermine trust in news. The social\nmedia companies take advertising money designed to spread false and one-sided news coverage,\nin many cases microtargeting swing voters. These partisan donors and irresponsible social media\ncompanies have helped undermine trust in news. The resulting uncertain \u2018local news\u2019 environ-\nment cuts readership and advertising support for the legitimate news sites that need both now\nmore than ever\u201d [8]. Research out of NewsGuard went on to criticize the almost $4 million spent\non ads run over 115 million times on Meta platforms in 2022 [4]. It comes as no surprise that\nNewsGuard created a nutrition label for the Metric Media sites claiming \u201dA network of web-\nsites that falsely present themselves as locally based news sites. The sites do not disclose their\nconservative agenda, and much of the content is created by algorithms\u201d [7].\nMetric Media is not the only parent organization of pink slime, but it is the largest. Metric\nMedia has several subnetworks all associated with and sharing IP space with the Metric Media\nsites [20]\nPink slime news sources do not exist in silos. Many of the known sources of pink slime have\ntheir own associated social media accounts on platforms like Facebook to amplify the spread\nof the messaging to the community (as the names of these sites frequently have the targeted\ncommunity in the domain name). Almost 70% of Americans get their news from the social\nmedia platform Facebook [37], but not all of this news is coming from quality news sources;\n15% of referrals to fake news sites are coming from Facebook [39]. While 17.7% of visits to\nthese sites are referred by Facebook 3.2% are through Twitter [47]. A lack of pink slime on\nReddit and 4chan has been documented by researchers who believe it is due to the communities\non these platforms having higher media literacy [28].\nThose who have scraped news articles and analyzed the content of Metric Media sites (in\n2020) have found that front-page stories have a median age of 81 days, 97% of the articles are\nautogenerated data stories, and those that made it to the front page pertained to state and national\npolitics [54].\nResearch out of Stanford was the first to analyze news consumption of pink slime and found\nthat during the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, 3.7% of American adults visited at least one pink\nslime site [47]. Furthermore, Biden supporters and people under 30 were more likely to visit\nthese sites [47]. While living in a news desert was not a significant predictor of visiting a pink\nslime site, the distance from a visitor\u2019s self-reported location to that of the pink slime site was\nsmaller (506 miles) than the distance from the visitor to the authentic local news sites he visited\n(598.1 miles) [47]. Surprisingly, the consumption study also found that living in a news desert\nwas not a significant predictor of visiting a pink slime site [47]. Finally, the researcher found that\nwhile a minority of pink slime sites are about politics, those are the ones most visited [47].\nParent Organizations Five parent organizations control over 1,000 pink slime news domains\nwith the number of domains illustrated in 3.1. While these numbers are smaller than the Tow\nCenter for Digital Journalism\u2019s published list [9], that is because the sites that have never been\nshared in the datasets in this thesis were excluded as well as any sites pertaining to outside of the\nUnited States. The largest organization, Metric Media, along with the Star News Network have\n9\nconservative political leanings while the other three share liberal-leaning news.\nFigure 3.1: Ownership of pink slime sites, colored by U.S. political leaning\nFigure 3.2: News Articles and Journal Publications Mentioning the Pink Slime Phenomenon\nPublished Research Per Fig 3.2, very few peer reviewed articles have been published on the\ntopic of pink slime. Publications prior to 2019 focused on the auto-generation of news and\nconditions that allowed pink slime to gain a footing in the American news media ecosystem [33].\nMost of the articles published have been by news outlets who are appalled by the emergence of\nthis new threat; however, some peer reviewed publications on the topic exist.\nWhile there have been a few publications on how pink slime news is consumed by individuals\nsurrounding an election [47] [27] and who is funding it [4] [22], little remains known about the\nimpact these news sites have during non-election years and where the funding from these parent\norganizations is going. Furthermore, no research has been published documenting the spread of\nthese news sites on different social media platforms. Chapter 2 of this thesis addresses all of\nthose gaps.\n10\nSome research has analyzed what movements the parent organizations are supporting [47]\n[19]; however, we are left unaware of how to quantitatively compare this support and the maneu-\nvers used to authentic local news. Chapter 3 of this thesis answers this question.\nOne researcher has found that new pink slime sites can be uncovered through an expensive\nand tedious process of searching NewRelic IDs and Quantcast IDs [20]. A free and less intensive\nmethod of finding these sites is proposed and tested in Chapter 4.\nPBS published lessons plans aimed at school-aged children to teach them media literacy\non the subject of pink slime [5]. The effectiveness of those plans have not yet been tested,\nbut Chapter 5 performs this testing. Additionally, user studies looked at humans viewing pink\nslime sites to conclude that there are negative impressions of these sites after repeated exposure\n[53]. What remains absent from this study is how the pink slime sites rate with regards to\ntrustworthiness in comparison to authentic local news. Chapter 5 also addresses this concern.\nFinally, pink slime is a term for the hijacking of local news in the United States, but this\nphenomenon has been seen in other countries and regions around the world [14] [46] [17]. In\nthe final chapter (6), policy recommendations from the international incidents and based on the\nprevious 5 chapters are recommended.\nResearch findings and gaps are referenced in Fig 3.3 as well as which chapter of this thesis\nwill address those gaps.\nFigure 3.3: Current Research Gaps\nFuture Work Future work for this chapter will involve actively following the research land-\nscape of pink slime\u2019s academically published works and journalism\u2019s shared news on the topic.\n11\nTable 3.1: Facebook Ads Over Time\nYear Number of Ads Total Impressions Total Ad Spend\n2018 364 1,301,818 $21,218\n2019 1,130 3,313,935 $73,535\n2020 1,960 25,785,521 $275,320\n2021 1,735 14,787,133 $158,883\n2022 3,640 42,881,181 $722,980\n2023 1,396 18,617,304 $543,402\n3.1.3 Challenges and Limitations\nThis chapter will need to continuously evolve until the dissertation is complete so that new arti-\ncles published will be included and addressed in corresponding chapters.\n3.2 Characteristics of Pink Slime (Ch. 2)\n3.2.1 Research Questions\nThe key research questions for this chapter is:\n\u2022What has pink slime infiltrated communities the most?\n\u2022What are the network characteristics of pink slime?\n\u2022How are these sites shared differently on different platforms?\n\u2022How do their network features look different from other news types?\n3.2.2 Methods and Proposed Work\nImpact This chapter begins by describing the impact of pink slime via all of the Facebook ads\nthe parent organizations have purchased and posts to public Facebook pages and groups that link\nto pink slime websites. The amount of ad spend and impressions - demonstrated in Table 3.1 -\nillustrates the importance of understanding the changes over time. While most academic litera-\nture focuses on pink slime during the most recent presidential election year (2020), less than 10\nmillion impressions were garnered on ads in that year. The year of the midterm elections (2022)\nsaw a strong increase in the ad spend and over 20 million impressions. These sites are only be-\nginning to pick up traction, and general trends of these ads and posts are summarized by parent\norganization in Figure 3.4. Furthermore, ad spend by these organizations on Facebook was over\n10 times higher in January 2024 than January 2022, which implies there will be a stronger effort\nduring the 2024 election year.\nIn order to analyze the messaging of these impactful ads, I broke down the content within\nFacebook ad messaging across the years and populated the frequency of messaging into a word\ncloud. I first pre-processed the text in the messaging to remove stopwords and URLs, before\n12\nFigure 3.4: An over time plot of (i) Ad Spend (ii) Group Posts Linking to Pink Slime Site (iii)\nPage Posts Linking to Pink Slime Sites by Organization\nusing Python\u2019s wordcloud package1to formulate the word cloud including the top 100 words,\nsized by frequency of appearance. Figure 3.5 illustrates the changing focus of topics in election\nand off-election years. Throughout all of the years, the most targeted states (\u2018Texas\u2019, \u2018Michigan\u2019,\n\u2018Georgia\u2019, \u2018Arizona\u2019, \u2018Florida\u2019, \u2018Wisconsin\u2019, and more) remain as top terms. One key tactic used\nis to write ads with the same message but switching out the name of the state for the one that\nis being targeted in the ad. For example, some of the ads run in 2022 had the following titles:\n\u201c\u2018Inflation has shot up a staggering 13.2%\u2019 since Biden took office, Arizona\u2019s CPI at 13%\u201d ,\n\u201c\u2018Inflation has shot up a staggering 13.2%\u2019 since Biden took office, Michigan\u2019s CPI at 8.1%\u201d, \u201c3\nin 5 Americans concerned about housing affordability, North Carolina\u2019s average rent up 30%\u201d,\nand \u201c3 in 5 Americans concerned about housing affordability, Wisconsin\u2019s average rent up 17%.\u201d\nDuring election years, ad spending increased drastically, and the conversations naturally turn\npolitical. While the presidential candidates\u2019 names were not at the forefront of the 2020 con-\nversation, there was a focus on the phrase Catholic . The ads containing references to \u2018Catholic\u2019\nwere mostly run in September and October 2020 by the Metric Media organization, leading into\nthe appointment of Catholic Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The top two of these\nads, garnering 125,000 and 50,000 impressions, respectively, were titled \u2018President Trump ad-\ndresses Catholics directly\u2019 and \u2018Catholic V ote: Biden\u2019s anti-school choice stance should worry\nWI Catholic school parents\u2019; the \u2018Catholic\u2019 phrase was indirectly used to support President\nTrump\u2019s re-election.\nDuring the midterms in 2022, President Biden was the top phrase, with secondary attention\npaid to key economic issues like \u2018inflation\u2019, \u2018gas\u2019 , and \u2018prices\u2019. The top two of these ads (ran\nby Metric Media) garnered 300,000 total impressions with the title \u2018As Pennsylvanians receive\nfourth stimulus check, Pigott points out negative real wage growth: \u2019Joe Biden is the pay cut\npresident\u201d. Much like the 2020 efforts to use the Catholic narrative into praise for President\nTrump, the 2022 tactic was to use negative economic news to undermine President Biden (and\nthe Democratic party) ahead of the midterm election.\nAd expenditure during the years between elections drastically diminished, and the discourse\nfocuses more on \u201ccourt\u201d. These ads highlighted state supreme and high courts, and are not\nnecessarily political or partisan in nature. For example, \u2018Appeals court vacates ruling against\nParkways Authority over Turnpike toll fees\u2019 received 10,000 impressions in 2023. This strategy\nmay be to establish the Facebook Pages sharing the news as a nonpartisan, trustworthy local news\noutlet when they aren\u2019t actively trying to push a political message, and to keep the organizations\n1https://pypi .org/project/wordcloud/\n13\nTable 3.2: State variables and their Pearson correlation to 2022 pink slime ad spend\nVariable Correlation Significance\n2020 Voter Spread -0.42 0.004\nCities Over 100k Population 0.09 0.54\nPercent of Population Living in Rural Areas -0.12 0.43\nPercent of Population with a Bachelors Degree -0.008 0.96\n2020 GDP 0.13 0.39\nMedian Age of State -0.08 0.61\nMarch 2020 Governor\u2019s Party -0.17 0.27\nElectoral College V otes 0.17 0.25\nactive and visible to the Facebook audience even during the down time.\nFigure 3.5: Wordclouds of the top 100 words used in Facebook ads by Pink Slime Organizations\nover Time\nWith the advertising expenditure segregated by states in Figure 3.6 , I analyze the expenditure\nper state. I observe that three of the five organizations purchased Facebook ads, and Metric\nMedia was the only organization to consistently purchase ads across all time periods. Courier\npurchased ads through 2020, and American Independent purchased ads in 2022 and 2023. All of\nthe organizations who purchased ads targeted Pennsylvania - a key swing state that determined\nBiden\u2019s 2020 victory over Trump. Other swing states, like Michigan, Georgia, and Wisconsin\nwere targeted by two of the three organizations.\nThe top ten states by ad spend (from highest to lowest) are Wisconsin, Georgia, Texas, Ari-\nzona, Pennsylvania, Iowa, California, Missouri, Michigan, and North Carolina.\nWhile swing states are a likely place to target during election years, other states\u2019 significance\nwas seen as a result of isolated events. For example, Courier spent $33,998 in ads to Iowa in\n2020.\nWhen analyzing the relationship between a state\u2019s attributes and the amount pink slime orga-\nnizations spent to influence that state via ads in 2022, I find in Table 3.2 that the only statistically\nsignificant (p-value \u00a1 0.05) relationship is the 2020 presidential voter spread of a state. This\nindicates that pink slime organizations are attempting to exert influence in the closest of races.\nFinally, to see how the ad spend influenced organic conversation, Figure 3.7 was generated to\ncompare the amount of money spent promoting a given pink slime domain via Facebook ads and\nthe number of times that domain appeared in a Facebook group. A linear trend line ( R2= 0.35)\nindicates a weak positive correlation between the two measures.\n14\nFigure 3.6: Advertising Expenditure by State\nFigure 3.7: Number of Instances a Pink Slime Domain Appears in a Facebook Group by Ad\nSpend for those Domains\n15\nFacebook Twitter Reddit\nPosts 28,178 1,383,896 16,375\nPosts with News URLs 17,268 851,828 7,811\nTable 3.3: Number of links with labels in the midterms dataset by platform\nNews Type Facebook Twitter Reddit\nReal News 65.6% 78.7% 89.5%\nLocal News 29.3% 13.8% 9.7%\nPink Slime 1.1% 2.3% 0.1%\nLow Credibility News 4.1% 5.3% 0.6%\nTable 3.4: Breakdown of news types shared on the three platforms, as percentages of the amount\nof each news type site as a total of the number of sites shared within each platform.\nHow pink slime differs from other news types To understand how pink slime spreads differ-\nently from other news types on different platforms, a case study was performed on the midterms\ndataset.\nDuring the 2022 U.S. Midterm elections, posts pertaining to contentious elections and linking\nto external URLs were collected from Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit; the number of links from\neach platform can be seen in Table 3.3.\nIn analyzing the breakdown of news type shared by platform (see Fig. 3.4), it was discovered\nthat all of the platforms studied had some pink slime news shared to them.\nWhile pink slime sites make up a very small percentage of news shared on these platforms,\nthey are disproportionately shared to smaller Facebook pages than other news types. Table 3.5\nshows how 85% of pink slime site shares are to the smallest 50% of the Facebook pages.\nDue to the differences in size of the audience it was shared to, their relative engagement\nshould be considered; if a post gets 100 likes in a group of 100 people, it\u2019s a hit, but if a post\ngets 100 likes in a group of 1,000,000 people it\u2019s a flop. On Facebook, I define the relative\nengagement as the number of likes a post received divided by the size of the group the post was\nshared to. When the relative engagement of posts are separated by news type, an alarming trend\nemerges in Fig. 3.8 - pink slime receives a greater relative engagement than any other news\ntype. This news is resonating with its audience, and real news is not.

Across all platforms,\nthe most likely outcome is for a user to continue to share content within the same news type\ncategory.\nHowever, there are some differences between the platforms. Outside of sharing the same\ncontent as previously shared, subreddits have a higher chance of going between sharing real\nnews and local news. None of the subreddits who shared local news in this dataset also shared\npink slime, and vice versa.\nOn Facebook, pink slime posters would also share local news and real news sites, which may\ngive the pink slime more credibility in the eyes of the viewers.\nGiven that Twitter had the most posts in this dataset, its users were split into two categories\nbefore news spread was analyzed - bot accounts and accounts that were not bots under the delini-\nation of [50]. Surprisingly, the behavior between bots and non-bots remained consistent. Pink\nslime was co-shared with all news types on Twitter, with a high likelihood of users sharing pink\nslime and low credibility news one after the other.\nI filtered down the dataset to exclusively include agents on all platforms (Facebook, Reddit,\nand Twitter) who shared posts to pink slime sites to better understand the online behavior of\nthese individuals. In Figure 3.11, using visualization software ORA [30] [16], the network of\nsuch accounts to the links they shared is visualized. The agents (gray nodes) link to the different\nnews types. The blue nodes represent real news, green represents local news, red represents low\ncredibility news, and pink represents pink slime domains. The pink slime domains are labeled,\nand they are split between two inner-connected components.\n17\nTwitter FacebookRedditFigure 3.9: User likelihood (represented by line thickness) of sharing one news type based on\nprevious news type shared by platform.\nFigure 3.10: Percentage of users who by platform and news type of continue to post within the\nsame news type (i.e., self-loops).\nThe pink slime domains in the right component are all under the control of parent organiza-\ntions pushing politically right-leaning news. Grandcanyontimes.com and keystonetoday.com are\ncontrolled by Metric Media. Georgiastarnews.com, theohiostar.com, and tennesseestar.com are\nall owned by the Star News Network.\nThe pink slime domains in the left component are all under the control of parent organiza-\ntions pushing politically left-leaning news. Coppercourier.com, keystonenewsroom.com, cardi-\nnalpine.com, and upnorthnewswi.com are all controlled by the Courier Newsroom. This visual\ndivision suggests that the news spread is not done along regional lines (a component along each\nof the six states in the dataset) but rather along political lines.\nTo further assess this phenomenon, the agents in the subset of users sharing pink slime were\nlabeled as \u201dLeft\u201d for those sharing left-leaning pink slime sites, \u201dRight\u201d for those sharing right-\nleaning pink slime sites, and \u201dBoth\u201d for the agents who shared pink slime sites from parent\norganizations on both sides of the political spectrum. For each of the three agent types, the\ndistribution of news types that they shared as a total of all of the links they posted was calculated\nand can be seen in Figure 3.12.\nBy inspection, agents sharing left-leaning pink slime sites shared more local news and less\nlow credibility news than those sharing right-leaning pink slime sites. To understand if there\nwas a significant difference in this distribution, we used a Chi-Squared test to compare the three\ndistributions.\n18\nLeft-Leaning  \nPink Slime \nSitesRight-Leaning \nPink Slime \nSitesFigure 3.11: News sources shared by users (including all platforms) who shared pink slime\ndomains.

While most of the work has been completed, there are some challenges in finding\ndifferences in the backlink behavior between pink slime and authentic local news sites.\n3.3 BEND Maneuvers of Pink Slime (Ch. 3)\n3.3.1 Research Questions\nThe key research questions for this chapter is:\n\u2022What BEND maneuvers are pink slime sites utilizing?\n\u2022How do these maneuvers vary from platform to platform?\n\u2022Do maneuvers differ between parent organizations or topic?\n\u2022What linguistic cues can be included to identify the proper maneuvers?\n\u2022How do the maneuvers compare to those of local news organizations?\n3.3.2 Methods and Proposed Work\nThe CASOS Center at Carnegie Mellon University has produced substantial research in the field\nof categorizing online influence operations; they have published a set of 16 defined maneuvers\nutilized in influence operations, referred to as the BEND framework [29]. The 16 categories can\nbe broken into narrative (based on the text messaging and the way in which it is presented) and\nnetwork (based on the way in which the messaging is spread and communities are formed around\n20\nFigure 3.13: Definitions of the 16 BEND Maneuvers, adapted from [24], [25], and discussions\nwith the authors.\nthe key actors) maneuvers. Each of the letters includes four maneuvers of the same starting\ninitial. The B maneuvers (Back, Build, Bridge, and Boost) are positive network maneuvers. The\nE maneuvers (Engage, Explain, Excite, and Enhance) represent positive narrative maneuvers.\nThe N maneuvers (Neutralize, Negate, Narrow, and Neglect) are utilized via negative network\nmeans. Finally, the D maneuvers (Dismiss, Distort, Dismay, and Distract) are negative narrative\nmaneuvers. Their individual definitions can be found in Figure 3.13. This framework allows for\na more defined, measured, and analytical way to compare ways in which influence tactics are\nemployed in information operations.\nWhile BEND has largely been utilized for analyzing behavior on Twitter (such as narratives\naround vaccines [26], the Chinese balloon incidents [49], and events in Indonesia [35]), this\nresearch will implement the methodology to categorize the maneuvers of sharers of the four\nnews types used throughout this thesis on Twitter, Facebook , and Reddit .\nWhen BEND is applied to Twitter data, the networks that the maneuvers were built on were\nfor User x User by shared hashtag, retweet, or reply. Due to the way in which Meta shares\nFacebook data via CrowdTangle, information about direct relationships between Facebook Pages\nwas unavailable. Instead, the network that was used for this study (Facebook Page x Domain x\nFacebook Page) is more limited because it does not imply a direct interaction between the two\nusers.\nTo ascertain whether differences exist between pink slime and local news shared on Face-\nbook, a proof of concept was devised for the below analysis. To find the news site domains I was\ninterested in studying, I consolidated a list of known pink slime sites [41] as well as the list of\nauthentic local news sites owned by companies [12]. Using the CrowdTangle API [3], for each\n21\nFigure 3.14: Percentage of Posts Using BEND Maneuvers by News Type\nof the domains on the list, the 1,000 most recent instances of a link to the domain being shared\non a Facebook Page was collected. In total 335,609 posts were collected from 12 pink slime\norganizations and 8 local news organizations. Of the 12 pink slime organizations, there were\n1,238 domains linked to from 285,640 posts. Of the 8 local news organizations, there were 50\ndomains linked to by 49.969 posts.\nAfter performing topic modeling on the titles of the shared links, the largest common topic\nfound pertained to elections. Since research shows that the most consumed pink slime sites are\nthose pertaining to politics [47] and in order to analyze how these two groups discussed the same\ntopic, the posts were filtered down to ones mentioning elections, judicial selections, and voting.\nThis left 385 posts linking to 47 local news domains and 465 posts linking to 76 different pink\nslime domains. The local news posts ranged from November 17, 2022 to January 12, 2022. The\npink slime posts ranged from January 27, 2020 to May 12, 2023. The posts linking to local news\nsites averaged a higher number of likes (27.2) than that of pink slime (21.7).\nTable 3.14 illustrates the percentage of Facebook posts that contain each of the BEND Ma-\nneuvers (a note that a post can contain multiple BEND Maneuvers).\nBoth groups had over half of their messages falling in the Distract category. While less than\n20% of documents had each of the B maneuvers, the percentages utilized by local news and pink\nslime are fairly equal.\nTable 3.15 takes the values from Table 3.14 and subtracts the local news values from the\npink slime values. This shows how much more the pink slime posts are utilizing each BEND\nmaneuver more than the local news posts.\n22\nFigure 3.15: Increase in pink slime posts using BEND maneuvers over local news posts\nMost interestingly, many more pink slime posts utilize the Explain, Excite, Nuke, and Dis-\nmiss maneuvers than local news. Local news posts, however, were more heavily involved in\nthe Neutralize maneuver. Both groups had over half of their messages falling in the Distract\ncategory.\nFor those sharing pink slime sites, the Explain maneuver can be seen in titles like \u201cNinety-\nthree percent of Arizona Catholics say religion should not play a factor in judicial selection\u201d and\n\u201cTownsend: Audit of secretary of state\u2019s use of private funds in elections necessary \u2018to feel good\nabout yes vote\u2019 on budget.\u201d The text of these posts convey statistics or quotes that provide insight\ninto the topic. Meanwhile the messaging around Excite can be seen in posts like \u201cAllen: \u2018We\nmust restore our trust in the election process\u2019\u201d and \u201cCoyne: \u2018We are thrilled with this year\u2019s local\nelection results and are very proud of whatever impact we had in producing them\u2019\u201d Much like\nwith the Explain posts, the titles for Excite rely heavily on quotes. The narrative is one meant to\nbring positive emotion towards the audience. More than half of the messages fall into the Explain\nand Excite categories, keeping a majority of the messaging positive in sentiment. The remainder\nof maneuvers analyzed fall into the categorization of negative in their influence.\nExamples of pink slime sites being shared with a Nuke message include \u201cArizona legislators\nprotest election results, request decertification\u201d and \u201cKansas legislature overrides Kelly\u2019s veto of\nelection integrity bill.\u201d When the Dismiss maneuver is analyzed for the pink slime sites, examples\ninclude \u201cHarbin: Georgia is experiencing \u2018more election irregularities because our Secretary of\nState could not get the job done\u2019\u201d and \u201cNagel: \u2018Democrats in Springfield are offering temporary\nelection year gimmicks that attempt to trick voters instead of truly help them\u2019\u201d, the later of which\n23\nlinks to an article owned by the LGIS pink slime organization targeting a small city in Illinois.\nBy referring to the state\u2019s capitol (Springfield), it gives the appearance of local news coverage;\nhowever, the same author also wrote articles for a different pink slime organization, Media Met-\nric, targeting Grand Haven, Michigan. These Dismiss campaigns are aimed at minimizing the\nefforts of individuals or groups.\nWhen the maneuvers for local news are analyzed, Neutralize (the largest increase over pink\nslime) is seen in messages like \u201cTrump: People who think 2020 election was fair are \u2018very\nstupid\u2019\u201d, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s response to criminal charges revives election lies\u201d and \u201cSchool elec-\ntions are now political: NYC Community and Education Council voting is getting too nasty.\u201d\nBroadly, these messages are designed to reduce positive messaging on a topic or individual.\nBoth of the groups utilized the Distract maneuver heavily, a narrative maneuver that attempts\nto make other topics seem more important through misdirection. For pink slime this was seen\nin messaging like \u201cRats and needles hot election issue in Rogers Park Aldermanic race\u201d and\n\u201cKansas challenger for secretary of state: Opponent\u2019s refusal to sign election integrity pledge\n\u2018should be a red flag for any Republican voter\u2019\u201d. In local news, Distract looks like \u201cBiden\nlaunches 2024 campaign; jury selection to start in Trump rape lawsuit; N. Dakota\u2019s near total\nabortion ban; and more morning headlines\u201d (linking to an Idaho-based local news site) and \u201cDid\nthey vote twice in the 2022 election? RI investigating 5 cases of potential double voting.\u201d\nFor both sites controlled by pink slime organizations and sites controlled by organizations\nowning multiple local news domains, the top-ranking BEND maneuver utilized was Distract - a\nnegative narrative maneuver. However, pink slime sites used distraction in messaging pertaining\nto local and state elections while the local news sites had a greater focus on national elections\nand events in other regions. Surprisingly, mentions of former President Trump were see in 3.2%\nof posts linking to pink slime sites, but he appeared in 8.1% of local news headlines; current\nPresident Biden was mentioned in only 1.5% of pink slime sites but in 8.6% of pink slime text.\nInterestingly, sites controlled by pink slime organizations were shared on Facebook with\nmore positive messaging than posts from local news organizations. Explaining and excite were\nutilized to highlight facts and nuance from both hyper-local and national political topics. When\nthey used negative messaging through Dismiss, not-local reporters highlighted reasons of local\nconcern to dismiss efforts by political parties.\nFacebook Pages sharing local news sites heavily utilized the Neutralize maneuver to dismiss\npositive stories about national politicians and local organizations.\nThis current analysis only includes a few hundred Facebook posts and is limited to comparing\npink slime and local news.\nFuture work After finding that there aredifferences in BEND maneuvers that pink sime sites\nand local news sites use to discuss elections, I chose to expand this research to include more\nvariables. Future work for this chapter will involve performing a BEND analysis on the midterms\ndataset - comparing BEND maneuvers used on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook and how it varies\nacross the four news types discussed in Chapter 2 - low credibility news, real news, pink slime,\nand local news.\n24\n3.3.3 Challenges and Limitations\nChallenges for this chapter involve include the appropriate network features from both Facebook\nand Reddit to create a community maneuver network that rivals Twitter\u2019s mentioning network.\nThis will involve several attempts at trying different networks to find the one that shows coor-\ndination. Furthermore, new linguistic cues will be need to be generated as the research evolves.\nLimitations are primarily within the datasets I possess. Specifically, the Facebook and Twitter\ndatasets are different because while Twitter has user-level posts, Facebook has page and group\nlevel posts. This may lead to differences in how BEND can be measured when they are compared\nto one another.\n3.4 Finding New Sources of Pink Slime (Ch. 4)\n3.4.1 Research Questions\nThe key research question for this chapter is:\n\u2022How can we detect new sources of pink slime sites?\n3.4.2 Methods and Proposed Work\nAcademic research into site credibility algorithms can serve as an inspiration to understanding\nmethods to find relevant websites of interest. In a precursor to PageRank, Kleinberg proposed a\nmodel that found authoritative webpages for search topics by analyzing the relationship between\n\u201cauthorities for a topic and those pages that link to many related authorities ... [called] hubs\u201d\n[43]. Using the reasoning that \u201chubs and authorities exhibit what could be called a mutually\nreinforcing relationship: a good hub is a page that points to many good authorities; a good\nauthority is a page that is pointed to by many good hubs\u201d [43], they created a hub score that\nincorporated the authority scores of the nodes pointing to it. Likewise, they gave nodes a high\nhub score if it linked to nodes that are authorities on the subject. While others have taken these\nmethods and applied them to citation networks and ranking academic journals, this research sets\nabout viewing certain Facebook pages as hubs of disinformation and building out the network of\nauthorities that they share.\nWhen looking at networks of Facebook pages to the parent organization of the pink slime\nsites they shared, there are many Facebook pages that are posting links to pink slime sites owned\nby multiple parent organizations. One such Facebook page, \u201cDemocrats of the Alachua County\nArea\u201d, linked to 5 different parent organizations of pink slime sites. Most of the Facebook pages\nsharing these sites were smaller (under 1,000 followers) and targeted a hyper-local area. See Fig.\n3.16. Additionally, Chapter 2 shows us that agents sharing pink slime are most likely to follow\nup by posting more pink slime.\nThe methodology for this research involves creating network features of the news domains to\nsignal their credibility based on which hubs are sharing the authorities and what other authorities\nthose hubs were sharing. In this research, Facebook pages act as the hubs, and the domains they\nshare are the authorities. The labeled news domains are utilized to test the validity of the features.\n25\nFigure 3.16: Network visual of Facebook Pages linking to Parent Organizations of Pink Slime\nSites\nFrom there, the larger, unlabeled domain dataset was analyzed using the set of features to find\nnew source of pink slime.\nIn order to determine the credibility of domains, the following equation was implemented.\nFirst, each Facebook Page present in the dataset was given a score to indicate the proportion\nof content it shared that originated from a known source of low credibility news or pink slime\n(Noncredible Sharer Score). The higher the Noncredible Sharer Score, the lower the credibility\nof the Facebook Page. Then, the domains could be scored by averaging the Noncredible Sharer\nScore of the pages that shared the domain.\nA common use case for this scoring algorithm would be to upload a Facebook dataset for\ntopic of interest, run the algorithm and find the Noncredibility Scores, and then sort by descend-\ning Noncredibility Scores. This ranks sites from lowest credibility and is a place where the\nanalyst can then use visual inspection and visit some of the highest scoring domains.\nNoncredible Sharer Score k=1\nnnX\nj=1Ij (3.1)\nIj=(\n1ifdomain j is a labeled pink slime or low credibility news site\n0otherwise\nwhere kis Facebook Page linking to domains and nis the number of domains shared by Facebook\nPage k\nNoncredibility Scorez=1\n|K|X\nk=1Noncredible Sharer Score k (3.2)\n26\nwhere Kis the set of Facebook Pages sharing a given unlabeled domain and znumber of\nunlabeled domain shared by a Facebook Page\nIn meta-network terms, in a network that linked Domains to Domains by the Facebook Pages\nthat shared them (Domain x Facebook Page x Domain), the Noncredibility Score for any given\ndomain would be the percentage of first degree neighbors that were known sources of pink slime\nor fake news.\nFor example, a page that shared 5 news articles, none of which link to domains that were\nlabeled as fake news was assigned a score of zero. However, if a page shared 10 news articles and\n5 of the articles were to domains labeled as fake news, that Facebook Page would be assigned\na Noncredible Sharer Score of 0.50. Each Facebook Page that shared a domain had its score\naveraged to assign the domain a Noncredibility Score.\nThese network features, as well as those described in the Data Description, were utilized as\ninputs in a machine learning model to predict whether or not a domain in the dataset was pink\nslime. 70% of the known sources of fake news, pink slime, and real news are utilized in training\nthe model to see if they can accurately predict the legitimacy of the 30% of withheld domains.\nThe 30% of withheld domains are treated as unlabeled news sources during the calculation of\nthe network measures. The XGBoost model, an open-source implementation of the gradient\nboosted trees algorithm, is used to perform the training and validation due to its high efficiency\nand accuracy [13].\nTo see if the labels of \u201cpink slime\u201d, \u201creal news\u201d, and \u201clow credibility news\u201d could be pre-\ndicted using the features extracted in the Data Description and Methods sections, a Naive esti-\nmator that assigned classifications to the dominant class (real news) was used as a baseline to\ncompare to another estimator, the XGBoost model. In comparison, the XGBoost model demon-\nstrated an increase in differentiating classification between real news and fake news. Low cred-\nibility news and real news saw an uptick in precision and recall when the actual estimator was\nused. However, class imbalance played a role in the classification of pink slime. Due to the\nextremely low support for pink slime instances in the dataset, the model struggled to find a\nthreshold for pink slime that increased the model\u2019s accuracy.\nWhile the accuracy value of the pink slime classification was low, the overall intent of the\nfeatures are to use them as a starting point of analysis to find higher likelihood domains faster.\nSince the goal of this research isn\u2019t to do human-out-of-the-loop, the accuracy scores don\u2019t paint\nthe entire picture of the model\u2019s performance. The below Figure 3.17 illustrates the strength of\nthe model in predicting pink slime (despite the low occurrence) through the ROC curve. Overall\nits area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 provides an acceptable value to use the network features\nof the model as a ranking heuristic in large scale data analysis [40]. When looking at how well\nthe model could predict the presence of fake news, the ROC curve is slightly stronger with an\nAUC of 0.78.The presence of real news was similarly well predicted to that of pink slime. The\nROC curve, with its AUC of 0.77 shows an ability for this approach to be generalizable to these\nthree difference news types.\nWhen analyzing the feature importance of the variables included in the model, only two had\nan effect greater than there. The strongest one was the domain\u2019s Noncredibility Score. The other\nattribute, with 25 times less importance, was the average number of likes a post from the domain\nreceived. These results validate that using a network-based approach to assessing credibility can\nbe used to predict news labels.\n27\nFigure 3.17: ROC Curve of Predicting Pink Slime\nThe primary function of the attributes discussed was to apply these measures to new datasets\nto quickly rank and assess probable new pink slime news agencies.Labeled pink slime sites\nare a small minority of the labeled news sources in a given dataset. Due to the issue of class\nimbalance, the general results for predicting pink slime show low accuracy but promising AUC\ncurves. Given these results, using the model itself is not to output a list of two possible pink\nslime sites in a dataset of tens of thousands of domains. Rather, the intent is to apply the new\nattributes to new datasets and sort by the Noncredibility Score for a shorter, more targeted list\nof potential new pink slime sites. While it did not show measurable effect on the model, the\nattribute describing whether a domain contains a location can still be used as a filter for the\nquickest analysis.\nFuture work Future work for this chapter would be to apply this methodology to the Twitter\nand Reddit midterm datasets and develop platform-specific alterations depending on the accu-\nracy. Additionally, more features of the dataset will be tested to see if they can improve the\nAUC.\n3.4.3 Challenges and Limitations\nThe primary challenge in this chapter is finding datasets with a representative amount of pink\nslime (as seen in Chapter 2, this is less than 1% of news sites shared during elections) such that\na 30% holdout will allow for enough class balance to have strong results.\n28\n3.5 Training Humans to Detect Pink Slime (Ch. 5)\n3.5.1 Research Questions\nThe existence of pink slime alone is not a threat. However, the human consumption and spread\nof these sites is a danger. This chapter looks to see how humans process encountering pink slime\non social media through a field study as part of Project OMEN. They will take a test to measure\ntheir trust of pink slime and local news before and after a training to see what impact the training\nhas on their level of trust and awareness of these sites.\nWhile previous research shows us that humans who visit pink slime sites directly have a\nnegative impression of the sites with repeated exposure over 6 days going to the same site [53],\nno further human subject testing has been performed to understand user impression of these sites\nin the format through which they are most frequently shared - social media posts. Additionally,\nwhile news literacy groups have published lessons plans on how to explain pink slime [5] no\nresearch has been done to assess the impact this type of training has on a user\u2019s ability to identify\npink slime.\nThe key research questions in this chapter are:\n\u2022What is the difference in trust a human has for local news versus pink slime?\n\u2022Does trust in pink slime news change after a user visits the pink slime link?\n\u2022Can we train human users to identify pink slime campaigns?\n3.5.2 Methods and Proposed Work\nAn ongoing project with the Office of Naval Research has been to simulate an information op-\neration environment, teach analysts how to assess vast quantity of online data, and observe their\nability to find bad actors and malicious information campaigns. The game\u2019s objectives and setup\ncan be found in [42]. As part of the measurement of effectiveness of training, a pre and post\ntest of media literacy has been conducted. 23 participants viewed 16 generic social media posts\nincluding 4 low credibility news posts, 4 real news posts, 4 local news posts, and 4 pink slime\nposts. Topics were selected to be apolitical and include the following topics: covid and vaccina-\ntion, climate change, and the Ohio train derailment. For stories with external links, participants\nare allowed to visit the websites. For each posts, the participants must answer a series of ques-\ntions including:\n\u2022How trustworthy do you consider the poster of this message to be?\nTrustworthy\nSomewhat trustworthy\nNeither trustworthy nor untrustworthy\nSomewhat untrustworthy\nUntrustworthy\n\u2022Do you believe the post was written by a local reporter?\nYes\n29\nNo\nUnsure\nAfter the pretest, the participants were given a 31-minute training adapted from PBS [5] to\ninclude defining pink slime journalism, visiting multiple pink slime sites owned by different par-\nent organizations, fact-checking a story mass-produced on Metric Media, and (per the research\nin Chapter 4) network features of the sites in ORA Figure 3.18.\nFigure 3.18: ORA interface for running the network features described in Chapter 4 as part of\nthe lesson plan\nAfter the training, the participants were given a post test with 16 new social media posts\n(with the same news type distribution). While participants accurately answered that local news\nposts were written by a local reporter 74% of the time, they only identified pink slime posts\nas not being written by a local reporter 21% of the time. In the post test, participants identified\nlocal news posts as written by a local reporter 65% of the time (a drop from the pretest); however,\nparticipants also correctly identified pink slime posts as notwritten by a local reporter 86% of the\ntime, as illustrated in Figure 3.19. Furthermore, since research shows that exposure to malicious\nnews types can lead to a corroded trust of credible news sources [52], we were interested in\nseeing if an awareness of pink slime journalism would lessen the participants\u2019 trust in authentic\nlocal news. Using the trustworthy question where \u201dTrustworthy\u201d as assigned a value of 1 and\n\u201dUntrustworthy\u201d was assigned a value of 5, we found that prior to the training, participants rated\nlocal news posts as an average of 2.2 and pink slime posts as 2.5 on the trustworthy scale. After\nthe training, trust of local news actually improved to a value of 2.1, while pink slime was rated\n30\na 4.2, indicating that the training had the intended affect of keeping trust in authentic local news\nhigh while increasing awareness of pink slime journalism\u2019s un-trustworthiness.\nFigure 3.19: Participants\u2019 ability to correctly identify pink slime and local news before and after\ntraining\nFuture work Further analysis will focus on whether participants\u2019 responses for trust levels in\nthe pink slime increased or decreased depending on if they clicked the embedded news story\nURLs and whether trust in local news decreased after the training. Statistical analyses will be\nconducted to determine whether the training resulted in significant changes in the ability for\nparticipants to identify pink slime.\n3.5.3 Challenges and Limitations\nThe main challenge will be having enough participants to have strong results.\n3.6 Conclusions and Recommendations (Ch. 6)\n3.6.1 Research Questions\nThis chapter will highlight key findings from the previous 5 chapters as well as look outwardly to\nother countries facing issues similar to pink slime to generate policy recommendations for how\nto maintain the institution of authentic local news and discredit pink slime.\nThe key research question in this chapter is:\n\u2022What have other countries done to control pink slime?\n\u2022What policies could decrease the threat of pink slime?\n31\n3.6.2 Methods and Proposed Work\nWhile pink slime has not been an internationally-adopted phrase, the tenants of purporting to\nbe local news but controlled by a larger national entity to sway public opinion is not a uniquely\nAmerican phenomenon. In 2019, the European External Action Service\u2019s East Stratcom (an EU\nDisinformation Task Force) disclosed that 265 fake local news sites operating in 65 countries\nwere under the control of an Indian influence campaign to undermine international support for\nPakistan [14]. Much like American pink slime, these sites had domains with local areas em-\nbedded, published stories that were largely copy and pasted as local news to different areas, and\nhad social media presence. Some even acquired previous authentic local news domains after the\nnewspapers went out of business. The task force made policy recommendations and urged for\nreform to the domain name industry.\nIn early 2024, it was discovered that China had created over 100 \u2018local\u2019 news sites in 30 coun-\ntries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America to spread pro-Beijing content as part of an information\noperations campaign[1]. Efforts by Russia to influence local communities in Europe [46] and\na campaign to hijack German local news [17] have been seen in the past, and will be analyzed\n(along with resulting policy changes) in this chapter.\nAdditionally, Some outlets have labeled pink slime as misinformation [45], and it\u2019s worth\nconsidering the approaches that misinformation and other low credibility news researchers have\ntaken to combat fake news - nudges, fact checking, debunking, de-platforming - and seeing how\nwell they would translate to the pink slime ecosystem based on the research in Chapters 1-5.\n3.6.3 Challenges and Limitations\nNot all of the international incidents seen have generalizable nor applicable policy recommenda-\ntions to the United States\u2019 pink slime phenomenon, and these limitatations will be discussed in\nthis chapter.\n32\nChapter 4\nContributions\n4.1 Theoretical Contributions\nThe first theoretical contribution is a definition of pink slime and the conditions that allowed\nthis phenomenon to gain success in online spaces. Secondly, through the human user studies, it\ncontributes an understanding of human trust of pink slime sites as well as an evaluation of the\nimpact of training on users\u2019 abilities to detect pink slime sites. The final theoretical contribution\nof the thesis is a set of policy recommendations for countering pink slime.\n4.2 Methodological Contributions\nThe methodological contributions for this thesis are the creation of a hop-based method to dis-\ncover low credibility news sites that is generalizable to not only pink slime but also assessing low\ncredibility news and real news sites via the Noncredibility Score. Additionally, it will contribute\nthe methodology to apply the BEND framework to Facebook posts and categorize pink slime\nsites (as well as local news ones) into narrative and network maneuvers.\n4.3 Empirical Contributions\nThis is the first large scale empirical assessment of the spread of pink slime sites on social media\nand the communities they targeted in online spaces during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election\nand the 2022 U.S. Midterm election. It is also the first study showing pink slime spread on\nmultiple platforms. Additionally, it contributes the quantitative measurement of impact of pink\nslime funding on organic community conversation.\n4.4 Data Contributions\nThis thesis also offers several dataset contributions. It will be publishing the largest collection of\nFacebook posts sharing pink slime sites from 2019-2023. This includes over a million posts from\nevery public Facebook account, page, and group that have ever shared a pink slime news article\n33\nalong with the engagement information and metadata representing which locale the pink slime\nsite that was shared was targeting. The thesis also includes a dataset of over 4,000 ads purchased\nby pink slime organizations to promote their news articles including the targeted demographic,\namount of money spent on the ads, and the number of impressions it received. This dataset\nwill allow future researchers to join the two datasets to similarly understand the relationship\nbetween ad spend by these organizations and the organic conversations they generate in online\nspaces. Additionally, the thesis provides a collection of posts from Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter\nshowing over 17,000 posts to pink slime sites during the 2022 U.S. midterm election.\n4.5 Limitations\nThere are several important limitations to be addressed when proceeding with the scope of this\nthesis. The first is that the focus of pink slime sites will be limited to those targeting the United\nStates. While some of the research looks to similar cases in other countries for inspiration of how\nto address the issues, the United States is the focus and policy recommendations can be targeted\nto those capable of the U.S. government.\nSecond, the research is done largely on text in the English language since most of the social\nmedia platforms analyzed in the thesis contain posts written predominantly in English. Addi-\ntionally, with the focus of the research being limited to the United States, the pink slime websites\ncontain only English language articles. However, the methods proposed in Chapter 4 are de-\nsigned to be language-agnostic, only focusing on the network features.\nThird, this research is conducted using data from the social media platforms of Reddit, Face-\nbook, and Twitter. From the conclusions drawn in Chapter 2 that Reddit contains minimal pink\nslime spread, the Facebook and Twitter datasets are a greater focus for analysis in later chapters.\nIn recent years the APIs for these platforms have changed, and the methods utilized to acquire\nthe data are referenced in the Data section of this proposal. While other platforms like Parler,\nTelegram, and NextDoor may contain posts linking to pink slime sites, the first two do not make\nup a significant amount of referral traffic per the SEO findings, and the third does not have a\nmethod to acquire data via an API.\nFinally, this research is not focused on fact checking news articles that are shared by pink\nslime sites. The intent is to highlight that the stories shared by these platforms are those of a\nlarger, national interest. The information is not analyzed for its factual validity but rather for its\nmarketed duplicity as local news.\n34\nChapter 5\nProposed Timeline\nFigure 5.1 shows my proposed timeline from Spring 2024 through my projected thesis defense\nin December 2024.\nFigure 5.1: Planned timeline for work to be completed\n35\nBibliography\n[1] PAPERWALL: Chinese Websites Posing as Local News Outlets Target Global Au-\ndiences with Pro-Beijing Content - The Citizen Lab \u2014 citizenlab.ca. https:\n//citizenlab .ca/2024/02/paperwall-chinese-websites-posing-\nas-local-news-outlets-with-pro-beijing-content/ . 3.6.2\n[2] Ad library, .

They focused on the debate related to the spread\nfraud allegations and revealed structured communities with strong evidence of coordi-\nnation to promote (i.e., retweet) such claims. Then, they characterized the communities\nin terms of suspensions and content and \ufb01nd that bans imposed by the platform did not\nhavee\ufb00ectivelystoppedthespreadofminformation.Ourstudybroadensthefocustothe\nentire debate, uncovering coordinated communities and characterizing a wider range of\naspects beyond just topics and suspensions.

In this work we complement the existing analyses on the US 2020 election, byinvestigating coordinated communities that took part in the online debate from multi-\npleperspectives,including:thedegreeofcoordinationofthedi\ufb00erentcommunities,their\nTardellietal.

We demonstrate that simul-taneously examining all these aspects provides rich insights into the intent, activity, and\nharmfulnessofthedi\ufb00erenttypesofcoordinatedcommunities.\n2.2 Detectionandcharacterizationofcoordinatedbehavior\nFor the detection of coordinated behavior we adopt the methodology that we proposed\nin[9].OurapproachrevolvesaroundbuildingaTermFrequency-InverseDocument(TF-\nIDF) co-retweet network \ufb01ltered using a backbone strategy [ 33], on which we perform\ncommunity detection at di\ufb00erent coordination levels, so as to detect coordinated com-munities.Thepeculiarityofourmethodologywithrespecttoothersinliterature[ 10,12]\nisthatitprovidesanestimationoftheextentofcoordinationbetweenusers,ratherthana\nbinarydistinctionbetweencoordinatedandnon-coordinatedones.However,ourmethod\nhasthedrawbackofdemandingmanualandsubjectiveassessmentsoftheextentofcoor-\ndinationofeachdetectedcommunity[ 9].Inaddition,itfocusesonthedetectiontaskand\ndealsonlymarginallywiththecharacterizationofthedetectedcommunities.Ourpresent\nworkovercomesboththeselimitations.\nBesides our previous work, the authors of [ 10,12] adopted similar approaches by con-\nstructingusernetworksbasedoncommonbehavioraltracesandbyperformingcommu-\nnity detection. However, their methods involve imposing arbitrary thresholds to removelow-weightedges,whichdiscardssigni\ufb01cantportionsofthenetworkaswellasmanypo-\ntentially interesting traces of coordination. By applying \ufb01xed thresholds, these and other\napproaches [ 34,35] cast the coordination detection task as a binary problem, classifying\nusersandcommunitiesaseithercoordinatedornon-coordinated[ 8].However,coordina-\ntion within a community expresses the degree to which the actions and behaviors of the\ncommunitymemberscontributetowardsacommongoal[ 5,9].Ourresearchaimstocap-\nture this nuanced complexity. As such, we move beyond the binary classi\ufb01cation that is\npredominant in many state-of-the-art methods, allowing a deeper understanding of the\nmultifacetednatureofonlinecoordination[ 5,16].\nRecent studies focused on developing multilayer network frameworks to detect coor-\ndination. For instance, the authors in [ 14] leveraged three standard action types (i.e., co-\nhashtag,co-URL,andco-mention)andconstructedathree-viewnetworkbasedonthese\ninteractions. They considered highly synchronized actions occurring within a 5-minute\ntime frame and identi\ufb01ed the clusters with the highest density, which then visually in-\nspected.Similarworksexploredcross-platformcoordinatedbehaviorthroughmultilayernetworks,whereeachlayerrepresentedadi\ufb00erentsocialmediaplatforms[ 36,37].Other\nstudies[11,38]proposedmultilayernetworkswithatemporaldimension,witheachlayer\nrepresentingatimeframe,allowingtoanalyzetheevolutionofcoordinatedcommunities.Insummary,agrowingnumberofstudiesareconsideringthewidercomplexitiesinvolved\nincoordinatedbehaviorwithintheiranalyses.Thissuggestsatrendtowardsamorecom-\nprehensive approach in understanding these dynamics.

Similarities between users can be observed across many behav-ioral dimensions. Among them, retweeting behavior similarity is by far the most widelyused[12,29,41]. Similarlyto previouswork,wemeasureuser similarities based ontheir\nretweeting activity. In detail, each user is de\ufb01ned by the TF-IDF weighted vector of the\ntweetstheyretweeted.Pairwisesimilaritiesbetweenallusersarecomputedasthecosine\nsimilarity of their user vectors. The TF-IDF weighting scheme diminishes the in\ufb02uenceof widely popular (i.e., viral) tweets and ampli\ufb01es the contribution of retweets targetinglesspopulartweets.Thisapproachisparticularlye\ufb00ectiveatidentifyingsuspiciousbehav-iorsandcoordinationthatmanifestthroughtheretweetingofnot-so-popularposts[ 9].At\nthe same time, the methodology accountsfor the fact that sporadic retweets of the samecontent do not imply coordination. On the contrary, this method contributes to uncov-ering deeper, non-obvious patterns of behavior that might also be indicative of genuine\ncoordination,ratherthanmerehomophilyortheviralityofpopulartweets.\n4.1.3 Buildingtheusersimilaritynetwork\nPairwise similarities are converted into a weighted undirected user similarity network,which encodes behavioral and interaction patterns between users. Edge weights in thisnetworkareproxiesforthedegreeofcoordination[ 9,12,29].\n4.1.4 Filteringtheusersimilaritynetwork\nBeing based on pairwise similarities, user similarity networks are typically too big to beanalyzedstraightaway.Therefore,allnetwork-basedcoordinationdetectionframeworksincludea\ufb01lteringsteptopruneirrelevantedgesanddisconnectednodesfromthenetwork[9,12].Nizzolietal.proposeextractingthemultiscalebackbone[ 33]oftheusersimilarity\nnetwork as the \ufb01ltering technique. This approach allows retaining all statistically signi\ufb01-\ncant network structures, independently of their scale. As a result of the multiscale back-bone extraction, our \ufb01ltered user similarity network consists of 9911 nodes and 148,038edges.\nTardellietal.

In\nparticular,Nizzolietal.proposedtoperformLouvaincommunitydetectionwithinanit-\nerative network dismantling process [ 9]. This approach allows to analyze the structure\nand behavior of each coordinated community at all degrees of coordination. As such, it\nprovidesmorenuancedresultswithrespecttothemethodsthatapply\ufb01xedandarbitrary\nedgeweightthresholds,whichallowanalyzingonlyasinglesnapshotoftheusersimilar-\nity network.

EPJDataScience           (2024) 13:33 Page10of27\n4.2.1 Coordination\nMost state-of-the-art methods cast the coordination detection task as a binary problem,according to which users and communities are either coordinated or non-coordinated[12]. However, coordination within a community expresses the degree to which the ac-\ntions and behaviors of the community members contribute towards a common goal. As\nsuch,multipledegreesofcoordinationexist,whichdemandnuancedmodelingandanal-yses that go beyond the simplistic binary de\ufb01nition used so far. Di\ufb00erently from the ma-jority of previous work, our approach for detecting coordination assigns a coordinationscoreonacontinuousscale \u2208[0,1]toeachuserinacommunity.In[ 9],thiscoordination\nscore is used to build a coordination curve for each community that quanti\ufb01es the frac-\ntionofcommunitymembersatanygivencoordinationscore.Itisthenlefttotheanalysttomanuallyinterpretthecoordinationcurvesandthebehaviorofthedetectedcoordinatedcommunities[ 9].\nHere we take a step forward by computing an aggregated coordination score for each\ncommunity, as the area under the coordination curve. Similarly to the user-level coordi-\nnationscore,alsothecommunitycoordinationscore \u2208[0,1] andquanti\ufb01esthedegreeto\nwhichthemembersofthecommunityarecoordinatedbetweenoneanother.Theadvan-tageofthisapproachliesinthepossibilitytohaveanobjectiveandquantitativeindicator\nofthedegreeofcoordinationwithinacommunity,ratherthanasubjectiveassessmentde-\nrivedfrommanualinspection.Inaddition,theaggregatedcoordinationscorelendsitselfto useful comparisons with other indicators that can be computed for the same commu-nities,asdescribedinthefollowing.\n4.2.2 Automation\nAutomationofanumberofsocialmediaaccountsisoneofthewaysinwhichonlinecoor-dinationcanbeachieved.Forexample,socialbotnetsexploitthesynchronizationallowed\nby the use of automation to e\ufb00ectively push narratives or support certain public charac-\nters [43]. As such, social botnets that tamper with the regular \ufb02ow of information are a\nparamount example of inauthentic and harmful coordination [ 10,35,44]. However, not\nall inauthentic and harmful coordination is carried out via automated means,\n5let alone\nauthenticandharmlessone.Thismakestheanalysisofautomationausefulcomplement,\nratherthanasubstitute,totheanalysisofcoordination.\nMany bot detection methods have been proposed in the last few years [ 45\u201347], with\nBotometerbeingthe defactostandardinthe\ufb01eld.HereweresorttoBotometerv4[ 48]to\nobtain an estimate of the degree of automation in Twitter accounts.

Multiple methods have been recently proposed to compute social media scores ofpolitical partisanship, bias, or leaning [ 54\u201356]. Among them, here we compute a com-\nmunity score of political partisanship based on the political bias of the news shared bycommunity members, which is a widely-used approach in this \ufb01eld [ 1,57]. In detail, we\n\ufb01rstextractallURLscontainedinthetweetssharedbythemembersofeachcoordinatedcommunity. Then, we standardize each URL by resolving redirections from shortening\nservices, by extracting the domain from the URL, and by grouping together URLs point-\ning to the same domain. We subsequently \ufb01lter out all domains that do not correspondto news outlets. Finally, we assign a political partisanship score to each URL based onthe political bias of the corresponding news outlet. We rely on Media Bias/Fact Check(MBFC)\n7to obtain an extensive list of news outlets and the corresponding political bias\nscores.MBFCisawell-knownresourcethatprovidesexpert-drivenratingsofthepoliticalbiasandfactualaccuracyofmanynewsoutlets.BeingprimarilytargetedatUSoutlets,thisresourceisparticularlysuitableforouranalysis.MBFCcategorizeseachnewsoutletintoone of six ordinal political bias categories, ranging from extreme-left to extreme-right.Here we convert each category to a numeric score by respecting their order, such that\na score of \u20131 corresponds to extreme-left news outlets, and a score of +1 corresponds\nto extreme-right ones, with all other values in between. We then compute the politicalpartisanship score for each member of a coordinated community, which represents theaveragepoliticalbiasofthenewsoutletssharedbythatmember.Next,thepoliticalparti-sanshipofacoordinatedcommunityiscomputedasthemeanofthepoliticalpartisanship\n6https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api .\n7mediabiasfactcheck.com .\nTardellietal.

First, the restricted accessibilityofTwitterdata,followingTwitter\u2019stransitiontoX.com,limitscontentretrievalandstudy\nreplicability[ 73].Additionally,methodssuchasBotometermaynotonlysu\ufb00erfromthese\nrestrictionsbutalsocomewithotherintrinsiclimitations[ 74,75].Anotherlimitationre-\nlates to the user selection process. While leveraging the retweet volume as a metric for\nselecting the top 1% of users to analyze is recognized as an adequate approach for iden-\ntifyingin\ufb02uentialusers[ 29,40],itmayalsointroduceaselectionbias.However,political\nbiasinourdatasetlikelymirrorsthedi\ufb00eringbehaviorsofpoliticalcommunitiesonsocial\nmedia, with research showing that right-leaning users are more active and utilize these\nplatforms more e\ufb00ectively than their left-leaning counterparts [ 60,61]. Finally, the use\nof MBFC to evaluate news source bias and credibility may introduce subjectivity due to\ntheevaluators\u2019personalbiasesandthevariabilityintheir\ufb02aggingcriteria,whichmaynot\nbeuniversallyaccepted.Moreover,limitationsinMBFC\u2019smethodologytransparency,po-\ntentialinaccuraciesinassessments,andincompletecoverageofsmallernewsoutletsfur-\nther complicate the reliability of their evaluations. However, the framework employed in\nthisstudyis\ufb02exible,allowingtheuseofalternativetoolsfornewssourceevaluation(e.g.,\nNewsguard), user selection (e.g., top 1% of active users), and bot detection [ 46,76\u201378].\nLikewise, our proposed framework can also incorporate additional relevant facets, like\ntoxicity levels and psycholinguistic traits. Furthermore, our characterization approach is\napplicable beyond political debates to other information operations datasets, including\nthoseaboutconspiracytheories[ 79,80]andinfodemics[ 81,82].\nTardellietal. EPJDataScience           (2024) 13:33 Page24of27\n7C o n c l u s i o n s\nWe carried out a thorough investigation of coordinated behavior occurred on Twitter\n(now X) in the run up to the US 2020 Presidential Election. Our approach is based on\nan established state-of-the-art coordination detection methodology, followed by a novel\nand nuanced approach to the characterization of coordinated communities that simul-\ntaneously examines the degree of coordination of the di\ufb00erent communities, their use\nof automation, their political partisanship, their factuality, and platform suspensions of\ncoordinated accounts. We demonstrate that the conjoint analysis of these aspects pro-\nvides rich insights into the intent, activity, and harmfulness of the di\ufb00erent coordinated\ncommunities.

 \nWith the increasing prevalence and dissemination of fake videos, this \nstudy aimed to measure the Impact of Media Education Programs in \nenhancing adolescents' awareness of detecting deep visual forgery. An \nexperimental study selected a sample of 60 adolescents and divided \nthem into two groups: one exposed to deeply fake content and the \nother to media literacy programs. The effectiveness of the media \nliteracy programs was evaluated, and different types of interventions \nwere compared. The study results confirmed the ability of adolescents \nexposed to media literacy programs to assess and detect deep visual \nforgery. The study recommended that the Ministry of Education \norganize workshops and scientific seminars  in schools to raise \nstudents' awareness of combating deep visual forgery and strive to \nintegrate media literacy into their curricula. It also encouraged the \nMinistry of Culture and the Ministry of Social Solidarity to launch \npublic awareness campaigns in collaboration with civil society \norganizations, political parties, and media agencies, to promote critical \nthinking skills and encourage the verification of news, images, and \nvideos before sharing them on social media platforms.  \n \nKeywords : Media Education ,

Over the past few decades, the public conversation about political issues has largely migrated online, more specifically to the social-media sphere, which has drastically altered the incentive structures of media outlets as well as the shape of information flows. Benkler, et al. (2018) identified the inner functioning of the alternative-reality dimension of the U.S. media ecosystem, which he termed the \u201cpropaganda feedback loop.\u201d They attributed the emergence of this mechanism to the specificities of the American ecosystem and social norms.  Building on the work by Benkler, et al., I hypothesize that this dynamic is universal amongst Western democracies. The hypothesis was tested with a mixed-method approach by comparing the functioning of media ecosystems in the United States and Germany during a specified interval of time during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The results indicate that inter-societal differences in learned behaviors, national political institutions, and/or specificities of media ecosystems do not alter the essential functioning of these systems. However, such distinctions govern significant differences in the scale, scope, and levels of influence of such systems.      \n \niv    Dedication    I dedicate this thesis to three beloved people who mean the world to me. First and foremost, to my mother Ingeburg Blum, whose love and persistent belief in me knew no bounds and whose unwavering support was determinative of my educational path. Although she is no longer of this world, my memories of her continue to regulate my life today. Thank you, I will never forget you.  Second, to my father Rolf Dieter Blum, who taught me the value of family and hard work, and supported and encouraged me regardless of what journey I embarked on. Thank you, I could not have done it without you.  Last, but not least, to my loving wife, Laetitia Blum, who has not only been a constant source of inspiration during the dual challenges of attending graduate school while maintaining full-time employment, but more importantly, has stood right next to me in good times and in bad. You are the love of my life, and I am truly thankful for having you by my side.

Over the past several decades, public conversation about political issues has in large part migrated online, more specifically to the social-media sphere, which has altered the incentive structures of media outlets and the shape of information flows. The impact of this online shift was magnified during the heavy social-media usage occurring at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I chose an observation period of two months in Fall 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic had regained momentum during its emerging second wave and before life-saving vaccines were a certainty, since I expected the national conversation and existing propaganda systems to be highly active. I collected online social media data (from Twitter and Facebook through their respective application programming interfaces (APIs)) and traditional media data (through Media Cloud), focused on established keywords related to the U.S. and German political landscapes.  I assessed the partisanship evinced in media outlets and social media users with methods defined by Faris, et al.1 Thereafter, I used network theory and machine-learning methods to generate, visualize, and analyze networks of the collected data.   \n \n2  Finally, I observed and compared the inner workings of propaganda systems in the United States and Germany. I augmented this data-driven view by tracing the flow of different high-profile stories through these systems.    Definitions  Inside-outside narrative: Any narrative that establishes a concept that separates an \u201cinsider\u201d from an \u201coutsider\u201d group, such as an \u201cus vs. them\u201d narrative or an extreme victimization narrative of a specific group in which the subject is a member.  Media\u2013state nexus: The interrelation of media outlets with political elites and public opinion, with all of its incentive and objective structures as well as the resulting strategic interactions.  Media ecosystem: A landscape of companies operating on on-line and off-line information platforms in which the boundaries between content, technology, and business tend to blur and hierarchically organized platforms and algorithms distribute information.  Propaganda: Communication designed to manipulate a target population by influencing its beliefs, attitudes, or preferences to generate behavior compliant with political goals of the propagandist. Propaganda Feedback Loop (PFL) (analog to alternative-reality enclave): A network dynamic in which media outlets, political elites, activists, and the public form and break connections based on the contents of statements and that progressively lowers the costs of stating falsehoods that are consistent with a shared political \n \n3  narrative while increasing the costs of resisting that shared narrative in the name of reality. Being caught within such a feedback loop makes it difficult for a media outlet or politician to adopt a consistently reality-focused strategy without being expelled from the network and losing influence in the relevant segment of the public.  Reality-seeking incentive: A phenomenon wherein journalistic media organizations in traditional systems moderate their desire to deliver identity-confirming narratives for fear of being called out for false reporting by competing organizations. Audiences react by punishing the called-out media organization by withholding their attention and rewarding the media organization that commits the fact-check with increased attention.  \n \n4     Chapter II  Literature Review    There is a substantial body of literature related to propaganda, the media ecosystem, and its relationship to the state and to public opinion. This review focused on the relevant knowledge base related to propaganda feedback loops (PFLs) and how they emerged from the evolution of the broader media ecosystem. I drew on the established literature across multiple categories to illuminate discussions amongst scholars who have traced the key steps that engendered the media ecosystem in its current form and ultimately led to the rise of the modern propaganda systems and PFLs.  Ultimately, I strove to contextualize my research by showing: (1) how the current media ecosystem evolved so as to give rise to conditions that produced PFLs; (2) the impact of the introduction of social media platforms as a truly new component of this media ecosystem, and the corresponding shift of a large segment of public online discussion regarding the overall dynamics of polarization; and (3) current gaps in our understanding that gave rise to this research.    Propaganda Feedback Loops  In elite-driven models of the American media-state nexus, elite opinion is reflected in politicians\u2019 behavior, policy proposals, and issue framing. The national media ecosystem then largely adopts elites\u2019 political framing and uses it to manufacture consent among the population.2 However, the media ecosystem has become increasingly  \n \n5  fragmented in recent decades due to the proliferation of digital media platforms, and media outlets must cut through enormous clutter to reap the rewards of audience attention and financial viability.3 Accordingly, media organizations have endeavored to make their content more discoverable by generating ways for audiences to more precisely select their news providers; also by developing algorithmic methods for news providers to select their audiences thereby giving rise to an attention economy in which commercial news organizations thrive by confirming their audiences\u2019 biases.4  The dramatically heightened need to attract audience attention has given rise to a partitioning of the national news media ecosystem into two coexisting media-state nexuses, which have nonetheless remained elite-driven as they formed around specific political preferences and identity groups.5 Although these sub-ecosystems share a bias- confirmation incentive, their approaches to moderating bias are highly asymmetrical. On the one hand, I observed the continuation of the legacy news-media ecosystem that provides a traditional reality-seeking incentive in which some news organizations are excoriated by their peers if they venture too far from verifiable facts in an attempt to please their audience. The peers, in turn, are rewarded with audience attention for calling out obvious biases and factual distortions.  On the other hand, the newly formed sub-ecosystem does not moderate its incentive for narratives that are bias-confirming since it has successfully established an \u201coutside\u201d versus \u201cinside\u201d delineation that manifests in the United States as an \u201cus vs. mainstream news\u201d dynamic. This approach has flipped the incentive structure, as audiences inhabiting this sub-ecosystem interpret external identifications of factual errors by their preferred news outlets as confirmation of partisan attacks that merely reinforce \n \n6  their preexisting beliefs.6 Such interactions between politicians, media outlets, and the public in these emerging, non-moderated, news-media ecosystems embody what Benkler, et al., refer to as a propaganda feedback loop.7 They argue that the specifics of where and when a PFL emerges depend on audiences\u2019 pre-existing attitudes, national traditions, media, and political institutions, which are manifested as varying constituencies across societies.  A PFL is essentially a symbiotic sub-system within the broader, elite-driven media ecosystem consisting of interrelated news outlets that share audiences and content and jointly produce an identity-confirming, politically useful narrative with which their audiences engage.8 One of the unique features of PFLs is that they not only link audiences with content but also connect audiences amongst themselves via the novel introduction of social media platforms into these ecosystems, thereby fostering online-conversations around the narrative they propagate.  Context   This section proceeds in three steps. First, I review literature that highlights the elite-driven nature of the overall media ecosystem and its interrelation with the political sphere, which is foundational to the investigation of PFLs because it helps to localize the propagandist\u2019s position. Second, I review literature that examines how growing technology-enabled fragmentation and polarization have led to the formation of two concurrently existing media-state nexuses. Finally, I focus on literature related to the functioning of the media-state nexus that constitutes a PFL. Although the resulting \n \n7  propaganda systems differ, some version of this process has played out in both the United States and in Germany.   Elite-Driven Media: Critical Perceptions of the Media-State Nexus  The realist\u2019s understanding of the media-state relationship can be divided into two broad categories: the structural realist and the classical realist perspectives. Structural realists largely discount the media\u2019s role in policy formation based on a foundational belief that states are forced to behave in a self-serving manner irrespective of their internal construction and systems.9 In contrast, the classical realist understands state behavior as flowing from institutions that promote the national interest.10 Classical realists assign a largely reactive role to the media in policy formation, postulating that the media operates in line with the state and prevailing power structures to further the national interest. In this sense, the realist\u2019s understanding of the media-policy relationship can be considered somewhat compatible with critical approaches in that it also asserts an elite-driven understanding of media in which policy-elites and power-elites set the agenda that the media and the public follow. The underlying rationale is that elites are best positioned to decide the course of action because the public is ill-informed on political matters and therefore incapable of making appropriate policy decisions.11  Much like the realist tradition, the elite-driven critical understanding of the media-policy relationship considers the media to be a subservient, reactive instrument in the service of the powerful. This perspective stands in direct opposition to the liberal-pluralist view.12 At the macro level, one can classify this body of literature into two broad categories of work: (1) studies by \u201cpropagandists\u201d who generally emphasize specific \n \n8  mechanisms that limit true media autonomy and turn it into a subservient instrument rather than a strategic actor;13 and (2) studies by \u201cconditionalists\u201d who focus on examining factors that enable the media to pivot from being a subservient tool that largely promotes the agendas of the powerful to occasionally functioning as a somewhat independent actor.14  Scholars across these two categories agree that the media ecosystem functions in a top-down manner by deploying incentives to reflect elite opinion and manufacture consent among the population. Specifically, Bennett\u2019s indexing hypothesis15 (which was inspired by research conducted by Hallin, and by Herman and Chomsky16) postulates that the media\u2019s need for access to original sources contributes to a symbiotic relationship between journalists and official sources whereby the media avoids broadcasting stories that could upset the balance of this partnership. This in turn leads to the media merely following the contours of\u2014or indexing itself to\u2014elite debates. There is substantial empirical support for Bennett\u2019s indexing hypothesis, as reflected in a range of scholarly analyses.17 In line with this understanding of the media-state relationship, my research assumes that the same mechanisms hold in a modern PFL, i.e., the propagandist projects propaganda in a top-down manner from the political sphere to the public via the media ecosystem.  The Rise of Technology-Enabled News, Polarization, and the Formation of Separate Media-State Nexuses  Over the three decades since Herman and Chomsky published their Propaganda Model,18 dynamic shifts in the media ecosystem have resulted as new platforms with \n \n9  novel technological features emerged. These platforms have transformed the media landscape beyond recognition and made modern PFLs significantly more complex both structurally and in terms of interactions.   The 1980s witnessed the first wave of fragmentation with the emergence of cable television, as the media world transitioned from a realm in which three channels and several prominent newspapers shaped the social dialogue, to one where the audience is in the driver\u2019s seat and can choose among an ever-increasing number of options.19 CNN was eight years old when the propaganda model was published; the rise of the 24-hour news channel would not occur for another eight years when that network was joined by MSNBC and Fox News in 1996.   The emergence of these networks splintered news consumers into various ideologically polarized camps, and over the last two decades the introduction of alternative platforms has fueled increasing fragmentation.20 First, the emergence in the late 1990s and early 2000s of global media networks such as CNN, Al Jazeera, BBC World, and RT engendered competition with domestic media in national markets.21 Over the last decade, the increasing prominence of internet-based news platforms and the proliferation of social media have added further complexity to the fractured news media landscape. Some analysts have argued that such shifts significantly contributed to the formation of modern PFLs. Traditional on-air and print outlets are taking advantage of a host of technological innovations that these internet-based platforms offer as a means of engaging audiences and analyzing their preferences and behaviors.22   However, the older players in the news industry now must compete with digital publishers that are ideologically polarized to different degrees and cater to clearly defined \n \n10  audiences. Such publishers include Buzzfeed, Vox News, Vice News, Huffington Post, The Young Turks, and Breitbart.23 Moreover, audiences have also begun to encounter rogue news sources such as Infowars, NewBuzzDaily, or the Boston Tribune.24 Whereas the former group exposed audiences to ideologically colored presentations of events, or even plain misinformation, the new generation of rogue players tends to promote unmitigated, sometimes blatantly false, identity-confirming narratives to an ideologically predisposed audience in a manner that is more akin to an entertainment outlet than a news organization. Furthermore, they often take full advantage of the digital capabilities offered by internet platforms, such as social media integration and internet memes.25  As elaborated by Bennett\u2019s indexing theory, these diverse news ecosystem participants largely align around their original sources, and clusters around those parts of the political spectrum toward which they are ideologically inclined.26 However, with audiences\u2019 increasing ability to select their news diets by technology-enabled filtering, and politicians\u2019 corresponding ability to deploy technology to target audiences that are pre-disposed to be most receptive to their messaging, I have increasingly observed the formation of distinct ideological eco-chambers. Entman and Usher argued that these distinct spheres remain elite-driven27; however, they exhibit substantially different interaction patterns, as Figure 1 shows.  Benkler, et al. conducted a data-driven deep dive into the inner dynamics of these media spheres by meticulously tracing their inner mechanics in the context of cases associated with the 2016 elections in the United States.28 The authors coined the term \u201cpropaganda feedback loop\u201d to describe the media-state nexus that has formed around the political right in the United States.  \n \n11   Figure 1. News Framing and the Propaganda Feedback Loop.  Sources: Benkler, Faris, and Roberts, Network Propaganda; Entman and Usher, \u201cFraming in a Fractured Democracy.\u201d    Functioning of the Propaganda Feedback Loop  The structural differences between varying media-state nexuses have been evolving for decades, and scholars and news commentators alike have examined their dynamics. Over 15 years ago, David Brock29 elucidated how the once fringe right-wing media has all but subsumed the regular media conversation, shaped the national consciousness, and turned American politics sharply to the right. Evidence of this phenomenon is observable in situations ranging from the disputed 2000 U.S. presidential election, to the war in Iraq, to the U.S. political battles of 2004. The strategies and resulting dynamics that Brock meticulously documented served as an impetus for a range of later scholarly work that demonstrated how the political right in the United States uses a simple, sustained symbolic vision to organize citizens around their version of reality.30 A number of analysts have argued that the rise of social media and the corresponding move of political discourse to virtual spaces and social media networks constitute a major paradigm shift that has transformed the overall dynamics of the \n\n \n12  public\u2019s interaction with the media-state nexus and thereby further driven the divergence of isolated eco-chambers.31 Online political discussions occur in different environments than typical face-to-face interactions; for one, there are fewer contextual cues of discussion partners\u2019 reactions.32 Many environments offer anonymity, which has significant implications for discussion quality, and conversations tend to be public or semi-public, i.e., visible to many others.33 Online platforms vary in the extent to which their architectures accentuate these channel characteristics. For example, whereas anonymity is possible on Twitter and Reddit, Facebook offers substantial user information that can provide contextual cues.  Earlier research on online political discussions was primarily qualitative in nature;34 however, in more recent years, researchers have employed traditional survey-based methods and social network analysis. Over the past decade, the proliferation of online political discussions has accelerated and amplified pre-existing polarization, thereby leading to further separation of the different media spheres.35 Whereas Benkler\u2019s earlier work expressed a rather optimistic view of the potential of blogs and other decentralized media production outlets to liberate society from the grip of centralized mass media,36 only a few years later this perspective had given way to a more critical examination in which he and Shaw elucidated distinctions between the technologies, institutions, and practices of participation in political blogs according to ideological affiliation.37 Platforms operated by those on the political right were shown to be more restrictive than left-leaning hosts by providing users with opportunities to offer independent input and less inclined to engage in collaborative discursive production.38 \n \n13  Benkler, et al. later extended this earlier work with an analysis of the mechanics, origins, and development of the American PFL (see Figure 2).39  \n Figure 2. Propaganda Feedback Loop Dynamics.  Source: Benkler, Faris, and Roberts, Network Propaganda.   The current literature remains ambiguous concerning the actual drivers that gave rise to the emergence of modern PFLs. Therefore, it is unclear whether the technology-propelled fracturing of the media ecosystem directly caused the separation of the media\u2013state nexus into two separate, concurrent systems, one of which became a PFL, or if PFLs independently formed due to the presence of certain other conditions, which in turn led to the separation of the two media\u2013state nexuses.   The Critical Change   Within the wealth of literature about PFLs and the corresponding echo chambers that gave rise to the current state of polarization and asymmetrical distribution of misinformation, opinions vary concerning the contributing constituents of these loops \n\n \n14  and\u2014perhaps more importantly, the novel components or features of our media ecosystem. After all, polarization in the United States is not a new development. Partisan media is also not new; in fact, one might say that partisan media is as old as media itself. Technology-enabled media is certainly new, but what is the linking mechanism connecting the emergence of digital technology to political polarization? One argument that is often brought forth to explain this linkage is that social media sites now absorb a significant share of the popular conversation. This conversation has increasingly shifted over the past decades: polarization in the United States and around the world has accelerated over the last few years due to politicians\u2019 increasing usage of social media, with the effects being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  An advocate of the above perspective, Sunstein highlighted the ease with which likeminded people find each other as a key feature of networking, suggesting that individuals remain increasingly isolated from other perspectives when they are predominantly exposed to views that reinforce their preconceived perspectives.40 Pariser proposed that algorithms that generate filter bubbles while suppressing counter-attitudinal information substantially contribute to this isolating effect.41 Benkler, et al. suggested that this mechanism incentivizes publishers to infuse filter bubbles with hyperpartisan content.42 On a systemic level, the introduction of social media platforms has fundamentally reshaped the information flow and interaction structure of audiences.  Explaining the Impact of Social Media on Political Discourse Scholars have debated the specific implications of the above-described phenomenon. As a result, the camps have become divided between a standard explanation and challenges to that perspective. \n \n15   The Standard Answer    The standard explanation of how social media platforms changed public debate in the United States is that they have increased polarization through the creation of isolated echo chambers in which inhabitants\u2019 views are pushed to the extreme ends of the debate spectrum. Proponents of this theory, including Sunstein, argue that polarization has increased due to new opportunities for like-minded people to easily and inexpensively find, interact, and coordinate with each other.43 The propensity of individuals to cluster around common traits like political ideology has long been understood.44 Interacting with like-minded people and sharing identity-confirming content and misinformation from propagandist media sources reinforces their pre-existing flawed ideologies\u2014a well-understood mechanism about how propaganda functions.45 As discovery, coordination, and interaction among these groups become much easier, they remain increasingly isolated from others with different views and counter-attitudinal content  Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson argued that digital platforms often contribute to a fragmented society because likeminded people can easily find each other and form clusters in which they can become further polarized.46 In his landmark work on social capital, Putnam warned of the impact that internet technology, e.g., filtering technologies, could have on movements such as white-supremacists when it becomes easy to form ideologically homogeneous communities without geotropic considerations.47 He outlined three components needed for this to occur: (1) digitally enabled communities of like-minded people, (2) increasing isolation of these clusters, and (3) filtering mechanisms.48 On balance, Putnam was hopeful that homogeneity would engender an interwoven \n \n16  community of communities, not unlike the leaky echo chambers that have proliferated today.49  Sunstein argues that homogeneous groups have a polarizing effect, which manifests in the rising number of online hate and extremist groups, as (1) group members might prefer to voice popular opinions to harvest approval, or (2) the group\u2019s homogeneity would restrict the size of the argument pool such that social influence and persuasion among members move to unmeritocratic positions.50 Empirical evidence from lab experiments confirms that these two mechanisms lead to more extreme positions.51 More recently, Conover, et al.52 and Barber\u00e1, et al.53 demonstrated evidence of homogeneous social clustering specifically in the social media space (Twitter). Berry and Sobieraj showed how these mechanisms led to the emergence of the Tea Party movement in the United States.54 Del Vicario, et al. found that conspiracy theories spread best in polarized, communities (Facebook).55 This polarizing effect, specifically on social media, most likely stems from a minority of hyper-partisans with a super-proportional share of voice on social media.56 The segregation of echo chambers and the self-selection of the media sources around which they form and that serve them, make for a deterioration of a shared sense of history and reality in society, which drives increasing mistrust of partisan outgroups and their associated media sources.57  Some empirical evidence supports this standard answer. For example, in the United States, political polarization has increased substantially less among people who do not use social media versus those who spend a great deal of time on these platforms.58     \n \n17  Challenges to the Standard Answer   One challenge to the standard answer is that algorithmic selection and presentation of news content on major social media platforms do not significantly alter the normal consumption pattern of echo chamber inhabitants.59 Thus, ideological clustering might be not as strong a challenge as the active sharing of identity-confirming content works without algorithmic help.  A substantial body of research challenges the standard answer by demonstrating that social media echo chambers are often leaky; also that interactions between inhabitants of other opposing echo chambers that provide exposure to counter-attitudinal points of view are not as rare as one might think.60 Researchers like Barnidge,61 Fletcher and Nielsen,62 and Silver, et al.63 have argued that exposure to counter-attitudinal content is greater on social media than with offline consumption and discussion of the same content. Others have shown that repeated exposure to different points of view fosters political moderation rather than amplified polarization.64 In the context of the \u201ccontact hypothesis\u201d literature, this sort of inter-group exposure implies a reduction in political prejudice, increased political tolerance, and support for the civil liberties of disliked groups.65 If so, then one would expect social media to have a moderating effect on the people who use it most frequently, as they are exposed to different viewpoints more often than people who are not on social media.  How to Make it Work  There are three main arguments that help to make the above-outlined, seemingly contradictory, bodies of work compatible:  1. The difference between strong and weak ties \n \n18  2. The difference between ideological and affective polarization  3. The Asymmetry of Polarization.  I examine each argument in turn.  Strong versus Weak Ties   The first explanation that might help resolve the apparent conflict among these bodies of research entails differentiating interaction points into strong and weak ties. Strong ties denote interactions, such as those among family and friends; weak ties denote exchanges such as those between co-workers or casual acquaintances. The shift of political discourse to social media echo chambers implies that most of our interactions are heavily skewed toward weak ties. Individuals linked by weak ties are more likely to share different points of view.66 Presumably, weak ties are also less trusted than strong ties. Hence it follows that the counter-attitudinal points of view to which echo chamber inhabitants are exposed on social media might not convince them, especially if they are shared by individuals who have a political identity associated with an outgroup echo chamber. Indeed, Settle describes the heightened awareness associated with political identities as a major driver of polarization on social media.67 If counter-attitudinal information indeed primarily derives from these weak tie relationships, then one would not expect it to have the moderating effect on social media that it displays.  Ideological versus Affective Polarization The second explanation that might help to reconcile these superficially differing perspectives focuses on the pervasive lack of common definitions across the research, especially as it relates to what is specifically meant by polarization. One can carefully \n \n19  distinguish between two different kinds of polarization, namely affective or psychological polarization, in the sense of dislike of or disdain for the political outgroup, and ideological polarization, in the sense of diverging positions.68 The standard model of information ecosystems describes various competing viewpoints that are processed by its inhabitants and over time lead to societal consensus.69 However, individuals do not process information in a scientific manner free of bias and emotion or update their positions according to the latest and best available data. Research shows that political information in particular is not processed in this way, and empirical observations confirm that affective bias leads individuals to interpret negative information about a candidate they support as a partisan attack.70 Partisan motivated reasoning and biased information processing are operative concepts in today\u2019s political landscape. In the United States, a social cleavage is widening whereby partisans might agree on specific ideological positions but have learned to dislike and distrust the outgroup.71 Social media platforms deploy a set of features that engage psychological mechanisms for affective polarization by correlating social and political content with identities, which facilitates stereotyping and dislike of the outgroup. This already skewed picture is then received via bias information processing, which further amplifies the perceived gap between inhabitants of different echo chambers. Settle gathered empirical evidence in support of this dynamic via a series of lab experiments, as a result of which he attributed the perceived widening of the distance between ingroups and outgroups to the use of social media and associated content sharing.72 Debate about the net effect of affective polarization is all but settled today. When dislike of the outgroup leads to \n \n20  growing perceived distance of partisans, and debates are won or lost based on identity rather than argument or evidence, I expect to find a net-negative effect in the form of, for example, increased inequality or unemployment.73 Ideological polarization is not generally considered undesirable, as its absence could indicate that the parties do not offer distinctly differentiated positions around which voters can rally around, as recently pointed out by Wickham-Jones.74   The Asymmetry of Polarization Not every individual will be politically polarized in the same way or be equally susceptible to misinformation.75 It is well established that individuals in part select, perceive, consume, and process political information depending on the strength of their political engagement, the degree of their partisanship, and their ideological orientation.76 As a result, it is unrealistic to expect that social-media use has an equally distributed effect regardless of the direction (polarizing/depolarizing).  The classical view was well described by Zaller, who discussed how political awareness correlates to more openness to pro-attitudinal messages.77 Taber and Lodge similarly argued that people with higher degrees of political sophistication are more likely to accept arguments in support of their views and reject counter-arguments.78 This situation might be amplified by people\u2019s self-selection in news consumption environments based on their pre-existing level of political engagement.79 This perspective might give rise to the argument that social-media-driven polarization occurs in a minority segment of partisans who are most engaged in political discussions on social media and enjoy a super-normal share of voice.80  \n \n21  Ideological orientation and its corresponding personality traits might be another variable that helps to explain polarization patterns across social media. Broader media research focusing on legacy media has found that conservatives are more likely than liberals to engage in selective exposure, bias information processing, and ideological conformity.81 Barber\u00e1, et al. found such asymmetry and ideological segregation in Twitter users, confirming that liberals engage in more cross-cutting interactions than conservatives.82 This finding was further validated and confirmed experimentally by Bail, et al. who found that the resulting polarization from counter-attitudinal information was greater for conservatives than for liberals.83 If true, then this view could help to explain the system-level asymmetry that Benkler, et al. observed in the United States, where they identified the presence of a propaganda feedback loop among extreme conservatives, whereas the entire remainder of the political spectrum operated in a more traditional reality-seeking dynamic.84  Although this body of work is compelling, it is worth noting that it is not undisputed. Other studies have found a more a more symmetric distribution of the above-described traits.85 For example, Kim, Hsu, and de Zuniga argued that social-media use does not substantively impact the heterogeneity of discussion networks among either liberals or conservatives in the United States.86   Knowledge Gaps  I identified two broad areas that remain ambiguous across the literature: (1) What is the individual-level impact (currently contradictory evidence that cannot easily be \n \n22  reconciled)?; and (2) To what degree are the data, largely gathered in the United States, generalizable to the rest of the world (lack of theory and empirical data)?  What is the Individual-Level Impact? I am uncertain of social media\u2019s individual-level effects, as the related data seem to be contradictory. Differences in empirical findings might be caused by the uneven impacts of social media on individuals within different socio-demographic segments. This point is especially likely to be true if I consider individuals\u2019 political orientation and the strength of their partisan identities. Exposure to a variety of views has long been considered a necessity for political decision making in a democracy.87 Deliberations under this condition can have a substantial impact on a person\u2019s beliefs. Exposure to a range of views increases individual awareness and helps him/her to both formulate their own perspective and to understand why they hold it.88  Despite compelling evidence of the beneficial effects of exposure to a wider variety of political viewpoints, it is unclear how far attitudes change subsequent to such illumination or what impact it has on the aggregate level of polarization. In fact, few studies have examined this question in the context of emerging technology and social media. Some researchers have found a negative correlation between social-media use and political polarization, as the challenge to the standard argument would suggest. For example, Boxell, Gentzkow, and Shapiro postulate that digital technology only plays a small role in political polarization, and they empirically demonstrated that although political polarization has increased among all age cohorts in the United States, the change \n \n23  has been least among members of the youngest groups who are most likely to be immersed in social media.89 However, other factors could play a role in fostering political polarization\u2014for example, the composition of strong and weak ties within the networks of younger people could be different. There is more empirical support for this view.90 For example, Bail, et al. showed that cross-cutting information from elites can increase polarization, suggesting that who is propagating the cross cutting information may play a role.91 In the same vein, Lodge and Traber,92 Nyhan and Reifler,93 and Suhay, Bello-Pardo, and Maurer94 showed a possible polarizing effect based on motivated reasoning. However, the merit of these findings is highly debated.  To What Degree are the Data, Largely Gathered in the U.S., Generalizable to the Rest of the World? I do not know if or to what extent the results found in the United States (where most of the studies cited in this thesis review were written) are generalizable to the rest of the world. With a few exceptions, notably Bechmann and Nielbo,95 Bright,96 and Vaccari et al.,97 there is a lack of theoretical basis and empirical observations concerning how far environmental factors such as societal norms and traditions, political institutions, or characteristics of the overall media ecosystem or societal history contribute to the polarization effect of social media. Benkler, et al. suggest that these differences largely account for the shape of the propaganda feedback loop in the United States,98 and it is upon this view that this research is designed to build. I want to shed light on what exactly is different and common between propaganda feedback loops across different countries \n \n24  and the societies that inhabit them. Do such systems even exist in other Western democracies? If so, how do they function?  Problem Statement In Networked Propaganda, Benkler, et al. formulated a theory that contemporary media landscapes evince a specific type of fragmentation in the ways that media outlets, politicians, and the public interact.99 According to their framework, the largest part of the media ecosystem follows a reality-check dynamic whereby media-content generation balances between fulfilling institutionalized reality-seeking norms and satisfying partisan attitudes. Benkler, et al. identified news outlets\u2019 incentive to cater to their audiences as a key mechanism in media fragmentation, which is moderated by the calling out of untruths by other news outlets in the same, reality-seeking sphere, which in turn is rewarded with audience attention.100 This mechanism is by no means perfect; however, it keeps the reality-seeking part of the media ecosystem relatively honest.  However, another set of media outlets functions under an alternative-reality dynamic and prefers to distribute partisan, identity-confirming news over reality. They appeal to segments of the public by disputing the trustworthiness of outlets that provide news that is discomforting to their audience, i.e., Benkler, et al.\u2019s propaganda feedback loops.101 These two mechanisms result in the segregation of the media ecosystem and contribute to the formation of echo chambers shaped by users\u2019 consumption habits, news generation, and politicians\u2019 performances. In this fragmented media ecosystem, outlets and users that are part of the alternative-reality cluster follow the principles of networked propaganda. Narratives shared in this part of the network are highly partisan, of low \n \n25  credibility, disorienting, and manipulative, and they emerge from interactions among a broad set of discrete sources and narrative bits.  Thus, the alternative-reality cluster has leveraged a supply-and-demand mechanism that reinforces itself at three different levels: politicians adapt their performances on media outlets based on the public interest, media outlets set the agenda based on politician activities and the urge to satisfy their audience, and the public chooses its consumption habits based on the availability of information that satisfies their attitudes. Inhabitants of this part of the media ecosystem reward in-group media outlets and politicians for propagating identity-confirming, partisan content and narratives with their attention. The reality-seeking mechanism that assures the functioning of the broader part of the media ecosystem is rendered inert, and any calling out of misinformation by media outlets that are not part of the alternative-reality cluster is dismissed as a partisan attack, thereby generating a propaganda feedback loop. According to Benkler, et al., this propaganda feedback loop might vary in its content and size; however, its structure is well defined in that it always contains an attention backbone.102 Peripheral nodes in the network garner attention for their agenda and framing within a subnetwork of like-minded users who are intensely interested in particular perspectives. Relatively more visible members of that subnetwork reach the public at large by amplifying the agenda or frame progressively upward to ever-more influential sites. Benkler, et al. developed their theory by analyzing the 2016 U.S. elections. They hypothesized that the PFL is likely specific to the U.S. ecosystem, and it might not exist in other countries with high media trust, such as Germany or Sweden.103 This thesis investigates the universality of propaganda feedback loops across media ecosystems. I \n \n26  seek to determine whether COVID-19-related information networks in the U.S. and Germany were fragmented into the aforementioned reality-check and alternative-reality clusters regardless of differences in the two countries\u2019 media and political structures. I want to analyze time snapshots of these countries\u2019 media ecosystems to determine whether the alternative-reality clusters contain a PFL that functions under partisanship principles in its rhetoric as well as controversial, affective information flow.  This thesis research tests the following key hypotheses: \u2022 H1: Both the United States and German media ecosystems contain a segregated, content-independent, alternative-reality cluster. \u2022 H2: The alternative-reality cluster follows the principles of networked propaganda (mechanism of partisan, low-credibility news and sources, ingroup vs. outgroup, affective polarization). \u2022 H3: Despite differences across almost all dimensions of these national media ecosystems, their respective propaganda feedback loops vary in scope and size, but not mechanism.   \n \n27     Chapter 3  Methodology    To investigate the three hypotheses, I conducted analyses at four different levels: 1. First, to answer H1: whether all media-ecosystems contain a segregated content-independent alternative-reality cluster, I created partisan information-sharing networks in inLinks and Twitter to visualize the information landscape related to COVID-19.  2. Second, I ran a semi-supervised learning clustering algorithm on the generated networks to locate the potential existence of the reality-check and alternative-reality clusters.  3. Then, I used statistical tools and qualitative content analysis to investigate whether the located clusters across countries follow the principles of network-propaganda (H2). Using appropriate statistical tools, I investigated the correlation of partisan consumption with the detected clusters.  4. Then, by qualitatively reviewing news articles, I quantified their truthfulness and quality. I also quantified \u201cus vs. them\u201d rhetoric in articles by measuring the prevalence of identity-related pronouns in the top articles of each cluster. By using network theory algorithms, I quantified the magnitude and size of the detected clusters, and by reviewing their structure and connectivity in the networks, I qualitatively evaluated similarities and differences (H3).   \n \n28  In the following sections, I provide a more detailed description of the research methods employed in this thesis.  Data Collection  To investigate the hypotheses, I first mapped the media ecosystems in the U.S. and Germany when case counts were sharply rising during the second COVID-19 wave and prior to the release of the COVID-19 vaccine (September\u2013November 2020) (see Figure 3).   \n  Figure 3. Data collection periods over confirmed case counts in the United States and Germany.  Source: Case data from Our World in Data. \n\n \n29  I chose September 3 to November 3, 2020, as the observation period based on the hypothesis that the COVID narratives and propaganda systems across the political spectrum were already set during the second COVID-19 wave and before life-saving vaccines were a certainty. I determined that it would be reasonable to assume that these propaganda systems were highly active during the sharp increase in infection cases. I constructed both networks to cover this period to ensure that they would be closely comparable.  However, the difficulty is that in the U.S., this period coincided with the most intense phase of the 2020 presidential election, whereas there were no elections in Germany during this timeframe. Therefore, to assure the validity of the data, I constructed a second network view for the German election period from July 26 to September 26, 2021, to see if there would be any notable differences. Comparing German dynamics between the two periods was done to verify whether located media behaviors were election (in)dependent. I found that the dynamics in Germany were largely identical between the election period and my observation period; thus, the initial observation period of September\u2013November 2020 appears to be valid.   News Media and Facebook Data  I used the open-source platform Media Cloud to create a comprehensive overview of news media articles related to COVID-19.104 Media Cloud contains historical information about online sources across the globe. For the United States, I searched for all articles between September 3 and November 3, 2020, that matched the query \u201cCOVID OR coronavirus\u201d in Media Cloud\u2019s National Online U.S. media corpus. Using the \n \n30  platform\u2019s capabilities, I then followed all the links from within the substantive content of these stories using automated spidering and added stories that included the same search terms. This recursive spidering process continued for 15 iterations, at which point an insignificant number of new stories was found. I used this corpus to reconstruct the U.S. online media landscape and study the linking and clustering patterns among the 29,403 identified media sources, 449,286 stories, and 918,125 links between stories.  These open web media sources included a broad range of media sites, campaign sites, sites for nonprofit organizations such as think tanks and advocacy organizations, government sites, company sites, and blogs. For Germany, I followed the same process using the Local and National Online German Media corpus, which generated a dataset containing 11,281 media sources, 261,431 links, and 123,105 unique articles, between both September 3 and November 3, 2020, and July 26 and September 26, 2021. I also collected Facebook shares of the total corpus of collected U.S. and German articles by using the respective APIs provided by Media Cloud, which directly links to the Facebook API.   Twitter Data  I used the same methodology to collect tweets from German and American sources. The following subsections describe the collection methodology. Collecting Twitter user handles. I defined a list of Twitter handles of parties or representatives across the political spectrum (shown in Table 1). Then, I collected the handles of all users who retweeted one of the parties or their politicians prior to the release of the first COVID vaccine (Sep. 3 to Nov. 3, 2020, for both Germany and the \n \n31  U.S.; Jul. 26 to Sep. 26, 2021, for Germany). As mentioned above, two time periods were covered for Germany to validate the hypothesis that there would be no difference between the observed media dynamics during a propaganda period and one outside of a major election cycle.  Table 1. Twitter Account Handles Used to Collect Partisan Tweets  Country Twitter Handles U.S.A @JoeBiden, @tedcruz, @Mike_Pence Germany @spdde, @Die_Gruenen, @CDU, @CSU, @FDP, @AfD, @dieLinke  The list of U.S. political handles includes Joe Biden\u2019s Twitter for the Democratic Party, along with Ted Cruz\u2019s and Mike Pence\u2019s handles for the Republican Party. A better representative for the Republican Party would have been Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account. However, by the time of collection, Trump\u2019s account had been suspended by Twitter, and data about retweets were not accessible through the Twitter API. I operated under the assumption that Twitter users who engaged with Cruz or Pence were the closest demographic to Trump\u2019s audience due to Cruz\u2019s extremely conservative views and Pence\u2019s status as vice president.  The list of German political handles includes SPD, CSU, CDU, AfD, Die Gr\u00fcnen, FDP, and Die Linke. Because Germany is not a two-party system, the electorate\u2019s votes are split into multiple parties. The table contains the main parties that are consistently elected in the German parliament. I collected a total of 94,243 Twitter user handles for the U.S. dataset and 26,878 for the German dataset. The discrepancy between these numbers is not surprising and \n \n32  very likely due to the size of the Twitter user base in the two countries. The U.S. had 37 million daily active users in 2021; Germany only had 1 million as of 2020.105 Furthermore, these numbers include only users who log in daily, and not those who less regularly engage with content or tweets. Collecting tweets with links. I collected tweets from the user list obtained in the previous step. I excluded the Twitter.com domain from the collection because I found that tweets in my dataset containing such links were either links to other tweets (retweets) or unavailable due to content that violated Twitter\u2019s terms of service.   The final U.S. dataset contains 13,226,157 tweets from 98,007 unique Twitter users with links from 115,875 domains. The German dataset contains 1,204,514 tweets from 19,292 unique Twitter users with links from 52,388 distinct domains. I further split the German dataset into tweets from the two periods of interest. The first chunk includes 880,725 tweets from 17,445 users, with links from 42,565 distinct domains. The second chunk includes 323,789 tweets from 5,864 users, with links from 18,718 distinct domains.  Network Construction  I developed three types of networks to investigate COVID-related information patterns on online media, Facebook, and Twitter. First, I created online media networks based on the linking patterns between open web media sources. In these networks, nodes represent online domains, and node size indicates the number of times other domains are linked to them. Edges denote the number of times two domains are linked to each other. I created two versions of these networks: in one, nodes and edges are colored based on \n \n33  how often partisans shared these domains; in the other, nodes and edges are colored based on the cluster-membership of domains (the calculation of which follows in the next section), and the node size corresponds to the number of times articles of these domains were shared on Facebook. I also used Twitter data to create similar maps of media sources; however, rather than using direct links between media sources, the network edges depict the frequency with which Twitter partisans cited different media sources. Media sources that were frequently found to be included by specific partisans are drawn together in the network, whereas more neutral sources are pushed apart. These maps provide a view of the partisan-related media sphere on Twitter. I visualized the two-mode networks (users and media sources) by creating single-mode equivalent network maps, whereby nodes are domains, edge weights quantify the number of users sharing two domains, and node colors correspond either to partisanship or cluster membership. I used the network mapping tool Gephi to create all of the networks. Within Gephi, I used the ForceAtlas layout algorithm on all of the connected media sources in a given map with a repulsion strength of 20,000 and an attraction strength of 5. For media networks, I used all domains that have at least three links. For the Twitter networks, I used domains that partisans have shared at least 50 times. To assign a partisanship score to a source, I calculated the ratio of partisans sharing it. In the case of the U.S., a source was assigned to a party if at least 75% of its shares came from that party\u2019s supporters. For Germany, a source was assigned to a party if either 75% or at least (50+ p) % of its shares came from that party\u2019s supporters, given \n \n34  that the second-most sharing party supporters had shared it p% of the time, whichever was smaller.  Cluster Construction I used a label-spreading algorithm to investigate whether the information ecosystems contained a reality-check or an alternative-reality cluster.106 Label spreading is a semi-supervised learning technique that takes a set of already-labeled nodes in the network and calculates the probability that the rest of the network belongs to the corresponding clusters. In this case, I used a pool of domains already categorized by prior studies or fact-checking websites as \u201cfactual\u201d or of \u201clow credibility.\u201d107 I then applied the label \u201cpropagation algorithm\u201d to each network of interest and classified the rest of the nodes. My initial list contained 16 mainstream and 22 low-credibility outlets for the U.S. (see Table 2) and 17 mainstream and 16 low-credibility outlets for Germany (see Table 3). Table 2. List of Reality-Seeking and Alternative-Reality Sources for the U.S.  Reality-seeking sources Alternative-reality sources aol, chicagotribune, latimes, sfchronicle, cbsnews, cnn, foxnews, huffingtonpost, msnbc, usatoday, washingtonpost, bloomberg, newsweek, politico, economist  blaze, twitchy, humansarefree, infowars, redstate,  breitbart, dailycaller, dailykos, dailywire, infowars, crooksandliars, dailysignal, newsmax, RawStory, redstate, infowars, zerohedge, infowars, breitbart, dailycaller, shareblue  Table 3.

I calculated the overall modularity of graphs, the density and average weighted degree of the subgraphs, and the number of domains assigned to each cluster according to partisanship. Cluster density gives the degree of interconnectedness within a graph, with the maximum value being 1 (all nodes connect to all others).  Similarly, modularity quantifies the strength of division between two communities in the network, with a value of 1 denoting a network with very dense interconnections within clusters and no interconnections between clusters and a value of  -1 indicating the opposite. I also compared domains based on their cluster membership and the corresponding partisan support. I calculated the odds that each domain supported by specific partisans belonged to the alternative-reality versus reality-seeking clusters. I then performed Chi-squared tests to determine if differences between partisan support were statistically significant.  Content Analysis The content analysis was split into four parts:  1. The top domains in the dataset in terms of inLinks (see Appendix Tables 20, 21, 22, 23, 32, 33); Facebook shares (Appendix Tables 24, 25, 26, 27, 34, 35); and Twitter shares (Appendix Tables 28, 29, 30, 31, 36, 37) for each cluster. 2. I normalized articles according to their Facebook and Twitter shares and calculated the overall ratio of network diffusion for alternative-reality and reality-seeking sources.  \n \n36  3. I sampled the top 100 articles from the Twitter networks of each country and cluster, and manually labeled stories in terms of their controversiality. I labeled stories as reality-seeking if they appeared to be doing fact-based reporting, and as controversial if they contained low-credibility/fake or highly partisan content.  4. I sampled 5,000 articles on Twitter for each country and cluster.  By automatically querying their content, I counted the prevalence of out-group descriptive words generally used by outlets in the \u201creality-seeking\u201d and \u201calternative-reality\u201d clusters. For Germany, I searched how many times domains from the \u201calternative-reality\u201d cluster used the word L\u00fcgenpresse (\u201clying press\u201d), which is a typical term used to criticize mainstream outlets. Similarly, for the \u201creality-seeking\u201d clusters, I searched for references to alternative Medien, which is used by outlets to describe sources from the \u201calternative-reality\u201d cluster.  For the U.S., I searched for the terms \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cfringe\u201d for sources coming from the \u201calternative-reality\u201d and \u201creality-seeking\u201d clusters, respectively. The \u201calternative-reality\u201d cluster generally argues that the other cluster generates false information, whereas mainstream media use the term \u201cfringe\u201d to describe sources that promote the \u201calternative-reality.\u201d I then performed Mann-Whitney U statistical tests to test whether differences in identity-related term prevalence were statistically significant.  Finally, unless otherwise indicated, the Source for each table and figure herein is the thesis author.  \n \n37     Chapter IV  Results    In this chapter, I present the results of the network and content analysis. The chapter is structured as follows. First, I present the results for the United States during the observation period, which are substantively similar to what Benkler found in 2016.108 I then proceed to the German data and present findings for the observation period from September\u2013November 2020, which serves as the basis for this study. Next, I present findings for the cross-check period from July\u2013September 2021 to clarify the similarities and differences between the election cycle and the off period. I found that differences between the time periods are minor and do not play into this analysis. I focused on the open-linkage and Twitter networks and presented the theoretical and statistical analysis together. Thereafter, I cross-checked the results with the Facebook data that was collected. Finally, for each part of the study, I compared findings and evaluated similarities and differences.  United States: Open Linkage Media Network   The U.S. media ecosystem follows principles of networked propaganda (Figures 4\u20138) during the observation period. Figure 4 shows an interconnected media ecosystem, which is more or less equally split between domains shared by Democratic and Republican supporters. Figure 5 contains an alternative-reality cluster comprised of 326 sources, whereas there were 5,693 sources in the reality-seeking cluster.   \n \n38   Figure 4. U.S. Media Networks:   Figure 5. U.S. Media Networks: September\u2013November 2020   September\u2013November 2020   Partisan: Nodes represent domains   Clustering: Nodes represent domains    As Benkler, et al.\u2019s landmark study predicted,109 I observed on a media-network level a red Republican enclave on the right, which strikingly overlaps with the domains that the label propagation algorithm identified as belonging to the alternative-reality cluster. Focusing on the most interlinked sources, mainstream media such as the New York Times and Washington Post are central in the network; however, alternative-reality enclave domains such as Daily Caller, Breitbart, and Blaze also appear.  Interestingly, Raw Story, which is a left-wing outlet, is also part of the alternative-reality enclave (see Figure 6). One possible explanation for this notable outlier is that, like the other domains in the alternative-reality enclave, Raw Story links to other stories of dubious reliability. This theory might be supported by that outlet\u2019s ranking as being of mixed credibility by the often-cited fact-checking site mediabiasfactcheck.com.110 This result could indicate that Raw Story is itself unreliable. However, another possible \n Clustering: Nodes represent domains.   Democrats  Republicans No Partisanship Truth-seeking   Alternative-reality \nReality-seeking   \n \n39  explanation might be that the outlet merely applies interlinking practices that resemble those seen in constituents of the alternative-reality cluster. Specifically, Raw Story might itself be reliable; however, it refers to unreliable sources at a much higher rate because it frequently comments on these sources. If this is the case, then I would expect to see links from Raw Story to the same unreliable sources as those linked to by right-leaning media, as it seems reasonable to assume that the left-leaning audiences of Raw Story would accept those sources in the context of commenting on or debunking them rather than as narrative drivers. I did not independently confirm this theory; however, it might give rise to further investigation.  \n   Figure 6. U.S. Media Networks: September\u2013November 2020.  Nodes represent domains. Clusters focus on the top 50 domains by inLink connections.  \nReality-seeking  Alternative-reality \n \n40   Figure 7. U.S. Media Networks: September\u2013November 2020.  Partisan clustering: clusters are separated into a reality-seeking cluster (left) and an alternative-reality enclave (right). Nodes represent domains.   \n    Figure 8. U.S. Media Networks: September\u2013November 2020.  Partisan clustering, direct comparison: separated into alternative-reality (bottom) and reality-seeking (top) clusters. Nodes represent domains.  \nDemocrats  Republicans No Partisanship Reality-seeking  Alternative-reality \nReality-seeking  \nAlternative-reality  \n \n41  Quantitative analysis shows that the odds-ratio that a Republican source will belong to the alternative-reality-cluster is 7.8, compared with 32.2 for Democratic and 98.6 for predominantly neutral sources (Table 4). This odds-ratio quantifies the likelihood that a Republican-populated domain will be in the reality-seeking cluster of the open-linkage network versus the alternative-reality enclave. In other words, for every 7.8 domains predominantly inhabited by Republicans in the reality-seeking cluster (based on their interlinkage patterns with other domains in the reality-seeking cluster), there is one Republican-dominated domain that is part of the alternative-reality enclave (based on its interlinkage pattern with other domains in the alternative-reality enclave). This is a significantly higher frequency than shown by Democrats and neutral audiences, which inhabit one domain of the alternative-reality enclave for every 32.2 or 98.6 domains they are inhabiting in the reality-seeking cluster, respectively. I confirmed the robustness of this analysis using a Chi-square test, which yielded a value of 4594 at a p-value at close to 0.  Table 4. Number of Partisan-Dominated Domains by News Generation Mechanism: September\u2013November 2020.  Party Reality-seeking Domains Alternative-reality Domains  Odds-Ratio         Democratic  4604 143 32.2 Neutral 61,620 625 98.6 Republican 14,165 1810 7.8     Chi-square test statistic   4594 p = .001    Note. The odds-ratio on the media network level quantifies the prevalence of partisans in the reality-seeking cluster vs. the alternative-reality enclave. \n \n42  I also computed that the alternative-reality enclave is around three times denser than the reality-seeking cluster (0.013 versus 0.0034; see Table 5). This density computation reflects the interlinkage intensity within the reality-seeking cluster and the alternative-reality enclave. The news sources in the alternative-reality enclave rely on interlinking with each other\u2019s content at significantly higher rates. This finding is compatible with findings in previous studies, that have shown that conservative news sources pick up each other\u2019s stories to drive a cohesive narrative within their eco-chamber. Hence, it is reasonable to expect a higher degree of interlinkage within the alternative-reality enclave.   Table 5. Descriptive Statistics of Detected Clusters for U.S. Online Media, September\u2013November 2020.   Reality-seeking Cluster Alternative-reality Cluster    Number of Domains  5693  326 Average Weighted Degree  19.65  4.3 Density  0.0034  0.013   Total Modularity 0.08 Average Total Weighted Degree 9.8  Finally, I analyzed the overall modularity of the reality-seeking cluster and the alternative-reality enclave, where a modularity of 0 indicates that every cluster constituent is connected to an equal number of constituents inside and outside its own cluster, while a modularity of 1 indicates that there are full connections of one cluster amongst its constituents, while there are no connections to an outside cluster. The calculated modularity of 0.08 indicates that there is still a fairly high degree of interconnection between the reality-seeking cluster and the alternative-reality enclave.  \n \n43  United States: Twitter Network  The Twitter network in the U.S. presents a fairly split partisan landscape (Figures 9\u201313). Figure 9 shows there is a clear separation of sources consumed by Democrat and Republican users. Furthermore, there is an alternative-reality enclave consisting of 953 domains, whereas the reality-seeking cluster contains 5,345 domains (Figure 10). On the left side are mostly reality-seeking media, largely supported by Democrats and Independents, and on the right are alternative-reality media such as Breitbart and the Daily Caller, which are primarily consumed by Republicans (Figure 11). Furthermore, these outlets are shared more or less to a similar degree as the mainstream sources.  \n       Figure 9. U.S. Twitter Network:    Figure 10. U.S. Twitter Network:  September\u2013November 2020    September\u2013November 2020 Partisanship: Nodes represent domains    Clustering: Nodes represent domains   On the audience usage level, I observed a similar overlap to that seen on the media network level, whereby Republicans appear to inhabit a large overlapping area for media sources that my label propagation algorithm identified as belonging to the alternative-reality cluster. As reflected by Twitter shares, Raw Story remains part of the \nDemocrats  Republicans No Partisanship Reality-seeking  Alternative-reality   \n \n44  alternative-reality enclave based on its users\u2019 content consumption and sharing behavior (Figure 11). However, its users also consume and share many mainstream media sources that are part of the reality-seeking cluster, which is in sharp contrast to the typical inhabitant of the alternative-reality enclave who exhibits a far more limited exposure to the mainstream sources. Thus, the Raw Story audience behaves more similarly to a reality-seeking audience and has a significantly more diverse media diet than the average alternative-reality enclave audience. Note that this does not necessarily mean a wider media-diet in terms of number of sources, but rather one that is more evenly distributed amongst the reality-seeking cluster and the alternative-reality enclave.  \n  Figure 11. U.S. Twitter Network: September\u2013November 2020.  I observed a similar phenomenon in the opposite direction with the New York Post and\u2014possibly most interestingly\u2014with Fox News. Although audiences using these media sources were also identified as part of the reality-seeking cluster based on content consumption and sharing level (as reflected in Twitter sharing behavior), they seem to behave more similarly to audiences of the alternative-reality enclave in that their media \nReality-seeking  Alternative-reality \n \n45  diet is more limited to other news sources within that cluster. This finding is in line with the popular hypothesis that Fox News is mainstreaming unreliable narratives that attract audiences who perceive this information as identity-confirming. Subsequently, they reward Fox News with their attention while otherwise predominantly consuming sources in the alternative-reality enclave. Although I was unable to independently verify this notion (a detailed content analysis of Fox News exceeds the scope of this study), I could see from the collected data that for whatever reason, the New York Post and Fox News audiences seem to give attention to these outlets while otherwise behaving like inhabitants of the alternative-reality enclave. If further research confirms the theory that these outlets enjoy such trust and attention because they propagate identity-confirming content to these audiences, then it is reasonable to assume that they might be among the more consequential specificities of the U.S. media ecosystem.  Fox News has enormous reach and can safely be considered a reach medium. There are not many outlets of this scale in the alternative-reality enclave. That could be a key differentiator of the alternative-reality enclave in the United States versus similar enclaves elsewhere. There is no Fox News equivalent in Germany that is part of the reality-seeking cluster while also being inhabited by audiences that predominantly limit the remainder of their media diet to sources in the alternative-reality enclave.  I applied the same methodology used at the media network level to the Twitter network level (see Table 6). Again, there is a strong partisan correlation, with the odds of a Republican consuming and sharing a piece of content from a source in the alternative-reality enclave being 1.17, versus 163 for Democrats and 43 for moderate users.   \n \n46  Table 6. Partisan-Dominated Domains by News Generation Mechanism: September\u2013November 2020.   Party Reality-seeking Domains  Alternative-reality Domains  Odds-Ratio     Democrat 2945 18 163.6 Neutral 1335 31 43.06 Republican 1065 904 1.17     Chi-square test statistic   2257 p = 0.01     The odds-ratio quantifies the sharing consumption habits of partisans on Twitter.  This correlation can be seen also in Figures 12 and 13, which show mostly shared outlets and their relative position in the network. For every 1.17 piece of content that is consumed and shared from a source that is part of the reality-seeking cluster, a Republican consumes and shares one content source that is part of the alternative-reality enclave. I again validated the robustness of this finding using a Chi-square test and received a result of 2257 with a p-value close to 0.  \n \n47   Figure 12.

Direct comparison.  \nDemocrats  Republicans No Partisanship Reality-seeking  Alternative-reality \nReality-seeking  \nAlternative-reality  \n \n48  In terms of interconnectivity, the alternative-reality cluster is twice as dense as the reality-seeking cluster, which again aligns with the principles of networked propaganda and confirms my prior findings at the media or open linkage network level (Table 7). However, upon closer examination, this result can be interpreted slightly differently than the finding for the media network level. Although the increased density at the media network level (0.0034 reality-seeking cluster versus 0.013 of the alternative-reality enclave) speaks to the interconnectedness of the media sources and therefore to the interplay of content amongst the sources in the reality-seeking cluster versus the alternative-reality enclave (three times more in the alternative-reality enclave), my finding at the Twitter network level speaks to the behavior of the audiences in the respective clusters.   Table 7. Descriptive Statistics of Detected Clusters for U.S. Online Media: September\u2013November 2020.   Reality-seeking Cluster Alternative-reality Cluster    Number of Domains 5345 953 Average Weighted Degree 1203 428 Density 0.22 0.45   Total Modularity 0.1 Average Total Weighted Degree 1391  This density differential shows that audiences in the alternative-reality enclave are more active than users in the reality-seeking cluster. Since it has been shown in previous studies that the alternative-reality enclave behaves as it does to gain audiences\u2019 attention by propagating identity-confirming content and narratives\u2014in other words, narratives that their adherents like to hear, I know that this sort of content has a higher emotional \n \n49  charge for its inhabitants. As the connection between higher emotional charged content and audience engagement (including commenting on and sharing content) tightens, I would expect to see a higher level of activity in the alternative-reality enclave versus the reality-seeking cluster. Further, users of the alternative-reality enclave consume and share a media diet that is predominantly within that cluster, whereas mainstream audiences tend to consume and share sources that occasionally dip into the alternative-reality enclave but largely remain within the reality-seeking cluster.  Germany: Open Linkage Media Network   Figures 14\u201318 present the media landscape for Germany during the chosen observation period (September\u2013November 2020). Most of the domains (n = 1415) belong to the reality-seeking cluster, whereas 294 belong to the alternative-reality. Figures 14 and 15 show that like the U.S., the German media landscape forms a fairly interconnected media network, with a partisan cluster dominated by media outlets that are mostly shared by AfD supporters (indicated in blue). The rest of the media network is less organized with respect to partisanship, as the multi-party system in Germany seems to be distributed relatively evenly across the spectrum of mainstream new sources.  When comparing Figures 14 and 15, it seems that, like the U.S., there is a strong overlap between the alternative-reality enclave in Germany and a partisan constituency, namely the AfD. Interestingly, I found find that despite significant social, historical, institutional and media-ecosystem differences between the two countries, the alternative-reality enclave in Germany aligns with that in the U.S. in that it seems to predominantly form over the right end of the political spectrum. \n \n50        Figure 14. German Media Network:    Figure 15. German Media Network:  September\u2013November 2020    September\u2013November 2020 Clustering: Nodes represent domains   Partisanship: Nodes represent domains  Figure 16 presents the most prominent nodes of this ecosystem in terms of interlinkages. Mainstream sources such as Focus, Spiegel, and Finanznachrichten together with medical and scientific sources such as the WHO and CDC are the most central nodes in the reality-seeking cluster. In contrast, the Epoch Times, RT, Rubikon, and FreeWiki are the most prominent alternative-reality nodes, albeit their importance of the network is smaller than that of the most interlinked mainstream sources. Notably, most of the nodes in the alternative-reality enclave are right-leaning, with some exceptions, such as RT, which is suspected to have close relations to the Russian state.   \nAfD CSU CDU Reality-seeking  Alternative-reality Die Gr\u00fcnen FDP SPD Die Linke No Partisanship \n \n51    Figure 16. German Media Network: September\u2013November 2020.  Specifically, as summarized in Table 8, the odds of an outlet being AfD (far right) and belonging to this cluster is 0.9; the second closest party is Die Linke (far left) with odds more than 300% higher (3.1). This odds-ratio quantifies the propensity that a domain populated by AfD supporters will be in the reality-seeking cluster of the open-linkage network over the alternative-reality enclave. In other words, for every 0.9 domains predominantly inhabited by another party in the reality-seeking cluster (based on their interlinkage patterns with other domains in the that cluster), there is one domain predominantly inhabited by AfD supporters that is part of the alternative-reality enclave \nReality-seeking  Alternative-reality \n \n52    (based on its interlinkage pattern with other domains in that enclave). The prevalence in the alternative-reality enclave is substantially lower for the Republicans in the U.S. Again I validated the robustness of this finding with a chi-square test, which yielded 137.2 and a p-value close to 0.   Table 8. Number of Partisan-Dominated Domains by News Generation Mechanism: September\u2013November 2020.

These observations are in line with what Benkler, et al. found in the United States ecosystem and was confirmed by this study during our observation period in 2020.111 The media ecosystems in Germany and the United States contain a distinguishable low-credibility cluster, which is also highly partisan: Republicans in the United States and AfD supporters in Germany. Interestingly, in the German situation, the odds ratio for AfD voters at the network level is even more significant than that for Republicans in the United States (0.9 vs. 7.8, respectively). The reason for this significant differential might \n \n53  be the finer siloing of the German electorate in the context of a multi-party structure vs. the two-party structure in the United States. In other words, the AfD in Germany only corresponds to a specific sub-segment of the wider Republican umbrella in the Unites States, specifically the one that is more likely to be inhabiting the alternative-reality enclave.    \n Figure 17.

German Media Network: September - November 2020 Note: Partisan clustering direct comparison: separated into an alternative-reality (bottom) and a reality-seeking cluster (top). Nodes represent domains    Table 9 shows that, as in the Unites States, the alternative-reality cluster in Germany is significantly denser than the reality-seeking cluster (0.11 vs. 0.07) at the media network level, whereby the former\u2019s outlets are more interconnected than those of the latter. The news sources in Germany\u2019s alternative-reality enclave are also interlinking with each other\u2019s content at significantly higher rates. This finding is again compatible with observations in the Unites States and suggests that here, too, news outlets in the alternative-reality enclave pick up each other\u2019s stories to drive a cohesive narrative within their echo chamber. Hence, I see a higher degree of interlinkage within the alternative-reality enclave.  \nAfD CSU CDU Die Gr\u00fcnen FDP SPD Die Linke No Partisanship  \nReality-seeking  \nAlternative-reality  \n \n55  Table 9. Number of Partisan-Dominated Domains by News Generation Mechanism: September\u2013November 2020 \n Note. The odds-ratio quantifies the prevalence of partisans in the reality-seeking cluster vs. the alternative-reality enclave.   Finally, I analyzed the overall modularity of the reality-seeking and alternative-reality clusters in Germany (see Table 10), whereby a modularity of 0 indicates that every cluster constituent is connected to an equal number of constituents inside and outside its own cluster, whereas a modularity of 1 indicates that there are full connections amongst a cluster\u2019s constituents and no connections to an outside cluster. The modularity of 0.088 is almost identical to that of the United States (0.08). This result indicates that, as in the United States, there is a high degree of interconnection between the reality-seeking cluster and the alternative-reality enclave in Germany.   Table 10.

I found no substantive differences in the observed dynamics. Specifically, the results for the German ecosystem during that country\u2019s elections are fairly similar to those of September\u2013November 2020 (see Figures 19\u201323).  Figure 19 again demonstrates the existence of a fairly connected media ecosystem, part of which contains outlets mostly inhabited by AfD supporters. Figure 20 shows the existence of an alternative-reality enclave comprising 168 domains, whereas the \u201creality-seeking\u201d cluster contains 1152 domains.  \n   Figure 19.

Partisanship: Nodes represent domains.  \nAfD CSU CDU Reality-seeking  Alternative-reality Die Gr\u00fcnen FDP SPD Die Linke No Partisanship \n \n57   Again, the alternative-reality enclave is much more interconnected than the reality-seeking cluster (0.07 vs. 0.015 graph density), and the total modularity of 0.08 is identical to that of the U.S. during its election cycle in 2020 (Table 11). Furthermore, domains belonging to the former are mostly shared on Twitter by AfD users. The odds of a domain mostly shared by AfD supporters belonging to this cluster is 1.1, whereas it is 4.4 for the next party (Die Linke; Table 12). These ratios are fairly similar to those for the media network during the U.S. election cycle (0.9 and 3.1, respectively). This result denotes that media landscape partisanship is robust regardless of the time period.   Table 11.

The slightly smaller size of the cluster during the second period is depicted in the presence of alternative sources in the most linked nodes, with only RT and Epoch Times being present. Nonetheless, as in the first case, the reality-seeking cluster consists of mainstream outlets and scientific/COVID-related sources.   \n Figure 21. German Media Network: July\u2013September 2021.

Figure 24 shows an interconnected network with partisan segments. One set of sources is mainly shared by AfD supporters (blue) and another is dominated by Die Gr\u00fcnen supporters (green); the remaining segment appears to be shared by supporters of several parties. Furthermore, the Twitter network contains a clear alternative-reality cluster, which contains 457 sources, whereas the reality-seeking cluster has 10,476 sources (Figure 25). As with the media network, sources in the alternative-reality cluster are primarily shared by AfD partisans. An examination of content consumption and sharing level again indicates a significant overlap of partisan shares by AfD supporters who share content from sources within the alternative-reality enclave.  \n              Figure 24.

This rationale explains why Journalistenwatch so strongly manifests as a constituent of the alternative-reality enclave in this network view.   \n    Figure 26.

In other words, for every 5.65 pieces of content consumed and shared by AfD supporters in the reality-seeking cluster, one piece of content is consumed and shared from a media source that inhabits the alternative-reality enclave. I confirmed the robustness of this analysis using a Chi-square test, which yielded a value of 2026 at a p-value close to 0.   Table 13. Number of partisan-dominated domains by sharing generation mechanism. \n The odds-ratio quantifies the consumption and sharing habits of partisans on Twitter.  Table 14 confirms that the alternative-reality cluster is over four times denser than the reality-seeking cluster (0.09 vs. 0.02), and domains such as Journalistenwatch gathered as many shares as mainstream sources such as Die Welt. This result shows that alternative-reality sources have higher importance in terms of public consumption habits than in domain-to-domain connectivity. This increased engagement level is analogous to our observations in the United States and suggests that in Germany, too, the content being propagated by these news sources leads to increased engagement and user activity.

The robustness check found no substantive differences in the dynamics (Figures 29\u201333).  Figures 29 and 30 again show a fairly connected network; however, in contrast to September\u2013November 2020, there is only one clearly partisan segment, which denotes the consumption habits of AfD supporters.

Otherwise, there do not seem to be any significant patterns that were not already visible in the original examination of the media and Twitter networks.   \n Figure 34.

Content Analysis  In this section, I summarize the various domains and articles that occupied central positions in the media and Twitter networks for both Germany and the U.S. Then, I describe the prevalence of the two types of sources on Facebook and Twitter. In the third and fourth sections, I evaluate a small sample of news articles, classify them based on their controversiality, and analyze the prevalence of \u201cUs vs., Them\u201d content across clusters. In this way, I could evaluate the applicability of networked propaganda principles in the information networks of both countries. \nReality-seeking  Alternative-reality \n \n71  Top Sources across Media Ecosystems, Countries and Clusters Tables 18\u201337 in the Appendix show the top ten sources and articles from inLinks, Facebook, and Twitter shares for both Germany and the U.S. The tables indicate that regardless of country and time period, the most prevalent sources were primarily related to domains from the \u201creality-seeking\u201d clusters. Furthermore, there is a significant prevalence of science- and health-related domains. This was not unexpected, as I focused on content related to COVID-19, and both media sources and users cited and shared pandemic information from health organizations and websites that publish scientific results.  From a qualitative perspective, the URLs associated with \u201calternative reality\u201d domains appear to be more controversial. More conclusive results are presented in the third part of this section.   Comparison of Source Diffusion in the Networks The results of the information diffusion analysis quantitatively support the findings from the descriptive statistics. Stories from reality-seeking clusters were shared much more frequently than those representing the alternative reality enclave on both Facebook and Twitter. On Twitter, these stories comprised 78% of the total for the U.S. and 83% of the total for Germany in the first period and 92% in the second period (see Table 17). On Facebook, shared stories from the alternative-reality enclave were shared only 6% of the time for the U.S., while in Germany they were shared 9% and 10% of the time in the first and second periods, respectively.  \n \n72  Table 17. Sharing Ratio of Stories from Outlets in the Reality-seeking and Alternative-reality Clusters for Germany and the U.S. across Twitter, Facebook, and Overall.

Overall, when aggregating Twitter and Facebook shares, stories from the alternative-reality enclave comprised between 9% and 13% of all shares, indicating that a solid portion of the diffused information was generated by outlets that follow the principles of networked propaganda.   Comparison of Content across Sources on Twitter A manual evaluation of the top 100 most shared sources on Twitter in the U.S. and Germany revealed a clear pattern in terms of the prevalence of controversial content among sources from the two competing clusters. In both cases, \u201calternative-reality\u201d sources generated substantially more controversial content than \u201creality-seeking\u201d sources. In the U.S., the top shared articles from \u201calternative-reality\u201d sources contained 92 controversial stories (43 containing low-credibility information), only 8 of which were \n \n73  factual (Table 18). In contrast, stories from the \u201creality-seeking\u201d cluster contained only one story of low-credibility and 49 with affective content. Similarly, in Germany, 49 out of 100 articles from the \u201calternative-reality\u201d cluster had controversial content (affective or low-credibility), compared with thirteen coming out from the \u201creality-seeking\u201d cluster (Table 19). These results show that the \u201calternative-reality\u201d domain indeed generated more controversial and affective content, confirming the prevalence of principles of networked propaganda in both the U.S. and Germany.

Table 20 summarizes these findings.  Category Factual Controversial (affective & low credibility) Reality-seeking 87 13 Alternative-reality 51 49 \n \n74  Table 20. Descriptive Statistics of Detected Clusters for Online News Media and Twitter during the U.S. Elections  \nNote: I included the average occurrences in the datasets (top 5,000 for each), the Mann-Whitney U test statistics, and the related p-values.   In the U.S. dataset, I counted mentions of \u201calt-right\u201d and \u201cfringe\u201d media in the reality-seeking cluster for the media and Twitter networks; mentions of \u201cmainstream\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d were counted in the alternative-reality clusters. In both cases, I found that stories stemming from the alternative-reality clusters included significantly more language that uses \u201cus vs. them\u201d rhetoric.    Twitter Media U.S. U_truth 11,763,493 12,118,813.5 U_alternative 13,236,507 12,881,186.5 Mean_truth 0.0284 0.0442 Mean_alternative 0.1278 0.1034 p-value 0.0 0.0 DE U_truth 2,853,072 3,566,427.5 U_alternative 2,866,928 3,568,572.5 Mean_truth 0.0002 0.0006 Mean_alternative 0.0026 0.0007 p-value 0.0018 0.3215 \n \n75  Similarly for the German networks, I counted mentions of alternative Medien (including all its declinations in German) in the reality-seeking cluster and mentions of L\u00fcgenpresse in the alternative-reality clusters. In both the Twitter and media networks, I found a higher number of \u201cus vs. them\u201d references coming from the alternative-reality clusters, although this difference was only statistically significant for the most shared articles on Twitter. These results demonstrate that that the \u201calternative-reality\u201d cluster is indeed defined by a stronger in-group versus out-group attitude than the reality-seeking cluster, thereby confirming that it follows the principles of networked propaganda.  \n \n76     Chapter V  Discussion    My analysis provided straightforward answers to the research questions. I detected similar structures of propaganda feedback loops (i.e., alternative-reality enclaves) in both Germany and the United States despite national differences in party and media systems. In this chapter, I discuss how the results relate to each hypothesis.  Review of Hypotheses \u25cf H-1: A media ecosystem contains a segregated, content-independent alternative-reality cluster. My findings confirm this hypothesis. In both the United States and in Germany (during both periods), I found an significant portion of media outlets belonged to the alternative-reality cluster, both from the perspective of media inLinks and Twitter user consumption habits.  \u25cf H-2: The alternative-reality cluster follows the principles of networked propaganda (mechanism: partisan, low-credibility news and news-sources, in-group vs. out-group, affective polarization). The comparison of network properties and the content analysis showed that the \u201calternative-reality\u201d clusters across ecosystems indeed followed principles of networked propaganda. The specific mechanism was universal across the two countries despite their  \n \n77  distinct media, social, and political traditions and practices. In both cases, there was a clearly identifiable alternative-reality enclave, which functioned under the principles of networked propaganda. The clusters evinced a clear partisan direction wherein right-wing partisans and outlets occupied core positions. The alternative-reality cluster also generated significantly more low-credibility and affective stories, which included more in-group vs. out-group language than outlets belonging to the reality-seeking cluster.  \u25cf H-3: This networked propaganda feedback loop varies in scope and size but not in mechanism. The features of the detected propaganda feedback loops showed that the principles of networked propaganda were universal, and there were additional concrete similarities. For example, as quantified by the modularity values in the networks, media interlinkages between clusters were the same in Germany and the U.S., showing that media functioned similarly across countries. Furthermore, the diffusion of these stories on Facebook and Twitter was quantitatively similar in the U.S. and Germany, thereby demonstrating that the clusters had a similar reach across countries.  However, there were also clear differences specific to the magnitude and scope of networked propaganda. For example, the alternative-reality enclave was larger in Germany at the media-ecosystem level but smaller at the user-consumption level. The density of these clusters was also different, with the U.S. Twitter network being much more segregated than the corresponding German one, and the within-cluster information flow was much higher in the former, as depicted by the modularity and cluster density values.  \n \n78  Comparing Twitter and media networks, the U.S. Twitter network was more polarized (as evinced by modularity and density of clusters) than the corresponding media network, whereas the German Twitter network was less segregated than the media network. This indicates that differences in media structures and consumption patterns are linked to each country\u2019s specific social features and practices, that is, there was a clear delineation between partisans and consumption habits in the U.S. Twitter network while there was more convolution in the German network.  Further differences included a much higher asymmetry in the generated partisan content in the U.S. media ecosystem, also the German media network did not include a major \u201creach\u201d outlet such as Fox News that was tightly connected and adjacent to the alternative-reality enclave.  The above features showed that the principles of networked propaganda applied in both countries. However, there were significant country-specific elements that influenced the expansion of network propaganda.  Summary of Findings This study of the U.S. and German media ecosystems showed that the specific propaganda feedback loop structure found in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections by Benkler, et al. was also prevalent in the U.S. and German media ecosystems in 2020.112 Although I focused on COVID-related content rather than elections, and studied distinct social, political, and media ecosystems, I identified properties of networked propaganda that were universal in their mechanism but different in their scope and size.  \n \n79  The study provided important insights into how propaganda mechanisms emerge and manifest themselves. It also paved the way for additional questions that might be examined, such as whether the siloing of ideas under a specific party (as was seen in the case of Germany) leads to a \u201czoning\u201d of problematic content, or whether the entrenchment of a \u201creach\u201d medium such as Fox News within the \u201calternative-reality\u201d enclave actually mainstreams problematic ideas or bridges political segregation. My study both extends Benkler, et al.\u2019s theory and lays the groundwork to investigate further properties of networked propaganda. \n \n80   Appendix  Tables 21\u201338    Table 21.
