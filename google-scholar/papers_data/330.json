According to the founders of the Maine Oyster Trail, there are over 150 oyster farms currently operating on Maine\u2019s coast, which is about twice as many as there were in 2016 (Maine Sea Grant). With this boom in the industry has come a wave of opportunity, as well as news coverage about the shellfish. This study examines the socio-cultural significance to the state of Maine. While the oyster aquaculture industry is growing rapidly in Maine, relatively limited attention has been given to the sociocultural value of oysters. To begin to address this gap, I conducted a systematic analysis of newspaper articles to elucidate different ways that oyster aquaculture confers value to people in the state of Maine.   Here I review Bangor Daily News articles that included the word \u201coyster\u201d or \u201coysters\u201d published within the last 10 years from 2013 to 2023. A total of 126 relevant articles were presented. These articles were reviewed and coded thematically with each relevant excerpt categorized based on the value(s) or area(s) of socio-cultural significance that they underscored. Each recurring value or theme that arose was determined to be one way in which oysters carry socio-cultural significance to the state of Maine.  The most commonly identified themes presented were those regarding a sense of livelihood. This included four subcategories including, aquaculture from both a positive (14.3%) and negative lens (18.1%), tourism (3.6%), and creative opportunities (12.6%), with excerpts pertaining to aquaculture and creative opportunities dominating. The other \n       three overarching themes identified were a sense of community, a sense of environmental awareness, and a sense of symbolic representation. A sense of community enveloped subcategories pertaining to celebration (2.7%), general entertainment (2.7%), local sales and support (4.4%), restaurants/food (4.4%), and bars/alcohol (4.1%). A sense of environmental awareness included the subcategories of sustainability (9.9%), climate change and habitat destruction (12.3%), and oyster population (1.9%), proving to be quite significant. Finally, a sense of symbolic representation referenced oysters in the context of metaphorical representation (1.4%), historical representation (0.8%), luxury (1.1%), feminism (0.8%), connoisseurial knowledge (2.5%), and Maine pride (2.2%). These percentages were determined simply by comparing the number of excerpts coded into each category to the total number of coded excerpts, which was 364.   This research suggests that oysters appear to have socio-cultural significance to Maine and support values such as a sense of community, livelihood, environmental awareness, and symbolism, which can be broken down into many more specific areas of significance. This study aims to promote an understanding of the relationship between people, values, and culture, while simultaneously sharing information regarding the sustainability of oyster cultivation, which is expanding in the state of Maine.        \n        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I know this may sound cliche, but I would like to start off by thanking my family for their unwavering love, support, and encouragement. Specifically, I would like to thank my dad, Win, for never failing to tell me how proud he is of me and for being endlessly enthusiastic about my life. I would like to thank my mom, Kristin, for constantly validating me, giving me advice, and remembering where I leave my shoes. Thank you to my baby brother, Harper, (who is not a baby at all) for keeping me young at heart and for never following through when you say \u201cno\u201d to a hug. And, thank you to my brother, Stony, for turning me into a big sister and for putting a smile on my face ever since. I would also like to thank my boyfriend, Ryan, for giving me pep talks throughout this research process and for going for swims and walks with me whenever I need a break. Thank you to my best friends for all of the amazing college memories and for the promises to never stop making more. I love you all.  Additionally, I would like to thank my advisor, WGE, for encouraging me to go to UMaine in the first place and for helping me out of every stressful situation that arose during my time there. Thank you to Adam St. Gelais and Chris Noren for teaching a bangin\u2019 aquaculture course at the Darling Marine Center and for sparking my interest in oyster aquaculture. Thank you to Gereardo Calero, Oscar Pacheco, and Rebeca Quesada Cespedes, and to the many Costa Rican oyster farmers for giving me a peek into your impressive work and inspiring livelihoods.  \n       Lastly, thank you to my thesis committee members and Melissa Ladenheim for being kind, patient, and understanding throughout this process as my timeline has been unconventional and my ideas can be disorganized. Thank you for reigning me in. \n i      TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...1 METHODOLOGY\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026.3   STUDY AREA\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20263  STUDY DESIGN\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026....6   DATA CODING: TIER1\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.8   DATA CODING: TIER 2\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20268 RESULTS\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 CODING THEMATIC FRAMEWORK AND DEFINITIONS\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610  SENSE OF COMMUNITY\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 10  SENSE OF LIVELIHOOD\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202611  SENSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202612  SENSE OF SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202613 DISCUSSION\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026....17 CONCLUSION\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026.24REFERENCES\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.25AUTHOR\u2019S BIOGRAPHY\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026..30       \n ii      LIST OF TABLES & FIGURES Figure 1.

Cultural significance is defined as having some kind of value for past, present, and/or future generations in a given place. When considering cultural significance, the first question to be asked is what is culturally significant to a given place. The next question to be asked is how is this culturally significant to that given place? These questions can be answered through observing people, speaking to people, or listening to and reading the news. After living, working, and going to school in a place for four years, one would hear, observe, and read enough to know at least some of what carries value there. Understanding shared values within a community is essential in maintaining peace, respect, healthy relationships, effective communication, community engagement, and cultural preservation.  That being said, there is no doubt that oysters carry value in the state of Maine. Oysters are most widely recognized to be economically and environmentally valuable. They are most obviously valuable from an economic standpoint since they provide income and work to people in Maine, which has grown more significant since the number of farms and number of annual landings as increased throughout the last decade. They prove to by environmentally and ecologically valuable in the they filter feed, helping to keep water clean and free of excess algae and nutrients, promoting the growth of other ecologically important organisms (NOAA, 2022). While culture does envelope both the economic and environmental aspects of a region, it can also include much more. That being said, there still lies the question of \u201chow oysters are culturally significant to \n 2      Maine\u201d. As stated priorly, this question can be addressed through many different means, one of which is by reading the news.  While news and media can impact culture, they also represent it. In fact, a published author featured in Oxford\u2019s Research Encyclopedia states that \u201cAt the social systems level, culture is often defined as relating to shared social practices, meanings, beliefs, symbols and norms. The relationship between journalism, culture, and society is a symbiotic one. Journalism influences culture, but it is also influenced by it. In fact, as some argue, journalism is culture\u201d (Hanusk, 2016). Media targets people by addressing information that will capture their audience\u2019s attention and elicit opinions. The information addressed repeatedly in media coverage can be considered culturally significant to the region in which it targets since it represents the readers\u2019 interests. The data collected through this study will be focused on the different roles that oysters play in Maine and the connections they have with the many different aspects of Maine\u2019s culture. This study is conducted under the premise that oysters are culturally significant in Maine, and it aims to address how.           \n 3      METHODOLOGY Study Area Before one can consider the current cultural significance of Maine oysters, it is important to understand the relationship between humans and oysters in this area throughout history. The four documented indigenous tribes in Maine relied heavily on wild-caught oysters as a source of food for thousands of years (Schmitt, 2017). Archaeological evidence and written studies suggest that ancestors of the Etchemin tribe would stay in the area, harvesting and collecting oysters during the early summer months before moving on and continuing their travels along the river (Lackovic, 2019). Massive oyster middens still stand on the banks of the Damariscotta River estuary in Newcastle, Maine as proof of large-scale oyster consumption.  The natural oyster stock collapsed with the introduction of the snail species Urosalpinx cinerea, commonly known as the Atlantic Oyster Drill, which entered this section of the river as a result of natural climate change, heightened water level, and increased salinity (Sanger, 1997). In 1821, the Maine State Legislature passed a law that prohibited the destruction of oyster reefs and limited wild capture, only allowing people to capture for personal consumption between the months of June and September. In 1849, the Maine State Legislature issued an act which granted Mainers the right to cultivate oysters and grow them out anywhere below the low tide mark with permission from neighboring property owners. In 1901, the first official oyster farm in Maine was launched in Portland harbor, failing shortly after. Small oyster bars sold oysters from Maryland and Virginia, but it was widely assumed that Maine\u2019s waters were simply too cold to cultivate oysters. This was disproved in 1970 by Dr. Herb Hidu at the University \n 4      of Maine\u2019s Darling Marine Center (Lackovic, 2019). After Hidu introduced cold water hatchery technology to the University of Maine\u2019s Darling Marine Center, farms began popping up and cultivating the native species, Crassostrea virginica, commonly known as the Eastern oyster which is tolerant to the extreme conditions of Maine\u2019s waters. During the same decade, marine scientists began selectively breeding this species of oysters to best suit Maine\u2019s conditions (Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, 2023). More recently, hatcheries have begun cross breeding tetraploid male oysters with diploid female oysters to produce triploid offspring. Triploid oysters are valuable products because they are sterile, and therefore put more energy into growth than into reproduction, allowing them to produce more meat (Guo et al., 1996). Although the natural oyster stock in this area collapsed, people have since found ways to grow, consume, and distribute oysters sustainably. With their popularity has come strong cultural significance, as they hold value on many different fronts in the state of Maine.  Not only are oysters culturally significant, but they also play a very unique role in their environment as ecosystem engineers, meaning that they serve as a structural habitat for many other organism including fish, invertebrates, and other species of shellfish (Chowdhury, 2019). They are filter-feeding bivalve mollusks that live in brackish and marine environments (Rodolfo et al., 2021). Filter feeders like oysters obtain nutrients by non-selectively pumping water through their bodies, their gills not only absorbing oxygen, but also extracting suspended particles, algae, phytoplankton and zooplankton (Gilbert, 2023). Up until recently, it was widely believed that minerals and proteins that compose oyster shells simply come together in the water outside of the cell without any rhyme, reason, or direction. However, scientists have more recently observed tiny \n 5      crystals of these combined proteins and minerals secreting out of oysters and settling in chipped or damaged areas (Galloway, 2015). Oyster shells are mostly made of calcium carbonate, but their components also include magnesium, sodium, copper, iron, nickel, strontium (John, 2016), and polysaccharides including nacre (Yamagami, 2021). Mineral availability is one of the many factors that oyster farmers must consider when assessing their stock\u2019s growth, quality, and health. Other important factors include temperature, salinity, food availability, density, oxygen availability, biofouling, nutrient content, natural events, and much more.  Oyster reefs provide a vital link between marine and land ecosystems, by protecting shorelines from erosion, removing pollutants, and buffering the effects of ocean acidification. These natural structures act as physical barriers against waves, tides,  \n and floods that cause erosion (Gillies et al., 2020). Coastal erosion does not only lead to loss of land and property, but it can also be detrimental to coastal ecosystems and \nFigure 1. Simplified oyster filter feeding process courtesy of DrawnbyDawn.  \n 6      fisheries (Islam and Ryan, 2016). While oyster communities have a lot of ecosystem value, individual oysters can filter over 150 liters of water daily, consuming algae, excess nutrients, and other suspended particles (Sargent, 2021). By removing excess algae and nutrients, they create a healthier habitat for themselves and other organisms by ensuring a higher content of available oxygen (Gillies et al., 2020). By removing suspended matter in general, they are allowing sunlight to penetrate deeper into the water column, powering photosynthesis and supporting the entire food web. Another important service that shellfish provide is the input of calcium carbonate into surrounding waters. While oyster shell growth is negatively impacted by acidic conditions, their presence simultaneously buffers the effects of ocean acidification on a small scale. For the same reasons that chewable calcium carbonate tablets can settle acid reflux in the stomach, calcium present in oyster shells can neutralize surrounding acidic water when dissolved (Malmquist, 2013). While oyster reefs are efficient in combating coastal erosion, any community of individual oysters is efficient in combating water pollution and ocean acidification. Nonetheless, culturing oysters can help to enhance its surrounding environment. Study Design News sources communicate and publish pieces based on their target audience. Since Maine-based news sources target Mainers and address happenings within the state, it can be inferred that they align with their readers\u2019 interests. That being said, localized culture can be studied by reading and analyzing news sources. The objective of this study was to qualitatively analyze news articles to identify ways in which oysters hold cultural significance to people in Maine. Bangor Daily News was chosen to source as the target \n 7      newspaper as it has been noted to be relatively unbiased compared to other Maine-based daily news sources. For the purposes of this study, organizing data reported by Bangor Daily News into culture-related categories was the most efficient and effective method of analyzing the cultural significance of oysters in Maine. In the research world, this is known as coding. There are two types of basic qualitative data coding, deductive coding and inductive coding. Deductive coding requires the pre-existence of categories which  data is sorted into, whereas inductive coding begins with a set of data that the researcher uses to create categories and sort the entirety of the data into (Indian Journal of Continuing Nursing Education). The categories created inductively can be used in future studies or in comparison studies to use a deductive approach. The research question being asked in this study was how oysters are culturally significant, and the codes or categories pulled from the data provided the answers to this question, which follows the inductive  \napproach. Two tiers of codes were created, the first being broad, and the second being narrower.   \nFigure 2. Deductive and inductive coding processes courtesy of Indian Journal of Continuing Nursing Education.   \n 8      With little experience in coding and a limited time frame, the key to reliably  analyzing data for this study was simplicity. Using Gale\u2019s online database called \u201cNewsstand\u201d, Bangor Daily News articles published in the last 10 years regarding oysters in Maine were retrieved. Specifically, the articles collected were published between January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2023, which was intended to capture the current cultural representation of oysters in Maine. Using the advanced search tool in Newsstand, articles were filtered and restricted to only those published by Bangor Daily News between said dates that contain the words \u201coyster\u201d or \u201coysters\u201d. Bangor Daily News was selected as it is one of the most widely read daily news sources in Maine, with only a slight left leaning bias, according to many bias rating websites including the commonly known \u201callsides.com\u201d, \u201cbiasly.com\u201d, and \u201cmediabiasfactcheck.com\u201d. It also represents the 2nd district of Maine which aligns with the state\u2019s fishing sector, the most relevant area to the topic in question. With the search criteria and filtration mentioned, 186 results were presented. Data Coding: Tier 1 The first tier of codes or broad categories was created by skimming the first page of articles retrieved which included twenty articles published throughout the last decade. While many topics appeared repeatedly, there were four that encompassed every common theme that arose. Data Coding: Tier 2 The second tier of codes or narrow categories was created by reading each of the 186 articles produced during the search line by line. Articles that were not relevant to oysters were discarded, leaving 126 relevant articles out of the 186 that were presented \n 9      during the search. Some of these articles involved oyster mushrooms or even street names with the word \u201coyster\u201d, but did not actually have anything to do with oysters. Relevant excerpts of the 126 articles taken into consideration were highlighted in different colors, depending on the themes they encompassed. In order to be assigned its own color, the themes must have appeared at least three times throughout the 126 relevant articles. Each of these narrow themes were encompassed by one of the four broader themes pulled during the first tier of coding.                 \n 10      RESULTS The broad categories identified during the first tier of coding included a sense of community, a sense of livelihood, a sense of environmental awareness, and a sense of symbolic representation, all of which define the cultural significance of oysters in Maine. Within a sense of community, oysters were found to represent celebration, general entertainment, local sales and support, restaurants and food, and bars and alcohol. Within a sense of livelihood, oysters were found to represent aquaculture through a positive and negative lens, tourism, and creative opportunities. Within a sense of environmental awareness, the topics that appeared most regarding oysters were sustainability, climate change and habitat destruction, and oyster populations. Within a sense of symbolic representation, the topics presented include metaphorical mentions, historical context, luxury, feminism, Maine pride, and connoisseurial knowledge. These are all defined and provided with an example below. Coding Thematic Framework and Definitions Sense of Community Celebration. Excerpt references oysters regarding celebration during holiday, gathering, or social event. \u201cI think people love to enjoy oysters at this celebratory time of year\u2026Getting together with family and friends and shucking some oysters is a tradition for many families\u201d (Edgecomb, 2021)  General entertainment. Excerpt references oyster(s) paired with calm, cozy settings, or regarding noncommercial harvest, and learning how to shuck.  \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to eat oysters and sit on the water?\u201d (Ragussis, 2014) \n 11      Local sales and support. Excerpt references oyster(s) in regards to eating locally, supporting small businesses, farmers markets, or neighborly relationships between oyster farmers and consumers.  \u201cAlso, \u2018buy local\u2019 has become a more common refrain in Maine and elsewhere as part of a strategy to dilute the pandemic\u2019s economic impact. Many producers and dealers in Maine\u2019s seafood industry in recent years have sought to expand their direct-to-consumer sales, hoping to boost Maine seafood\u2019s reputation and to keep more of the profits generated from their products, but the pandemic has put a sharper point on boosting home seafood consumption\u201d (Trotter, 2020).  Restaurants and food. Excerpt references oyster(s) as a highlight on a restaurant\u2019s menu or an individual\u2019s blog about food. \u201cThere\u2019s an ever-changing oyster menu of shellfish sourced from Maine\u2019s many oyster farms, to be paired with things like fried almonds and house-made pickles. On a recent weeknight, other seafood dishes included a fish fry comprised of crab croquettes, oysters and fish; hardshell clams served with polenta, greens and smoky bacon in a pork broth; and a half lobster served with either brown butter and lemon, or herb aioli, Mexican street corn and a popover\u201d (Burnham, 2017).  Bars and alcohol. Excerpt references oyster(s) in the name of a bar or in regards to alcohol pairing. \u201cOndine Oyster + Wine Bar is open for dinner from Thursdays through Tuesdays, 5 to 9 p.m. It is closed on Wednesdays\u201d (Burnham, 2017). Sense of Livelihood Aquaculture through a positive lens. Excerpt references oyster(s) in regards to research, labor, and other efforts put into cultivating oysters. Includes references to industry growth, support, and financial success. \u201cMore generally, the popularity and demand for oysters is growing\u201d (Schipani, 2021). \n 12      Aquaculture through a negative lens. Excerpt references oyster(s) in regards to obstacles that growers must overcome, including backlash from the public and competing lobstermen.  \u201cDevin said he\u2019s more concerned about potential conflicts of interest with other fisheries \u2013 lobstermen and scallop draggers that still work in the winter \u2013 than he is with riparian landowners who may not like the sight of oyster nets or additional working boats\u201d (Moretto, 2013).  Tourism. Excerpt references oyster(s) in regards to aqua tourism, which aims to educate curious tourists. This provides income to oyster farmers as well as tour companies. \u201cCarroll approached the Maine Department of Marine Resources more than a year ago to establish a Maine Oyster Tasting Trail. All these initiatives help increase the visitor\u2019s appetite for oysters, which taste different up and down the coast\u201d (Pierce, 2014).  Creative opportunities. Excerpt references creative ways to make use of oyster(s), most of which provide income, support lifestyles, or replace items that would otherwise cost money.  \u201cLaying hens require up to four-times more calcium to form hard shells than non-layers, so you need to provide calcium supplements in addition to their regular feed. Lichthenwalner suggests using oyster shell grit and feed formulated specifically for laying hens\u201d (Bayly, 2021).  Sense of Environmental Awareness Sustainability. Excerpt references oyster(s) as a sustainable source of food and income. Includes excerpts in which oyster farmers make statements that support sustainable practices. \u201cBy cultivating young oysters in hatcheries before transferring them to ocean growing sites, aquaculture operators have a better ability to adapt to the changing climate than traditional fishermen, who depend entirely on Mother Nature for their catch, said Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. He also said that because of such nursery operations, and because \n 13      aquaculture growers use relatively small sites, they tend to be closely attuned to even minor changes in environmental conditions such as temperature, pH levels, or salinity. \u2018It\u2019s an example of why aquaculture farmers become advocates for environmental protection,\u2019 Belle said. Fish farmers routinely collect environmental data firsthand, he said, and have direct knowledge of how their product is affected by surrounding conditions\u201d (Trotter, 2020).  Climate change and habitat destruction. Excerpt references oyster(s) regarding negative changes in physical, chemical, or biological environment.   \u201cMaine shellfish harvesters have been warning about increasingly acidic coastal waters \u2013 they call it \u2018dead mud\u2019 \u2013 since at least three years ago\u201d (Cousins, 2014).  Oyster population. Excerpt references increasing wild oyster population(s) as a result of warming waters and reproduction of farmed oysters.  \u201cOysters are starting to reappear in the wild along the shoreline, too, not just in plastic cultivation mesh bags in licensed aquaculture lease sites\u201d (Trotter, 2021). Sense of Symbolic Representation Metaphorical representation. Excerpt references oyster(s) as part of a metaphor with an ulterior meaning. \u201cThe fool\u2019s journey represents being young and naive, and innocent, and pure-hearted and childlike and unfettered and thinking the world is my oyster. Through the school of hard knocks we learn it\u2019s not always an oyster. It means learning how to troubleshoot your life in all the right ways without life hardening you. Without life weakening you. Life should strengthen you, not weaken you. It\u2019s designed to teach us to make us stronger, not weaker. But that\u2019s always a choice and an option\u201d (Loffredo, 2013).  Historical representation. Excerpt references oyster(s) in a historical context including mentions of indigenous harvest and traditions. \u201cEastern oysters, also known as American oysters, were native to Maine for millennia, as indicated by ancient shell middens found along the coast where members of Wabanaki indigenous tribes discarded oyster shells for generations\u201d (April, 2021). \n 14      Luxury. Excerpt refers to oyster(s) as delicacies or in context to luxurious settings. \u201cA Maine seafood delicacy that is on the rise is oysters, Nancy Harmon Jenkins said\u201d (Schipani, 2021). Feminism. Excerpt refers specifically to women who work with oyster(s) and embrace their femininity. \u201cThe Biddeford resident taught herself to farm oysters in Nonesuch Point, rocks a designer wetsuit\u201d (Pierce, 2015). Maine pride. Excerpt refers to oyster(s) as a source of pride for Mainers. \u201cThe Maine Aquaculture Association recently launched the Maine Oyster Trail to highlight the variety and quality of oysters throughout the state\u201d (Schipani and Jenkins, 2021). Connoisseurial knowledge. Excerpt refers to expertise knowledge and opinions regarding oyster(s), often pertaining to flavor. \u201cA \u2018cocktail\u2019 might be a two-chew,\u201d he said, pointing to a smaller oyster. \u201cA \u2018select\u2019 might be a four-chew\u201d (Brogan, 2017).        \n 15        Figure 3.

The color-coded categories on the right are more specific codes identified during the second-tier coding. Both the broad and narrow categories represent values.  \n\n 17      DISCUSSION  Understanding a community\u2019s values is essential to understanding its culture and vice versa. One cannot exist without the other. This study aims to understand an aspect of Maine\u2019s culture by analyzing the ways in which oysters are valuable to Maine\u2019s community. The results of this study show that a sense of community, a sense of livelihood, a sense of environmental awareness, and a sense of symbolism are all important values that influence the culture of Maine. All of these values are represented by oysters and what they mean for people in the community. Understanding a community\u2019s shared values allows people to communicate, make decisions, and solve conflicts effectively.  One shared value presented through this study is a sense of community, which is shown through the presence of oysters during celebrations. Several articles mentioned the consumption of oysters at Thanksgiving, a tradition that represents communal gratitude and sharing. Oysters were also mentioned to be present at events, serving as a form of entertainment. In fact, Bar Harbor Oyster Company has employees shuck oysters at weddings, galleries, and parties as a source of entertainment and catering. They also promote the locally sourced food system by exclusively selling their oysters on Mount Desert Island using the honors system in their shop and delivering to local restaurants using a small refrigerated truck. While there are some oyster farms in Maine who ship their product, most do not, which means they are primarily being consumed locally. Oysters that are sold at restaurants and bars in Maine contribute to a sense of community as these establishments are both economically and socially significant to residents as well as visitors. Many of the articles reviewed during this study mentioned oysters as a \n 18      featured item in restaurant advertisements. There were also several mentions of oyster and alcohol pairings being sold at bars throughout the state.  A sense of livelihood was the most prominent value identified through this study. This includes mentions of aquaculture through both a positive and negative light. The oyster aquaculture industry in Maine is growing, becoming more prosperous, and providing more jobs, but with this comes its own struggles. For example, in some areas, lobstermen and fishermen see oyster farms as competition for space, particularly those that exceed 10 acres (Powers, 2018). This has created some tension within the working waterfront community, which is why it is important for people to remember that there is a shared value at stake, a sense of livelihood. Mainers pride themselves in how hard they work, often in harsh conditions, so recognizing this shared value could and should encourage fishermen, lobstermen and oyster farmers to find a balance that benefits everyone. Oyster farmers must also overcome physical obstacles constantly. For example, it takes about 3 years for a prospective oyster farmer to obtain a lease from the state and another 3 years for an oyster to grow from seed to market size, making it a way of life that is difficult to commit to. Oyster farmers also face the risk of water quality disturbances and related shellfish-borne diseases, which force them to shut down and halt income for extended periods of time. These are just a few of the struggles that oyster farmers face on top of the rugged physical labor that they endure every day, making it a livelihood to be proud of. Oysters provide livelihoods to people in other ways aside from aquaculture through tourism and other creative opportunities. For example, some kayak touring companies source income through taking tourists to oyster farms and sharing information along the way in cooperation with the farm\u2019s employees. Oysters have also \n 19      been the center of many small businesses, featured by artists, and even used as chicken meal and compost. That being said, they have brought prosperity in different forms to many of Maine\u2019s residents.  A sense of environmental awareness is another value that is represented by Maine\u2019s oysters, according to Bangor Daily News. This is presented through mentions of oysters in regards to sustainability such as the limited amount of nonrenewable energy required for cultivation or used for transportation, their ability to filter and \u201cclean\u201d the water, and their ability to thrive in warming waters (Fogg, 2023). This is extremely relevant as the lobster population in the Gulf of Maine is expected to drop with the ever-changing conditions and warming water (Belle, 2020). Lobster populations in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have dropped by 70% in recent years, and if this trend continues, Maine\u2019s lobster fishery could be in big trouble (NOAA, 2021). It would be disastrous if Maine\u2019s fishery sourced economy depended solely on lobsters, making oyster aquaculture a good fall back. That being said, warming waters could have a negative impact on the well-being of oysters as increased acidity could make shell growth and healing very difficult, proving the ways in which climate change and habitat destruction can impact oysters (Mook, 2014). In Maine, oysters are considered to be a locally sourced sustainable food harvested under strict regulations (NOAA, 2022). Some of the most devastating environmental impacts occur due to a lack of regulation and enforcement, so the fact that oyster cultivation is being closely watched is key to sustainability. While oysters could face issues in the future if climate change trends continue, their natural stock populations are increasing across Maine\u2019s coast, most likely as a result of oyster farming. This is great for the natural ecosystem for filtration purposes \n 20      and because oyster reefs combat habitat loss and destruction by protecting shores from erosion (Wright, 2020).  Lastly, this study brings to light Maine\u2019s value of symbolic meaning, especially regarding the oyster. Symbolism is used to portray deep or abstract meaning, which can be attributed to being open-minded. Most people have heard the saying \u201cthe world is your oyster\u201d, but when being used in a Maine news article, it portrays more meaning. This quote is used as a metaphor of broadening horizons and taking advantage of new opportunities. To many Mainers, this might mean being a part of the booming industry of oyster aquaculture, aqua tourism, or the creative use of oysters by small businesses. On \nFigure 5. Photo of Professor Richard Wahle\u2019s class touring Glidden Shell Midden with Archaeologist Alice Kelley. \nFigure 6. Miners at Whaleback Shell Midden courtesy of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University.          \n 21      top of having metaphorical meaning, oysters also carry historical significance in the state of Maine which was mentioned in the study area prior to this study\u2019s research. Oysters have been feasted on for millennia not just on Thanksgiving, but by indigenous Wabanaki tribes long before Thanksgiving was a recognized holiday. In fact, you can still see massive shell middens on the banks of the Damariscotta River, the largest ones being the Glidden Shell Midden and the Whaleback Shell Midden located in Newcastle and Damariscotta, Maine. The Glidden Shell Midden can still be seen today, but most of the Whaleback Shell Midden was mined away by English settlers from the 1600s to the 1800s, used to make chicken feed that would produce strong eggs, road filler, fertilizer, and lime for building (Maine Gov, 2021). The fact that the history of oysters in Maine is represented in news articles proves that their symbolic meaning in the context of indigenous gatherings is still culturally significant today. Today, oysters also symbolize luxury, which can be seen throughout Bangor Daily News articles that refer to oysters as delicacies. The price of oysters at restaurants in Maine might make someone think they are luxurious, but mentioning it repeatedly in the daily news proves the oyster\u2019s luxurious reputation to be culturally significant. Data presented during this study also brings light to the feminist culture associated with oyster farming by quoting a female oyster farmer who promotes skin care and femininity. In the past, Maine\u2019s fishing industry was comprised almost exclusively of men, but in recent years, women have begun to participate in the sector, and aquaculture is no exception. In fact, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute estimated in 2020 that about a third of Maine\u2019s aquaculture leases were held by women, a 14% increase from the year prior (Terry, 2022). Women in other countries have been making leaps in the aquaculture industry as well, so it is a privilege \n 22      for Maine to be part of the larger community whose femininity can be represented by oyster aquaculture. Oysters also symbolize connoisseurial knowledge in that they attract people\u2019s interest in the same way that craft beer does. Just as Maine has a Beer Trail, there is also a Maine Oyster Trail. Like many beer lovers, oyster lovers tend to have lots of opinions regarding their product. For example, oyster connoisseurs talk about the \u201cright\u201d number of chews an oyster deserves as well as how to identify different hints of flavor, describing them as sweet, briny, flinty, fine, meaty, etc. (Schipani, 2018). Each destination offers oysters with a unique flavor to the area. This is referred to as an oyster\u2019s \u201cmerroir\u201d, which varies up and down the coast of Maine, adding to the effect of Maine\u2019s Oyster Trail (Carroll, 2014). This brings us to discuss the symbolism of Maine pride that oysters seem to carry as Maine boasts a wide variety of high-quality oysters that trump those grown in southern states, due to the cold waters that they grow in (Schipani and Jenkins, 2021). One article also boasts \u201cthe Pine Tree state\u2019s\u201d abundance of locally grown and produced food with the mention of oysters using Maine\u2019s nickname to reflect a sense of pride. Like any study this one did have limitations and biases involved. Since the data was retrieved from a single news source, there is a certain amount of bias that could not be avoided. According to several bias rating websites, Bangor Daily News is a slightly left leaning news source, meaning that its reports are likely geared towards a liberal leaning audience. This could have an impact on what is reported and how. Another limiting factor of this study was that codes were identified and excerpts were categorized by just one person. While this does provide consistency, it also means that, though unintentional, personal interpretation may have played a hand. Unlike with quantitative \n 23      data and research, qualitative data leaves a lot of room for interpretation, which could vary from person to person. This study was done as unbiased as possible with the resources at hand, and the research produced very conclusive results regarding the socio-cultural significance of Maine\u2019s oysters and the values that they represent.                     \n 24      CONCLUSION The objective of this study was to identify Maine\u2019s values that are represented by the oyster. Identifying these values allows us to answer the question of \u201chow are oysters socio culturally significant in the state of Maine?\u201d They are significant in that they represent the people of Maine\u2019s community, livelihood, environmental awareness, and use of symbolism or recognition of deeper meanings. A community\u2019s values make up their culture, making oysters and everything that they represent to people in Maine culturally significant. Communities can change over time, and with that, so can their values and their cultural identities. As the popularity of oysters in Maine continues to grow, the uses for them and the things they represent may also continue to morph. That being said, this study could be used in future studies to consider how Maine\u2019s cultural values and the significance of oysters change over time. Since this study was based on media coverage, it would be interesting to see how changes in media sources and politics could also have an impact on these results. There are many different factors that go into a community\u2019s culture, and culture in the eyes of media is changing rapidly in this day and age.       \n 25      REFERENCES \u201cAs climate change threatens Maine fisheries, it\u2019s not all bad news for oysters.\u201d Bangor  Daily News [Bangor, ME], 28 Sept. 2020, p.

FAKTA predicts the factu-\nality of given claims and provides evidence at\nthe document and sentence level to explain its\npredictions.\n1 Introduction\nWith the rapid increase of fake news in social me-\ndia and its negative in\ufb02uence on people and pub-\nlic opinion (Mihaylov et al., 2015; Mihaylov and\nNakov, 2016; V osoughi et al., 2018), various orga-\nnizations are now performing manual fact check-\ning on suspicious claims. However, manual fact-\nchecking is a time consuming and challenging pro-\ncess. As an alternative, researchers are investigat-\ningautomatic fact checking which is a multi-step\nprocess and involves: ( i) retrieving potentially rele-\nvant documents for a given claim (Mihaylova et al.,\n2018; Karadzhov et al., 2017), ( ii) checking the reli-\nability of the media sources from which documents\nare retrieved, ( iii) predicting the stance of each doc-\nument with respect to the claim (Mohtarami et al.,\n2018; Xu et al., 2018), and \ufb01nally ( iv) predicting\nfactuality of given claims (Mihaylova et al., 2018).\nWhile previous works separately investigated in-\ndividual components of the fact checking process,\nin this work, we present a uni\ufb01ed framework ti-\ntled FAKTA that integrates these components to\nnot only predict the factuality of given claims, but\nalso provide evidence at the document and sentence\nlevel to explain its predictions. To the best of our\nknowledge, FAKTA is the only system that offers\nsuch a capability.2 FAKTA\nFigure 1 illustrates the general architecture of\nFAKTA. The system is accessible via a Web\nbrowser and has two sides: client and server. When\na user at the client side submits a textual claim for\nfact checking, the server handles the request by \ufb01rst\npassing it into the document retrieval component\nto retrieve a list of top-K relevant documents (see\nSection 2.1) from four types of sources: Wikipedia,\nhighly-reliable, mixed reliability and low reliabil-\nity mainstream media (see Section 2.2). The re-\ntrieved documents are passed to the re-ranking\nmodel to re\ufb01ne the retrieval result (see Section 2.1).\nThen, the stance detection component detects the\nstance/perspective of each relevant document with\nrespect to the claim, typically modeled using la-\nbels such as agree ,disagree anddiscuss . This\ncomponent further provides rationales at the sen-\ntence level for explaining model predictions (see\nSection 2.3). Each document is also passed to the\nlinguistic analysis component to analyze the lan-\nguage of the document using different linguistic\nlexicons (see Section 2.4). Finally, the aggregation\ncomponent combines the predictions of stance de-\ntection for all the relevant documents and makes a\n\ufb01nal decision about the factuality of the claim (see\nSection 2.5). We describe the components below.\n2.1 Document Retrieval & Re-ranking Model\nWe \ufb01rst convert an input claim to a query by only\nconsidering its verbs, nouns and adjectives (Pot-\nthast et al., 2013). Furthermore, claims often con-\ntain named entities (e.g., names of persons and\norganizations). We use the NLTK package to iden-\ntify named entities in claims, and augment the ini-\ntial query with all named entities from the claim\u2019s\ntext. Ultimately, we generate queries of 5\u201310to-\nkens, which we execute against a search engine. If\nthe search engine does not retrieve any results forarXiv:1906.04164v1  [cs.CL]  7 Jun 2019\nFigure 1: The architecture of our FAKTA system.\nthe query, we iteratively relax the query by drop-\nping the \ufb01nal tokens one at a time. We also use\nApache Lucene1to index and retrieve relevant doc-\numents from the 2017 Wikipedia dump (see our\nexperiments in Section 3). Furthermore, we use\nthe Google API2to search across three pre-de\ufb01ned\nlists of media sources based on their factuality and\nreliability as explained in Section 2.2. Finally, the\nre-ranking model of Lee et al. (2018) is applied to\nselect the top-K relevant documents. This model\nuses all the POS tags in a claim that carry high\ndiscriminating power (NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS, JJ,\nCD) as keywords. The re-ranking model is de\ufb01ned\nas follows:\nfrank =jmatchj\njclaimj\u0002jmatchj\njtitlej\u0002score init;(1)\nwherejclaimj,jtitlej, andjmatchjare the counts\nof such POS tags in the claim, title of a document,\nboth claim and title respectively, and score initis\nthe initial ranking score computed by Lucene or\nranking from Google API.\n2.2 Sources\nWhile current search engines (e.g., Google, Bing,\nYahoo) retrieve relevant documents for a given\nquery from any media source, we retrieve relevant\ndocuments from four types of sources: Wikipedia,\nand high, mixed and low factual media. Journal-\nists often spend considerable time verifying the\nreliability of their information sources (Popat et al.,\n2017; Nguyen et al., 2018), and some fact-checking\norganizations have been producing lists of unreli-\nable online news sources speci\ufb01ed by their journal-\nists. FAKTA utilizes information about news me-\ndia listed on the Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)\nwebsite3, which contains manual annotations and\n1https://lucene.apache.org\n2https://developers.google.com/\ncustom-search\n3https://mediabiasfactcheck.comanalysis of the factuality of 2;500news websites.\nOur list from MBFC includes 1;300websites an-\nnotated by journalists as high orvery high ,700\nwebsites annotated as lowandlow-questionable ,\nand 500websites annotated as mixed (i.e., contain-\ning both factually true and false information). Our\ndocument retrieval component retrieves documents\nfrom these three types of media sources (i.e., high,\nmixed andlow) along with Wikipedia that mostly\ncontains factually-true information.\n2.3 Stance Detection & Evidence Extraction\nIn this work, we use our best model presented\nin (Xu et al., 2018) for stance detection. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this model is the current\nstate-of-the-art system on the Fake News Chal-\nlenge (FNC) dataset.4Our model combines Bag\nof Words (BOW) and Convolutional Neural Net-\nworks (CNNs) in a two-level hierarchy scheme,\nwhere the \ufb01rst level predicts whether the label\nisrelated orunrelated (see Figure 2, the top-left\npie chart in FAKTA), and then related documents\nare passed to the second level to determine their\nstances, agree ,disagree , and discuss labels (see\nFigure 2, the bottom-left pie chart in FAKTA). Our\nmodel is further supplemented with an adversarial\ndomain adaptation technique which helps it over-\ncome the limited size of labeled data when training\nthrough different domains.\nTo provide rationales for model prediction,\nFAKTA further processes each sentence in the doc-\nument with respect to the claim and computes a\nstance score for each sentence. The relevant sen-\ntences in the document are then highlighted and\ncolor coded with respect to stance labels (see Fig-\nure 2). FAKTA provides the option for re-ordering\nthese rationales according to a speci\ufb01c stance label.\n4http://www.fakenewschallenge.org\nFigure 2: Screenshot of FAKTA for a document retrieved for the claim \u201cISIS in\ufb01litrates the United States.\u201d\n2.4 Linguistic Analysis\nWe analyze the language used in documents using\nthe following linguistic markers:\n\u2014Subjectivity lexicon (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003):\nwhich contains weak and strong subjective terms\n(we only consider the strong subjectivity cues),\n\u2014Sentiment cues (Liu et al., 2005): which contains\npositive andnegative sentiment cues, and\n\u2014Wiki-bias lexicon (Recasens et al., 2013): which\ninvolves bias cues and controversial words (e.g.,\nabortion andexecute ) extracted from the Neutral\nPoint of View Wikipedia corpus (Recasens et al.,\n2013).\nFinally, we compute a score for the document\nusing these cues according to Equation (2), where\nfor each lexicon type Liand document Dj, the\nfrequency of the cues for LiinDjis normalized\nby the total number of words in Dj:\nLi(Dj) =P\ncue2Licount (cue; D j)\nP\nwk2Djcount (wk; Dj)(2)\nThese scores are shown in a radar chart in Fig-\nure 2. Furthermore, FAKTA provides the option\nto see a lexicon-speci\ufb01c word cloud of frequent\nwords in each documents (see Figure 2, the right\nside of the radar chart which shows the word cloud\nof Sentiment cues in the document).\n2.5 Aggregation\nStance Detection and Linguistic Analysis compo-\nnents are executed in parallel against all documentsretrieved by our document retrieval component\nfrom each type of sources. All the stance scores\nare averaged across these documents, and the ag-\ngregated scores are shown for each agree ,disagree\nanddiscuss categories at the top of the ranked list\nof retrieved documents. Higher agree score indi-\ncates the claim is factually true, and higher disagree\nscore indicates the claim is factually false.\n3 Evaluation and Results\nWe use the Fact Extraction and VERi\ufb01cation\n(FEVER) dataset (Thorne et al., 2018) to evaluate\nour system. In FEVER, each claim is assigned to its\nrelevant Wikipedia documents with agree/disagree\nstances to the claim, and claims are labeled as sup-\nported (SUP, i.e. factually true), refuted (REF, i.e.\nfactually false), and not enough information (NEI,\ni.e., there is not any relevant document for the claim\nin Wikipedia). The data includes a total of 145K\nclaims, with around 80K,30K and 35K SUP, REF\nand NEI labels respectively.\nDocument Retrieval: Table 1 shows results for\ndocument retrieval. We use various search and\nranking algorithms that measure the similarity be-\ntween each input claim as query and Web doc-\numents. Lines 1\u201311 in the table show the re-\nsults when we use Lucene to index and search the\ndata corpus with the following retrieval models:\nBM25 (Robertson et al., 1994) (Line 1), Classic\nbased on the TF.IDF model (Line 2), and Diver-\ngence from Independence (DFI) (Kocaba s \u00b8et al.,\nModel R@1 R@5 R@10 R@20\n1.

We also use Divergence from Inde-\npendence Randomness (DFR) (Amati and Van Ri-\njsbergen, 2002) with different term frequency nor-\nmalization, such as the normalization provided by\nDirichlet prior (DFR H3) (Line 4) or a Zip\ufb01an re-\nlation prior (DFR z) (Line 5). We also consider\nInformation Based (IB) models (Clinchant and\nGaussier, 2010) with Log-logistic (IB LL) (Line 6)\nor Smoothed power-law (IB SPL) (Line 7) distribu-\ntions. Finally, we consider LMDirichlet (Zhai and\nLafferty, 2001) (Line 8), and LMJelinek (Zhai and\nLafferty, 2001) with different settings for its hyper-\nparameter (Lines 9\u201311). According to the resulting\nperformance at different ranks f1\u201320g, we select\nthe ranking algorithm DFR z(Lucene DFR Z) as our\nretrieval model.\nIn addition, Lines 12\u201313 show the results when\nclaims are converted to queries as explained in Sec-\ntion 2.1. The results (Lines 5 and 12) show that\nLucene performance decreases with query genera-\ntion. This might be because the resulting queries be-\ncome more abstract than their corresponding claims\nwhich may introduce some noise to the intended\nmeaning of claims. However, Lines 14\u201315 show\nthat our re-ranking model, explained in Section 2.1,\ncan improve both Lucene and Google results.\nFAKTA Full Pipeline: The complete pipeline\nconsists of document retrieval and re-ranking\nmodel (Section 2.1), stance detection and rationale\nextraction5(Section 2.3) and aggregation model\n(Section 2.5).

Lines 2\u20133 are the results for our sys-\ntem when using Lucene (L) and Google API (G)\nfor document retrieval. The results show that our\nsystem achieves the highest performance on both\nF1(Macro )and accuracy (Acc) using Google as re-\ntrieval engine. We repeat our experiments when\nconsidering only SUP and REF labels (2lbl) and\nthe results are signi\ufb01cantly higher than the results\nwith 3lbl (Lines 4\u20135).\n4 The System in Action\nThe current version of FAKTA6and its short in-\ntroduction video7and source code8are available\nonline. FAKTA consists of three views:\n\u2014The text entry view : to enter a claim to be checked\nfor factuality.\n\u2014Overall result view : includes four lists of retrieved\ndocuments from four factuality types of sources:\nWikipedia, and high-, mixed-, and low-factuality\nmedia (Section 2.2). For each list, the \ufb01nal factu-\nality score for the input claim is shown at the top\nof the page (Section 2.5), and the stance detection\nscore for each document appears beside it.\n\u2014Document result view : when selecting a retrieved\ndocument, FAKTA shows the text of the document\nand highlights its important sentences according\nto their stance scores with respect to the claim.\nThe stance detection results for the document are\nfurther shown as pie chart at the left side of the\nview (Section 2.3), and the linguistic analysis is\nshown at the bottom of the view (Section 2.4).\n5 Related Work\nAutomatic fact checking (Xu et al., 2018) cen-\nters on evidence extraction for given claims, re-\n6http://fakta.mit.edu\n7http://fakta.mit.edu/video\n8https://github.com/moinnadeem/fakta\nliability evaluation of media sources (Baly et al.,\n2018a), stance detection of documents with respect\nto claims (Mohtarami et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018;\nBaly et al., 2018b), and fact checking of claims (Mi-\nhaylova et al., 2018). These steps correspond to\ndifferent Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\nInformation Retrieval (IR) tasks including informa-\ntion extraction and question answering (Shiralkar\net al., 2017). Veracity inference has been mostly ap-\nproached as text classi\ufb01cation problem and mainly\ntackled by developing linguistic, stylistic, and se-\nmantic features (Rashkin et al., 2017; Mihaylova\net al., 2018; Nakov et al., 2017), as well as using in-\nformation from external sources (Mihaylova et al.,\n2018; Karadzhov et al., 2017).\nThese steps are typically handled in isolation.\nFor example, previous works (Wang, 2017; OBrien\net al., 2018) proposed algorithms to predict factu-\nality of claims by mainly focusing on only input\nclaims (i.e., step ( iv) and their metadata informa-\ntion (e.g., the speaker of the claim). In addition,\nrecent works on the Fact Extraction and VERi\ufb01ca-\ntion (FEVER) (Thorne et al., 2018) has focused on\na speci\ufb01c domain (e.g., Wikipedia).\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is currently\nno end-to-end systems for fact checking which can\nsearch through Wikipedia and mainstream media\nsources across the Web to fact check given claims.\nTo address these gaps, our FAKTA system covers\nall fact-checking steps and can search across dif-\nferent sources, predict the factuality of claims, and\npresent a set of evidence to explain its prediction.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have presented FAKTA\u2013an online system for\nautomatic end-to-end fact checking of claims.\nFAKTA can assist individuals and professional fact-\ncheckers to check the factuality of claims by pre-\nsenting relevant documents and rationales as evi-\ndence for its predictions. In future work, we plan\nto improve FAKTA\u2019s underlying components (e.g.,\nstance detection), extend FAKTA to cross-lingual\nsettings, and incorporate temporal information for\nfact checking.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank anonymous reviewers for their insight-\nful comments, suggestions, and feedback.

Language reinforc-\ning stigma around V AW can result in negative consequences\nsuch as unethical representation of survivors and trivializa-\ntion of the act of violence. In this work, we study the pres-\nence of stigmatized framings in news media and how it differs\nbased on media attributes like regionality, political leaning,\nveracity, and latent communities of news sources. We also in-\nvestigate the interactions between V AW-based stigma and 14\nissue-generic policies used to describe political communica-\ntions. We found that articles from national, right-leaning, and\nconspiratorial news sources contain more stigma compared to\ntheir counterparts. Furthermore, alignment of articles to the\nissue-generic policies offers the highest explanation for the\npresence of stigma in news articles. We discuss implications\nfor institutions to improve safe reporting guidelines on V AW.\nIntroduction\nViolence Against Women (V AW) is defined by the United\nNations (UN) as \u201cany act of gender-based violence that re-\nsults in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental\nharm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts,\ncoercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occur-\nring in public or in private life\u201d (United Nations 1993). It is\nrecognized as a global problem that can have adverse effects\non the health, safety, productivity, and overall well-being of\nwomen. Despite designated efforts by associations such as\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and UN Women to pre-\nvent and eliminate all forms of V AW, its prevalence remains\nhigh \u2013 \u201cglobally 1 in 3 women experience physical and/or\nsexual violence in their lifetime\u201d (United Nations 1993).\nMedia, including mass and print, is considered a \u201ckey en-\ntry point for preventing V AW in the long-term because of\ntheir unique reach to broad sections of the population\u201d (UN\nWomen 2019). In addition, media has the ability to influence\nand shape public opinion about what is considered socially\nacceptable \u2013 Bandura (2001) identified media to \u201cserve as\nsocializing agents that aid in construction and perpetuation\nof perceptions and learned behaviors.\u201d News media, in par-\nticular, can potentially raise public awareness to bring jus-\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.tice to survivors and shine light upon the extent, causes, and\nrepercussions of V AW (Owusu-Addo et al. 2018). At the\nsame time, through harmful or stigmatized representations,\nnews media may reinforce problematic norms that promote\ngender inequality, trivialize the issue, or encourage repro-\nduction of violent acts (\u201ccopycat effect\u201d (Lira and Toledo\n2014)). A contributing factor to explain these depictions of\nV AW stems from Entman\u2019s sociological notion of \u201cfram-\ning\u201d (Entman 1993) \u2013 news media may \u201cselect some aspects\nof a perceived reality and make them more salient in a com-\nmunicating text, to promote a particular problem definition,\ncausal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment rec-\nommendation for the item described.\u201d\nGiven the significant impact of news media portrayals on\npersonal, political, and social justice responses, researchers\nhave studied representations of V AW in mainstream news\nmedia. For instance, a body of work shows that journalists\noften use \u201cepisodic framing\u201d (Lindsay-Brisbin, DePrince,\nand Welton-Mitchell 2014), eliciting individualistic details\ninstead of posing V AW as a systemic societal problem to\ntheir audience. Research has also discovered that, unfortu-\nnately, news stories depict sexual assault in a \u201csensational-\nist\u201d manner (Sacks, Ackerman, and Shlosberg 2018), rein-\nforcing cultural stereotypes, stigma, and rape myths (Meyers\n1996). In addition, journalistic reports can intensify stigma\naround V AW through \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d \u2013 \u201can act of blaming\nvictims for criminal acts committed against them\u201d (Berns\n2001) \u2013 such as attributing V AW incidents to physical ap-\npearances and descriptions. Usage of such stigmatizing lan-\nguage not only impacts public opinion, as highlighted ear-\nlier, but it also trivializes the act of violence, and discourages\n(silences) the survivors from reporting the crime (Easteal,\nHolland, and Judd 2015), emphasizing the need to under-\nstand (and eliminate) V AW-based stigma in news.\nTo the best of our knowledge, existing works uncovering\nstigma of V AW in news only examine articles from a few\npublishers. However, to inform change, it is essential to rec-\nognize and contextualize stigma around V AW in the larger\nnews media landscape, factoring in the diversity of today\u2019s\nmedia. In this work, we do so by looking at articles from\n396 national, local, and conspiratorial news sources, within\nthe United States. Furthermore, there is a gap in understand-\ning the factors that may drive journalists\u2019 usage of specific\nlinguistic framings, in the context of V AW. For instance, Ele-\nProceedings of the Eighteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2024)\n1068\njalde, Ferres, and Schifanella (2019) observed that news me-\ndia coverage is highly influenced by the geographic reach\nand the political leaning of outlets. Moreover, with mis- and\ndis-information threatening the American news ecosystem\nin recent years, it is imperative to also consider news quality\nas we seek to better understand framings of V AW. In this\ncontext, misinformation on V AW can contribute to harm-\nful attitudes, making it more difficult to prevent and address\ngender-based violence. This misinformation may gain per-\nceived credibility through inauthentic coordination amongst\nfringe media outlets (Horne, N\u00f8rregaard, and Adal\u0131 2019).\nConsequently, we make the first attempt to study and explain\nstigma around V AW in news using outlet attributes such\nasregionality, partisanship, veracity, and media community\nmembership (captured via content sharing networks) as well\nas article attributes, such as issue-generic policies to study\npolitical issues highlighted in news (Boydstun et al. 2013).\nOur research pursues the following two research questions:\nRQ1: How is stigma around V AW perpetuated across U.S.\nnews media and how does it differ based on (a) regional-\nity, (b) political leaning, (c) veracity of news sources, (d)\nmedia communities, and (e) issue-generic policies?\nRQ2: What are the relative roles of the above mentioned\nfactors in explaining stigma in V AW news reports?\nTo answer these two research questions, we filtered\ntwo publicly available news datasets \u2013 NELA-GT and\nNELA-Local \u2013 using relevant key phrases, identified by\ndomain experts, to only contain V AW-specific articles in\nthe United States. In total, we looked at 98,107 articles\ninNELA-GT and68,892articles in NELA-Local \u2013 pub-\nlished from April 2020 to March 2023. To explore the pres-\nence of stigmatized V AW framings in this data, we adopted\na BERT-based (Devlin et al. 2019) representation learning\nframework proposed by Mittal and De Choudhury (2023).\nWe then looked at differences in stigma-based framings,\nalong the five factors mentioned in RQ1. Our analysis re-\nvealed that national, right-leaning, and low-veracity outlets\ntend to use more stigma compared to their counterparts. Our\nanalysis of media communities supported these findings,\nshowing that outlets in the fringe, right-leaning community\nused stigmatized framings more than the average outlet, but\nalso added nuance to the findings. In particular, we found\nthat small clusters of progressive outlets used stigmatized\nframings more than the average outlet despite left-leaning\noutlets more generally using less. Our article level analysis\nindicated that articles with mentions of certain issue-generic\npolicies such as those highlighting (in)equality of penalty\nor rewards, policy outcomes across organizations, and ef-\nfectiveness of existing systems contain more stigma. On the\nother hand, articles highlighting overall well-being, social\nresponsibility, and existing social norms contain less stigma.\nLastly, an article\u2019s alignment (or lack thereof) with issue-\ngeneric policies was the most informative in determining\nwhether an article uses stigmatized V AW framings or not.\nBroader Perspectives, Ethics, and Competing Interests:\nOur findings bear implications for survivor-centered report-\ning guidelines that avoid perpetuation of political biases andconspiracy theories, provide contextual information high-\nlighting the underlying systemic issues, and use trauma-\ninformed language instead of sensationalist and victim-\nblaming framings. We followed best practices in our analy-\nsis (Chancellor, Baumer, and De Choudhury 2019), such as\nworking with deidentified data, and refraining from sharing\nraw or personally identifiable data in any form. All quotes\nare paraphrased to reduce traceability and potential harm to\nthose referenced in the news articles. We provide a content\nwarning as the paper contains descriptions of VAW.\nBackground and Related Work\nStigma, Stereotypes, and Violence Against Women\nStigma and stereotypes have a documented influence on in-\ncidence and prevalence of V AW. \u201cThis can take the form\nof promoting stereotypes and myths about \u2018real\u2019 and \u2018de-\nserving\u2019 victims and \u2018provoked\u2019 or \u2018tragic\u2019 perpetrators and\nfailing to convey the true scale of violence against women\nand girls\u201d (Eaves and Equality Now 2012). But how existing\nresearch comes to identify presentations of stigma relating\nto V AW, and the resulting implications for individual help-\nseeking behaviors, are varied by individual contexts. As it\nrelates to intimate partner violence, research suggests dis-\nparities for women of color are best understood when ac-\ncounting for cultural messaging that communities of color\nare not victims of abuse (Plough 2000). However, in the con-\ntext of sex work, V AW research offers that stigma is struc-\ntural, and barriers to prevention are shaped by social stigma-\ntization and criminalization of sex work \u2013 enabling violence\nagainst sex workers to persist.\nDespite the richness of these perspectives, scholars have\ncriticized that existing research on stigma has had an in-\ndividualistic focus on characteristics. For instance, prior\nworks concentrate on a single manifestation of stigma or\nmicro-level interactions (e.g., cultural stereotype or victim-\nblaming), leading to \u201cvague and varied conceptualizations of\nstigma\u201d (Oliver 1990). To address this concern, we adopt a\nBERT-based framework to explore stigmatized V AW fram-\nings (Mittal and De Choudhury 2023), which is built on a\nholistic conceptualization of stigma \u2013 \u201cstigma exists when\nelements of labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss,\nand discrimination occur together in a power situation that\nallows them to unfold\u201d (Link and Phelan 2001) and thus\ngoes beyond an individualistic focus due to a reliance on a\nvery large news dataset reporting on diverse V AW incidents.\nNews and Violence Against Women\nFraming, defined as the \u201cportray[al] of an issue from one\nperspective to the necessary exclusion of alternative per-\nspectives of issues,\u201d (Schaffner and Sellers 2010) of V AW\nmay be correlated with harmful cultural and structural\nstigma perpetuated in mass communication. Studies at-\ntribute problematic portrayals of V AW to media\u2019s proclivity\ntoward frames (Bullock 2007) of objectivity (Meyers 2004),\nconcealing broader social context (Bullock 2007), and di-\nrecting the responsibility of prevention onto victims (Car-\nline and Easteal 2014). Research has also identified me-\ndia\u2019s occasional use of \u201csocial problem frame\u201d in reports\n1069\nof V AW (Berns 2004). Another examination investigated\nchanges in journalistic framing of sexual violence following\nthe #MeToo movement (Noetzel et al. 2022).\nWhile all of these works contribute to the cognizance\nof problematic V AW framings, they each assess a narrow\nmanifestation, restricted to a few news articles and non-\nstandardized dimensions of framing. We harness the 14\nissue-generic policies derived from political communication\ntheory to understand framing of subject matter in mass com-\nmunication (Boydstun et al. 2013). Prior work has employed\nthem to study framing of immigration (Mendelsohn, Bu-\ndak, and Jurgens 2021), tobacco use, and same-sex mar-\nriage (Card et al. 2015). In the context of V AW, the policies\nprovide a systematic way to comprehend discourse on distri-\nbution of rewards/punishments, capacity of existing judicial\nsystems and public well-being, and stigma they may attract.\nAdditionally, existing studies exploring framing of V AW\nexamine media in a limited number of outlets (Chagnon\n2020), locale (Bullock 2007), and types of violence (Nettle-\nton 2011). However, to inform change, it is essential to un-\nderstand framings in the larger news media landscape. This\npaper contributes by studying media content from two pub-\nlicly available datasets, expanding on the number (396), lo-\ncality, and variety of news outlets.\nMedia Attributes: Regionality, Partisanship,\nVeracity, and Communities\nAudience reach and targeting efforts of news are influenced\nby geographical factors and differ for local and national\nnews outlets (Elejalde, Ferres, and Schifanella 2019). In tan-\ndem, the political bias of a news outlet is correlated with\naudience targeting efforts intended to appeal to those they\nreach and maximize revenue (Bahamonde et al. 2018). Bar-\nnett and Hilz (2018) found that individuals with politically\nconservative beliefs are more likely to hold rape supportive\nattitudes. In addition, republican men reported the highest\nlevels of sexual assault myth acceptance, lowest levels of\nconcern for sexual assault and were least likely to perceive\nthe #MeToo movement as having a positive impact (Ortiz\nand Smith 2022). Hence, both the regionality and the parti-\nsanship of a news outlet may influence coverage of V AW.\nThe news consumed today is not always reliable or writ-\nten by a professional journalist. Information may be filtered\nthrough fringe, alternative media outlets, where sensational-\nist framing and moral-emotional language are used to gain\nreader engagement (Brady et al. 2017). In the context of\nV AW, fringe media that blames victims of violence for their\nown victimization, or suggests that women should be more\nvigilant to avoid being assaulted, can shift the focus away\nfrom holding perpetrators accountable for their actions. This\ncan discourage victims from coming forward and can lead to\na culture where V AW is normalized and minimized. Hence,\nwe also consider the veracity of an outlet.\nLastly, there are various sub-groups of media that impact\nV AW coverage, but those groups may be opaque to the in-\nformation consumer and can be hard to define. For exam-\nple, fringe media may coordinate to make certain narratives\nseem more widely reported (Horne, N\u00f8rregaard, and Adal\u0131\n2019), or the ownership of outlets may impact story fram-ing and therefore the public\u2019s view of events (Levendusky\n2022). Given that latent sub-groups like these can be diffi-\ncult to directly capture in data, we estimate them through\nwhat we call \u201cmedia communities\u201d \u2013 leveraging prior work\n(Horne, N\u00f8rregaard, and Adal\u0131 2019; Starbird et al. 2018).\nWe contribute by studying the relationship between stig-\nmatized V AW coverage and four outlet factors: regionality,\npartisanship, veracity, and latent communities.\nData\nWe used articles published by U.S. national, local, and\nfringe news media outlets, present within the publicly avail-\nableNELA-GT (N\u00f8rregaard, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2019) and\nNELA-Local (Horne et al. 2022) datasets. To have an up-\nto-date news coverage, we used an extended version of both\nNELA-GT andNELA-Local, collected from April 2020 to\nMarch 2023. Table 1 provides an overview of these.\nWe chose these datasets as they contain nearly every news\narticle published within the specified timeline. Apart from\nthe textual content of news articles, the datasets provide in-\nformation on attributes such as source of publication, date of\npublication, estimates of political leaning, estimates of ve-\nracity (for NELA-GT), and the state and the county the news\noutlet is headquartered in (for NELA-Local).\nFiltering and Data Cleaning\nWe filtered news articles, which were relevant to study dis-\ncourse on V AW, in both the NELA-GT andNELA-Local\ndatasets. To do so, we used key phrases identified by UNFPA\ndomain experts (Purohit et al. 2016), and further fine-tuned\nby ElSherief, Belding, and Nguyen (2017), to define three\ncategories of Gender Based Violence (GBV): (1) Physi-\ncal Violence (e.g., \u2018intimate partner violence\u2019, \u2018woman at-\ntacked\u2019, and \u2018domestic violence\u2019), (2) Sexual Violence (e.g.,\n\u2018sexual assault\u2019, \u2018rape victim\u2019, and \u2018stalking woman\u2019), and\n(3) Harmful Practices (e.g., \u2018woman trafficking\u2019, \u2018sex slave\u2019,\nand \u2018woman abuse\u2019). We carefully selected a subset of these\nGBV key phrases such that they were applicable to V AW.\nFor instance, we dropped gender neutral phrases like \u2018child\nabuse\u2019 and \u2018physical violence\u2019 from the original list. After\nthis processing and filtering out sources not headquartered\nin the U.S., we were able to get 115, 197V AW-specific news\narticles in NELA-GT and68,892inNELA-Local.\nLastly, following P. Aires, G. Nakamura, and F. Naka-\nmura (2019) and Nakov and Da San Martino (2021), we\nused source-level veracity labels \u2013 already available in the\nNELA-GT dataset, obtained through the MBFC1resource,\nto remove articles originating from low-veracity conspiracy-\npseudoscience, and questionable sources. Finally, we were\nleft with 98,107 articles in NELA-GT and 68,892 in\nNELA-Local. We grouped the filtered out 17,090 low-\nveracity articles, to form a separate dataset containing ar-\nticles from conspiratorial news sources, to answer RQ1(c).\nData Validation\nTo validate our filtered V AW-specific NELA-GT and\nNELA-Local datasets, we randomly sampled 50 news ar-\n1https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\n1070\nDataset #Articles #NMean (#words) SD Example Sources\nNELA-GT 7,246,352 361 3702.47 108.33 CNBC, Washington Post, The New York Times, The Duran, US News, The Blaze\nNELA-Local 2,089,785 313 4440.32 773.01 Daily News, The Daily Gazette, Philadelphia Weekly, Daily Herald, The Republic\nTable 1: Overview of the news datasets, before filtering.

The first two au-\nthors hand annotated them as relevant or irrelevant (to V AW)\nbased on their prior experience and expertise with study-\ning news related content. Throughout this process, the an-\nnotations were discussed amongst the two authors to resolve\nconflicts, and reach agreement. The subsets contained a high\npercentage of relevant articles (84% for NELA-GT and 92%\nforNELA-Local). The annotations were reliable in terms\nof a high inter-rater agreement or Cohen\u2019s Kappa of 0.89 for\nNELA-GT and 0.91 for NELA-Local.\nMethods\nMeasuring Stigma\nIn this study, our goal was to understand how news media de-\nscribes V AW, through a stigma lens. Hence we adopted the\nApproval/Stigma frame characterization, proposed by Mit-\ntal and De Choudhury (2023), to quantify levels of stigma\nin news media reports. These authors curated well-validated\ndictionaries, referring to existing literature on conceptual-\nization of stigma (Link and Phelan 2001; Goffman 2014), to\nrepresent approval andstigma dimensions. Link and Phelan\n(2001) provide a comprehensive understanding of stigma \u2013\n\u201cstigma exists when elements of labeling, stereotyping, sep-\naration, status loss, and discrimination occur together in a\npower situation that allows the components of stigma to un-\nfold.\u201d As supported by prior work, stigma around V AW con-\ntains the elements mentioned above:\n1.Labeling: Survivors are labeled as false accusers (Larson\n2018); e.g., \u201cher account did not add up.\u201d\n2.Stereotyping: Dominant beliefs link survivors to unde-\nsirable characteristics (Plough 2000); e.g., \u201cengage in be-\nhaviors such as thumbsucking.\u201d\n3.Separation: Survivors are \u201cothered\u201d, receive \u201cout-group\ntreatment\u201d (Pickup, Williams, and Sweetman 2001).\n4.Status loss and Discrimination: Survivors experience\ndisadvantaged outcomes (Jina and Thomas 2013); e.g.,\n\u201cdealing with PTSD, scarred and may never recover.\u201d\nSome exemplar terms present in the Approval/Stigma dic-\ntionaries are \u2018support\u2019, \u2018accept\u2019, \u2018regard\u2019 for approval and\n\u2018disgrace\u2019, \u2018exclusion\u2019, \u2018flaw\u2019 for stigma. We carefully stud-\nied the dictionaries to check for relevancy. Using these dic-\ntionaries the authors then generated vector representations\nforapproval andstigma dimensions via BERT (Devlin et al.\n2019), a pre-trained large language model. They averaged\nthe word embeddings, extracted using BERT, for all the key-\nwords present in the two dictionaries, to create the represen-\ntations for approval andstigma. Finally, following the se-\nmantic axes approach (An, Kwak, and Ahn 2018), a single\nlinguistic representation for Approval/Stigma was obtained\nby subtracting the embedding for stigma from approval.Next, to quantify stigmatized framings of V AW in news\nmedia, we extracted sentence-level BERT embeddings to get\na linguistic representation of the news article content similar\nto Mittal and De Choudhury (2023). Lastly, following prior\nwork (Kwak et al. 2021), we compared the vectors repre-\nsenting the news article and the Approval/Stigma frame us-\ning the cosine similarity metric. This comparison resulted\nin scores ranging from -1 to 1 such that a score closer to\n-1 (alternatively, 1) indicates an alignment to stigma (al-\nternatively, approval). Following Mittal and De Choudhury\n(2023) we then set a threshold on 0 cosine similarity to say\nthat news articles with a score lesser (greater) than 0 align\nmore with the stigma (approval) dimension.\nValidating Approval/Stigma Frame Extraction Two au-\nthors hand-annotated a random sample of 10 news articles\nidentifying the presence of either stigma or approval-based\nframings. As a demonstration of annotator credibility, we\nnote that one annotator has expertise in social computing re-\nsearch and the other is proficient in violence-related public\nhealth work. They agreed on 70% of the samples and dis-\ncussed their annotations to reach 100% consensus. Follow-\ning this, they sampled and annotated 50 articles (25 each\nfrom NELA-GT andNELA-Local datasets) to compare\nhuman-assigned ground truth labels against those generated\nby the Approval/Stigma frame characterization. The frame-\nwork achieved high precision (82%) and recall (78%).\nError analyses: The framework mislabeled presence of\nstigma in 4 articles when they contained stigmatizing quotes\nfrom subjects, but the overall reporting argued against the\nsaid ideas. E.g., \u201c[name] said \u2018[...] claims were corrobo-\nrated.\u2019 This allegation stands void for multiple reasons.\u201d\nMedia Communities\nNext, we generated broad, latent sub-groups of news outlets,\nextending beyond regionality, political leaning, and veracity\nof sources captured in the NELA datasets \u2013 our motivation\nwas that this fine-grained grouping could provide insights\ninto different communities of V AW framings. Accordingly,\nwe constructed a content sharing network (CSN) of news\noutlets, where nodes represent outlets and edges represent\nthe proportion of articles copied between outlets (directed\nas information flow, A \u2192B means B copies from A). As\ndemonstrated in prior studies (Gruppi et al. 2022; Horne,\nN\u00f8rregaard, and Adal\u0131 2019; Starbird et al. 2018), this struc-\ntural conceptualization of news networks consistently yields\nclusters that represent meaningful and distinct parts of the\nnews landscape. These clusters may capture inauthentic co-\nordination, ownership, partisanship, and regionality.\nThis network was constructed using the algorithm de-\nscribed by Horne, N\u00f8rregaard, and Adal\u0131 (2019). Specifi-\ncally, we constructed a Term Frequency Inverse Document\n1071\nIssue-generic Policy Dimension Description\nEconomic Costs, benefits, and other monetary implications\nCapacity and resources Availability of physical, human, or financial resources, and capacity of existing systems\nMorality Religious, ethical, or social implications\nFairness and equality Equality or inequality with which laws, punishments, or rewards are distributed\nConstitutionality and jurisprudence Rights, freedoms and authority of individuals, government, and corporations\nPolicy prescription and evaluation Discussion of policies proposed for addressing an identified problem\nCrime and punishment Effectiveness and implications of existing laws and their reinforcement\nSecurity and defense Security or threats to security of an individual, group or nation\nHealth and safety Healthcare access and effectiveness, public safety\nQuality of life Effects of policy on individuals\u2019 wealth, well-being, and happiness\nCultural identity Social norms, values, and customs constituting culture(s), in relevance to a policy issue\nPublic opinion Attitudes and opinions of the general public\nPolitical Considerations related to politics and politicians including elections and lobbyists\nExternal regulation and reputation Comparison of policy outcomes across nations, states, and groups\nTable 2: Issue-generic policy dimensions devised by Boydstun et al. (2013).\nFrequency (TF-IDF) matrix for each 5 day window of the\ndataset and created article pairs by keeping articles that had\na greater than 0.85cosine similarity (near verbatim copies of\neach other). We then ordered these edges by time and aggre-\ngated individual articles into outlets. Importantly, to ensure\nwe were appropriately representing the news landscape, we\nconstructed this network using all of the outlets and articles\ninNELA-GT andNELA-Local (9,336,137 articles from\n674 outlets) rather than only using those in our final filtered\nV AW dataset (184,089 articles from 396 outlets).\nA visualization of this network is given in Figure 2. The\ncommunity membership (computed using modularity) of a\nnews outlet is used in our subsequent analyses for RQs 1, 2.\nOperationalizing Issue-generic Policies\nIssue-generic policies (refer to Table 2) \u2013 proposed by Boyd-\nstun et al. (2013) \u2013 summarize aspects that provide high-\nlevel insights into publicly available political communica-\ntions and their influence on public attitudes.\nTo answer RQ1(e), i.e. to explore differences in stigma-\ntized V AW framings across mentions of issue-generic poli-\ncies, we first identified presence of the 14 issue-generic pol-\nicy dimensions, as listed in Table 2, in our news datasets. We\nused two publicly available datasets, manually annotated for\nthe presence of the 14 policy dimensions, to extract mentions\nof issue-generic policies within our news articles:\n1.Media Frames Corpus (Card et al. 2015): This consists\nof annotated news articles on three political issues: (1)\nimmigration (5, 549articles), (2) smoking (4, 077arti-\ncles), and (3) same-sex marriage (6, 298articles).\n2.Immigration Discourse on Social Media (Mendel-\nsohn, Budak, and Jurgens 2021): This consists of 4,497\nimmigration-related annotated tweets.\nWe used a BERT-based representation learning frame-\nwork (Devlin et al. 2019) to get linguistic representations\nof the 14 policy dimensions. For this, we used all the news\narticle excerpts and tweets \u2013 contained in the two datasets\nmentioned above \u2013 annotated for the presence of each issue-\ngeneric policy. For each policy, the corresponding annotatedarticle excerpts and tweets were then transformed into vec-\ntor representations using sentence-level BERT. Finally, we\naveraged the sentence-level embeddings of all the articles\nand tweets annotated for an issue-generic policy to get its\nlinguistic representation. This process resulted in 14 embed-\ndings representing the 14 issue-generic policies.\nSimilar to measuring stigma, to identify the presence of\nthe 14 policy dimensions in our news datasets we repre-\nsented the news articles using sentence-level BERT embed-\ndings. Again, per Kwak et al. (2021), we compared embed-\ndings representing the news article and the 14 policy di-\nmensions using cosine similarity. This generated a 14-length\nvector for each news article, enumerating the presence of the\n14 issue-generic policies within the news article.\nValidating Issue-generic Policy Extraction Two authors\nfirst had an in-depth discussion to reach a common un-\nderstanding of the 14 policies. Following this, they la-\nbeled the presence of issue-generic policies for 10 randomly\nsampled news articles and agreed on 80% of the sample.\nThe authors then resolved their differences to reach 100%\nco-author agreement. Finally, they sampled and annotated\n150 news articles, spanning NELA-GT andNELA-Local\ndatasets, to compare hand annotations against machine la-\nbels for the policies. Our issue-generic policy extraction sys-\ntem achieved high precision (79%) and recall (74%) against\nthe human-assigned ground truth.\nError analyses: The system mislabeled 8 articles as\n\u2018Constitutionality and jurisprudence\u2019. This happened when\nthere were mentions of justice institutions and law enforce-\nment but no direct references to individuals\u2019 rights/freedom\n(e.g., \u201csupreme court justice was in question\u201d). The frame-\nwork also mislabeled 4 articles as \u2018Economic\u2019 when there\nwere numerical comparisons with no monetary implications\n(e.g., \u201c43 times more likely to commit assualt\u201d).\nExplanatory Model\nIn response to RQ2, we developed a logistic regression\nmodel (all-factors), using the default statsmodels\nPython module, to understand the relative roles of differ-\n1072\nent factors, namely, (a) regionality, (b) political leaning, (c)\nveracity of news sources, (d) media communities, and (e)\nissue-generic policies, in explaining stigmatized V AW fram-\nings in news media. Our choice of using logistic regression\nstems from prior work that adopt this methodology to inves-\ntigate the association of various independent variables with\nparticular outcomes of interest in understanding online me-\ndia behaviors (Sivaraman et al. 2023). The all-factors\nmodel was trained using the five factors as independent vari-\nables, with an 80-20 train-test split, to perceive their ex-\nplanatory power in determining whether an article uses stig-\nmatized framings or not (dependent variable).\nResults\nDifference in Stigma: Regionality of News Sources\nCorresponding to RQ1(a), to analyze differences in stigma-\ntized V AW framings based on regionality of news sources,\nwe compared cosine similarity score distributions (indicat-\ning articles\u2019 alignment to Approval/Stigma frame) for two\nclusters of news articles: (1) published by national media\noutlets, i.e., articles within NELA-GT and (2) published by\nlocal media outlets, i.e., articles within NELA-Local.\nWe found that 82,986(15,121) news articles published\nby national news outlets skewed towards the stigma (ap-\nproval) dimension of the Approval/Stigma frame. This\nshows that a larger proportion of articles by national sources\naligned more with the stigma dimension compared to the\napproval dimension, indicating their V AW discourse to use\nmore stigmatizing linguistic cues than approving or accept-\ning framings. Along similar lines we observed that 51,471\n(17,421) articles published by local outlets aligned with the\nstigma (approval) dimension. Articles from national outlets\n\u2018US News\u2019, \u2018CNN\u2019 and local outlets \u2018Atlanta Daily World\u2019,\n\u2018The Daily Republic\u2019 contained V AW-based stigma.\nOn comparing prevalence of the Approval/Stigma frame\nacross the national and local outlets we found that the aver-\nage cosine similarity score was \u22120.0428 (\u22120.0332) for arti-\ncles within the national (local) clusters, indicating that local\nmedia sources contain less stigmatizing V AW framings com-\npared to national sources. This finding is also captured in the\ncosine similarity distribution plot shown in Figure 1a. The\nhistogram plot for local media outlets is skewed towards the\nright, compared to that of national outlets, suggesting that lo-\ncal outlets use more approval-based framings than national.\nEffect size measurement revealed meaningful differences in\nscore distributions of national and local sources, |Cohen\u2019s d|:\n0.513. These differences were also statistically significant\nunder Mann-Whitney U-tests (U-stat: 29.903;p <0.01).\nElucidating these quantitative observations further, in the\nparaphrased excerpts below, we observe the presence of sup-\nportive, positive, and progressive language (e.g., \u201ccommuni-\ncate priorities as one voice\u201d, \u201cmake the experience comfort-\nable\u201d) around survivors and structures for both national and\nlocal articles falling towards the approval dimension:\n\u201cWRAP helps victims of rape and domestic violence to\nbounce back emotionally, physically and mentally. \u2018We\nwant to make the experience as comfortable and relaxing\nas possible [...] the conversation you are having is going tobe one of the most difficult of your life as you open up about\nthe experience,\u2019 [...] said.\u201d (National (CBS): approval )\n\u201cThis year\u2019s legislative session brought a more broad and\norganized effort to communicate priorities as one voice. [...]\nalso filed HB 1906, dubbed \u2018Athena\u2019s Law,\u2019 which would\ngive judges the authority to delay release of those accused\nof sexual assault.\u201d (Local (Kennebec Journal): approval )\nIn contrast, we observe critical and condemning lan-\nguage directed at social processes and inequities for arti-\ncles aligned with the stigma dimension. For instance, the\nparaphrased excerpt below blames the systemic processes\nand culture of a country for the prevalence of sexual assault\n(\u201cconviction rate in trials is low\u201d, \u201cblame increasing number\nof assaults on a culture of impunity\u201d). Additionally, the other\nexcerpt uses derogatory language to describe sexual assault\nsurvivors (\u201cengage in behaviors such as bedwetting\u201d).\n\u201cWhen survivors file complaint for sexual assault in [coun-\ntry name] prosecution is very rare, and the conviction rate in\ntrials that do go to court is very low. [...] 88% of respondents\nsaid they faced no legal consequences. [...] blame assaults\non a culture of impunity.\u201d (National (US News): stigma)\n\u201cA few common signs of sexual assault include: changes in\nself-care, such as paying less attention to hygiene, or ap-\npearance [...] may engage in behaviors, such as thumbsuck-\ning or bedwetting.\u201d (Local (Atlanta Daily World): stigma)\nDifference in Stigma: Political Leaning of News\nIn response to RQ1(b), i.e., to study differences in stig-\nmatized V AW framings based on political leaning of\nnews sources, we looked at cosine similarity distributions\nfor articles grouped by political leaning of outlets ana-\nlyzed separately within the national (NELA-GT) and local\n(NELA-Local) source clusters. Again, >0cosine similar-\nity indicates alignment to approval, while <0to stigma.\nNational-left and -right leaning sources On segregat-\ning articles based on political leaning of sources within\nNELA-GT, i.e., articles published by left/right leaning\nsources, we observed that 32,123 (14,371) articles pub-\nlished by national-left leaning outlets aligned with the\nstigma (approval) dimension (Figure 1b). In addition,\n43,874(7,739) articles published by national-right leaning\noutlets aligned with stigma (approval). These raw statistics\nsuggest that for both left and right leaning sources within\nNELA-GT, more articles tended to use a stigmatizing fram-\ning compared to an approval-based framing. However, the\nratio of number of articles leaning more towards approval\nthan to stigma is higher, 0.447, for national-left leaning out-\nlets in comparison to that for national-right outlets (0.176),\nindicating that national-left sources use lesser stigmatizing\nlinguistic framings than national-right. This is also sum-\nmarized in the cosine similarity distribution plots shown\nin Figure 1b where the histogram distribution for national-\nleft sources is shifted towards the right to that of national-\nright sources. Effect size measurement revealed meaningful\ndifferences in score distributions of national-left and -right\nleaning sources, |Cohen\u2019s d|:0.751. These differences were\nalso statistically significant under Mann-Whitney U-tests\n1073\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\n (d)\nFigure 1: Histogram of cosine similarity scores for articles published by (a) national outlets (left Y-axis) and local outlets (right\nY-axis), (b) national-right leaning (left Y-axis) and -left leaning (right Y-axis) outlets, (c) local-right leaning (left Y-axis) and\n-left leaning (right Y-axis) outlets, and (d) conspiracy (left Y-axis) and non-conspiracy outlets (right Y-axis). (All) Dotted lines\nrepresent the average cosine similarity for articles from corresponding groups of news sources.\n(a) Colored by Stigma Score\n (b) Colored by Community\n (c) Annotated Communities\nFigure 2: Content sharing networks. In (a), outlets are colored green if they use less stigma framing than the average outlet, red\nif they use more stigma framing than the average outlet, and grey if they are not included in our V AW sample. In (b), outlets\nare colored by community membership, determined by modularity. In (c), to better explain the types of media communities\ncaptured in the network, we provide high-level annotations of the largest communities.\n(U-stat: 15.196;p < 0.05). Quotes below from national-\nleft and national-right articles show comparable degrees of\nstigma \u2013 left portrays structural systems with stigma while\nthe right portrays survivors and supporters with stigma:\n\u201cNews sparked outrage in [...], where allegations of SA of-\nten go under reported due to a slow legal system. [...] brutal\ncases of assault are often dealt with poorly under the coun-\ntry\u2019s justice system.\u201d (National-left (CNN): stigma)\n\u201cSupporters falsely claim that survivors of sexual assault are\ndenied care [...] advocating for procedures that put women\nat risk.\u201d (National-right (RealClearPolitics): stigma)\nLocal-left and -right leaning sources Next, looking at\ncosine similarity scores for articles in left and right lean-\ning sources within NELA-Local (Figure 1c), 24,197\n(17,439) articles released by local-left leaning sources\naligned with the stigma (approval) dimension of the Ap-\nproval/Stigma frame. Furthermore, 19,995(6,176) articles\npublished by local-right sources skewed towards the stigma\n(approval) dimension. Again, similar to what was observed\nforNELA-GT, for both left and right leaning sources within\nNELA-Local, a larger proportion of articles used stigma-tizing language than positive approval-based framings. On\ncomparing the ratio of number of articles aligning with\napproval to those with stigma, we observed that local-left\nsources achieve a higher value (0.721) compared to local-\nright (0. 309), suggesting that left-leaning sources use more\napproval-based framings than right-leaning sources within\nNELA-Local. This finding is also featured in the score dis-\ntribution plots shown in Figure 1c such that the histogram for\nlocal-left sources appears towards the right to that of local-\nright sources. Effect size measurement revealed meaningful\nand large differences in score distributions of local-left and\n-right leaning sources, |Cohen\u2019s d|:0.812. These differences\nwere also statistically significant under Mann-Whitney U-\ntests (U-stat: 72.48;p <0.01).\nTo summarize, within both NELA-GT andNELA-Local\ndatasets, left-leaning sources use more approval-based fram-\nings compared to right. This is also indicated by a higher\naverage similarity score for articles from national-left\n(\u22120.0228) and local-left (\u22120. 0097) when compared to those\nfrom national-right (\u22120. 0427) and local-right (\u22120. 0390).\n1074\nDifference in Stigma: Veracity of News Sources\nNext, for RQ1(c), i.e., to study differences in stigmatized\nV AW framings based on veracity of news sources, we looked\nat cosine similarity distributions across two clusters of news\narticles published by: (1) low-veracity or conspiracy outlets\nand (2) high-veracity or non-conspiracy outlets (NELA-GT).\nPer Figure 1d, 14,760 (2,330) articles from conspir-\nacy news sources (e.g., Breitbart, Infowars, The Gateway\nPundit) skewed towards the stigma (approval) dimension,\nshowing that conspiracy sources use more negative stigma-\nbased language than approval-based framings. Similarly,\nfor non-conspiracy news outlets, like NPR, PBS, ABC\nNews, 82,986 (15,121) articles aligned with the stigma\n(approval) dimension of the Approval/Stigma frame. How-\never, comparing the stigmatized framings across conspiracy\nand non-conspiracy outlets, we found that non-conspiracy\nsources use more approval-based framings than conspirato-\nrial sources. E.g., non-conspiracy outlets achieved a higher\naverage cosine similarity, \u22120.0428, as compared to conspir-\nacy outlets (\u2212 0.0632). In addition, the ratio of number of\nnews articles aligning with approval to those with stigma is\nhigher for non-conspiracy (0. 182) than for conspiracy out-\nlets (0. 053). This finding is also supported by the cosine\nsimilarity score distributions shown in Figure 1d, where the\nhistogram plot for non-conspiracy outlets is shifted towards\nthe right to that of conspiracy outlets. Effect size measure-\nment revealed meaningful and large differences in distribu-\ntions of mainstream and conspiratorial sources, |Cohen\u2019s d|:\n0.803. Differences were statistically significant under Mann-\nWhitney U-tests (U-stat: 26.891;p <0.05).\nDifference in Stigma: Media Communities\nMedia communities captured by the CSN supported the\nabove findings. In Figure 2a, we colored nodes green if they\nused stigmatized framings less than the average outlet over-\nall, and red if they used stigmatized framings more than the\naverage outlet overall, where the average outlet had a cosine\nsimilarity score of \u22120.044. As expected, outlets with similar\nlevels of stigmatized language were clustered together.\nThen, overlaying this network with community member-\nships (computed using modularity), we found that the com-\nmunity that used the most stigmatizing language on average\nis a community of far-right and conspiracy-peddling sources\n(labeled Far Right, Conspiracy in Figure 2c). As a whole,\noutlets within this community had a lower cosine similarity\nscore (\u2212 0.057) than the average outlet (\u22120. 044). In particu-\nlar, several outlets central to the community used highly stig-\nmatizing language across their articles: The Blaze (\u22120. 104),\nFree Beacon (\u2212 0.075), and Breitbart (\u22120. 053).\nNext, when comparing this community to the largest com-\nmunity in the network, which contains mostly U.S. main-\nstream news outlets (labeled National Mainstream in Figure\n2c), we found similar results to our previous findings. That\nis, the U.S. mainstream community used less stigmatizing\nlanguage than the far right, conspiracy community (\u22120. 045\nvs.\u22120.057) but slightly more than the average outlet overall\n(\u22120.045vs.\u22120.044). While much of the community uses\nless stigmatized language than the average outlet (as indi-\ncated by the green nodes in Figure 2a), several outlets thatare highly central to the community use more stigmatized\nlanguage than average (CBS (\u22120. 056) and NPR (\u2212 0.056))\nand multiple outlets on the periphery of the community\nalso used more stigmatized language than the average outlet\n(Shareblue (\u2212 0.076) and Business Insider (\u22120. 072)).\nThe media communities also supported the finding that\nnational outlets used more stigmatizing language than local\noutlets, particularly more than left-leaning local news out-\nlets. E.g., the community with the highest average cosine\nsimilarity score (lowest stigma), \u22120.033, is a group of local\nnews outlets owned by Digital First Media (labeled Digital\nFirst Media Local in Figure 2c, e.g., The Denver Post, The\nMercury News, Daily Democrat, St. Paul Pioneer Press) that\nare headquartered in left-leaning counties.\nNonetheless, there are some nuances to this support. For\nexample, despite left-leaning outlets, both nationally (e.g.,\nThe New York Times) and locally (e.g., The Columbus Dis-\npatch), producing more articles leaning towards the approval\ndimension rather than the stigma dimension, a small com-\nmunity of progressive outlets (labeled Progressive Blogs in\nFigure 2c) used stigmatized framings more than the average\n(\u22120.051vs.\u22120.044). This community included outlets such\nas The Raw Story (\u2212 0.048), and Crooks and Liars (\u22120. 049).\nDifference in Stigma: Issue-generic Policies\nPer Section \u201cOperationalizing Issue-generic Policies\u201d, for\nRQ1(e), we generated a 14-length vector representation for\neach news article to quantify the presence of the 14 dimen-\nsions, listed in Table 2. Articles published by national, lo-\ncal, and conspiracy sources were then separately clustered\ninto 14 groups \u2013 representing the 14 issue-generic policies.\nWe performed this clustering by assigning an article to the\nissue-generic policy cluster with which the article aligned\nthe most, i.e., for which it attained the highest numerical\nvalue in the 14-length vector. After obtaining these 14 clus-\nters, for each of the three types of news sources (national, lo-\ncal, and conspiracy), we averaged the cosine similarity to the\nApproval/Stigma frame for all articles in a cluster. This anal-\nysis gave the heatmap shown in Figure 3, representing aver-\nage Approval/Stigma alignment of articles with pronounced\npresence of an issue-generic policy.\nFrom Figure 3 we see that articles mentioning issue-\ngeneric policies \u2018Fairness and equality\u2019, \u2018External regulation\nand reputation\u2019, \u2018Health and safety\u2019, and \u2018Capacity and re-\nsources\u2019 use stigmatizing language the most across all three\ncategories of news sources, with conspiratorial news sources\ndemonstrating 26.19% more stigma compared to national\nfor these 4 issue-generic policies, and national outlets with\n43.73% more stigma than local ones, also for the same poli-\ncies. Table 3 lists top uni-, bi-, and tri-grams, based on TF-\nIDF, in articles belonging to the policy clusters, across the 3\nsource types. Phrases such as \u2018justice system\u2019, \u2018cancel cul-\nture\u2019, and \u2018war crimes\u2019 indicate themes that attract V AW-\nbased stigma. Consider the following two paraphrased ex-\ncerpts. In the first, instead of providing references to support\nservices or ways to combat the issue, the article sensation-\nalizes the judicial system of the mentioned country. In addi-\ntion, the next excerpt not only exaggerates the act of violence\nunnecessarily but uses a visual representation (\u201cforced her\u201d)\n1075\nFigure 3: Heatmap showing alignment to Approval/Stigma,\nfor articles with an issue-generic policy (Y-axis); published\nby national, local or conspiracy outlets (X-axis).\nto reinforce stereotypes on female subordination.\n\u201cSexual crimes against women are widespread in [...], brutal\ncases of rape are often dealt with poorly under the country\u2019s\njustice system.\u201d (Capacity and resources: stigma)\n\u201c[...] forced her into the apartment, where he assaulted her.\n[...] Though the perpetrator had a prior record on property\ncrimes, the judge ruled against punishment using a \u2018benefit\nof the doubt\u2019 argument.\u201d (Fairness and equality: stigma)\nOn the other hand, articles containing issue-generic poli-\ncies such as \u2018Morality\u2019, \u2018Cultural identity\u2019, and \u2018Quality\nof life\u2019 tend to mostly use approval-based framings, again,\nacross all three types of news sources, with local outlets\nhaving the most approval by 31.14% compared to national\nand conspiratorial outlets. This finding is evident through\nthe following two exemplars. The first paraphrased article\nexcerpt raises awareness about the increased domestic and\nchild abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic (Piquero et al.\n2021), acknowledges its impact on the youth\u2019s well-being,\nand advocates for appropriate support. Terms in Table 3 like\n\u2018better life\u2019, \u2018health care\u2019 also indicate this approval-based\nusage. The excerpt follows existing media guidelines to re-\nsponsibly report and represent V AW, without exacerbating\nstigma, such as by using a \u201csurvivor-centered approach\u201d and\nhighlighting that \u201csituations (like COVID-19) can lead to an\nincrease in V AW, but should not be used as an excuse for\nviolence\u201d (UNICEF and UN Women 2020). Similarly, the\nsecond paraphrased excerpt not only normalizes the impact\nof domestic violence across different identities and demo-\ngraphics but also affirms the need for the audience to collec-\ntively care for the survivors (\u201call of us should care\u201d).\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, for many teenagers, home was not\nalways a safe place. [...] having therapists in schools pro-\nvides a way of supporting youth, particularly female stu-\ndents, who may be experiencing physical abuse in the home\nduring COVID-19.\u201d (Quality of life: approval )\n\u201cDV is a crime that affects both women and men, of every\nrace, religion, culture, status and income level. [...] all of us\nshould care, and should understand the resources available\nto those in danger.\u201d (Cultural identity, Morality: approval )\nFigure 4: Standardized regression coefficients (\u03b2 ) of inde-\npendent variables with the highest positive and negative val-\nues (p < 0.01) in the all-factors model.\nImportance of Factors that Explain VAW Stigma\nFor RQ2, here we present our evaluation of the\nall-factors logistic regression model, used to explore\nthe relative roles of the five factors in explaining stigma\naround V AW in news media. To do so, we provide the posi-\ntive and negative standardized coefficients (\u03b2 ) of the most\nsalient independent variables in Figure 4. Larger positive\n(negative) \u03b2value of an independent variable represents its\ngreater ability in explaining the likelihood of an article con-\ntaining stigma-based framings (or not). Amongst the five\nfactors, issue-generic policies (or article alignment to the 14\nissue-generic dimensions) offer the highest explanation in\nour dependent variable, i.e., presence/absence of stigma \u2013\nissue-generic policy dimensions obtain large absolute \u03b2val-\nues as shown in Figure 4. In addition, independent variables\nsuch as veracity, national regionality, and left political lean-\ning are relatively weak in identifying stigma- or approval-\nbased framings since they achieve small absolute \u03b2values.\nLastly, variables with the highest importance in identi-\nfying stigmatized framings include issue-generic policies\nlike Fairness and equality (\u03b2 :0.839), Health and safety (\u03b2 :\n0.834), and External regulation and reputation (\u03b2 :0.527),\nwhich were also shown to contain pronounced stigma-\ntized framings in response to RQ1(e). In contrast, inde-\npendent variables with the highest importance in iden-\ntifying approval-based framings include local regionality\n(\u03b2:\u22120.240) and issue-generic policies like Morality (\u03b2 :\n\u22120.566) and Cultural identity (\u03b2 :\u22120.697), which could be\nattributed to some level of adherence to media guidelines.\nDiscussion\nWhy News Sources Differ in their VAW Framings\nJournalists are usually supported by a set of comprehensive\nguidelines that they are recommended to follow while re-\nporting accounts of V AW (UNICEF and UN Women 2020;\nUNDP 2022). Most of these resources expand on steps that\njournalists can take to ensure their reporting is part of the\nsolution to V AW and does not cause additional harm to the\nsurvivors reinforcing stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors.\n1076\nIssue-generic Policy Dimension Top uni-, bi-, tri-grams based on TF-IDF\nEconomic fsa, layoffs, 19 million, lifetime warranty, labor, money allocated, abortion money, compensation pay\nCapacity and resources justice system, reserve court, school staff, abortion resource access, hospital admin, white house\nMorality fair, civil rights, taking care, acted unethically, responsible activists, sexual morality, social ethics\nFairness and equality against punishment, black lives matter, cancel culture, right wing, resource allocation, racism\nConstitutionality and jurisprudence us citizen, green card, voter id, reform, forbidden, joe biden, 2021 vawa passed, district attorney\nPolicy prescription and evaluation abortion ban, we need, president trump, the bill, anti abortion, reauthorizing vawa, 14th amendment\nCrime and punishment violence, sex trafficking, law enforcement, los angeles, johnston county, police said, sheriff office\nSecurity and defense president trump, brief survey, security upgrade, defense department, prison camps, amendment needs\nHealth and safety make sure, health experts, emergency, safety guidelines, precaution, public health, volunteer\nQuality of life mental health, health care, public health, better life, live work, hostile environment, feel like, covid 19\nCultural identity country built, black lives, citizen, white women, culture wars, meanwhile indians, high school, racism\nPublic opinion petition, please sign, public health, rights, pro life, liberal media scream, abortion rights, lives matter\nPolitical far right, crisis, united states, president trump, right wing, hearing, joe biden, attorney general\nExternal regulation and reputation united nations, biden administration, white house, war crimes, human rights, rape incest\nTable 3: Top uni-, bi-, and tri-grams based on TF-IDF for articles contained in the 14 issue-generic policy clusters.\nStill, our findings for RQ1(a-c) revealed pronounced pres-\nence of stigma in articles from national, right-leaning, and\nconspiratorial news outlets. There could be many factors at\nplay behind these observations and we highlight them below.\nFirst, news outlets tend to tailor and optimize their con-\ntent using audience targeting techniques (Elejalde, Ferres,\nand Schifanella 2019). Right-leaning news media may be\nmore likely to hold conservative or traditional views on gen-\nder roles and sexuality. This can lead to stigmatizing atti-\ntudes. The implications of this are particularly acute in local\nmedia systems, where communities may only receive local\nV AW related news from one particular angle. As our anal-\nysis indicated, the largest difference in the usage of stig-\nmatized framings was between local outlets embedded in\nright-leaning counties versus those embedded in left-leaning\ncounties (Figure 1c). Further, conspiratorial outlets, often\ndriven by covert or overt political agendas, may attempt to\ndownplay the incidents of V AW if they conflict with their\nbeliefs or priorities. In fact, such outlets are known to pro-\nmote conspiracy theories that are not based on facts or ev-\nidence, which may result in sharing beliefs that V AW is a\nhoax. Since they also tend to use fear-mongering tactics to\nattract viewers or readers, these outlets may portray women\nas vulnerable and helpless. Importantly, conspiratorial news\noutlets may not be held accountable to the same standards of\naccuracy or fairness as mainstream news, resulting in report-\ning that contains sensationalist language or imagery, biased,\nexploitative, or lacking in context. Indeed, we found more\nstigma-based framings in articles from conspiratorial outlets\ncompared to mainstream news (Figure 1d). Such framings\ncan preclude victimized women from reporting incidents for\nfear of shame, judgment, and minimization.\nNext, despite the differences between local left- and right-\nleaning outlets, local news as a whole used stigmatizing\nframes less than national news (Figure 1a). This finding ex-\npands upon prior work, which found that local newspapers\nin Utah challenged patriarchal institutions on domestic vi-\nolence (Bullock 2007). Distance from the local community\nmay drive national outlets\u2019 stigmatizing V AW frames \u2013 these\noutlets may be less connected to the communities where theviolence occurred. As a result, they may not have access to\nlocal resources or community perspectives that can provide\ncontext and nuance to the reporting. Given their scope, they\nmay also tend to focus on high-profile cases of V AW, over-\nlooking or under reporting on the prevalence of V AW in ev-\neryday life, which can perpetuate the belief that these inci-\ndents are rare or exceptional. In contrast, local news sources\nmay be more likely to report on V AW in a way that is sen-\nsitive to the survivors involved. They may have closer rela-\ntionships with local resources and organizations that provide\nsupport and advocacy for survivors, and they may be more\nattuned to the nuances of the local context.\nOur study also found that news articles adopting certain\nissue-generic policies displayed different levels of stigma\ntowards victims of V AW. Specifically, policy dimensions re-\nlated to fair and equal treatment and health and safety were\nfound to perpetuate stigma in different ways. News media\nfocusing on the \u2018Fairness and equality\u2019 policy dimension\nmay demonize women who have experienced violence by\nframing them as liars and manipulators; thus exploit their\ntrauma for political gain. Meanwhile, media focusing on the\n\u2018Health and safety\u2019 dimension may perpetuate the stereotype\nthat women are most at risk from unknown men and ignore\nthe fact that women are more likely to experience violence\nfrom someone they know. This narrative may blame victims\nfor not taking steps to protect themselves Additionally, when\nnews media frames V AW as a policy issue of capacity and\nresource allocation, it may portray survivors as burdens on\nthe system and ignore the root causes of V AW, such as sys-\ntemic sexism and gender inequality. It perpetuates stigma by\nsuggesting that V AW is solely a problem of resource alloca-\ntion rather than a societal issue requiring systemic change.\nFinally, our RQ2 findings suggest that media attributes\nsuch as regionality, political leaning, and veracity alone are\nnot enough to identify stigma in news articles about V AW.\nThe relationship between these attributes and stigma is more\ncomplex and context-dependent. For instance, left-leaning\narticles showed stigma when criticizing policies or actions\nthat contribute to V AW, while right-leaning articles stigma-\ntized survivors, advocates, and political rivals. Thus, these\n1077\nattributes alone are not enough to capture the underlying\ncontext. In contrast, systematically categorizing news out-\nlets based on media communities and aligning articles to\nissue-generic policy dimensions offered a better explanation\nfor the presence/absence of stigma, as they can capture con-\ntextualized information on the outlet\u2019s position in the news\nmedia landscape and the political themes used in the articles.\nSurvivor-Centered Safe Reporting Guidelines\nBased on our findings noting the presence of stigma in V AW\nnews reporting in different types of outlets, we suggest the\nfollowing considerations for V AW safe reporting guidelines.\nUse trauma-informed language and avoid victim-\nblaming: Articles focusing on the \u2018Fairness and equality\u2019\npolicy dimension perpetuate stigma by portraying survivors\nas manipulators (RQ1(e)). News outlets should avoid lan-\nguage that downplays the severity of the problem. Aside\nfrom prioritizing survivors\u2019 voices and experiences, trauma-\ninformed language should be used when reporting on V AW,\nwhich means avoiding language and narratives that suggest\nsurvivors are responsible for their own victimization or that\nminimizes the severity of the harm they have experienced.\nHold perpetrators accountable: The \u2018Capacity and re-\nsources\u2019 policy dimensions propagates stigma by justifying\nthat V AW merely results from incapacity of existing systems\n(RQ1(e)). News outlets should avoid language that excuses\nor justifies perpetrators\u2019 behavior and instead focus on the\nharm caused to survivors and consequences of their actions.\nThis includes providing information on legal consequences.\nProvide context and educate readers: We found that para-\nphrased excerpts contextualizing V AW in RQ1(e), e.g., by\nadvocating for students experiencing increased domestic\nabuse during COVID-19 or normalizing domestic violence\nacross different cultural identities, contained approval-based\nframings. News outlets should provide context for incidents\nof V AW and educate readers on the broader societal issues\nthat contribute to the problem. This can include information\non systemic sexism, gender inequality, the impact of cultural\nnorms and beliefs on V AW, and local/community informa-\ntion where a particular V AW incident may have occurred.\nAvoid perpetuating conspiracy theories: News outlets\nshould adopt evidence-based reporting and thus avoid per-\npetuating false mis- and disinformation that undermine the\ncredibility of survivor accountsor that survivors could have\nprevented V AW by simply taking different actions.\nAvoid perpetuating political biases: Our results for\nRQ1(b) show that right-leaning sources use more stigma-\ntized framings than their left counterparts. Right-leaning\noutlets may hold conservative views on V AW to appeal\nto their target audiences (Elejalde, Ferres, and Schifanella\n2019). News outlets should avoid using V AW as a way to ad-\nvance underlying political agendas that undermine the credi-\nbility of survivor accounts or that suggest V AW as a strategy\nto exploit existing institutions for personal advantage.\nConclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\nIn this paper, we sought to understand the presence of\nstigmatized framings in news media reports of V AW. Us-\ning a BERT-based framework, we quantified approval- andstigma-based language in news articles from 396 national,\nlocal, and conspiratorial news outlets within the U.S., cover-\ning a broad news media landscape. Articles from local, left-\nleaning, and high-veracity sources adopted more acceptable\nand approval-based framings, in comparison to their coun-\nterparts. In addition, articles with mentions of specific issue-\ngeneric policies such as those around the distribution of laws\nand rewards, those speaking to the capacity of existing soci-\netal infrastructures, and those with references to the public\nsafety threats of V AW had pronounced stigma, and it also\nshowed the best ability to explain the presence of stigma.\nWe note some limitations which provide excellent direc-\ntions for future research. We did not examine how specific\nstigmatized V AW framings in news influence consumers.\nNext, V AW saw an increase in reported incidents during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic (UN Women 2021). Researchers\ncould study temporal trends of stigma to quantify the im-\npact of unforeseen crises. Finally, this work was executed\nunder the premise that framing is a journalistic strategy in-\nfluencing partisan action. Future work might consider evolu-\ntion of stigma around the implementation of national V AW\npolicy.

Yes,\nwe discuss limitations of our work in Section \u201cCon-\nclusion, Limitations, and Future Work.\u201d\n(f) Did you discuss any potential negative societal im-\npacts of your work? No, because our work does not\npromote any societal violations. For instance, we do\nnot build prediction frameworks to infer sensitive at-\ntributes. In fact, our findings provide ways to combat\nexisting negative perceptions on V AW in news media\n(refer to Section \u201cSurvivor-Centered Safe Reporting\nGuidelines\u201d under \u201cDiscussion\u201d).\n(g) Did you discuss any potential misuse of your work?\nNo. We do not curate/release any resources that pro-\nmote harm or bear potential for misuse. We perform\nan observational study of already published datasets\n(refer to Section \u201cData\u201d) that are available for public\nuse.(h) Did you describe steps taken to prevent or mitigate po-\ntential negative outcomes of the research, such as data\nand model documentation, data anonymization, re-\nsponsible release, access control, and the reproducibil-\nity of findings? Yes, refer to Section \u201cBroader Perspec-\ntives, Ethics, and Competing Interests.\u201d We followed\nbest practices in social computing research and worked\nwith deidentified data. We also provide carefully para-\nphrased excerpts in the paper to reduce traceability.\n(i) Have you read the ethics review guidelines and en-\nsured that your paper conforms to them? Yes, we\ncarefully read the ethics guidelines and ensured that\nthe paper conforms to them. For instance, in Section\n\u201cBroader Perspectives, Ethics, and Competing Inter-\nests,\u201d we elaborate on the societal impact of our find-\nings, data anonymization, and responsible release of\nparaphrased excerpts.\n2.

Through a detailed examination of over 20 million posts \non Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube over five years (2018\u20132022), we identify trends \nin engagement, distinguishing between unreliable and reliable content to assess the impact of \nmisinformation. Further, we investigate the relationships among various discussion topics and their \nassociation with information quality, employing a network-based method to quantify the semantic \ndistances between these categories. Our findings reveal diverse trends in engagement that align \nwith global events, suggesting that social media discussions promptly reflect the resonance of real \nlife events concerning climate change such as COP26, the Climate Action Week and climate strikes \nassociated with the Fridays for Future movement. Notably, despite the lower volume of content \nlinking to unreliable sources, we observe significantly greater relative engagement with these sources \ncompared to content from reliable sources on all platforms except Twitter. This highlights a persistent \nchallenge in the online discourse surrounding climate misinformation.\nIn the contemporary digital environment, social media platforms critically shape public discourse on crucial \nissues like climate change1\u20133. Users often select content that aligns with their existing beliefs, typically overlooking \nopposing viewpoints, fostering echo chambers characterised by homogeneous, like-minded groups4\u20136. This \nphenomenon is partly rooted in the core designs of these platforms and user psychology7\u20139, where the business \nmodels of social media companies aim to captivate and retain attention by curating engaging content, thereby \nintensifying the echo chamber effect10. This dynamic contributes to increased ideological segregation, influenced \nby algorithmic curation and user interactions11,12. The challenge of separating inherent human behaviours from \ndigital influences is exacerbated by the limited data available for research13. Even when access to data is granted \nby direct holders such as Meta14, the intertwining of user interactions with this data makes it challenging to \nseparate natural behaviours from those influenced by the platform\u2019s algorithms and design features.\nIn this study, we focus specifically on how climate change (and climate misinformation) is communicated \non social media for two reasons. Firstly, climate change, unlike many other socio-political issues, presents an \nexistential risk to human societies and requires coordinate global action above and beyond what is needed to \ntackle most other socio-political issues. Achieving this global coordination is particularly challenging because \nprogress in the fight against climate change will only be apparent over a relatively long time period, a timescale \nwhich is not compatible with the short-term priorities (often economic) of most policy makers. This sets it \napart from other major socio-political issues where the costs and consequences of policy decisions are much \nmore evident in the short term (e.g., the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines as a result of concerted policy \nefforts). Secondly, the failure to tackle climate change is primarily a policy failure, not a failure of climate science, \nsince there remains a lack of global consensus as to which policies are correct or necessary to prevent worsening \nclimate change. This lack of policy consensus is what a lot of climate sceptics exploit when they oppose climate \naction, and counteracting these points requires an understanding of how and why these narratives are appealing \nto specific political groups and the general public. Building this understanding starts by studying in detail how \nthe issue of climate change is communicated across different contexts and domains, an effort which our study \n1Department of Computer Science, Sapienza University of Rome, Via Regina Elena 295, Rome 00161, Italy. \n2Department of Mathematics, City University of London, Northampton Square, London EC1V 0HB, United \nKingdom. 3Department of Network & Data Science, Central European University, Vienna, Austria. \uf02aemail:  \nmatteo.cinelli@uniroma1.it\nOPEN\nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 1 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports\n\naims to contribute to. Many climate sceptic narratives are spread via social media, which is why our study focuses \nspecifically on social media discourses.\nWhile broad scientific consensus recognises human activity as the primary driver of climate change15, public \ndiscourse on social media allows for the (near) unrestricted exchange of views, including views sceptical of \nclimate science which conflict with the scientific consensus, potentially undermining public understanding \nof climate-related global issues. While this openness introduces a rich diversity of perspectives16, it also risks \ngenerating confusion and discord, especially when scientifically unsupported opinions receive as much emphasis \nas facts, thereby fostering polarisation1,17,18. Bridging the gap between scientific consensus and diverse public \nopinions is essential; effective communication and education are vital to achieving this19. Although traditional \nmedia has significantly shaped public opinion in the past20, social media has become a formidable force in \ndisseminating information and transforming the public discourse on climate change through dynamic sharing \nand the debate of ideas and evidence.\nOur study conducts a comparative analysis across multiple social media platforms to address the outlined \nchallenges, identifying consistent themes in the climate change discourse over five years. We examine interactions \nwith content on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Y ouTube to discern nuances in user engagement, the evolution \nof discussion themes, and the influence of sources that frequently share unreliable content on the online debate.\nAs stated in the 2024 Global Risk Report of the World Economic Forum, misinformation is among the main \nshort term global risks21. Climate change and misinformation are, unfortunately, tightly linked and according \nto the scientific literature, a wide share of misinformation narratives revolve around this topic22 and some of its \nmanifestations (e.g extreme climate events23,24). Despite the longstanding history of misinformation in political \nprocesses, its proliferation in recent years, particularly on social media, has raised significant concerns25,26. \nMisinformation has been prominently analysed in contexts ranging from elections to natural disasters and \nclimate change, with the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighting its impact18,23,27\u201330. Our study builds on \nand advances a growing literature studying the narratives of climate change on social media24,31\u201339. Within this \nliterature, some studies focus on the discussion around climate change in general, whereas others focus on \nspecific aspects or themes within the wider climate discussion. For example, studies have considered online \ndiscussions around climate science31\u201333,35, climate politics1,36, and climate activism40,41. Across these studies, \ncommon findings include (1) that the online discussion around climate change is polarised between groups \nwho are supportive of climate action, and those sceptical of action1,3,31,32, and (2) that engagement with \nclimate narratives has consistently increased over time1, particularly since the climate protests in 2019 and the \nemergence of the Fridays for Future movement41. Studies have also considered individuals\u2019 engagement with, \nand discussion of, pro-climate action behaviours or policies, for instance in relation to veganism42, the adoption \nof electric vehicles43, and concerning controversial actions such as the climate geoengineering44.\nHistorically, the literature on social media and climate change has been heavily biased towards studies \nfocusing on Twitter (now X)2, with only a small number of studies considering climate communication on \nother platforms, for instance on Facebook45, Y ouTube46, and more recently on TikTok47. Consequently, our \nunderstanding of how climate change is communicated online has suffered from a bias in the audience and \npopulations studied. However, perhaps more importantly, the vast majority of studies do not compare findings \nacross platforms (for a rare comparative study, see39). Therefore, it is not clear the extent to which insights can \nbe generalised to social media as a whole, and by extension to the general public. Addressing this gap is a key \naim of our study.\nIn this work, we analyse the dynamics of user engagement with climate change content across various social \nmedia platforms, examining both the volume and the nature of engagement, the persistence of specific topics over \ntime, and users engagement with topics spread by unreliable and reliable information sources. We identify trends \nof engagement that align with significant global events (such as the Climate Action Week or the COP summits), \nhighlighting the pivotal role of social media in raising awareness about environmental issues. Furthermore, the \nincreasing engagement with sources sharing unreliable content across all four platforms underscores the urgent \nneed for strategies aimed at improving the accuracy and quality of online discourse related to climate change.\nResults and discussion\nInteraction patterns\nWe gathered data using a keyword search of terms central to the climate change debate, including {climate \nchange, climate crisis, climate emergency, global warming } thus focusing on English language content. A more \ncomprehensive explanation regarding the data collection is reported in Methods (see Data collection Section) \nwhile a breakdown of the collected data is presented in Table\u00a0 1.\nWe start by investigating posting patterns on the four social media platforms7, namely Facebook (FB), \nInstagram (IG), Twitter (TW) and Y ouTube (YT) obtaining the heavy-tailed distributions of users\u2019 activity (i.e. \nnumber of posts per account) and engagement per post (i.e. the sum of the interactions received by each post) \nshown in Fig.\u00a0 1. The shape of the distributions (displayed on logarithmic axes and common to most social media \nplatforms7) shows that while the majority of accounts publish only a small number of posts, a small number of \naccounts are responsible for a large number of the posts produced. Similar patterns are observed in the case of \nengagement per post where a small fraction of posts receive the majority of engagement.\nTrends and volumes of social media content\nIn this section, we show the evolution in terms of the volume of content posted on each of the social media \nplatforms studied in order to estimate broad trends in the wider climate discussion.\nIn the first column of Fig.\u00a0 2, we display the time series for the quantity of content created (i.e., posts on \nFacebook and Instagram, tweets on Twitter, and videos on Y ouTube) on the four platforms. The second column \ndisplays their total engagement, i.e. the sum of the interactions received by each post; interactions are defined \nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 2 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nas likes, reactions, comments and shares on Facebook; likes, comments and shares on Instagram; likes, replies \nand retweets on Twitter; likes, dislikes, comments, shares and views on Y ouTube. The third column displays \nthe average engagement. The time series are shown at a monthly resolution, with the data for each social media \nplatform organised by rows and differentiated by colour coding. Given the non-stationary nature of these time \nseries, we employ the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter to extract and summarise their trends, potentially revealing \nnon-linear patterns. In a nutshell, the HP filter decomposes a time series into a smooth trend component and \na cyclical component by minimising the squared deviations of the time series values from the smoothed trend \nwhile applying a penalty function to large trend\u2019s variation. For an in-depth explanation of the HP filter and its \napplication to our data, please refer to Methods (see Hodrick-Prescott filter Section).\nUpon inspecting Fig.\u00a0 2, we note that the time series for each platform exhibit distinct peaks corresponding \nwith major international events, demonstrating a widespread engagement with climate change issues. Notably, \na significant surge in content creation and user interactions is observed across all platforms around the end of \n2019. This surge aligns with critical events: the Climate Action Week starting September 27, 2019, that involved \naround 7.6 million participants globally, and the climate strikes on November 29, 2019, associated with the \nFridays for Future movement41. Another notable peak in both activity and engagement occurs in November \n2021, in coincidence with the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26), highlighting this event\u2019s substantial impact \non raising awareness and fostering discussion on climate change issues within the digital sphere1,40. To assess \nwhether these events influenced engagement trends, we analysed the average engagement levels before and during \nthe considered events. As shown in Table 2, there is a notable increase in engagement across platforms around \nthese key moments. During Climate Action Week in September 2019, Facebook engagement rose significantly-\nfrom 16,735,430 before the event to 38,987,139 during the event. Instagram saw a similarly sharp increase, with \nengagement jumping from 24,832,920 to 54,882,392. Twitter experienced a more moderate rise, from 8,025,537 Fig. 1 .

A comparable \ntrend was observed during COP26 in November 2021. Facebook engagement increased from 14,322,492 to \n17,829,903. Instagram also saw an increase, from 32,663,626 to 39,505,208. Twitter engagement grew from \n9,230,530 to 11,013,226, while Y ouTube once again experienced a rise, from 98,092,648 to 127,572,410.\nTo further investigate the relevance of these events we conducted an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis \nfor both the September 2019 and November 2021 events (for details see the Interrupted time series sub-section \nin Methods). The ITS analyses identify whether events like Climate Action Week  and COP26  caused significant \nchanges in engagement trends; and if the effect are temporary or long-term. Table 3 displays the results of the \nITS analysis. The significant coefficients for the time variable T and, in particular, its quadratic term T2 across \nall platforms indicate that engagement trends over time are nonlinear, suggesting more complex dynamics than \na simple linear trend. Specifically, the significance of the quadratic term at the 0.01 level (except for IG and YT at \nthe 0.05 level) highlights acceleration or deceleration patterns over time. The analysis of the event coefficient ( D1 \nand D2) reveals that, for many platforms (IG, TW , YT), the event did not produce an immediate and significant \nimpact on engagement. However, this does not imply a complete absence of effect but rather a lack of an abrupt \nand short-term change. A key finding is the significance of the interaction terms T\u00d7D1 and T\u00d7D2 across all \nplatforms, indicating that the event\u2019s effect unfolds over time rather than manifesting immediately. The negative \nsign of these coefficients suggests a slowdown in the growth rate or a stabilization of engagement levels in the long \nterm. Although Fig. 2 shows visible peaks during the event, the non-significance of the immediate event effect \nin the model suggests that these variations were temporary and did not lead to a lasting shift in the trajectory of \nthe time series. This highlights how high-profile events may generate visible short-term fluctuations, while their \nlong-term effects become evident only through time-dependent interactions.\nHowever, we would like to clarify that our study does not aim to establish causality between events and \nplatforms trends but rather to highlight the trends observed in the engagement of social media. Many studies \nprovide evidence of the relationship between platforms and user climate awareness, which further supports our \nobservations; see, e.g.48\u201350. Causality is also difficult to establish because external events such as the Covid-19 \npandemic changed social media use trends during the time period we have studied, but unfortunately it is not \npossible to disentangle how engagement with climate-related events would have changed in the absence of such \nexternal factors.\nOur analysis reveals diverse trends across social media platforms regarding content publication, engagement, \nand average engagement. Specifically, we note an overall increase in content creation across all platforms. \nRegarding total engagement, we note a mix of decreasing trends for Facebook, a plateauing effect on Instagram, \nand increases on Twitter and Y ouTube. The most notable differences across social media platforms are observable \nin the case of average engagement, calculated as the monthly ratio of engagement (i.e. the sum of interactions \nreceived by all the posts published in a given month to the sum of monthly posts per platform). Facebook, \nInstagram, and Y ouTube exhibit a decline in average engagement, each following a different trajectory (note \nthat in the case of Y ouTube the same results were obtained also excluding views51 from the computation of \nengagement, as shown in Supplementary Information [ SI]).

The analysis of average engagement trends reveals a general downtrend across \nthree platforms. Several factors may contribute to this phenomenon including (i) the variability in the volume \nof posts generated each month; (ii) the significant proportion of accounts posting climate change-related \ncontent sporadically (as depicted in Fig.\u00a0 1, top panel), which could engage a narrowly interested audience, \nthus diminishing overall average engagement; (iii) the skewed distribution of engagement across all platforms \n(illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 1, bottom panel), suggesting that average engagement may not fully capture the nuances of \nuser interaction and that, while many accounts are producing climate content, only few accounts are likely to \nhave a meaningful influence in the debate. Robustness checks to address these complexities and validate the \nobserved trends are presented in SI (section Robustness Checks).\nOverall, the evidence suggests that while engagement is likely to be approaching saturation (especially on \nFacebook and Instagram), content production does not follow this trend. This may indicate that information \nsources addressing the topic of climate change are encountering difficulties in attracting new individuals to \nparticipate in the online climate discussion. Furthermore, the observed trends could be attributed to several \nfactors, including the different demographics of each social media platform52, changes in the language used to \ndiscuss climate change, or the popularity of new platforms such as TikTok.\nTo investigate whether trends in average engagement reflect shifts in individual participation in the climate \nchange debate, we analyse accounts\u2019 activity patterns. This analysis is essential for evaluating the discussion\u2019s \nability to attract new participants and includes monthly time series data for both unique and new accounts. \nUnique accounts are those posting about climate change in a given month, while new accounts are those \nengaging in the discussion for the first time. Figure\u00a0 3 displays the observed trends, showing a consistent increase \nin the number of unique accounts engaged in the climate discussion across all platforms, despite some monthly \nvariations. Even though some data points indicate a decline, the influx of new accounts suggests sustained interest \nin the topic. The overall growth in terms of unique accounts combined with the presence of new accounts every \nmonth indicates that while engagement may be saturating on some platforms, the climate change issue continues \nto draw new voices, maintaining its relevance and expanding its reach. This being said, it is important to notice \nthe decreasing trends of the new accounts curves on Facebook, Twitter and, to some extent, on Instagram.\nPrevalence of content from unreliable sources\nIn this section, we examine social media engagement with posts referencing URLs to external (i.e. outside of the \nsocial media platform) information sources, distinguishing between those frequently spreading misinformation \nand those deemed reliable. We combine the lists curated by NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check, two \nindependent news rating agencies that assess the credibility and quality of news sources. Our methodology \n(detailed in Methods, see section Matching sources, and common to a number of previous studies18,53) involves \na source-based labelling strategy where posts are categorised as unreliable or reliable based on these assessments. \nIn more detail, unreliable sources are those that have been flagged by NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check for \nfrequently publishing false or misleading information, while reliable sources consistently adhere to journalistic \nstandards and fact-checking protocols. This systematic approach ensures that all content from a flagged \nsource is consistently classified as potentially misleading or trustworthy, aiding in a clearer understanding of \nmisinformation\u2019s role in public discourse. Figure 4 presents a comparative analysis of average engagement for \ncontent from both sources using a static (left hand side) and dynamic (right hand side) perspective.\nUnique Accounts\n3*1046*1049*104\n2018 2020 2022FB Accounts4*1038*10312*103\n2018 20202 022IG Accounts 9*10418*10427*104\n2018 2020 2022TW Accounts\n5*1015*10210*102\n2018 2020 2022YT Accounts\nNew Accounts\n30*103\n20*103\n10*103\n2018 20202 022FB Accounts 60*102\n40*102\n20*102\n2018 20202 022IG Accounts12*104\n80*103\n40*103\n2018 2020 2022TW Accounts34*101\n22*101\n10*101\n2018 2020 2022YT Accounts \nFig. 3 .

The bottom panel \ndisplays the monthly time series of new accounts for Facebook (FB), Instagram (IG), Twitter (TW), and \nY ouTube (YT). By new accounts we refer to those who have never posted content related to climate change \nin the previous months. Finally, above each plot, we find the theoretical trends estimated using the Hodrick-\nPrescott Filter (HP Filter). \nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 6 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nThe bar charts in the left hand side of Fig. 4 show that content linked to unreliable sources receive, on average, \nhigher engagement than content linked to reliable sources on all platforms except Twitter. Possible reasons \nbehind this observation may include the fact that posts relying on unreliable sources are often characterised \nby sensationalistic and provocative nature, or even due to the popularity of certain counter-narratives within \nplatform-specific communities.\nThe comparisons are statistically significant and align with the average engagement values, highlighting \na consistent pattern across platforms. To assess these differences, we performed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests-\nstandard, bootstrapped, and log-transformed-which all yielded highly significant results (p-values <10\u22123). \nThese findings underscore a robust divergence in user engagement with reliable versus unreliable content, thus \noffering a critical perspective on how misinformation competes with factual content on social media platforms \n(see SI for full tables and robustness checks).\nThe bar chart outcomes in Fig. 4 can be partially explained by the different features, algorithms, and user \nbases of each platform. For instance, Y ouTube\u2019s engagement-driven algorithm tends to amplify content that \ntriggers strong emotional responses, while Twitter historically prioritized real-time updates within follower \nnetworks. These design choices influence not only what content is surfaced, but also how users interact with \nit. Although it is difficult to disentangle algorithmic amplification from shifts in user behaviour or platform \npolicies in observational studies, these factors likely interact and co-shape engagement dynamics. Moreover, past \nresearch has shown that false or questionable content often appears more novel or surprising, which may attract \nmore user interaction54. This could help explain the increasing engagement with questionable sources on several \nplatforms. The exception of Twitter, where reliable sources received comparatively more engagement, may relate \nto the platform\u2019s user base. For instance, climate-related discussions on Twitter often involve communities of \nexperts, activists, and journalists, potentially fostering greater interaction with scientifically sound information. \nThese trends may also reflect self-selection effects or norms around information credibility within specific online \ncommunities. similar findings have been found also for general news content which is not climate specific. For \nexample, a study on Facebook found higher level of engagement with unreliable content related to politics55, while \nanalysing Twitter56 has shown substantial difference in the production of engaging content by the pro-vaccine \nanti anti-vaccine groups, the former receiving substantially more engagement. To further investigate the nature \nof engagement across content reliability, we present a set of contrasting examples of climate-related posts labelled \nas either \u201creliable\u201d or \u201cunreliable\u201d across Facebook, Instagram, Y ouTube, and Twitter. While only a small subset \nFig. 4 . Comparison of average engagement between posts from unreliable and reliable sources. The four \nbar charts in the left column show the mean values of bootstrap samples from posts linking to news outlets \nbelonging to two categories: unreliable and reliable. The right column contains regression lines for the four \nplatforms, obtained from time series data of the ratio of posts categorised as unreliable to reliable (upper \npanel), and from the ratio of average interactions with unreliable to reliable (bottom panel). \nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 7 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nof the full dataset, these examples offer insight into the types of narratives that tend to drive user interaction. \nOn Facebook, unreliable content includes claims like \u201cWe\u2019ve been lied to for a long time about climate change. \nEveryone in America needs to see this!\u201d , whereas reliable posts focus on factual summaries such as \u201cscientists \nsay the melting ice in Antarctica is responsible for about one-third of all sea-level rise around the world. \u201d On \nInstagram, unreliable narratives refer to geoengineering as \u201cnot a conspiracy theory but very real indeed\u201d , while \nreliable content emphasizes scientific data, such as the environmental impact of animal agriculture. On Y ouTube, \nunreliable content often takes a confrontational tone-for example, calling Greta Thunberg a \u201cTERRIBLE Role \nModel\u201d-in contrast to reliable posts that highlight scientific innovations like \u201cartificial photosynthesis to fight \nclimate change\u201d . On Twitter, unreliable tweets may simply state \u201cClimate change hoax\u201d whereas reliable ones \nstress scientific consensus, such as declarations of climate emergency signed by thousands of scientists. These \nexamples suggest that posts conveying sensationalist or polarizing narratives-particularly those questioning \nmainstream perspectives or invoking controversy-tend to resonate strongly with users. However, engagement \nis not solely driven by tone or topic. Prior literature highlights the role of structural dynamics such as opinion \npolarization, echo chambers, and filter bubbles in reinforcing users\u2019 preexisting beliefs and preferences10,57,58. \nThese mechanisms likely contribute to the amplification of certain types of content regardless of their factual \naccuracy, shaping how information is consumed and shared on social media.\nThe right column of Fig.\u00a0 4 displays the results of two linear regression analyses. The top right panel shows the \nmonthly ratios of the number of posts linking to unreliable sources relative to those linking to reliable sources, \nwhile the bottom right panel illustrates the monthly ratios of average engagement with posts linking to unreliable \nsources compared to reliable ones. In both cases, time (measured in months) is the independent variable, and \nthe ratio is the dependent variable. The regression lines were estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) \nmethod. The applied regression model is Yt=\u03b20+\u03b21t+\u03b5t, where Yt represents the monthly ratio, \u03b20 is the \nintercept, \u03b21 the slope indicating the temporal trend, and \u03b5t the error term. The resulting trends highlight a \nnumber of relevant dynamics. Overall, we note that the share of posts from unreliable sources with respect to \nthose from reliable ones is approximately 7% thus highlighting a significantly lower production of such kind of \ncontent. In more detail, the intercepts range from \u223c0.05 in the case of Twitter to \u223c0.1 in the case of Y ouTube \nwhile the trends show different slopes ranging from positive to slightly negative values. Conversely, the bottom \nright panel reveals a notable disparity in engagement levels, with unreliable content receiving, on average, 1.2 \ntimes the engagement of its reliable counterparts. The higher average engagement with unreliable content varies \nacross platforms and generally shows a slight increasing trend over time. Detailed regression coefficients are \nprovided in SI (Tables 3 and 4). Note also that, in the case of Y ouTube, we obtained consistent results excluding \nviews in the count of engagement as shown in SI. Despite the lower volume of unreliable content compared to \nreliable sources, its disproportionate impact on user engagement is noteworthy. This counterintuitive dynamic \nhighlights a critical aspect of social media ecosystems: even though unreliable content is less prevalent in terms \nof volume, it often obtains significantly more user engagement.\nHashtags used by sources spreading unreliable and reliable information\nAfter outlining the general dynamics of the climate change discussion, we now focus on how specific concepts \nare treated within unreliable and reliable posts in order to highlight differences and similarities in their respective \ndiscourses. According to previous literature24,59\u201361, we operate under the premise that hashtags significantly \nencapsulate posts\u2019 key aspects and therefore provide a compact way to analyse topics62. We first identify the most \nfrequently used hashtags in posts labelled as either unreliable or reliable and compute their relative difference i.e., \nthe difference between the relative frequency in each of the two categories in order to understand the importance \nwith respect to the two sides. For an general overview of hashtags usage on the four platforms please refer to SI \n(Overview of hashtag usage section).\nFigure 5 shows the difference between the relative frequencies normalised over the set made up of the twelve \nmost used hashtags appearing in posts sourced by either unreliable or reliable accounts, aggregated over time. \nThis analysis focuses on how these hashtags are utilised in posts from each source category, highlighting the \ndistinctions in thematic engagement. In some cases, the top twelve hashtags were common between unreliable \nand reliable posts, as shown in magenta. The analysis indicates that accounts posting information from unreliable \nsources tend to focus on hashtags that align with narratives often seen as controversial or denying mainstream \nscientific consensus63. For example, hashtags such as #climatehoax are prominent in content shared by unreliable \nsources, reflecting a tendency to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change. Conversely, reliable \nsources frequently use hashtags related to scientific discussions and global events such as #cop26, #cop27, and \n#actionclimate, emphasising their alignment with established scientific perspectives and international efforts \nto address climate change. In this context, Instagram shows a relatively different behaviour having hashtags \nappearing in posts linking to unreliable sources mostly related to the vegan community, and a group of hashtags \nappearing in posts linking to reliable sources having some geographic resolution. Exception made for Instagram, \nsimilar discussion themes have been observed in previous research on climate communication online1. The \ndifference in hashtag use suggests that accounts that are more likely to engage with unreliable sources, employ \na lexicon, in terms of hashtags, that may reinforce sceptical views on climate change. Conversely, accounts that \nemploy reliable sources, present content that supports and promotes scientific and global consensus on the issue. \nThis divergence in hashtags usage underscores the broader polarisation in how climate change is discussed and \nperceived across different segments of social media users.\nAfter showing which hashtags are the most representative for each kind of content we attempt at estimating \ntheir separation in the public debate using network analysis. In more detail, we build up four undirected co-\noccurrence networks (one per each social media platform) using hashtags as nodes and co-occurrence of \nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 8 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nhashtags in posts as links. In these networks, the weight of a link corresponds to the number of times two \nhashtags co-occurred in posts. The networks are sparse (that is the number of links is much lower with \nrespect to its maximum) and they are made up of {680,280; 569,962; 449,182; 19,431} nodes and {10,766,970; \n13,703,602; 3,399,321; 517,121} links for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Y ouTube respectively. The resulting \nnetworks are not made up of a single connected component and therefore we extract their largest connected \ncomponents which are made up of about {93%, 98%, 91%, 91%} original nodes respectively. Operating on the \nlargest connected components, we compute the shortest paths among labelled hashtags in order to quantify their \nseparation in the network and therefore the tendency to be used in different contexts. Hashtags were labelled as \neither unreliable or reliable based on the difference of their relative frequency in posts by unreliable and reliable \nsources. Specifically, after standardising the differences between relative frequencies, we labelled as unreliable \nhashtags having a z-score of standardised relative differences lower than -3 (indicating significant occurrence \nin unreliable posts), and reliable those with a z-score greater than +3. A more formal explanation is provided in \nMethods (see Network construction and hashtag labelling Section).\nTable 4 provides values of the average shortest path distances between hashtags classified as \u201creliable\u201d and \n\u201cunreliable\u201d on the four different social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Y ouTube. These \nvalues represent the average separation between hashtags of these categories in the co-occurrence networks \nconstructed for each platform.\nOn Facebook, reliable hashtags tend to be very close to each other, indicating that they are often used \ntogether. In contrast, unreliable hashtags show a greater average distance (5.44 steps), suggesting less coherence \nand density in their usage. The distance between reliable and unreliable hashtags is intermediate (3.78 steps), \nindicating some interaction but with significant separation, very similar to the overall distance between the \nnodes of the network. The high standard deviation for lqq and lrq highlights considerable variability in the \njoint usage of these hashtags. On Instagram distances between labelled hashtags are, on average, consistent \nacross classes ( \u223c 2 steps) and lower with respect to the average distances, thus indicating their proximity in the \nnetwork. The uniformity of such results could be due to a relatively poor identification of hashtags belonging to \nsuch categories, as discussed with respect to Fig. 5. On Twitter, reliable hashtags are also very close to each other \n(1.95 steps). unreliable hashtags are relatively more distant (2.38 steps), but less fragmented than in the Facebook Fig. 5 . The panel displays the top 12 hashtags with the highest relative frequencies for content referencing both \nreliable and unreliable sources on FB, IG, TW , and YT respectively. The bars represent the difference between \nthe relative frequencies calculated on the top 12 hashtags used in reliable and unreliable content. In red and \nblue, we have those hashtags mentioned above in unreliable and reliable content, respectively. The magenta \nlabels underline those hashtags that are present in the top 12 of both reliable and unreliable categories. Rank \nhighlights the position in term of relative frequency difference among reliable and unreliable hashtags. \nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 9 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9www.nature.com/scientificreports/\ncase (also considering the average length of shortest paths in the network). The distance between reliable \nand unreliable hashtags is the smallest among the three platforms (2.14 steps), suggesting greater interaction \nbetween the two groups on Twitter compared to Facebook and Y ouTube. The standard deviation is lower than on \nFacebook, indicating more uniform distances. On Y ouTube, reliable hashtags have the shortest average distance \n(1.93 steps), similarly to Facebook and Twitter while unreliable hashtags show the highest average distance (7.24 \nsteps), indicating significant dispersion. The distance between reliable and unreliable hashtags is also quite high \n(4.71 steps), suggesting a clear separation between the two groups. The large variability in distances ( lqq and lrq) \nindicates a very heterogeneous use of hashtags on Y ouTube. These results suggest that reliable hashtags tend to \nform cohesive clusters, possibly reflecting a more organized online community built around shared and verified \ninformation sources. This behaviour is consistent with prior work that highlights the formation of echo chambers \nin which reliable information circulates within homogeneously connected users10. Conversely, the dispersion \nof unreliable hashtags may be indicative of more fragmented communication around misinformation-related \nnarratives. Consequently, the use of questionable hashtags can create small and relatively isolated clusters, each \npresenting its own perspective regarding climate change and related events, which aligns with recent studies \nhighlighting the heterogeneous and uncoordinated nature of misinformation dynamics64. In summary, we note \nthat reliable hashtags tend to cluster closely together across all platforms, while unreliable hashtags are more \ndispersed and variable indicating a higher fragmentation in their use.\nConclusions\nOur analysis of the climate change discourse on social media platforms reveals intricate dynamics of user \nengagement, thematic developments through hashtags, and the challenging interplay between information \nspread by reliable unreliable sources. With the aim to explicitly focus on climate change misinformation to \ninform evidence-based policy interventions and improve climate communication, we find that engagement \nspikes significantly during major global events (Climate Action Week, Fridays for Future, and COP summits), \nunderscoring the role of social media as a pivotal platform for climate activism and discussion. This enhanced \nengagement may promote extensive information dissemination and drive public participation in climate-related \ninitiatives.\nOur research highlights a consistent rise in climate change-related content across four different mainstream \nplatforms that are likely to contain the majority of online climate discussions, although the nature and \nengagement trends vary markedly. This variability reflects the distinct roles that these platforms play in \nfacilitating discussions on climate issues. For instance, we observed differences in engagement, likely influenced \nby platform-specific characteristics, such as user demographics or content formats. The decline in engagement \non Facebook, for example, may be linked to its longevity and older user base65, while each platform\u2019s audience \nand content format influence the patterns we observe. For instance, younger audiences on Y ouTube may engage \nmore with sensationalist content, while Twitter\u2019s retweets and trending hashtags create a different form of \nviral content amplification. These differences are not solely demographic. Platform-specific affordances-such \nas Twitter\u2019s character limit and retweet functionality, Y ouTube\u2019s algorithmic promotion of engaging videos, or \nInstagram\u2019s emphasis on visual storytelling-may also shape the type of content that circulates and how users \ninteract with it. For instance, polarizing posts may gain traction more easily on Twitter due to its trend-based \nstructure and amplification mechanisms, while sensationalist videos may thrive on Y ouTube7,10. Moreover, the \ndifferent role of hashtags across platforms-more integrated and frequent on Twitter, less so on Facebook- may \nfurther influence the visibility and engagement with specific narratives. Identifying these different trends across \nplatforms is important given that existing research has been largely platform specific, preventing a comparative \nanalysis2.\nA critical point of our study is the significant engagement with content from unreliable sources and its \nincreasing trends compared to content from reliable ones, particularly on platforms like Facebook. This issue is \nalso substantiated by a clear separation in the topics treated within posts referring to unreliable versus reliable \ninformation sources. This analysis is important given that most existing research on climate communication \nhas not focused specifically on climate misinformation41, and most studies of social media misinformation in \ngeneral focus on political misinformation or Covid-19 misinformation4,30,66.\nBeyond the presence of potential confounding factors, which we tried to mitigate through robustness checks \nand extra statistical analysis, our study has limitations due to data accessibility67. This is particularly true for \nTwitter, where restricted data availability, due to the academic API shutdown, limited the time frame of our \nanalysis. Relatedly, in selecting platforms, we chose mainstream social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, \nTwitter, and Y ouTube due to their widespread use and established presence in the literature. We excluded \nplatforms such as TikTok and Reddit, either due to data unavailability at the time of collection or the lack of \nsubstantial data volume on climate change.

Also \nplatform differences and keywords selection could represent a potential limitation in terms of representativeness \nof diverse groups of users68. Similarly, the use of a source-based approach and the combination of two different \nsources10,53,69 for identifying unreliable and reliable accounts could hinder the study from providing a complete \npicture regarding engagement with misinformation. We strongly encourage future work to look at a broader set \nof social media platforms where possible, including emerging platforms which cater to different demographic \ngroups of specific political communities, but we note that researchers should not lose sight of the important \ninterdependencies between established and emerging social media platforms70.\nThat being acknowledged, our study underscores the profound impact of social media in monitoring \nperceptions and discussions about climate change, highlighting the need of both fostering informed discourse \nand countering misinformation. Future works should focus on entering the debate in greater detail by tackling \nspecific themes, targeting specific pages, and possibly comparing mainstream social media platforms with \nalternative ones. A broader analysis across diverse social media ecosystems and topics, incorporating both \ntraditional and emerging platforms, would be therefore valuable for future studies. In this context, developing \nmechanisms and policies to strengthen the reliability of information and engage diverse audiences effectively \nwill be crucial in leveraging social media\u2019s capacity to support global climate initiatives in this digitally \ninterconnected era.\nMethodology\nData collection\nThe data collection process is tailored according to the characteristics of the four different platforms. In \ngeneral, we performed keyword search to identify relevant social media content. For Facebook, Instagram, \nand Y ouTube, the keywords used to capture discussions related to climate change are: { climate change, climate \ncrisis, climate emergency, global warming }. Due to unavailability of the Twitter API for academics after the Elon \nMusk acquisition we had to resort to an available dataset retrieved using only the keyword: { climate change }. We \ncollected the Facebook and Instagram datasets using CrowdTangle, a Meta owned archive which grants access \nto posts (and their engagement) from 7M+ pages, groups, and verified profiles in the case of Facebook, and \n2M+ public accounts in the case of Instagram. In more detail, the archive includes: all public Facebook pages \nwith more than 50K likes, all public Facebook groups with 95k+ members, all US-based public groups with 2k+ \nmembers, and all verified profiles; all public Instagram accounts with more than 50K followers, as well as all \nverified accounts. More details are provided at  h t t p s :  / / h  e l p  . c r o w d  t a n g l e  . c o m /  e n /  a r t  i c l e s /  4 2 0 1 9 4  0 - a  b o u t - u s. For \nY ouTube, we collected a large sample of video videos and their engagement data using the Y ouTube Data API v3, \nspecifically searching for videos that match our keywords and crawling the relevant related videos. In the case \nof Twitter, we gathered tweets and user information using the official Twitter API in 2022, prior to Elon Musk\u2019s \ntakeover of the platform. The API is no longer available to researchers free of charge. It is important to note \nthat the search query on Twitter was more limited compared to the other platforms, as previously mentioned. \nAnother distinction between Facebook, Instagram, Y ouTube, and Twitter is the observation period. Data from \nthe first three social media platforms range from January 2018 to December 2022. The time window for Twitter \nlasts four-years ending in December 2021. Table 1 provides a data breakdown.\nInterrupted time series\nThe interrupted time series (ITS) approach is a widely used method for evaluating the impact of an event or \nintervention on a time-dependent variable. This method models the data as a time series before and after the \nevent, allowing for the identification of structural changes in the trend following the event. Unlike simple pre-\npost comparisons, ITS accounts for underlying temporal dynamics, distinguishing between immediate effects \nand longer-term changes. ITS is commonly applied in various fields, including public health, economics, policy \nevaluation, and environmental science71\u201373.\nWe explored different specifications for modelling engagement dynamics as show in Table 5. Model \ncomparisons using ANOV A74, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)75, and Bayesian Information Criterion \n(BIC)76 confirmed that a quadratic time trend significantly improved model fit, capturing non-linear engagement \ntrajectories77.\nThe final ITS model is specified as follows:\n Yt=\u03b20+\u03b21T+\u03b22T2+\u03b23D1+\u03b24D2+\u03b25(T\u00d7D1)+\u03b26(T\u00d7D2)+\u03f5t (1)\nwhere Yt represents engagement at time t, T is the time variable, and T2 is its quadratic term. The dummy \nvariables D1 and D2 indicate the post-event periods for the first and second events, respectively. The interaction Criterion Linear model Quadratic model\nAIC 2020.861 1998.047\nBIC 2035.521 2014.802\nANOV A (F, p) \u2013 F = 27.15, p<0.001\nTable 5 . Comparison between the linear and quadratic models. The quadratic model shows lower AIC and \nBIC values, and the ANOV A test confirms a significantly better fit ( p<0.001 ), indicating that the inclusion of \na quadratic term improves model performance. \nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 11 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nterms T\u00d7D1 and T\u00d7D2 capture long-term changes in engagement after each event. Finally, \u03f5t represents the \nerror term.\nHodrick-Prescott filter\nThe Hodrick-Prescott filter is a statistical method commonly employed in economics and finance to analyse \neconomic time series, especially when they display non-stationary behaviour and to identify cyclical \nvariation78\u201380. It is used to decompose the time series into two main components: the long-term trend and the \nshort-term cyclical component.\nThe mathematical equation for the Hodrick-Prescott filter is :\n yt=\u03c4t+ct, (2)\nwhile the function to be optimised is:\n min\n\u03c4tT\u2211\nt=1(yt\u2212\u03c4t)2+\u03bbT\u22121\u2211\nt=2[\n(\u03c4t+1\u22122\u03c4t+\u03c4t\u22121)2]\n. (3)\nThe equation represents the minimisation problem to obtain the decomposition of the time series yt into \ntwo components: the trend \u03c4t and the cyclical component ct. The first term \u2211T\nt=1(yt\u2212\u03c4t)2 measures the \nadherence of the trend component to the original data. The second term \u03bb\u2211T\u22121\nt=2[(\u03c4t+1\u2212\u03c4t)\u2212(\u03c4t\u2212\u03c4t\u22121)]2 \npenalises excessive variations in the trend over time, where \u03bb is the smoothing parameter controlling the relative \nimportance of the two terms in the objective function.\nMatching sources\nIn order to assign reliability labels to content we combine the classification of web pages provided by two \nindependent agencies that assess the credibility of news sources, namely NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check \n(MBFC).\nNewsGuard employs a team of highly experienced journalists and editors to analyse sites that publish news \nand information, providing ratings and reliability scores based on nine journalistic criteria. These criteria \npertain to the basic standards of credibility and transparency in journalism. Each criterion is assigned a certain \nscore, and the total, ranging from 0 to 100, represents the site\u2019s overall reliability. This score is also reported as \na percentage. It indicates the extent to which the site meets the various criteria. Each site is accompanied by an \ninformation sheet, accessible by clicking on the score, which details the reasons for NewsGuard\u2019s assessment. \nGenerally, a score above 60 indicates trustworthiness.\nMBFC assigns a qualitative (non-numerical) rating for each news and commentary site, placing them on \nthe political spectrum from left to right. The scale includes values such as \u2018extreme left\u2019 , \u2018leaning left\u2019 , \u2018center-\nleft\u2019 , \u2018poorly biased\u2019 , \u2018leaning center-right\u2019 , \u2018leaning right\u2019 and \u2018extreme right\u2019 . Additionally, a second rating on \nthe accuracy and impartial objectivity of the published content is assigned, with values like \u2018very high\u2019 , \u2018high\u2019 , \n\u2018mostly factual\u2019 , \u2018mixed\u2019 , \u2018low\u2019 , and \u2018very low\u2019 . Furthermore, MBFC provides extra labels for certain source \nincluding \u201cunreliable\u201d and \u201cConspiracy/Pseudo-Science\u201d . According to the MBFC\u2019s website: \u201c A unreliable source \nexhibits one or more of the following: extreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or \nno sourcing to credible information, a complete lack of transparency, and/or is fake news. [...] Sources listed in \nthe unreliable Category may be very untrustworthy and should be fact-checked on a per-article basis\u201d . While a \n\u201cConspiracy/Pseudo-Science\u201d: \u201cThis category is for sources that disseminate unverified information related to \nknown conspiracies or pseudoscientific claims. For instance, sources denying human-influenced climate change \nor promoting anti-vaccination stances are labelled as pseudoscience. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia \nof Philosophy on Science and Pseudoscience, there\u2019s a consensus among knowledge disciplines that certain \ntopics, like creationism and climate change denial, are pseudosciences. To be included in this category, a source\u2019s \nprimary focus must be on conspiracies or pseudoscience. \u201d81.\nUsing the classifications from both organisations, we assigned a dichotomous label (either reliable or \nunreliable) to each source employing both the score assigned by NewsGuard (if <60 the source was considered \nunreliable otherwise reliable) and the label from MBFC (if equals to one on the following factuality labels {\u2018mixed\u2019 , \n\u2018low\u2019 , and \u2018very low\u2019} the source was considered unreliable otherwise reliable). This procedure is consistent with \nthe guidelines of the two agencies where in the case of NewsGuard the official website states: \u201cThe language that \nintroduces and summarizes each website\u2019s score varies, depending on the score, as follows: 100 \u2013 High Credibility: \nThis website adheres to all nine standards of credibility and transparency. 75\u201399 \u2013 Generally Credible: This \nwebsite mostly adheres to basic standards of credibility and transparency. 60-74 \u2013 Credible with Exceptions: This \nwebsite generally maintains basic standards of credibility and transparency-with significant exceptions. 40\u201359 \u2013 \nProceed with Caution: This website is unreliable because it fails to adhere to several basic journalistic standards. \n0-39 Proceed with Maximum Caution: This website is unreliable because it severely violates basic journalistic \nstandards\u201d82. We used NewsGuard scores as the primary source for categorizing outlets, and for those domains \nnot listed in the NewsGuard database, we incorporated ratings from MBFC. According to our procedure, an \noutlet was labelled as \u201cunreliable\u201d if it received a score below 60 from NewsGuard. If an outlet was not included \nin the NewsGuard dataset, we used the MBFC rating and, consistently with previous work10, we classified it as \nunreliable if it received the \u201cunreliable\u201d label by MBFC itself or if it was marked as either \u201clow\u201d or \u201cvery low\u201d \nin terms of accuracy and impartial objectivity or if it was labelled as \u201cConspiracy/Pseudo-Science\u201d and had a \nScientific Reports  |        (2025) 15:18629 12 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03082-9www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nlabel lower than or equal to \u201cmixed\u201d . More details, regarding the categorized domains and the matching between \nsources are available in SI.\nThis approach allowed us to encompass a broader range of sources compared to individual companies, \nthereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our classification. For labelling Facebook posts, we focus on \ncontent posted by Pages, Groups, and Verified Profiles that include URLs linking to external websites that, when \ndecompressed, point to a domain among those labelled by either NewsGuard or MBFC. We followed a different \nprocedure for Instagram, Twitter, and Y ouTube. We extracted URLs referring to external websites from the text, \nimage, or video descriptions, depending on the platform. After collecting all the URL links present in the text, \nwe expanded the compressed ones. This enabled us to cross-reference the domains of the extracted links with \nour dataset containing reliability and unreliability classifications of the sources.\nNetwork construction and hashtag labelling\nWe start with a graph G=(V,E), where V represents the set of nodes n and E represents the set of m edges \nconnecting pairs of nodes. Specifically, nodes represent hashtags, and connections are determined by the number \nof times two hashtags appear together in the same post. The links w(i,j) indicate the connection strength (i.e. \nthe number of co-occurrences) between nodes i and j, making our network weighted. We denote our weighted \nnetwork as N=(V,W), where the matrix W is our adjacency matrix containing the weights of the links wi,j.\nWe calculate the relative frequency of hashtags, specifically the frequency with which hashtags appear in \nreliable and unreliable posts respectively, normalised by the total number of hashtags in reliable or unreliable \ncategories. The relative frequency fh,c of a hashtag h in category c( either reliable or unreliable) is calculated as:\n fh,c=count of hashtag hin category c\ntotal count of all hashtags in category c\n\u00a0.\nTo label hashtags as either unreliable or reliable, we calculate the z-score of each hashtag. The z-score zh is \ncomputed as follows:\n zh=dh\u2212\u00b5d\n\u03c3d\nwhere dh=fh,reliable \u2212fh,unreliable  is the difference in relative frequencies of the hashtag h between the \nreliable and unreliable categories, \u00b5d is the mean of these differences for all hashtags, and \u03c3d is the standard \ndeviation of these differences.\nBy computing these metrics, we can effectively categorize hashtags and analyse their distribution within \ndifferent content reliability categories.\nData availability\nThe datasets generated during and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding au -\nthor on reasonable request.\nReceived: 23 July 2024; Accepted: 19 May 2025\nReferences\n 1.

As Gates (2017)  \nreported, the latest report of the LGBT \npopulation in the United States increases from  \n3,5% in 2012 to 4,1% in 2016  (p. 1221) . The development may increase from time to time. \nThis increase might be possible because of the \nstruggle of LGBT through some mo vements in \nthe United States.  \nHistorically, the first case of the same -sex \nactivity happened in the United States in 1566, \nreceiving a death sentence, as same -sex was Article i nformation  \nReceived: 24 January , 2020  \nRevised:  7 February, 2020  \nAccepted: 21 February, 2020   \nRUBIKON Volume 7/ Number 1  \nFebruary 2020  \n36 banned by law and traditional custom (Morris, \n2009). Moreover, the United States military  \nalso contributed to eliminating the LGBT \npopulation. The United States military began \nto discharging lesbians and gays then \nprevented them from serving, damaging their \nability to obtain civilian employment \n(Morrow, 2001, p. 156).  \nHowever, LGBT in the Unit ed States \nbegan to show their sexual identity in the early \n20th century. Morris (2009) states that, with the \nrise of blues music in the early 1920s, African \nAmerican women showcased varieties of \nlesbian desire, struggle, and humor; these \nperformances and m ale and female drag stars \nled to the introduction of gay bars in the \nUnited States. Since the population of LGBT \nstarted to increase, the organizations which \nsupport LGBT as an oppressed cultural \nminority also began to establish.  \nSome popular organizations  were \nsupporting the LGBT community during that \ntime. Some of them were Mattachine Society -\n\u2014founded in 1950 by Harry Hay and Chuck \nRowland, One, Inc. \u2014founded in 1952, and the \nfirst lesbian support network named Daughters \nof Bilitis \u2014founded in 1955 by Phyl lis Lyon \nand Del Martin (Morris, 2009). Those \norganizations worked to support and give \nsafety to the LGBT community, which faced \nprejudices and discriminations.  \nBronski (2011)  claims hatred towards \nLGBT was at its peak in the 1960s. There were \nphysical harassment, psychiatric lockup as \nwell as jail, losing jobs  (p. 21 -22). Moreover, \nit worsened when the American Psychiatric \nAssociation defined LGBT as mentally sick, \ncriminal, a nd immoral. However, the Civil \nRights Movement that began in the 1960s gave \nhope to LGBT as part of the minorities in the United States. Therefore, the Civil Rights \nMovement became the beginning of other \nmovements. The independence of the LGBT \ncommunity wa s further strengthened by the \nexistence of the Stonewall Riots.  \nNelson (2015)  states that The Stonewall \nRiot, which occurred in 1969, was the origin \nfor the stand against oppression in the LGBT; \nLGBT and their supporters rallied and \nprotested for equal rig hts by forming \norganizations hosting public demonstrations. \nStonewall Riot was perhaps the most \nsignificant movement in fighting for the rights \nof LGBT in the United States  (p. 21) . Morrow \n(2001) claims that it was the first time LGBT \nrose against police o ppression and became \nactively resistant to institutionalized anti -\nLGBT violence (p. 160). Through this \nmovement, LGBT became more struggling to \nvoice their rights for equality in the United \nStates. Furthermore, Stonewall Riot also led to \nthe emergence of Gay Pride,  held in June \nevery year in the United States (Nelson, 2015, \np. 23).  \nLGBT started to be accepted gradually \nafter the involvement of politicians. Morris \n(2009) claims that LGBT began to get \napproval by the United States after the first out \nGay mini ster was ordained by the United \nChurch of Christ in 1972. Since a more \npowerful person turned out to be Gay, people \nstarted to be less discriminating against LGBT \nat that time. Furthermore, Waites and Kollman \n(2009) also argue that since gay and lesbian \nmovements in the United States happened in \nthe 1960s, the LGBT community became more \nopen about their identity and started to \nstruggle more for their rights (p. 2).  \nFurthermore, LGBT is not a single group. \nLGBT consists of people with different sexual \nAprilya Indah R. & Dewi Haryani Susilastuti \u2013 Different  Types of \nStereotypes toward LGBT as Minority on American Online News  \n \n37 orient ations. Some people are openly gay or \nlesbian, while there are also those who are in \nthe closet. Kushnick (2010) explains that the \nterm \u2017in the closet\u2018 used since the late of 1960s \nwhich originally refers to a small private room \n(p. 678). This idea means t o the sense of \nhiding a fact or keeping a secret about \nsomething. Therefore, a person who is hiding \nthe fact that they are gay or lesbian has been \ndescribed as \u2017in the closet.\u2018 People who are \nopenly lesbian or gay and those who are \u2017in \nthe closet\u2018 would ex perience different \ntreatment and challenges. It also occurs in \nbisexual and transgender people. Moreover, \nthe social class would also affect the treatment \nexperienced by LGBT within society . \nThe existence of prejudices toward LGBT \nin the United States even  though there were \nmany movements that happened throughout \nthe decades. Many supports raise awareness \nthat LGBT still became an issue that might be \ndifficult to be eliminated. Thus from the \nresearch background, the researcher analyzes \nLGBT stereotypes in t he United States by \napplying the stereotype theory by Henry \nTajfeil. The researcher uses some selected \nstereotypes which appear in American online \nnews: The New York Times, Washington Post, \nand USA Today. These news portals are \nchosen due to their high lev el of factual \nreporting, generally trustworthy for \ninformation, and have a good reputation in \nWorld Press Rank (Media Bias/Fact Check, \n2019). Moreover, the researcher chooses news \nin online newspaper throughout 2019 -2020 in \norder to indicate the latest new s in the United \nStates and also consi dering the availability of \ndata. \nIn addition, the researcher also analyzes \nthe difference of stereotypes toward Lesbian, \nGay, Bisexual, and Transgender. Thus, this research asserts that stereotypes against \nLesbian, Gay,  Bisexual, and Transgender are \nway too different one and other even though \nLGBT is considered a single unity minor \ncommunity.  \nIn doing the analysis, this research utilizes \nthe Post -nationalist American Studies \nparadigm, which concerns cross -cultural \ncommunication, race and gender, global and \nlocal identities, and the complex tensions \nbetween symbolic and political economies \n(Rowe, 2000). It means that this particular \nparadigm discusses the minority issues in \nAmerican society, which may deal with racia l, \ngender, and other minor issues in the United \nStates. Thus, under Post -nationalist American \nStudies, this research is no longer celebrates \nAmerican myths since it discusses LGBT as a \nproblematic minority issue in the current \nAmerican society . \nFurthermore , the researcher uses a \nsociological approach, which specifically is \nthe gender socialization approach. Gender \nsocialization aims to determine how and why \nmales and females act differently, and the \nsocialization process begins at birth (Carter, \n2014, p. 24 4). Therefore, everyone is taught to \naccept their gender roles and sexuality. Based \non gender roles, a male is expected to be \nmasculine while a female is expected to be \nfeminine. Due to gender socialization, society \nexpected people to appear and behave bas ed \non their gender roles and sexuality. However, \nminorities, like LGBT, mostly do not appear \nand act based on gender socialization. Thus, \nthis research discusses LGBT stereotypes in \nthe United States which appear on American \nonline news: The New York Times , The \nWashington Post, and USA Today . \nRUBIKON Volume 7/ Number 1  \nFebruary 2020  \n38 In this research, in order to examine \nLGBT stereotypes in the United States, it is \nessential to understand the stereotype theory. \nMark and Ko (2019) state that stereotypes \nrefer to beliefs about the attributes and \nbeha viors of individuals and or groups (p. 2). \nMoreover, Tajfel (1963) adds that \u2015the less \nspecific information one has about an \nindividual, the greater will be the tendency to \nassign to him the characteristics which are \nassumed to be those of his group\u2016 (p. 1 2). \nTherefore, stereotypes can be wrong. Tajfel \n(1963) reveals that through stereotypes, people \ncharacterized human groups; these \ncharacterizations might stable for long periods \nof time or tend to change to some extent as \nfunctions of social, political, an d economic \nchanges (p. 4 -5). For example, the stereotype \nof women as weak and uneducated back then, \nbut as technology develops, many educated \nwomen have successfu l careers.  \nAccording to Tajfel (1963), the stereotype \nis divided into two categories; neutral \nstereotypes and prejudiced stereotyping (p. 8). \nIn other words, the types of stereotypes are \nboth positive and negative stereotypes. Tajfel \n(1963) claims that neutral stereotypes have no \nemotional involvement; it represents no more \nthan a moderately useful  classifying device for \nlack of anything better to rely on (p. 12). For \nexample, when a White has no bias toward \nother Whites in public places in the United \nStates. In contrast, prejudiced stereotyping \nhappens when a person or group of people \nlabeling othe rs with negative characteristics. In \nhis study, Tajfeil (1963) gives an example of \ndiscriminatory stereotyping; in some American \nexperiments, it has been shown that groups of \nAmericans have less positive stereotypes \ntoward Negroes when they are presented w ith \na series of photographs of Negroes and whites \n(p. 9). Thus, the neutral stereotype would have no impact while, in contrast, prejudiced \nstereotyping would bring adverse effects, \nwhich might lead to discrimination.  \nThis research then uses qualitative as the \nmethod with descriptive type research. \nAccording to Jackson (1995), qualitative \nresearch asserts verbal description and \nexplanations of human behavior. The \nresearcher uses descriptive type research on \ndescribing the findings to get the accurate \ndepicti on of a population since the aims of \ndescriptive research is to describe in order to \nmake estimations about some populations (p. \n18). It means that qualitative research is \nconducted based on descriptive data and it \nfurther relies on the researcher\u2018s interp retation \nof the data.  \nMoreover, in conducting this research, it \nneeds data sources divided into two; primary \nand secondary sources. The primary sources \nare American online news articles from The \nNew York Times, The Washington Post, and \nUSA Today throughout  2019 -2020, which \ncontain stereotypes toward LGBT in the \nUnited States. The secondary sources are taken \nfrom other printed and unprinted references \nfrom international journal research, books, \nwebsites, and electronic books which related \nto the topic of dis cussion . \nDISCUSSION  \nIn order to discuss the differences of \nstereotype toward  LGBT in the United States \nand examining the reason of it, the researcher \ninvestigates the stereotypes toward Lesbian, \nGay, Bisexual, and Transgender which \nfeatured on selected American online news. \nThus, the findings and discussion part, is \nclassified into  four parts: Lesbian stereotypes, \nGay stereotypes, Bisexual stereotypes, and \nTransgender stereotypes. Furthermore, the \nAprilya Indah R. & Dewi Haryani Susilastuti \u2013 Different  Types of \nStereotypes toward LGBT as Minority on American Online News  \n \n39 researcher explores the differences of \nstereotypes toward LGBT in the United States . \nLesbian Stereotypes on American Online \nNews  \nLesbians  are usually stereotyped as \nstraight -forward. The context of straight -\nforward means that being too honest and direct \nin stating what their thought (Bull, 2008). In \ndiscussing the stereotype of lesbians, they are \noften depicted as straight -forward. For \ninstance, it is characterized by Santana Lopez \non the American television series Glee \u2014an \nAmerican popular television series tells about \na group of high school students who try to \nescape from the harsh realities by joining a \nchoir club  (IMDb, 2009).  \nIn the seri es, Santana came out as a \nlesbian after one of her classmates knew that \nshe is a lesbian. Through the series, the \ncharacter of Santana is depicted as a mean \nstraight -forward girl. The depiction of the \nsurface of Santana Lopez on Glee as a straight -\nforward who is not afraid to admit her \nsexuality as a lesbian inspires a lot of people. \nAs The Washington Post (2020) illustrates, \n\u2015For many young fans of Glee, Santana served \nas a role model not in the traditional sense \u2014 \nher wit, while admirably sharp, was often  \nweaponized \u2013 but because her on -screen \nexploration of identity validated their own.\u2016 \nThrough the news article, Santana is a lesbian \nhigh school student who does not feel afraid to \nadmit her sexuality; also, she is not scared of \nbeing ostracized by her sur rounding \nenvironment . \nFurthermore, it shows that, in American \nsociety, especially on online media, lesbians \nare often labeled as bold or straight -forward \ncharacters with less respect or awareness \ntoward their surroundings. By deeply looking at this news ar ticle, the analysis of Santana's \ncharacter on Glee resembles this stereotype of \nlesbian, has already been embedded as part of \nthe characteristic of lesbian in the United \nStates. Then, The Washington Post compares \nthe existence of this particular stereotype  in \nthe current American society . \nBesides straight -forward, one of the most \nnotable stereotypes of lesbians in American \nsociety is good in sports, the field that is \nusually related to men. In this case, women's \nsoccer has gained a lot of attention and \npopu larity in American society. In fact, in \ncontrast to the American men's soccer team, \nthe American women's soccer team dominates \ninternational competitions by winning the \nFIFA Women World Cup several times (The \nNew York Times, 2019). Uniquely, the \nmembers of  the women soccer team in the \nUnited States are dominated by lesbian and \nbisexual females . \nLesbians are stereotyped as a good athlete \nbecause lesbians are usually considered more \nmasculine rather than heterosexual women. \nThese stereotypes are proven by res earch focus \non lesbian stereotypes. Research conducted by \nGeiger, Harwood, and Hummert (2006) \nindicates that lesbian stereotypes are athletic, \npowerful, and explicitly masculine (p. 171). \nThese studies as facts of supporting \nstereotypes toward lesbians as featured in the \nnews article. The discussion of this particular \nstereotype toward lesbians in American \nsociety shows that lesbian women are often \nlabeled as \u2015more masculine than heterosexual \nwomen.\u2016 As The New York Times \nhighlighting this issue on its medi a platform, it \nreveals that this type of stereotype does exist \nin the current American society . \n \nRUBIKON Volume 7/ Number 1  \nFebruary 2020  \n40 Gay Stereotypes on American Online News  \nGay as part of a minority in the United \nStates is usually stereotyped as full of \nempathy. It means that gay people are \nconsidered as more understanding and \nrespecting toward other people compared to \nheterosexuals. Moreover, as part of the \nminorities, gay has surely experienced some \ndifficulties and challenges which make them \nfeel empathy toward their community, in this \ncase, other gay people. Therefore, gay would \nconcern other minorities and more respecting \npeople due to their identical situation in the \nmiddle of American society . \nPete Buttigieg was a candidate for the \nnomination in the 2020 United States \npresidential election. Pete Buttigieg started his \npresidential campaign in 2019. Based on The \nNew York Times (2020), he is known as gay, \nwhich made him the first United States gay \npresidential candidate. He gained some \nsupports from his supporters, which mostly \ncame from the minorities, especially from the \nLGBT community. It was shown through \nsupport by his supporters during his campaign. \nEven some supporters approached him at his \ncampaign events while crying. Buttigieg\u2018s \nsupporters believe that the fact of him as gay \nmaking him more approachable and more \nconcerned about minorities in the United \nStates. As The New York Times (2020) states : \nButtigieg\u2018s sexual orientation can be \nwoven into his personal narrative to \npowerful effect, humanizing him, making \nhim more approachable rather than less, \nforging a bridge to other minorities, \nestablishing a familiarity with struggle \nand thus a capacity for empathy . \nThe discussion surrounding the st ereotype \nof gay figures like Pete Buttigieg as full of \nempathy can be seen on the New York Times article above. It shows that American online \nmedia often emphasizes the discussion toward \nthe sexual orientation of political figure as a \nstereotype in which i t resembles that Pete \nButtigieg is able to represent the voice of \nLGBT and other minorities in American stage \nof politics . \nOther than being stereotyped as full of \nempathy, gay is also stereotyped as a sensible \nperson who represented on American online \nnews . The researchers of UW News (2017) \nfound that gay participants who were married \nreported have better physical and mental \nhealth. In short, homosexual marriage gives a \nhigher level of satisfaction and happiness \nrather than heterosexual marriage. In order t o \ninvestigate about homosexual marriage, The \nNew York Times (2020) interviewed their gay \nreaders to reveal about th e dynamics of gay \nrelationship:  \nI am in a same -sex relationship, and we \nare regularly flummoxed by how our \nheterosexual parent friends don\u2018t split \nnighttime child care and sleep loss\u2026 In \nour house, parents are parents. There is no \nartificial distinction like fathers do this \nand mothers do that . \nBased on the interviews, most of the \nparticipants utter that they feel happier in gay \nmarriage because  they are able to get away \nfrom traditional gender roles and expectations. \nDue to traditional gender roles, men are \nexpected to work while women are expected to \ndo household and child caring. In homosexual \nmarriage, based on the interview, they argue \nthat households are carried out by both parties \nfairly so it does not only burdens one party. \nBecause of that, homosexual marriage is \nclaimed to be healthier and happier than \nheterosexuals since both parties are being \nsensible . \nAprilya Indah R. & Dewi Haryani Susilastuti \u2013 Different  Types of \nStereotypes toward LGBT as Minority on American Online News  \n \n41 By understanding the issue, gay i s viewed \nas more sensible. In gay marriage, both parties \nare more understanding of each other and do \nnot impose a duty on only one party. Both \nparties help and understand each other, which \nmake a gay marriage are viewed as healthier \nthan heterosexuals. Thu s, this creates a \nstereotype that gay is sensible . \nFurthermore, gay in the United States is \nalso stereotyped as more fashionable than a \nstraight man. This can be seen from an article \nin The New York Times, which discusses \nJared Polis. Jared Polis is a director and \nproducer in the United States who is \nincreasingly known after being governor of \nColorado. Even though Colorado is known for \nresisting anti -gay policies, Jared Polis\u2018 voters \nclaim that they did not vote for Polis because \nhe is gay. In this case , Colorado people assume \nthat he did not represent the stereotype of gay \nsince he is not a well -dressed man. As stated \nfrom The New York Times (2019 ):  \nHe does not conform to the clich\u00e9d gay \nstereotypes \u2026 GQ called him the worst -\ndressed congressman ever, t hough he is \nimproved his style a bit since then \u2026 all \ngay men are stylish, they dance well, they \nyada yada yada . \nThe stereotypes of gay for being stylish \nseem to be quite well known. Therefore, by \nunderstanding the issue, in American society, \nbeing fashion able is one of the stereotypes \ntoward gay people that are sometimes \ndiscussed on the media. In Polis\u2018 case, it is \nused to a political issue. Thus, along with \nbeing sensible and full of empathy, this \nstereotype is also attached to gay people in \nAmerican soc iety. \nIn contrast, gay is also stereotyped as \nunreligious in the United States. The issues \nbetween faith in religion and homosexuality are complicated in the United States. Most \nAmericans, which are Christians, have \nregarded homosexuality as morally wrong.  \nSubhi and Geelan (2013) state that since the \nbeginning of Christianity, most Christians \nhave already had a bias toward homosexuality. \nAs reported from The New York Times \n(2020), through Daniel Karslake\u2018s \ndocumentary, which follows Christian families \ndiscu ssing about their testimonies toward \nhomosexuality, all of them revealed their \ndisagreement against homosexuality also the \nlegalization of same -sex marriage in the \nUnited States; most of them stated that being \ngay is embarrassing because it contradictory \nagainst bible. Based on Daniel Karslake\u2018s \ndocumentary, it appears that there are many \nChristian families still opposing \nhomosexuality and strictly prohibit their \ngeneration from being homosexuals . \nIn short, by understanding the issues, gay \nstereotype in the  United States is unreligious \nsince the issues assert that gay is sinful, strictly \nprohibited in religion because it violates the \nrules in bible, and also viewed as possessed by \ndemon. Moreover, the studies also affirm the \ngay stereotype in the United Stat es as \nunreligious.  \nBisexual Stereotypes on American Online \nNews  \nBisexual is also part of the minorities in \nthe United States due to social and religious \nstigma. Bisexual is sexuality which has the \npotential to be attracted romantically and \nsexually to peop le of more than one sex or \ngender (Ochs, n.d.). Since bisexual\u2018s interest \nin people is more than two sexes or genders, it \nmakes bisexual look quite more unique than \nlesbian or gay. However, because of that, \nRUBIKON Volume 7/ Number 1  \nFebruary 2020  \n42 society\u2018s stereotype towards bisexual is also \nmore pessimistic than lesbian or gay . \nAs stated from The New York Times  \n(2019), in the United States bisexual is \nstereotyped as negative such as a transitional \nstage and a cover for promiscuity. Because \nbisexual is interested in more than one sexes or \ngenders , that is why they are stereotyped as \nbeing in a transitional stage, since their \nsexuality are neither heterosexual nor lesbian \nor gay \u2014whose interested for only one sex or \ngender. Moreover, the stereotype of \npromiscuous is also associated with bisexual \nbecause of bisexual\u2018s tendencies to two sexes \nor genders.  \nBased on the issue, bisexuals in the United \nStates are stereotyped as people who are \nconfused about their sexuality, because \nbisexuals are attracted to both men and/or \nwomen also both genders. Because of that, \nbisexuals in the United States are also \nstereotyped as people who involved in \npromiscuity.  \nTransgender Stereotypes on American \nOnline News  \nTransgender refers to people who \ngenerally refuse to take their gender binary as \ngiven (Vidal -Ortiz, 2008, p . 435). Since \ntransgender refusing to take their gender \nbinary as birth, they behave and look like their \nopposite gender binary. As an example, a \nTranswoman \u2014who is actually a man, changes \nhis appearance and behave like a woman. \nBecause of this, the stereot ype of transgender \nin the United States is as an impersonator of \ntheir opposite gender.  \nThe anti -Trans community names Trans -\nExclusionary Radical Feminists or TERFs for \nshort. TERFs is an anti -Trans community -based in the United States for those who hold \nsuch views deny the validity of transgender \npeople and transgender identities (USA Today, \n2020). TERFs believe that Transwomen are \nnot counted as women, \u2015The women who are \naccused of being impostors these days are \noften trans women\u2016 (The New York Times, \n2020). Due to their beliefs, TERFs\u2018 \nstereotypes toward Transgender are always \nnegative. Besides stereotyping Transgender as \nan impersonator of women, TERFs also call \nTransgender as cartoons of reality because the \nfemininity performance depicted by \nTransgender  is unnatural and also look it is \ndesigned for male satisfaction only. Other than \nTERFs, there is another radical feminist \ncommunity in the United States names The \nWomen\u2018s Liberation Front or known as WoLF \nin short . \nWoLF is a radical feminist organization \nbased in the United States, established in 2014 \nand aimed at the total liberation of women \n(Women\u2018s Liberation Front Official Website, \n2014). One of the agendas of WoLF is to reject \nthe existence of transgender since they believe \nthat Transwomen are not wo men. Moreover, \nthey claim that : \nthere is no male can assume female \nchromosomes a nd life history/  \nexperiences\u2026 transgender women \nreinforce gender stereotypes and p ose a \nthreat to gender equality  (The Washington \nPost, 2020).  \nIn summary, the stereotype of \nTransgender in the United States is \nTransgender as an impersonator of another \ngender. Based on the issue, Transwomen are \nconsidered as not women because they behave \nunnaturally feminine. In short, even though \nTransgender appears as their gender desires, \nthey are still stereotyped as impersonators \nAprilya Indah R. & Dewi Haryani Susilastuti \u2013 Different  Types of \nStereotypes toward LGBT as Minority on American Online News  \n \n43 because their biological identities are still \nbased on their birth sex.  \nThe stereotypes of transgender in the \nUnited States are mostly negative. Besides \nbeing an impersonator, the stereotype of \ntransgender is abnormal . It happens because \ntransgender changes their identity to its \nopposite, and it is considered weird and being \nabnormal. The United States Department of \nHousing and Urban Development secretary, \nBen Carson, confirms his disapproval of \ntransgender in front of  media during his visit at \nthe Union Rescue Mission in Skid Row area of \ndowntown Los Angeles, the United States. The \ninternal meeting discusses women\u2018s homeless \nshelters in the United States. During the \nconference, media revealed that Ben Carson \nkeep allud ing the transgender by mentioning \ntransgender women as big and hairy men; this \nstatement remarked upset feeling of the staff \nwho present at the meeting  (The Washington \nPost, 2019).  \nBased on the issue, the stereotype of \nTransgender in the United States is a bnormal. \nTranswomen behave and look like women \nwhile Transmen behave and look like men; \nbecause of that, it makes Transgender looks \ntoo visible which make them are stereotyped \nas unusual and abnormal.  \nBased on the findings, the researcher \nfound that lesbia n has two cases are included \nin neutral stereotypes such as being straight -\nforward and athletic. Moreover, gay has three \ninstances that included in neutral stereotypes; \ngay as full of empathy, fashionable and \nsensible person, while gay also has one case is  \nincluded in prejudiced stereotype \u2014gay as \nunreligious.  \nIn contrast, by examining the findings, the \nstereotypes of bisexuals and transgender in the United States are included in prejudiced \nstereotyping. Bisexual in the United States is \nstereotyped as promis cuous, while transgender \nis stereotyped as impersonator and abnormal. \nBased on the issue, bisexual is stereotyped \nnegatively because of their attraction to both \nsexes and genders. Unlike transgender, \nbisexuals rarely got negative stereotypes and \ndiscrimina tion in the United States because \ntheir appearance is not as conspicuous as \ntransgender. This is proven by a study \nconducted by Gazzola and Morrison (2014), \nwhich indicates that transgender in the United \nStates is stereotyped as abnormal because of \ntheir w eirdness by wearing feminine \nclothing \u2014and vice versa that make them too \nnoticeable in society (p. 81). Thus, through the \nresearch, American people mostly believe that \ntransgender is abnormal because they are \nhighly different from non -transgender and it is \nevident . \nCONCLUSION  \nLGBT as a minority in the United States is \nconsidered as a unity \u2014as one minority group. \nHowever, based on the findings, the researcher \nfound that the stereotypes against lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transgender are different from \neach other. Gay and lesbian are still have \nneutral stereotypes, while bisexual and \ntransgender are not. Moreover, transgender in \nthe United States has more prejudiced \nstereotyping than bisexual or other minorities \nsuch as lesbian and gay. It happens because of \ntheir appearance, which is mostly considered \nweird and abnormal by Americans.  \nIn summary, stereotypes against \nminorities in the United States also depend on \ntheir appearance and behavior. In this case, \ntransgender people are the most disadvantaged \nminority group because they appear and \nRUBIKON Volume 7/ Number 1  \nFebruary 2020  \n44 behave opposite to their gender binary at birth . \nThus, it can be concluded that LGBT is not \nconsidered as a single entity anymore because \neach group \u2014lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender experienced different stereotypes \nand challenges.  \nREFERENCES  \nBronski, M.

Traditional anticommunism and a historical one-sided view \non Cuba in the press, as well as widespread conceptual confusion about \u201csocialism\u201d in \nUS society, converged against Sanders over the run-up to the nomination, especially at \na crucial moment in February 2020 when he was the frontrunner and was interviewed \nby CBS. The paper analyses the reaction of the online press to Sanders\u2019 comments on \nCuba during the interview, but also considers other US press reports during 2019 as \nwell as specialised literature on the topic. Discourse Analysis parameters are brought \nforward to highlight ideological discourse representations in the media.\nKeywords:  Cuba, Bernie Sanders, online press, Discourse Analysis, socialism.\nIntroduction\nOn 23 February 2020, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic Party \ncandidate for President of the United States, was the frontrunner, after victories \nin New Hampshire and Nevada. At that moment, Sanders was interviewed by \nAnderson Cooper on the well-known CBS TV show 60 Minutes  (Cooper 2020). \n44 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021The candidate\u2019s statements about Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution were \nnuanced. He said, \u201cit\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad\u201d on the island. In \nthis context, he offered a positive portrayal of the massive literacy programme \ncarried out in Cuba in 1961.\nIn tune with the most visible opinion trends in the US concerning Fidel \nCastro and the process of change led by him (Solomon 2000; Perez 2002; Prieto \n2004; Landau 2006. G\u00f3mez Masju\u00e1n 2010; Lamrani 2011; Acosta Gonz\u00e1lez \n2017), Sanders clearly condemned the \u201cauthoritarian nature\u201d of the Cuban \nsystem, as well as the alleged imprisonment of dissidents on the Caribbean \nisland. Cooper reminded Sanders that he had made similar comments across his \nlong political career.\nSanders\u2019 answers resonated notably in the mass and social media on the inter -\nnet, against a very particular backdrop both in the United States and in the \ncontext of relations between the US and Cuba. In the US, the Democratic Party \nprimaries were underway to choose the candidate to face Donald Trump in the \npresidential elections in November. Substantial evidence demonstrated the exist -\nence of deep political polarisation (Pew Research Center 2014, 2016, 2017; \nDom\u00ednguez L\u00f3pez and Barrera Rodr\u00edguez 2018; Cia\u00f1o Zanetti 2016), which \nhad grown over recent decades. Trumpism, as a matter of fact, was a result of it \nand, recursively, one among various factors increasing divisions, tensions and \npolitical confrontation.\nUnder these circumstances, also marked by gross rising economic inequality \n(Piketty 2013; Boushey et al. 2017) and complex social problems, social demo -\ncratic proposals became increasingly noticeable within the Democratic Party \n(Sanders 2014; Stevens 2019; Ember 2019; Cramer 2017), put forward by \nBernie Sanders, mostly since his candidacy to the Democratic nomination in \n2016, when he turned out to be a formidable rival to the winner, Hillary Clinton.\nThe senator from Vermont became well known for his remarkable social \nbase \u2013 very strong among the youth \u2013 significant activity on the Web and social \nmedia, unprecedented contributions from individual donors and a programme \naimed at tackling the great inequality in US society. Some of his renowned \nproposals were Medicare for all, a significant raise in the minimum wage to \n$15.00 an hour, the relief of students\u2019 debt, fighting climate change, among \nothers. Discursively, Sanders lashed out at Wall Street, corporations, insurance \ncompanies, Big Pharma, the political establishment \u2013 including the Democratic \nParty \u2013 and the extremely wealthy. Additionally, he called for higher taxes on \nthe rich to finance these projects. Moreover, Sanders adopted the \u201cdemocratic \nsocialist\u201d label, in an apparent attempt to transform the understanding of the \nterm socialist .\nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  45\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nOn the other hand, with respect to US\u2013Cuba relations, Donald Trump had \nrolled out his Cuba policy in three phases. The first was a partial reversal of \nthe progress made under Obama\u2019s administration. The second was character -\nised by continuous deterioration of relations and the third was marked by \naccelerated confrontation (Gonz\u00e1lez Morales 2019).Trump\u2019s shift to open \nconfrontation was a move away from Obama\u2019s policy \u2013 a policy of dialogue, \nresuming negotiations and diplomatic relations, as well as greater exchange \nand cooperation in some fields. Trump\u2019s resort to subterfuge was typical of his \nadministration. For example, they raised doubt, with no evidence whatsoever, \nabout US diplomats stationed in Havana being victims of supposed \u201csonic \nattacks\u201d. They also accused Cuba of helping to prop up Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s \ngovernment in Venezuela, against which they deployed various tactics in a \nfailed attempt to topple it.\nIt is worth noting that, on the one hand, the White House, while employing \nfiery anti-communist and anti-socialist rhetoric against Cuba and Venezuela, \nalso tried to undermine or overthrow the governments of those countries, gov -\nernments which endeavour to build different models of socialism according to \ntheir historical specificities. On the other hand, the same US administration \nnegotiated, and even established relations imbued with certain cordiality, with \nsocialist North Korea. Moreover, according to the Department of State, US rela -\ntions with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam evolved \u201cinto a flourishing partner -\nship\u201d (US Department of State 2020). Besides, as Gonz\u00e1lez Morales (2019) \ndemonstrated, Trump, before being President, did not seem to care about Cuba\u2019s \nsocialist nature when it came to exploring the possibility of business arrange -\nments, or even registering his brand on the island. Both Trump and some notice -\nable media made clear efforts to link the social democratic tendencies headed by \nBernie Sanders within the Democratic Party with Venezuelan or Cuban social -\nism (Schwartz 2019; Thomas 2019; Cannon 2019; Post Editorial Board 2019; \nDavis Hanson 2019; Mansfield 2020; Smith 2020; Beauchamp 2020).\nThis paper examines these political and ideological circumstances, aiming to \nexplain the way Cuba was represented in influential online media and how that \nrepresentation, together with considerable conceptual confusion persisting in the \nUS as to what socialism is, played out against Bernie Sanders while he still stood \na chance to become the Democratic nominee for the presidential elections and, \nespecially, after the interview given to CBS 60 Minutes , on 23 February 2020, \nwhen he was the frontrunner.\nIn order to accomplish this aim, specialised literature and the online press \nwere studied, placing emphasis on the reaction of the latter to Sanders\u2019 Cuba \ncomments during the CBS interview.\n46 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021Discourse Analysis as an Instrument for Political and Ideological \nAnalysis\nDiscourse, defined as the process of producing sense in social activity, consti -\ntutes an opening to study the reality created while that social activity unfolds. In \nother words, discourse is language in use and a form of social action. This reali -\nsation established, at least from the early 20th century, a long tradition of ana -\nlysing discourse in various disciplines, from different perspectives, with diverse \nobjectives, and under various conceptualisations and theoretical frameworks \n(Beaugrande 2006).\nHowever, it was Foucault\u2019s approach (Foucault 1992), to a considerable \ndegree, which paved the way for the use of linguistic analysis to reveal how \ndiscourse operates as a fundamental tool to perpetuate, or resist, power rela -\ntions. Other authors, from different perspectives, have also discussed the use \nof rhetoric, persuasion, mass communication and different forms of cultural \ninfluence in general as tools to exercise power (Althusser 1976; Acanda 2002; \nNye 2008).\nDiscourse Analysis (DA), conducted from a historical and integrative per -\nspective within the social totality of the phenomenon examined, can be useful as \na theoretical and methodological instrument in the search for relevant informa -\ntion, especially when it comes to the study of political and ideological issues, \nwhich manifest themselves in discourse in various ways. One approach worth \nnoting is Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (van Dijk 1998; Wodak and Chilton \n2005; Fairclough 1995).\nNevertheless, as Jones (2007) points out, it is an approach with some flaws \nthat should be avoided. For instance, CDA sometimes emphasises certain lin -\nguistic aspects that hardly contribute to the in-depth understanding of the matter \nat hand which is, in the case analysed in this paper, mostly political, ideological \nand historical. Such weaknesses are revealed, for example, when, based on \nHalliday\u2019s systemic-functional grammar (Halliday 1994), grammatical features \nlike agency are interpreted as having certain ideological or political connota -\ntions; such interpretations actually appear to be far-fetched. Examples of that \nkind of grammatical analysis can be seen in Beaugrande (2006).\nMethodology is one of the aspects of CDA that still requires serious attention \nand improvement. Moreover, although CDA declared its interdisciplinary nature \nsince its inception, it has been clear throughout its relatively short existence that \nthe real integration of disciplines has not always been achieved. In this regard, \nCDA sometimes has reified the linguistic component of discourse as a decontex -\ntualised abstraction acting autonomously on people\u2019s minds and behaviour, as if \nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  47\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nlanguage existed as \u201can independent realm of determinate forms and meanings \nfrom which particular discourses are constructed\u201d (Jones 2007).\nThus, taking note of such pitfalls, in this research, an analysis was carried out \nto examine the discourse produced by the online press as a reaction to the CBS \ninterview with Bernie Sanders on 23 February 2020. The significance of this \nanalysis is derived from the role of the far-reaching and most visible press online \nin the formation of citizens\u2019 opinion, as well as in mirroring the political interests \nof those who, one way or another, control that press. The analysis is also perti -\nnent given the socio-historical and political context in which the interview took \nplace, which has already been detailed.\nThe DA1 was conducted, above all, in the sample that is described below but \nother journalistic articles (some of which were referred to in the introduction of \nthis paper) and specialised literature were also taken into consideration.\nHow the Sample was Selected\nIn order to select the sample for the analysis, the following key words were \nentered on Google\u2019s browser: CBS, 60 Minutes, Sanders, Cuba. Given the pre -\nsumable variations of Google searches depending on the individuals who run \nthem, they were performed from six different cellular phones in different places: \ntwo in Cuba, three in Spain and one in the United States. Seven searches were \ndone, because one of the participants ran two of them, one with the browser in \nEnglish and another in Spanish, the former being done seven days after the inter -\nview with Sanders, while the latter was done three weeks after the interview \ntogether with those performed by the other participants. In total, two searches \nwere run with the browser in English and five in Spanish.\nThe six participants, well known by the researcher, maintain diverse political \nideological stances on the political objects of study, that is, Bernie Sanders, the \nCuban revolution and socialism. Each participant noted down the first twelve \npress articles that popped up on the screen. The videos were disregarded. The \nresults of the search were similar. Mainly, they varied as to the order of appear -\nance of the press articles. The researcher analysed the articles that were repeated \nat least twice among the total results noted down by the six participants. The \nsample was composed of 16 press articles. Taking into account that over 90% of \n1 As Jones (2007) also argues, there is no need to describe DA as \u201ccritical\u201d, because \nevery analysis, and even more if it is done with scientific rigor, is critical per se. That is \nwhy the more general term DA, instead of CDA , is the one preferred in this research.\n48 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021the people that run a search on Google do not look beyond the first page (Kaye \n2013; Lee 2013), it is then a representative sample among the most likely articles \nthat would appear in any search using the given key words, which would be the \narticles presumably read or skimmed by the person running the search.\nThe sample is the following: Watson (2020); Ward (2020); Ellefson (2020); \nRedacci\u00f3n On Cuba (2020); LeBlanc and Merica (2020); Mazzei (2020); Cranley \n(2020); Redacci\u00f3n Radio Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed (2020); CNN en Espa\u00f1ol (2020); \nBreuninger (2020); RT (2020); Madrid (2020); Smiley and Daugherty (2020); \nOppenheimer (2020); Garger (2020) and Steinbuch (2020).\nAnalysis of the Sample and Other Press Articles Considered\nThe Discourse Analysis was carried out by means of parameters laid down \nthrough a process of induction-deduction and considering existing antecedents \n(Acosta 2014; van Dijk 1998). According to the aim of the research, and on the \nbasis of trying to properly understand the real role of discourse in the phenom -\nenon analysed, the parameters focus on explaining, as clearly as possible, the \nviews and ideological stance manifested in discourse on the topic discussed, \nmainly those that are recurrent in the sample selected. The parameters used are \ndefined below, along with necessary notes:\nTitle, heading or headline : the heading of any text is particularly relevant, \nbeing the synthetic presentation of the content or a significant part of it. In \nonline journalism it is even more noteworthy, given the dynamic of internet \nnavigation in which, often, people only read the heading. Then, the idea con -\nveyed by the heading and its likely impact on the reader are analysed from the \nideological perspective.\nIdeology2 in this context is defined as a system of ideas3stemming from a core \nof values that contributes to the regulation of behavior in situations of \n2 Some authors contributing to this definition of ideology are Thompson (1989), van \nDijk (1998) and Althusser (1976).\n3 It is pertinent to clarify that the word idea has several meanings, hence the need for a \nterminological definition in this context as follows:\nIdea: an entity (as thought, concept, sensation, or image) actually or potentially \npresent to consciousness. A formulated thought or opinion. Whatever is known or \nsupposed about something. Principle.\nThis definition combines some of the meanings of idea in Merriam Webster\u2019s 11th \nCollegiate Dictionary, except \u201cprinciple\u201d which is added; principle  is defined as a rule or \ncode of conduct  (this definition is one of the meanings of principle  in the same dictionary).\nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  49\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nconflict (mediated by power relations) with other ideologies.  The construc -\ntion of discourse is precisely a manifestation of the behaviour that, in situa -\ntions of conflict such as those between Cuba and the United States, is regulated \nby ideology along with other factors.\nThe production of highly ideological discourse, like that which is analysed in \nthis paper, usually carries the intention of representing negatively those who are \nidentified as adversaries, as well as representing positively the social group to \nwhich the speaker/writer belongs or with which he or she identifies (van Dijk \n1998). As a rule, that intention is inherent, one way or another, in the discursive \nbehaviour revealed by all the parameters. In the case discussed in this paper, the \nobjects that are represented either positively or negatively in discourse are Bernie \nSanders as a political figure, the Cuban revolutionary process under Fidel \nCastro\u2019s leadership and socialism.\nSo as to analyse each headline of the press articles of the sample, the follow -\ning steps were taken:\n1. The country to which the media outlet publishing the article belongs was \nnoted down.\n2. The ideological tendency of the media outlet was noted down.\n3. It was determined whether the representation of Bernie Sanders in the head -\nline was favourable, unfavourable or non-valuative.\nIn order to measure the ideological tendency of each media outlet, the website \nMedia Bias/Fact Check (www.mediabiasfactcheck.com) and its methodology \nwere used. Its classification includes Left, Left-Center, Least Biased, Right-Center \nand Right. Although those are the main tags used, the website also employs other \nlabels according to some criteria that can be checked in the methodology. It is \nevident that the reference point of this site is the US political spectrum, i.e. liber -\nalism-conservatism. Media Bias/Fact Check admits to the subjective component \ninherent in determining the ideological bias of any media outlet and its methodol -\nogy is detailed with transparency. This website subscribes to the International \nFact-Checking Network\u2019s code of principles established by the Poynter Institute.\nThe representation of Bernie Sanders being favourable, unfavourable or non-\nvaluative means the following:\nFavourable representation of Bernie Sanders , in relation to his statements on \nCuba, in the headline of the press article: a positive valuation of Sanders\u2019 state -\nments on Cuba is made, it is highlighted that others made it, or it is asserted \nthat what he said will benefit him over the run-up to the White House.\n50 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021Unfavourable representation of Bernie Sanders , in relation to his statements on \nCuba, in the headline of the press article: a negative valuation of Sanders\u2019 state -\nments on Cuba is made, it is highlighted that others made it or it is asserted that \nwhat he said will affect him adversely over the run-up to the White House.\nNon-valuative representation of Bernie Sanders , in relation to his statements \non Cuba, in the headline of the press article: the representation of Sanders in \nthe headline is not defined axiologically in relation to his statements on Cuba; \nthe headline just reports what Sanders said.\nTextual genre : the genre framing a text sets, to a greater or lesser degree, \ncertain characteristics as to the type of content and the stylistic features that \ntext must have. In journalism, there exist different classifications (Sexto 2006; \nRius 1988; Garc\u00eda 1989; Gargurevich 2006), historically grouped into two \nmain types: informative text and opinion. Roughly, the former is supposed to \nbe more objective and factually precise, while explicit opinions and valua -\ntions, and hence the ideological stance, are more typical of an opinion text. It \nis then relevant to analyse opinions and valuations that are ideological in \ncharacter and occur either explicitly or implicitly, in a subtle or less noticea -\nble manner and mostly within the framework of genres that are expected to \nbe objective, like a news item or a report.\nLexical selection : there often exist various lexical choices to represent a cer -\ntain part of reality by means of language. The choice may be a function of \nideology, which can be verified by contrasting that choice with the one made \nby ideological rivals or with others, whether or not they involve a valuation, \nthat are also possible according to reality. When referring to ideological \nadversaries, \u201cneutral or negative\u201d words are usually used, whereas \u201cneutral \nor positive\u201d ones are used for in-groups (van Dijk 1998: 270).\nStylistic devices : stylistic devices (metaphors, similes, hyperboles, among oth -\ners) discursively highlight a certain property (real or perceived) of the object \nreferred to, thus conferring, to some extent, a generalised character on that \nproperty (or alleged property) (Galperin 1981). The use of stylistic devices is \noften a result of an ideological stance or intention (Lakoff 2014).\nInformativeness : out of all the verifiable information available, the speaker/\nwriter usually chooses or places more emphasis on that which strengthens \nhis/her argument and contributes to a positive self-representation and a neg -\native representation of the ideological adversary. Vice versa, he/she omits  \nor de-emphasises the information that would contribute to a negative self-\nrepresentation or a positive representation of the ideological adversary.\nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  51\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nUse of sources : information in general, and opinions and valuations in par -\nticular, can appear in a text directly as a result of the speaker/writer\u2019s knowl -\nedge or claim of knowledge. Nevertheless, frequently, they can also appear \nthrough references to or citations of other individuals or entities that uttered \nthem (intertextuality). The speaker/writer\u2019s ideological stance often leads to \nselecting predominantly those sources which support it and ignoring those \nwhich contradict it. If a rival source is quoted, it is frequently done to refute \nits argument. On the other hand, sometimes, opinions or rumors are repro -\nduced without citing the source.\nWarning : the conviction that the ideological adversary is weak, wrong or infe -\nrior somehow sometimes leads to the belief, and its appearance in discourse, \nthat that rival\u2019s actions will cause harm to himself/herself or other people.\nCulpability : frequently, the speaker/writer\u2019s ideological stance leads to blam -\ning the adversary, without weighing his/her own degree of responsibility or \nexamining the multi-causality, not necessarily attributable to any parties, that \npotentially exists in any conflict, especially when its complexity is \nconsiderable.\nLogic of argumentation : argumentation can be logical or can incur any of the \nfallacies known (Yap 2012; Floridi 2008; Heberle 2017), or any other contra -\ndictions, inconsistencies or incoherence.\nManagement of truth : ideological convictions sometimes bring about inac -\ncurate perception and comprehension of reality as a result of the tendency \nto wish for reality to fit our beliefs and stance, instead of the opposite \n(Mcintyre 2018).\nResults\nTitle, heading or headline  and textual genre\nAmong the 14 media in the sample (two of them \u2013 Miami Herald  and New York \nPost \u2013 included two press articles each; the others had only one each, totalling \n16 press articles), all were from the US except Russia Today . The majority of the \nmedia outlets in the sample have an impact nationwide: CBS (this one obviously \nwould appear given the procedure used to obtain the sample), Vox, The Wrap, \nCNN, New York Times , Insider, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, CNBC and New York Post.  \nOthers are more influential locally in Florida and Miami in particular: Radio \nTelevisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed, Oncuba, Miami New Times and Miami Herald.\n52 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021According to Media Bias/Fact Check, of the 14 media outlets in the sample, \nsix are classified as Left-Center: CBS, The Wrap, New York Times , Insider, \nCNBC and Miami Herald;  four as Left: Vox, CNN, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol and Miami \nNew Times ; one as Right-Center: New York Post ; the ideological tendency of \ntwo had not been identified at the time the research was done: Oncuba and \nRadio Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed, while one is labelled \u201cquestionable source\u201d, \u201cRussian \npropaganda\u201d, \u201cconspiracy\u201d, \u201clack of transparency\u201d and \u201csome fake news\u201d: \nRussia Today .\nOf the 16 press articles, nine represented Bernie Sanders unfavourably from \nthe very headline, six headlines were non-valuative and only the headline of \nRussia Today  represented Sanders favourably. However, in the body of the \nvast majority of articles in the sample, a negative valuation of Bernie Sanders \nprevailed, except Russia Today , whereas in the article of Oncuba, the positive \nand negative opinions balanced out. On the other hand, the valuation of social -\nist Cuba was almost completely negative in the sample, although in some \nexceptional cases, within a few articles, there were some nuances and diverse \nopinions about this referent. This result is even more noteworthy considering \nthat only a tiny minority of the 16 articles were overtly opinion based, while \nthe overwhelming majority of them were supposed to be just reporting on the \nevents during the CBS interview with Sanders and the reactions to his state -\nments on Cuba.\nLexical selection  and stylistic devices\nThe majority of the articles in the sample highlighted that Sanders described \nhimself as \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d. A detailed analysis of Sanders\u2019 programme \nreveals that his purpose was not to dismantle the capitalist system at all \u2013 as, for \ninstance, the USSR and Cuba did plan to do based on Marxism (Cabrera \nRodr\u00edguez 2017) \u2013 but just to reform it substantially in order to resolve the seri -\nous problems afflicting it, such as the great inequality.\nApparently, the senator from Vermont overestimated his capacity to contrib -\nute to modifying or consolidating certain notions of \u201csocialism\u201d that, heteroge -\nneously, surfaced in the imagination of the US population over the last decade. \nAccording to Gallup News Service (2018), in 2018, for the first time since 2010, \nthe number of Democratic-leaning people surveyed who viewed capitalism posi -\ntively dropped below 50% (47%), whereas their positive view on socialism \nremained over 50%, a stable tendency since 2010 (53% in both 2010 and 2012, \n58% in 2016 and 57% in 2018). Another notable result of the same survey is the \npercentage of youth (many of whom are Sanders\u2019 sympathisers) who viewed \nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  53\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nsocialism positively compared with those who viewed capitalism the same way. \nThe former remained stable at slightly over 50% on average between 2010 and \n2018, but the latter decreased over 20 percentage points in the same period, it \nbeing 45% in 2018.\nNevertheless, the notions of \u201csocialism\u201d among US people were diverse \n(Newport 2018): government ownership or control, government ownership of \nutilities, everything controlled by the government, state control of business \n(17%); equality \u2013 equal standing for everybody, all equal in rights, or equal in \ndistribution (23%); benefits and services \u2013 free social services, medicine for all \n(10%); modified communism or communism (6%); talking to people, being \nsocial, social media, getting along with people (6%); restriction of freedom \u2013 \npeople told what to do (3%); liberal government \u2013 reform government, liberal -\nism in politics (2%), among others. It is significant that 23% of the people \nsurveyed had no opinion, which hints at the existence of a considerable sector of \nthe population as a battlefield for the different political forces to try to influence \nin this regard. Besides, over half of the people expressed their belief that social -\nism does not exist in their country (54%), but four out of ten did think that there \nis socialism in the United States (38%).\nIn this context, according to this research, when Sanders was the frontrunner \nin the primaries, the media discursively linked his figure to models of socialism \nlike that of Cuba, labelled (referring to the Cuban revolution, the resulting polit -\nical system or its main leader) in the sample analysed as \u201ccommunist regime\u201d, \n\u201cFidel Castro\u2019s communist government\u201d, \u201cFidel Castro\u2019s murderous totalitarian \ncommunist regime\u201d, \u201cdespot\u201d (referring to Fidel Castro), \u201cauthoritarian regime\u201d \n(Sanders\u2019 declared opposition to this alleged authoritarianism was presented in \nthe sample frequently, but also clearly minimised discursively), \u201cCastro\u2019s revolu -\ntion\u201d, \u201cCuban revolutionary and communist dictator Fidel Castro\u201d and \u201cleft-\nwing dictator\u201d.\nThis lexical selection was reinforced sometimes with stylistic devices such as \nthe metaphors \u201c[Sanders] is lost\u201d and he is \u201cway off base\u201d; the simile \u201cSanders\u2019 \nclaim that it\u2019s unfair to say that everything was bad in Castro\u2019s Cuba is as stupid \nas claiming that Stalin\u2019s Russia produced great dancers despite its mass murders. \nOr that Nazi Germany, despite its concentration camps, built great public high -\nways and reduced crime rates\u201d, and the hyperboles \u201cyou can practically hear \nMiami crack off Florida and go spinning into the ocean\u201d and \u201cCubans weren\u2019t \nexactly communicating by grunts\u201d (the latter implies that the literacy campaign \nwas not actually as important as Sanders said because, it is argued, \u201cmost \nCubans knew how to read\u201d (Redacci\u00f3n Radio Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed 2020)). Cuba\u2019s \nilliteracy rate was 23.6% when the revolution triumphed (Bhola 1984).\n54 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021Informativeness and use of sources\nA careful examination of the Cuban reality since 1959 reveals the existence of \nundeniable achievements in various fields, regardless of mistakes typical of radical \nsocio-political transformations, inexcusable faults or possible criticism from dif -\nferent views. Some such fields are public education, training of professionals, \nhealth programmes, child protection, scientific research, race and gender equality, \ncultural and art projects, sport feats and international cooperation. Influential US \nmedia looked into some such matters when Barack Obama rolled out his Cuba \npolicy of rapprochement in his second term as President (Acosta Gonz\u00e1lez 2017).\nNonetheless, a large majority of ideas on socialist Cuba conveyed in the sam -\nple were highly one-sided, skewed and characterised by hiding, minimizing or \nquestioning Cuban accomplishments. The majority of sources used were politi -\ncal figures with a strong political and ideological stance against the Cuban revo -\nlution. As a matter of fact, in the very same sample, exceptionally, a statement \nsupports this idea:\nThe positive read of Sanders\u2019s comments is that he\u2019s injecting nuance into an \noversimplified issue. Members of his team have long told me the senator rejects \nthe good-bad dichotomy that dominates Washington\u2019s foreign policy discourse. \nOne can reject a nation\u2019s system of government and its leadership while \nrecognizing some of the advances they might make, they argue. (Ward 2020).\nThe same article adds that Obama too had praised Cuban achievements in \neducation and health care while he was pursuing his Cuba policy of engagement. \nAnother article of the sample, also exceptionally, pointed out that, although the \nsubject was thorny in Florida (especially among older generations), in the rest of \nthe country, the reaction to Sanders\u2019 comments was rather that of indifference; \ntherefore, they would not have the same impact (Ellefson 2020).\nWarning and culpability\nOne of the ideas repeated the most in the sample was the warning that Sanders\u2019 \ncomments on Cuba were a negative tactic as regards trying to win the primaries. \nAllegedly, the candidate would have been rejected by voters, especially Cuban \nAmericans and other Latino groups, because of his comments. It was also \nasserted that Florida Democratic legislators would have lost their seats and, had \nSanders finally been nominated, Trump would have attacked him successfully \non the \u201csocialism\u201d weak spot, the President would have been re-elected and, \nconsequently, the constitutional republic would have been threatened.\nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  55\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nHowever, evidence hinted at that prediction being, at least, controversial. \nActually, a candidate\u2019s stance toward Cuba is not a top-of-the-list factor to win \nthe Cuban American vote. It ranks eighth. The most important factors are the \neconomy and jobs, health care, gun control and immigration (Grenier and \nGladwin 2018). Moreover, as time goes by, the new groups of Cubans settling \ndown in Florida, as well as those born in the US, have more diverse and nuanced \nviews on the Cuban reality (Grinspan 2020; Arboleya Cervera 2016), although \nthe older groups \u2013 especially the so-called \u201chistorical exiles\u201d from before 1980 \u2013 \nand their ideas continue to have a high level of influence and visibility compared \nwith the most recent groups.\nOn the other hand, after Sanders dropped from the nomination race, Trump \nlikewise attacked Biden for being a \u201csocialist\u201d (Sesin 2020) and, although the \nformer Vice President and Democratic nominee had decided to work together \nwith Sanders\u2019 team (Sprunt 2020) looking for reconciliation and party unity, \nDemocrats did not seem to pay much attention to Trump\u2019s attacks (Sesin 2020); \nmaybe, because Biden was less vulnerable, being perceived as a more moderate \npolitician; perhaps, also, because he was not linked to any Latin American pro -\njects regarded in the United States as authoritarian and failed regimes \u2013 neither \ndid Biden ever self-describe as a \u201csocialist\u201d of any kind \u2013 but maybe also \nbecause, to some extent, the \u201csocialist\u201d attack was not really such a major \nthreat to any candidates.\nAnother stereotype that arose in the sample was the supposed culpability of \nsocialism for the economic problems of Cuba (discourse in the sample insinuated \nthat it is the kind of socialism Sanders wanted for the US, which was false). This \ncould be real to a certain degree, but it is far from being the only factor: every \neconomically developing country must overcome obstacles inherent in the world \norder which favours wealthier nations and, in the case of Cuba, the coercive \nunilateral US measures against the island also have a heavy negative impact \n(Leogrande 2016).\nRecurrently, the Cuban revolution was discursively condemned in the sample \nfor allegedly having murdered, imprisoned or exiled its opponents. It was a \nstrongly biased narrative that overlooked the complexity of a revolutionary pro -\ncess, including the degree of culpability of the adversaries as well for the loss of \nlives and human suffering. This subject, which was succinctly presented in the \nsample and permeated by a strong negative valuation, requires a thorough anal -\nysis, with pertinent questions like the following. Who was murdered or impris -\noned? Was it murder or fair executions after due penal process for crimes \ncommitted during Fulgencio Batista\u2019s dictatorship (1952\u20138) or other historical \nmoments after 1959? Was it imprisonment just for having a different political \nstance or also for acting to thwart the revolutionary process or violating existing \n56 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021laws? Were the deaths discursively attributed to the revolution related to the \narmed struggle against Batista\u2019s dictatorship and the war that followed in the \nCuban mountains over the next five years after the triumph of the revolution? \nWere the opponents or detractors forcefully sent out of the country or did they \ndecide to leave? There is a series of necessary questions \u2013 full of nuance, com -\nplexity and contradiction \u2013 that require a detailed study, case by case. The \nanswers to those questions are usually oversimplified or biased depending on the \nideological stance.\nLogic of argumentation and management of truth\nThe eradication of illiteracy in Cuba in 1961 is an irrefutable fact (Bhola 1984, \nGreenberg 2020) being just one out of a considerable number of achievements. \nNevertheless, this fact was played down in the sample with the argument that, \nallegedly, the literacy campaign was negative because it was used as a tool for \nindoctrination to consolidate socialism. It is true that, during the campaign, \ntexts with ideological content favouring the revolution were used. However, the \nargumentation in the sample was fallacious for various reasons. First, every cul -\ntural complexus4 utilises education to ensure the predominance of values and \nfundamental ideas that underpin the system (Althusser 1976; Foucault 1992). \nThe complexus, as a complex dynamic system, organises itself and the values \nproper to the ruling mode of production prevail. Although some dissonance may \nexist, normally, it does not pose a serious threat to the system and, were it to \nbecome one, the system co-opts it, undermines it or absorbs it somehow.\nOn the other hand, it is a proven historical fact that large sectors of the \nCuban population played significant roles during the process of change headed \nby Fidel Castro: the very mobilisation into the literacy campaign was an exam -\nple, but other events also confirm it, such as the massive enlistment in militias to \ncombat the invaders during the Bay of Pigs operations and others, sizeable \nmajorities joining in mass organisations and institutions, the political stability \nachieved on the island and the approval of the socialist Constitution by a vast \nmajority. Therefore, assuming that socialism is negative for all Cubans and that \nmassive participation has been caused by \u201cindoctrination\u201d is, at least, highly \ncontroversial. Observation and analysis of history indicate the development of a \n4 The term cultural complexus  is adopted in this research. It is defined in Dom\u00ednguez \nL\u00f3pez and Barrera Rodr\u00edguez (2018). This term refers to the society as a whole and \nmakes its quality of being a complex system explicit; it adds in the notion of cul -\nture, defined as human production, including the creation of relations and patterns of \nbehaviour and production.\nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  57\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nconsensus built among broad sectors of the population about socialism, even \nthough opposing groups have also existed but as a minority.\nLikewise, so as to play down the Cuban development of health care, the con -\nstruction of discourse in the sample resorted to some analysts who acknowl -\nedged the advancements but argued that the Cuban health care system works \nbetter for foreigners than it does for Cubans (Ward 2020). This is an argumenta -\ntive fallacy, because even if it were real, it would not conflict with the idea \nbrought up by Sanders about the existence of substantial progress in health care \non the island.\nMost articles in the sample echoed a comment made by Sanders\u2019 CBS inter -\nviewer, Anderson Cooper, when Sanders spoke about the literacy programme in \nCuba. As a response to Sanders\u2019 rhetorical question wondering whether the lit -\neracy programme was negative even if Fidel Castro did it, Cooper asserted that \nthere were many dissidents in prison on the island. Only the article of Russia \nToday  remarked that Cooper\u2019s statement was an argumentative fallacy, because \nit was a change of subject unrelated to Sanders\u2019 comments, regardless of the fact \nthat Cooper\u2019s utterance is controversial in itself and the topic he brought up is \noften given different interpretations depending on the ideological stance.\nThe overwhelming majority of the articles in the sample made apparent the \nreturn to anti-communist rhetoric typical of the Cold War, when the manage -\nment of the historical, political and social truth was highly permeated by ideol -\nogy. A conspicuous example was the assertion that Fidel Castro \u201cseparated tens \nof thousands of mothers from their babies\u201d (Oppenheimer 2020). Presumably, \nthe statement referred to the Peter Pan Operation (or Pedro Pan as it was known \nin the US), which resulted in sending about 14,000 children to the US, unaccom -\npanied by their parents, from 1960 to 1962. Basically, this operation was a \nconsequence of fake rumours and documents saying that parents in Cuba would \nlose custody of their children who, allegedly, would be indoctrinated in the fun -\ndamentals of communism. It was an \u201cescape narrative\u201d typical of the Cold War, \nconsisting of selling the idea that children ought to be saved from the evil of \ncommunism (Dubinsky 2014; Bolender 2010; G\u00f3mez Cort\u00e9s 2013). In no way \nwhatsoever did the Cuban state instigate or cause such separation between chil -\ndren and their parents.\nSynthesis of the Results\nIn February 2020, Bernie Sanders was the frontrunner in the race for the \nDemocratic nomination. Then, following a CBS interview with him, important \nonline media portrayed Sanders predominantly negatively by linking the candi -\ndate with Cuba. The media involved adopt different positions in the US political \n58 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021spectrum, although \u201cLeft\u201d and \u201cCenter Left\u201d prevail. Cuba was represented in \nvery pejorative terms while, categorically, discourse was imbued with highly \nderogatory remarks about socialism which, as a matter of fact, is perceived dif -\nferently among US people.\nIt was also evident that a prejudiced and hardly nuanced view on after-1959 \nCuba predominated in those media. That view was profoundly negative, chastis -\ning almost the totality of that socio-political reality, on the basis of the overstate -\nment and almost absolute role attributed to Fidel Castro in the process of change \non the island after 1959. However, it is probable that the circumstances under \nwhich that discourse was built \u2013 amid the electoral process \u2013 also took its toll.\nIn this context, characterised by a rising political polarisation in the United \nStates and the increasing visibility of markedly social democratic and reformist \nproposals within the Democratic Party, the revival of historical anti-communism \nwas apparent in important online media. Such rhetoric appeared to have \ndecreased after the collapse of the USSR and the so-called socialism in Eastern \nEurope (Acosta Gonz\u00e1lez 2016).\nProbably, Sanders\u2019 strategy of highlighting his identity as a \u201cdemocratic \nsocialist\u201d had a negative impact, to some extent at least, concerning his aspira -\ntions to the Democratic nomination. It paved the way for his adversaries to \nsubjectively link \u2013 in the mass media, and most likely also in some sectors of the \npopulation not necessarily exposed to the media discourse \u2013 the candidate with \nmodels of socialism like that of Cuba, historically demonised in the US imagina -\ntion. Objectively, such connection is false. The negative impact on the candidate \nwas even worse after he insisted, in the middle of the campaign for the nomina -\ntion, on making some positive comments on a couple of aspects of after-1959 \nCuba. He did so at a moment when significant forces within the establishment, \nboth Republican and Democratic, did not view Sanders\u2019 pre-eminence in the \nrace favourably. Moreover, Sanders used the phrase \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d, \nwhich also favoured symbolic attacks against him, as evidenced by the very CBS \ninterview (Cooper 2020).\nThe predominant argumentation in the sample instantiated a phenomenon \nwell established by cognitive science: when reality is not in tune with ideology, \ngeneralised valuations or fundamental concepts of the individual or social group, \nthey find a way to ignore, distort or play down that reality in their discourse and \nsocial activity at large (Lakoff 2014; Mcintyre 2018).\nAlthough there are clues to transformations of the Cuban American commu -\nnity over the last decades (Grenier and Gladwin 2018), it is evident that voices \nthat are more diverse and less opinionated about the Cuban reality do not yet \nhave the same influence on the media as those with more rigid and homogeneous \nopinions against it. This situation manifested itself in the most visible online \nCUBA  AND  BERNIE  SANDERS  59\nIJCS Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/ijcs/\nmedia, and even more at a crucial moment like the race for the Democratic \nnomination. Those media discursively connected such oversimplified views on \nCuba with Bernie Sanders, in an attempt to reinforce the image of him as a can -\ndidate who lacked \u201celectability\u201d given his \u201cradical\u201d position. However, it is \nprobable that, even though this picture of Sanders as \u201cnot electable\u201d may have \nbeen real to some extent, the media also contributed to it, thus causing to a cer -\ntain degree a number of undecided voters to not support the senator. This would \nconstitute an example of the Pygmalion Effect (Rosenthal and Jacobsen 1968).\nThe reasons why Bernie Sanders could not keep up with Joe Biden in the race \nare surely diverse and complex and they were examined by different analysts \n(Beauchamp 2020; Weigel 2020). In this regard, a significant part of the US \nmedia coverage did not favour him (as evidenced by the analysis of the sample \nstudied but also observable in other press articles). This coverage was based on a \nsymbolic portrayal that inaccurately related the future under a potential victory \nof Sanders with models of socialism like that of Cuba \u2013 historically demonised \nand oversimplified \u2013 which have almost nothing or very little to do, essentially, \nwith Sanders\u2019 proposals. It is significant that Florida polls indicated an abrupt \nchange against Sanders after the CBS interview and the subsequent unfavourable \nreaction in the mass media as well as in the social media of influential political \nfigures with a hard-line stance against Cuba (RealClearPolitics 2020).\nConclusions\nWhile Bernie Sanders stood a chance to be nominated the Democrat to face \nDonald Trump in the 2020 presidential elections, a dominant opinion trend in \nthe US media was that the candidate\u2019s proposals were \u201cextreme\u201d, \u201cradical\u201d and \n\u201csocialist\u201d in the style of models undesired in the US like those of Venezuela and \nCuba. The conceptual confusion about socialism existing in the US was a breed -\ning ground for that opinion trend. That media phenomenon reached a peak after \nSanders\u2019 comments in CBS 60 Minutes , on 23 February 2020, just because the \ninterviewee praised some well-known achievements in socialist Cuba headed by \nFidel Castro. The above-mentioned opinion trend was then even more noticea -\nble, at least in the most visible mass media online, when running a search with \nthe key words CBS, 60 Minutes, Sanders and Cuba. As a general rule, the repre -\nsentation produced in those media can be described as follows:\n\u2022\u2022 The revolution headed by Fidel Castro has been an absolutely negative pro -\ncess for Cubans. There is nothing positive worth noting about the process or \nits most important leader. If there were something somewhat positive, it is \nminimal compared with the negative aspects.\n60 ACADEMIC  ARTICLE  \u2013 YOAN  kARELL  ACOSTA  GONz\u00e1LEz\nInternatIonal  Journal  of Cuban  StudIeS  13.1 Summer  2021\u2022\u2022 Bernie Sanders has praised Fidel Castro and the process of change he headed \nup. Sanders has shown his sympathy toward Castro and other authoritarian \nleft-wing leaders. He is rejected by Cuban American voters and Latinos at \nlarge because of that attitude. Sanders\u2019 political proposal is radical, extremist \nand probably inspired by those left-wing processes for which he has expressed \nhis admiration. If Sanders is nominated, Trump will attack his socialist ten -\ndency and the President will be re-elected. That would be a political disaster.\nNonetheless, there exist clues and evidence indicating that such representa -\ntion is significantly inaccurate. It is necessary to continue studying the media \nrepresentation of Cuba, socialism and US left-wing proposals called \u201csocialism\u201d \nby some. Concerning this research, the journalistic discourse construction ana -\nlysed in relation to Cuba, Sanders and his proposals seems to have overstated \noutright citizen rejection and total lack of \u201celectability\u201d related to Sanders\u2019 sup -\nposed radicalism and political sympathies. The most visible media online acted \nquite homogeneously against Sanders, a political option that was far from really \nthreatening the foundations of the political system and the cultural complexus in \nany way, despite the recurrent warning that it was. Sanders did put forth social \ndemocratic proposals that were not viewed favourably by powerful elites whose \ninterests are often guarded by the most influential media.\nIn this context, the media capitalised on the serious deterioration in US\u2013Cuba \nrelations, and the return to the inflammatory anti-communist and anti-socialist \nrhetoric most typical of the Cold War. This behaviour echoed Donald Trump\u2019s \nadministration\u2019s narrative, which is in tune with the most traditional utterly \nskewed hard-line stance against Cuba and its socialism, which is not the \u201csocial -\nism\u201d Bernie Sanders embraced as a political project.\nReferences\nAcanda, Jorge.

We use\nthis corpus to develop a robust annotation scheme that will allow us to distinguish between documents containing conspiracy\nlanguage and documents that do not contain any conspiracy content or that propagate conspiracy theories via misinformation\n(which we explicitly disregard in our work). We find that focusing on indicators of a belief in a conspiracy combined with\ntextual cues of conspiracy language allows us to reach a substantial agreement (based on Fleiss\u2019 kappa and Krippendorff\u2019s\nalpha). We also find that the automatic retrieval methods used to collect the corpus work well in finding mainstream documents,\nbut include some documents in the conspiracy category that would not belong there based on our definition.\nKeywords: corpus, conspiracy theory, annotation scheme\n1. Introduction\nConspiracy theories have found a new channel on the\ninternet and spread by bringing together like-minded\npeople, thus functioning as an echo chamber that ac-\ncelerates the spread of conspiracy theories and con-\ntributes to the further polarization of extremes (e.g.,\n(Papacharissi, 2016)). In recent years, researchers have\nthus become interested in the mechanisms of how con-\nspiracy theories are spread, and which types of people\nare susceptible to them (Barkum, 2013; Douglas and\nSutton, 2018; Samory and Mitra, 2018, a.o.).\nMiani et al. (2021) created LOCO, the Language of\nConspiracy Corpus. They collected the large-scale cor-\npus from automatically retrieved texts using a seeding\napproach, one subcorpus focusing on conspiracy the-\nory documents, and the second subcorpus focusing on\nmainstream documents for each seed. The corpus cre-\nators intend this corpus to serve as a basis for investi-\ngating the linguistic differences between conspiratorial\nand mainstream texts.\nWe use the LOCO corpus as the basis for our work.\nUltimately, our goal is to create machine learning ap-\nproaches that can tell conspiracy content from main-\nstream content, ideally independent of the individual\nconspiracy theory. As a first step, we needed to de-\ntermine how well the retrieval strategies of the LOCO\ncorpus worked, in other words, whether the grouping\nof documents into conspiracy or mainstream subcor-\npora was reliable. This led to an annotation project,\nin which we annotated a considerable number of texts\nfrom two different conspiracy theories, and in the pro-\ncess created annotation guidelines. We used documents\nusing the seed \u201cSandy Hook\u201d as our first set, and doc-\numents retrieved using the seed \u201cCoronavirus\u201d to de-\ncide whether our annotation guidelines were applicableacross different conspiracy theories. Sandy Hook refers\nto conspiracy theories centered around the Sandy Hook\nElementary School shooting in 2012, including claims\nthat the shooting was staged by the US government,\npotentially to establish tighter gun control regulations;\nthat nobody died in the event; or that there was a second\nconspirator, etc. The Coronavirus conspiracy theory re-\nvolves around claims that the virus was engineered in\nChina; that the virus was spread by elites to gain in-\nfluence and increase profit; or that the vaccine is more\ndangerous than the virus, etc.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 explains\nour research questions in more detail and section 3 in-\ntroduces related work. Section 4 presents the LOCO\ncorpus, and section 5 describes the first round of anno-\ntations of Sandy Hook documents. Section 6 explains\nthe adaptation of the annotation guidelines based on\nthe first annotations, section 7 the experiment on an-\nnotating documents from a different seed, and section 8\ngives an overview of all the annotations. Section 9 con-\ncludes and describes future work.\n2. Research Questions\nThe goal of this project is to annotate the texts of\nthe LOCO corpus (Miani et al., 2021) for conspir-\nacy theory language. This is a challenge that has\nnot been addressed in this form before (but see the\nnext section). Similar to abusive language detection\n(e.g., (Lopez Long et al., 2021)), we assume that this\ntype of annotation is non-trivial, since the categories\nsound intuitive at first but tend to have soft boundaries,\nwhich may depend on personal stance and knowledge\nof the annotator. In order to develop a robust annota-\ntion scheme, we need to answer the following research\nquestions:\n1121. Can we start with a minimal definition of conspir-\nacy theory, and use the difficulties arising from\napplying this definition in annotation to develop\nrobust annotation guidelines that will lead to high\ninter-annotator agreement?\n2. Do our guidelines cover both conspiracy theory\nand mainstream texts? Are there differences in\nthe annotation quality between these two types of\ntexts?\n3. If the guidelines are developed based on texts from\none specific conspiracy theory, are they robust\nenough so that they can be applied to texts from\nother conspiracy theories?\nAdditionally, we will have a look at the quality of the\ntexts in the LOCO corpus. Since the corpus texts were\ncollected automatically without human supervision, it\nis important to know how reliable the search criteria\nare that were chosen to create the corpus, and whether\nthe reliability of the retrieval strategies is dependent on\nthe relevant conspiracy theory.\n3. Related Work\nBefore creating guidelines for annotating the language\nof conspiracy theories, we first need a working defini-\ntion of what constitutes a conspiracy theory, and what\nconstitutes a conspiracy theory text. Banas and Miller\n(2013) define conspiracy theories (CTs) as \u201ccausal nar-\nratives of an event as a covert plan orchestrated by a\nsecret cabal of people or organizations instead of a ran-\ndom or natural happening.\u201d Douglas et al. (2019) de-\nfine them as \u201cattempts to explain the ultimate causes\nof significant social and political events and circum-\nstances with claims of secret plots by two or more pow-\nerful actors\u201d. Miani et al. (2021) define CTs as follows:\n\u201cConspiracy theories are narratives that attempt to ex-\nplain significant social events as being secretly plotted\nby powerful and malicious elites at the expense of an\nunwitting population.\u201d\nSamory and Mitra (2018) identify three key elements\nof previous CT definitions: agent, action, and target.\nIn the work by Douglas et al. (2019), for example,\nthe agent is \u201ctwo or more powerful actors\u2019\u201d, the tar-\nget is\u201csignificant social and political events and cir-\ncumstances\u201d, and the action is \u201cattempts to explain the\nultimate causes ... with claims of secret plots\u201d. We can\neasily identify these three key elements from a theo-\nretical level, and Samory and Mitra (2018) show that\nsuch methods work well for conspiratorial statements\nin real texts. However, Samory and Mitra (2018) also\npoint out that \u201cconspiracy theories are often collages\nof many smaller scale theories\u201d, which makes them a\ndifficult phenomenon to study.\nInvestigating linguistic characteristics of conspiracy\ntheories, Fong et al. (2021) identify lexical cues that\nrepresent \u201dpsychological themes\u201d relevant to \u201cconspir-\nacy ideation\u201d identification, for example ingroup vs.outgroup language or the \u201cwe vs. them\u201d ideology,\nandcognitive processes creating a higher past- and\ncertainty-oriented language that is focused on causal\nexplanations and closure. This distinguishes the lan-\nguage of CT from that of mainstream media, which is\nmore oriented towards the factuality of information. In\naddition to lexical cues, the authors also identify lexical\nthemes based on power, death, and religion. Introne et\nal. (2020) use a narrative framework to investigate con-\nspiracy theory texts. They use the following definition:\n\u201cA conspiracy theory is a narrative explaining an [event\nor series of events] that involve [deceptive, coordinated\nactors] working together to achieve [a goal] through\n[an action or series of actions] that have consequences\nthat intentionally disenfranchise or harm an [individual\nor population].\u201d They identify six main terms, marked\nin the square brackets above. Additionally, they dis-\ntinguish between CTheory (for which annotators need\nto distinguish actors, actions, consequences, and vic-\ntims) and CThinking for posts that \u201cimplied a conspir-\nacist point of view . . . but did not themselves contain\nidentifiable CTheories\u201d. For this category, only one of\nthe six categories needed to be present. Introne et al.\nfound that CTheories are very infrequent in their data,\nCThinking less so. Additionally, CT posts mostly fo-\ncused on actors and actions.\nThe next problem to be addressed concerns how to\ncompile a corpus of CT documents. CT researchers\nhave studied texts with potential CT content on dif-\nferent social media platforms such as Twitter, Face-\nbook, and Reddit (Wood, 2018; Smith and Graham,\n2019; Samory and Mitra, 2018). However, Miani et\nal. (2021) argue that texts from discussion threads are\nnot a good resource for investigating CT narratives and\ntracking how CT beliefs are transmitted, because in\nmost cases, Twitter comments, etc. are short and very\ncontextualized in a (potentially asynchronous) \u201cconver-\nsation\u201d, and it is difficult to interpret such posts inde-\npendent of the whole thread.\nInstead of extracting potential CT content from social\nmedia resources, other efforts focused on building CT\ncorpora using full documents. For example, Uscinski\net al. (2011) compiled a corpus of conspiracy docu-\nments using letters to the editor of The New York Times\nfrom 1897 to 2010. This corpus contains 100 000 doc-\numents, out of which 800 were manually annotated as\nconspiracies. Unfortunately, this corpus is no longer\navailable (p.c. J. Uscinski, 2021). The most recent,\nlarge-scale corpus of conspiracy documents was re-\nleased by (Miani et al., 2021), it covers a wide range\nof different conspiracy theories and was collected auto-\nmatically using a seeding approach. This is the corpus\nwe will use for our work, for more details see below.\n4. The LOCO Corpus\nMiani et al. (2021) created the Language Of Conspir-\nacy Corpus (LOCO) (Miani, A. et al., 2021), which\ncontains 23 937 conspiracy and 72 806 mainstream\n113Topic Category Round 5 ann. agree 4+ ann. agree Fleiss\u2019 kappa Krippendorff\u2019s alpha\nSandy Hook CT 1 9/20 17/20 0.466 0.469\nmainstream 1 18/20 20/20 -0.020 -0.010\nSandy Hook CT 2 14/20 17/20 0.696 0.699\nmainstream 2 20/20 20/20 1.0 1.0\nCoronavirus CT 12/20 17/20 0.577 0.575\nmainstream 19/20 20/20 -0.010 0\nTable 1: Inter-annotator agreement for documents from two CT seeds, when annotating for CT vs. non-CT.\ndocuments, about 88 million words overall.

(2021).\nThere are two categories used in the corpus, conspir-\nacy and mainstream documents, which are retrieved\nvia different strategies: To gather conspiracy texts, Mi-\nani et al. (2021) used a list of conspiracy theory web-\nsites based on scores from mediabiasfactcheck2. To re-\ntrieve mainstream documents, the authors used Google\nto search for the seeds and extracted website domains,\nfrom which they retrieved the texts. The authors ac-\nknowledge that not all conspiracy theory (CT) texts will\ncontain conspiracy content. Mainstream documents\nmay contain CT content, but they reflect the mix of CT\nand non-CT that the general public is exposed to.\nCompared to previous corpora on related areas (con-\nspiracy, rumors, fake news (e.g. (Uscinski et al., 2011;\nKwon et al., 2017; Castelo et al., 2019)), the LOCO\ncorpus covers a large set of conspiracy texts and a siz-\nable number of different CTs, plus a detailed set of\nmetadata, including date, website, and measures of so-\ncial media engagement. To determine the accuracy of\nthe CT and mainstream categories, Miani et al. (2021)\nrandomly sampled 60 documents from the conspiracy\nand mainstream subcorpora each, and manually anno-\ntated them. Their annotation results indicate that 85%\nof the conspiracy documents and 92% of the main-\nstream documents are correctly labeled.\nIt is clear that the LOCO corpus is a valuable resource\nfor exploring the narratives of conspiracy theories and\ntheir effect on social media. However, in order to use\nthis corpus for creating machine learning models of CT,\nwe need a better understanding of the quality of the\ncorpus, i.e., the degree to which the automatic grouping\ninto the CT and mainstream subcorpora corresponds to\nhuman judgments across the different seeds.\n1https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/\npolls/democrats-and-republicans-differ-\non-conspiracy-theory-beliefs/\n2https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\nconspiracy/5. Annotating Sandy Hook Documents\n5.1. Distinguishing Conspiracy Theory Texts\nfrom Mainstream\nOur first question concerns the problem of defining the\ntarget of our annotations. What do we consider a con-\nspiracy theory (CT) document? Where do we draw\nthe line between conspiracy theory and mainstream /\nnon-conspiracy theory? To answer these questions, we\nconducted a first round of annotations on a sample of\n40 documents from the set of documents in the LOCO\ncorpus on Sandy Hook. We chose 20 documents from\nthe conspiracy subcorpus and 20 from the mainstream\nsubcorpus. The annotations were conducted by 2 un-\ndergraduate and 3 graduate students, who had read and\ndiscussed relevant literature prior to the annotations.\nOur starting definition of CT was the definition by Dou-\nglas et al. (2019) (see section 3). However, after our\npilot annotation, we found this definition too general\nfor our goal since it does not give any guidance on\nthe distinction between reports of the event, reports of\nconspiracy theories related to the event, and the prop-\nagation of conspiracy theories. Since we are mostly\ninterested in the latter, we decided to incorporate the\nconcept of conspiracy belief, as defined by Barkum\n(2013): \u201cA conspiracy belief is the belief that an or-\nganization made up of individuals or groups was or is\nacting covertly to achieve some malevolent end.\u201d We\nadopted the definition proposed by Seelig et al. (2022),\nwhich is based on the definition by Banas and Miller\n(2013):\n(1) A conspiracy belief is the belief that an orga-\nnization made up of individuals or groups was\nor is acting covertly to achieve some malevolent\nend. It depicts causal narratives of an event as\na covert plan orchestrated by a secret cabal of\npeople or organizations instead of a random or\nnatural happening.\nThe results of this first annotation round are shown in\nthe first two rows of Table 1. We found that the main-\nstream documents from the LOCO corpus were mostly\nlabeled correctly, and our annotators agreed in most\ncases: Only 2 documents had 1 annotator disagreeing\nwith the majority. Note that the kappa and alpha val-\nues for the mainstream subcorpora show either nega-\ntive numbers or 0 even though the annotators mostly\nagreed. The reason for this can be found in the very\n114How Zionist Politicians Brought On Newtown Killings - Part 2\nThe first half of this analysis of the Connecticut shootings, MK-ULTRA Links to Sandy Hook Assault, examined\nhow the CIA\u2019s mind-control program spread like a metastasizing cancer across the Eastern Seaboard, delivering\na nightmarish cocktail of synthetic drugs, sexual abuse and lethal violence. The focus of that essay was on the\nthree major players in the New England region - CIA/FBI agents, the pedophile Catholic clergy and the Irish drug-\ntrafficking mob, while giving only passing mention of the Jewish politicians whose salesmanship was needed for\nthe monumental task of social engineering a proud nation into a herd of sheep.\nThe major political figure in the Newtown tragedy who has once again evaded personal responsibility for the bloody\nconsequences of his idiotic policies, which include the war in Iraq and arms shipments to Israel, is Joseph Isadore\nLieberman. The chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and U.S. senator from Tel Aviv and Stamford is\nthe elephant in the schoolroom that nobody seems to notice.\nSoon to retire from the senatorial seat he\u2019s kept warm for 22 years, Joe Lieberman has been a contemporary of\nNew England gangland boss Whitey Bulger and his CIA controllers. His Senate term has run exactly parallel to\nthe takeover and transformation of once-puritanical Connecticut into a sleazy hub of underage prostitution, child\nporn, drug peddling and gambling.\nWithout the powerful senator\u2019s protection and nurturing of unsavory characters and corporate criminals over the\ndecades, the Sandy Hook school massacre probably would never have happened. Here, in Part 2, the role of Jewish\npoliticians in first promoting and later suppressing child prostitution, kiddie porn and drug use is explored, along\nwith the blowback from that policy reversal provoking the school attack and subsequent cover-up.\nFigure 1: Example of a clear CT document [LOCO ID: C006b9].\nTrial Date Set in Sandy Hook Families\u2019 Lawsuit Against Remington \u2013 Infinite Unknown\nA lawsuit by families of Sandy Hook victims is proceeding against Remington, manufacturer of the AR-15, in the\nnew push to hold gun manufacturers responsible for what is done by people who purchase their products and use\nthem illegally.\nThe New York Times is pretty excited about it: The legal challenge faces long odds, and a key hearing next week\nwill determine its future.\nQuestion: Do you think it\u2019s a bit hypocritical of the system to applaud the Sandy Hook families for suing Rem-\nington and decry the fact that people can\u2019t sue to hold a company responsible for what people who purchase its\nproducts could potentially do to others, but completely ignore the fact that we live in a country where no one is\nallowed to sue vaccine manufacturers directly for vaccine damage?\nAlso, can you imagine if every company could be sued for every time someone used their products in the commis-\nsion of a crime to hurt someone else?\nKnife manufacturers sued for stabbings. . . Car manufacturers and alcohol producers sued for DUI deaths. . . Com-\npanies who sell lighters sued if an arsonist decides to burn someone\u2019s house down. . . Shoelace manufacturers sued\nfor someone being strangled by one. . . Swimming pool manufacturers being sued if someone drowns in one. . .\nPersonal responsibility be damned when there\u2019s an agenda, and this agenda is pretty obvious. If they can\u2019t get the\nlaws passed to gut the Second Amendment, they\u2019ll just try to sue gun manufacturers out of existence instead.\nFigure 2: Example of a document difficult to label [LOCO ID: C06962].\nhigh expected values. Neither metric is useful for data\nwith very high agreement and small sample size (Zhao\net al., 2013). Given the results in Table 1, we decided\nto trust the retrieval strategy used for mainstream docu-\nments, with which the annotators agreed in most cases.\nFor the CT documents, however, inter-annotator agree-\nment was low, only for 9 out of the 20 documents did\nall 5 annotators agree, and Fleiss\u2019 kappa reached 0.466.\nFigure 1 shows a clear case of CT.\nWhen discussing the documents on which the annota-\ntors did not agree, we found that in some cases, a con-\nspiracy theory may be perpetuated, but the text itself\ndid not show any evidence of the writer\u2019s belief in the\nCT. Other examples were unclear. One example for\nsuch a difficult decision is shown in Figure 2.This article was particularly difficult to label as CT or\nnon-CT: While the author is clearly opposed to the law-\nsuit against gun manufacturers, and while the docu-\nment contains leading questions (e.g., \u201cAlso, can you\nimagine if every company could be sued for every\ntime someone used their products in the commission\nof a crime to hurt someone else?\u201d) and mentions an\n\u201cagenda\u201d, there is no indication of a belief in a conspir-\nacy. After the discussion, all annotators agreed that this\ntext should be classified as non-CT.\nMany of those documents contain statements that were\nverifiably incorrect or misleading and that would indi-\ncate covert activities with malevolent intentions. An\nexample of such a document is shown in Figure 3. In\nthis example, the claim that the property records show\n115Over 30 Sandy Hook Homes \u201dGifted\u201d In 2009\nNewtown property records suggest that on December 25, 2009 a total of 35 properties located on and around\nYogananda Street in Sandy Hook were transferred at zero value to new owners.\nThe transactions include the house belonging to mysterious figure Chris Manfredonia, who was apprehended by\npolice on Sandy Hook School grounds on the morning of December 14, 2012.\n\u201dIt\u2019s not just Yogananda Street that was given away on Christmas of \u201909,\u201d the researcher argues.\nYogananda addresses 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, and 23 all bear identical transactions to the ones\nexhibited here; 24 is owned by the town, while 18 is a normal transaction.

All of these\nproperties surround the Lanza home.\nFigure 3: Example of a misinformation/fake news document [LOCO ID: C060d0].\nDemocrats Call For A Complete Ban on All Cryptocurrencies\nBrad Sherman told a subcommittee for the House of Representatives Financial Services. Democrats are calling\nfor a blanket ban on all forms of Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, claiming that digital money warrants heavy\nregulation by lawmakers. Congressman Brad Sherman told a subcommittee for the House of Representatives\nFinancial Services that the American public should not be allowed to purchase any form of digital currency. \u201cWe\nshould prohibit U.S. persons from buying or mining cryptocurrencies,\u201d the California Democrat said. According\nto Coindesk: He added that, beyond cryptocurrencies being potentially used as a form of money in the future, it\ncan currently be used by tax evaders and rogue states seeking to bypass U.S. sanctions.\nFigure 4: Example of an unrelated article [LOCO ID: C05e2a].\nthat 35 properties were transferred at zero value to new\nowners on the same day is technically correct but ig-\nnores that this was due to missing information in the\ncomputer system.\nWe decided that we would focus on the language of\nconspiracy theories, in the sense that a belief in the CT\nwas shown in the language of the text. We consider\nfact checking a separate, but clearly related problem.\nWhen focusing on the language of CT, this document\ncan be considered non-CT, even though the misinfor-\nmation indicates a CT. This decision was made in order\nto keep the annotations feasible given time and budget\nconstraints. A combination of fact checking and infor-\nmation about conspiracy beliefs anchored in the lan-\nguage will have to be addressed in the future.\n5.2. Relatedness\nFrom a cursory look at the CT documents, it became\nclear that solely distinguishing between conspiracy and\nnon-conspiracy was not sufficient since we found that\nsome documents, which were collected for a specific\nseed, may mention that seed, but were otherwise un-\nrelated to the CT. For this reason, we added a Relat-\nedness category, with three different labels: closely re-\nlated, broadly related, and not related.\nFigure 4 shows an extreme example. This is a text\non cryptocurrencies, but the corpus groups it under the\nseed Sandy Hook. There is no mention of Sandy Hook\nin the whole document, and it is unclear how it was re-\ntrieved. We consider this document not related to the\nSandy Hook CT.\nThe first two rows in Table 2 show the results of the\nfirst round of annotations. We see a similar picture to\nthe annotations of CT vs. non-CT for the mainstreamdocuments, Fleiss\u2019 kappa reaches 0.512. For the CT\ndocuments, the results are higher, with Fleiss\u2019 kappa\nreaching 0.655. A closer look at the documents where\nannotators disagreed shows that disagreements concern\nthe hard boundaries between the labels. Is one cursory\nmention of Sandy Hook enough to make a document\nclosely related? Does Sandy Hook need to be the only\ntopic in a document for it to count as closely related?\nFor the future, we will investigate a continuous scale\nfor this type of annotation.\n6. The New Annotation Scheme\nAfter the first round of annotations and the discussion\nof the documents that had conflicting annotations, we\nupdated the definition in (1) to the one in (2).\n(2) A conspiracy belief is the belief that an orga-\nnization made up of individuals or groups was\nor is acting covertly to achieve some malevolent\nend. It depicts causal narratives of an event as\na covert plan orchestrated by a secret cabal of\npeople or organizations instead of a random or\nnatural happening.\nA document is considered CT if and only if such\na belief is manifested in the text via specific\nexpressions. We explicitly exclude fact check-\ning beyond obvious inconsistencies with infor-\nmation present in mainstream coverage of the\nevent underlying the CT.\nGiven the retrieval strategies used in the creation of the\nLOCO corpus (see section 4), there are obvious dif-\nferences since most of the mainstream documents are\nretrieved from news outlets while the CT documents\ntend to come from less official outlets.

Mentions of other conspiracy theories\nCT documents often draw connections between\ndifferent conspiracy theories.\nThere are also textual cues that are indicative of CTs,\nmany of these cues are typically also used in other so-\ncial media (as opposed to news reports). Examples are\nshown in the lower half of Table 3.\n1. Extensive use of all caps\n2. Atypical named entities\n3. Unconventional use of punctuation\n4. Frequent use of 1st and 2nd person pronouns\n5. Frequent questions directed at the reader\n6. Paraphrasing instead of direct quoting\nSeveral documents in the LOCO corpus were written\nby or reference prominent conspiracy theory propo-\nnents such as Alex Jones and Infowars. If we were\ninterested in conspiracy theories in general, such doc-\numents should be labeled as CT. Given our definition\nin (2), such documents are labeled as non-CT since they\ndo not contain any language showing the belief in a CT.\nFigure 5 shows an example of a document that caused\ndoubts based on our first definition in (1) but was con-\nsidered a clear case of CT based on the new defini-\ntion. In this document, we clearly see language relat-\ning to the conspiracy theory, e.g., \u201dFake victims/no real\ndeaths = crisis actors playing loved ones. Crisis actors\ninstead of real heartbroken angry loved ones = no law-\nsuits and NO QUESTIONS.\u201d Additionally, it shows a\nrange of the cues we have identified: \u201cThe deep state\u201d,\ninformal language, words in all caps to show emphasis,\nand repeatedly the hedge \u201callegedly\u201d.\nIn some cases, however, the verbal cues complicated\nthe decision. Figure 6 shows an example containingverbal cues of emotional language, (\u201dharrowing\u201d) and\nquotations indicating panic. This language seems to\nimply that the \u201ccalm\u201d response was inappropriate in\nthat situation. Within the remainder of the document,\nhowever, there is no claim of a secret plot, etc. Conse-\nquently, we annotated this document as non-CT.\nThe lack of clarity in these documents may allow read-\ners to impose their pre-existing beliefs or worldview;\nin this way, the CT is perpetuated in part because it\ncan mean different things to different people, thus con-\ntributing to the multi-faceted collection of beliefs cen-\ntered around one CT.\nAfter establishing our new annotation scheme, we con-\nducted a second inter-annotator agreement experiment\non 20 previously unseen documents from the CT sub-\ncorpus and 20 from mainstream. The inter-annotator\nagreement results are shown in rows 3 and 4 in Ta-\nble 1 for the decision on CT vs. non-CT and in Ta-\nble 2 for relatedness. Note that we reached a perfect\nagreement on the mainstream documents for CT vs.\nnon-CT, thus corroborating our decision to trust the\nretrieval strategy for this subcorpus. For the CT doc-\numents, Fleiss\u2019 kappa increased from 0.466 to 0.696.\nFor relatedness, we also see a marked improvement in\nFleiss\u2019 kappa from 0.655 to 0.776 for CT documents\nand from 0.512 to 0.819 for mainstream documents,\nbut we do not reach a perfect agreement. All scores\ncorrespond to substantial agreement based on Landis\nand Koch (1977).\n7. Using the Annotation Scheme for\nCoronavirus Documents\nThe second round of annotation in Sandy Hook doc-\numents shows that annotators reach a high agreement\nin annotating for both conspiracy and relatedness. This\nleads to the next question, namely whether the anno-\ntation guidelines developed based on texts on Sandy\nHook will also be relevant for the annotation of other\n118Seed Category # LOCO docs # docs annotated Conspiracy Rate Related Rate\nSandy Hook Conspiracy 364 364 0.615 0.615\nSandy Hook Mainstream 1476 200 0.020 0.780\nCoronavirus Conspiracy 571 571 0.413 0.891\nCoronavirus Mainstream 1965 20 0 0.850\nTable 4: Statistics of our annotations.\nCTs, or whether we need to adapt the guidelines to new\nCTs.\nTo answer this question, we chose a second seed from\nthe LOCO corpus: coronavirus. This choice was de-\ntermined in the attempt to find a CT that is differ-\nent enough from Sandy Hook. The coronavirus CT\nconcerns ongoing events, unlike the Sandy Hook CT,\nwhere the focus event happened in 2012. Furthermore,\nwhile the majority of the narratives on Sandy Hook are\ncentered around the event of the school shooting, there\nis no such core event for coronavirus. Our hypothesis\nis that the coronavirus texts are more diverse in topics\nthan the Sandy Hook ones, therefore if the annotation\nguidelines are usable for coronavirus, they should also\nbe usable for a wider range of CTs.\nWe conducted a third inter-annotator agreement exper-\niment on 20 CT and 20 mainstream documents for the\ncoronavirus seed. From the annotation results in rows 5\nand 6 of Tables 1 and 2, we see a clear divergence. For\nCT vs. non-CT, both Fleiss\u2019 kappa and Krippendorff\u2019s\nalpha are considerably lower for these documents than\nfor the second round of Sandy Hook documents (kappa:\n0.577 vs. 0.696), clearly showing that the CT docu-\nments are structured differently in different CTs. For\nthe mainstream documents, in contrast, the results are\nvery similar to the second round of Sandy Hook anno-\ntations. For relatedness, the CT documents had similar\ntrends to the second round of Sandy Hook while the\nmainstream documents reached lower scores (kappa:\n0.517 vs. 0.751).\nThese differences can partly be explained by the differ-\nences in the success of the automatic retrieval strategies\nin LOCO (see below for more details): A much higher\npercentage of the documents in the CT subcorpus for\nthe seed coronavirus are non-CT based on our defini-\ntion. Additionally, in comparison to the Sandy Hook\ndocuments, a higher percentage of documents in both\nsubcorpora for the coronovirus seed are related to the\ntopic.\n8. Overview of All Annotations\nWe re-annotated the documents from the first inter-\nannotator agreement experiment and continued anno-\ntating the remaining documents in the conspiracy sub-\ncorpus for both seeds. An overview of the complete\nset of annotations is shown in Table 4. Here the con-\nspiracy rate refers to the percentage of documents of\na subcorpus that were annotated as CT by our annota-\ntors. We see that for both seeds, the conspiracy rate is\nvery low for mainstream documents (0.020 for SandyHook and 0.0 for coronavirus). However, the rate is\nalso rather low for the CT documents, showing that less\nthan 2/3 of the documents in the Sandy Hook CT sub-\ncorpus, and less than half of the documents in the coro-\nnavirus CT subcorpus, actually contain CT language.\nThe relatedness rate refers to the percentage of docu-\nments that were labeled as closely or broadly related to\nthe seed CT by the annotators. Here we see a similar\ntrend to the Sandy Hook CT subcorpora, a much higher\nrate for the coronavirus CT subcorpus, and lower rates\nfor the mainstream subcorpora: 0.780 for Sandy Hook\nand 0.850 for coronavirus. These numbers show very\nclearly that the two retrieval strategies work qualita-\ntively differently for different CT seeds.\n9. Conclusion and Future Work\nWe have investigated the annotation of documents in\nthe LOCO corpus for the presence of language that\nindicated a belief in conspiracy theories. Our experi-\nments show that the automatic retrieval methods used\nto create the LOCO corpus reach different levels of\nconspiracy content and relatedness for the two seeds\nthat we used for our investigation. We also find that\ndistinguishing between CT and non-CT is a difficult\nand subjective task. Our annotation guidelines can help\nwith consistent decisions across different annotators\nand can be used across different CTs. We do notice a\ndeterioration of inter-annotator agreement in some met-\nrics, but these can be partly explained by the underlying\ndifferences in terms of the ratios of conspiracy content\nand relatedness. However, this needs deeper probing.\nFor the future, we are considering an extension of the\nCT annotation to include a concept similar to CThink-\ning by Introne et al. (2020), to better handle doc-\numents such as the one in Figure 3. More gener-\nally, we plan to use the annotated texts for creating a\nclassifier to detect CT language across different CTs.\nThe annotations will be publicly available at https:\n//github.com/zytian9/locoAnnotations.\n10.

Bot campaigns have\nbeen deployed for both economic scams and\npolitical interference, making it necessary to\ndevelop a system to detect these agents and ana-\nlyze their behavior. We present a scalable appli-\ncation designed to identify bots and to buttress\nthe investigation of disinformation campaigns.\nOur intention is to provide professionals with-\nout technical expertise with an effective tool\nto identify and analyze content generated by\nbots. This will enable researchers from diverse\nbackgrounds to study bot activity, fostering an\ninterdisciplinary understanding of the strategies\nthese agents use to spread disinformation, and\nthe characteristics of their discourse. We illus-\ntrate how to use the application through a case\nstudy on COVID-19.\n1 Introduction\nIn a world characterized by an increasing global-\nization and the rapid dissemination of information,\nmany decisions are influenced by publicly acces-\nsible information obtained through online sources.\nIn 2021, more than 50 %of Twitter\u2019s users were\nobtaining news directly from the platform (Pew\nResearch Center, 2021). Individuals who rely on\nsocial media for news tend to exhibit reduced en-\ngagement with news and possess limited knowl-\nedge regarding a wide range of current events (Pew\nResearch Center, 2020). This creates an exploitable\nopportunity for malicious actors to manipulate pub-\nlic opinion or deceive unsuspecting users through\ndisinformation, posing a threat to the 16th Sus-\ntainable Development Goal of the United Nations,\nwhich aims for an inclusive and peaceful society\n(Bontcheva et al., 2020).\nOne of these malicious agents are bots, software\nprograms that can mimic human behavior on social\n\u2217*Corresponding author: josemanuel.camacho@icmat.esnetworks like Twitter. They have played a signif-\nicant role in the dissemination of low credibility\ncontent (Shao et al., 2018), and their presence con-\ntinues to grow within the discourse of democratic\nprocesses (Pastor-Galindo et al., 2020). Moreover,\nthey can be combined with Large Language Models\nto generate counterfeit news and fabricate speech\nthat resembles that of a human (De Angelis et al.,\n2023). Given the limited effectiveness of current\nmethods for detecting non-human content (Pego-\nraro et al., 2023), it is crucial to adopt a differ-\nent perspective. Instead of solely focusing on the\naccuracy of the content, an alternative approach\nis to identify bots based on their behavior, which\ncan be inferred from the analysis of their metadata.\nBased on bot detection techniques, it is also possi-\nble to expose disinformation campaigns that have\nthe potential to influence critical decision-making\nprocesses.\nWIDISBOT1has been developed to address the\nchallenge of scrutinizing the dissemination of dis-\ninformation by bots in Twitter. This tool employs a\nscalable machine learning model and enables the\nanalysis of bot discourse in tweets, making compar-\nisons with human users participating in the same\npublic conversations. This discourse analysis com-\nprises the examination of sentiment, hashtags, and\nthe usage of the most shared URLs or hashtags.\nBuilt using Streamlit2, the primary goal of this\nwidget is to offer professionals with non-technical\nexpertise an effective means for examining how\nbots propagate disinformation. It empowers them\nto contribute to research on these agents and en-\nhance the field with insights from diverse disci-\nplines. By enhancing interdisciplinary research,\nwe facilitate the development of information con-\nsumption security frameworks and contribute to\nsafeguard digital societies.\n1The application is available at: https://github.\ncom/jmcamachor1/WIDISBOT\n2https://streamlit.io/\n514\n2 Related works\nResearch on bot detection has significantly in-\ncreased over the last decade, leading to the de-\nvelopment of various methods, with supervised\nlearning being the most widely adopted approach\n(Cresci, 2020). A conspicuous example of a su-\npervised method is demonstrated in (Yang et al.,\n2020), where the account\u2019s metadata is utilized to\nconstruct a scalable detector. Another popular al-\nternative for bot detection is unsupervised learning,\nwhich does not rely on labeled datasets. An illus-\ntrative instance of this method is given in (Mazza\net al., 2019), where the identification of bot ac-\ncounts is constructed upon the analysis of the tem-\nporal patterns of retweeting behavior. One popular\nmethod for modeling bot behavior involves gener-\nating a string, similar to a DNA chain, that can en-\ncode different aspects of bot behavior (Cresci et al.,\n2017). This modeling can be exploited from both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning methods. An\nadditional alternative is to employ an adversarial\napproach (Najari et al., 2022), which mitigates the\nimpact of evasion techniques on bot detection.\nBot detection models have been integrated into\nuser-friendly software, making them accessible to\nindividuals with no technical expertise. One no-\ntable example is Botometer (Sayyadiharikandeh\net al., 2020), which enables users to predict the like-\nlihood of an account being a bot by leveraging over\n1200 features. Otherwise, Bot Detective (Kouvela\net al., 2020) offers a web service powered by an\nexplainable method for detecting bots. BotSlayer\nintroduces a system with a dashboard to visualize\nthe users who are sharing content that matches a\ngiven Twitter query (Hui et al., 2019, 2020). The\nsystem provides various metrics and allows content\nfiltering based on entities such as hashtags, user\nhandles, and links. One of these metrics focuses on\nassessing the likelihood of an account being a bot,\nwhich can be accomplished using different rules\nor bot detection models. Combining BotSlayer\nwith Hoaxy enables the analysis of the spread of\ndisinformation associated with bots and their cor-\nresponding fact-checking responses (Shao et al.,\n2016).\nOur approach, WIDISBOT, facilitates the com-\nparison of discourse between bots and humans\nwithin a specific conversation on Twitter. Users\ncan input either a Twitter query or tweets IDs, en-\nabling further analysis of tweets datasets. WIDIS-\nBOT offers an interface to visualize disparities indiscourse between automated and genuine users by\napplying sentiment and words frequency analysis.\nAdditionally, WIDISBOT supports in-depth exami-\nnation of fabricated content that is propagated by\nthese entities.\n3 Application description\nThis section presents an overview of the appli-\ncation\u2019s functionalities and the machine learning\n(ML) models empowering them. Initially, we out-\nline the application capabilities, followed by a de-\nscription of the models. When analyzing tweets\nthrough the various functionalities, the input for-\nmat requires Tweet Objects obtained via the Twitter\nAPI, and the related User Object representing the\ntweet author.\n3.1 Functionalities\nBelow, we describe the application functionalities:\n\u2022Data extraction (DE). It enables the retrieval\nof tweets by connecting to the API. Therefore,\nvalid credentials are necessary. These can\nbe for any version of the Twitter API (v1.1,\nv2). The retrieved data is then normalized in\nthe structure of v1.1 Tweet Objects and User\nObjects. In particular, the user may extract\ntweets by ID, or via search containing a cer-\ntain keyword, hashtag or URL on a specific\ndate. This functionality is limited by Twitter\nAPI restrictions and rate limits. The generated\ndataset can then be used as an entry to any\nother WIDISBOT functionality.\n\u2022Monitoring (M). It identifies which of the in-\nput tweets were generated by bots or humans.\nAdditionally, it plots the probability distribu-\ntion that the accounts that posted those tweets\nwere bots, as well as the proportion of those\naccounts that were labelled as bots or humans\nand the number of tweets produced by each\naccount type.\n\u2022Forensics (F). Given the accounts\u2019 usernames,\nit computes the likelihood of them being bots,\nallowing the results to be presented in an ag-\ngregated manner.\n\u2022Sentiment analysis (SA). It computes the sen-\ntiment of the input tweets, displaying the hu-\nman/bot sentiment distribution in both a dis-\ncrete (positive-negative-neutral) and continu-\nous fashion.\n515\nTest datasets\nbotwiki-verified cresci-rtbust- 2019 gilani-2017 kaiser cr\nesci-stock-2018 midterm-2018\nLight (v1.1) .990 .613 .631 .944 .631 .964\nLight (v.2) .975 .518 .580 .936 .653 .947\nBotometer v3 .922 .625 .689 .829 .756 .958\nTable 1: AUC scores of the bot detection models on different datasets3. The botwiki-verified is formed through\nmerging datasets botwiki-2019 andverified-2019.\n\u2022Hashtag analysis (HA). It allows the visualiza-\ntion of the most frequently used hashtags by\nboth humans and bots within the input tweets.\nThis functionality is not case-sensitive, as bots\nmay utilize variations of the same hashtag to\npromote diverse content.\n\u2022Wordcloud (W). It provides a visualization\nof the 25 most frequent words on the tweets\nshared by bots and humans.\n\u2022Analysis of spread sources (ASS). It displays\nthe most shared URLs by bots and humans.\nIt is connected to the Wayback Machine4to\nretrieve the content from deleted websites, as\ncontent spread by bots is often removed after\na certain time. The app also provides access to\nMedia Bias Fact Check5to determine the bias\nof a media and if it is a non-reliable source.\n\u2022Analysis of discourse around hashtags (ADH).\nIt enables the utilization of the functionalities\nM,SA,HA,ASSon tweets that contain a spe-\ncific hashtag, allowing for the analysis of how\nthe discourse surrounding the given hashtag\nis influenced by both bots and humans.\nThe classification of input accounts as bots or\nhumans is conducted using a threshold specified\nby the user. A higher threshold leads to a more\ncautious approach by the model in determining\nwhich accounts are classified as bots. It is advis-\nable to utilize a threshold of at least 0.51, although\nhigher thresholds can be employed for a more con-\nservative analysis. Additionally, the application\nenables users to download files with the results\nof the various functionalities for further analysis,\neither manually or in another application.\n3.2 Machine Learning models\nWe provide details about the bot detection and sen-\ntiment analysis models integrated into the widget,\npowering the previous functionalities.\n4https://archive.org/web/\n5https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/Bot detection The widget utilizes the Light\nmodel from (Antenore et al., 2022) if the input\nTweet objects are in Twitter API v1.1 format. How-\never, if the input tweets are in API v2 format, we\nemploy an adapted version of the model that does\nnot consider features inaccessible in API v2 but\navailable in v1.1. These models offer scalability,\nrequiring only a Tweet object to forecast whether\nan account is a bot. Table 1demonstrates their ef-\nfectiveness in detecting various types of bots. Fur-\nthermore, they achieve comparable performance to\nBotometer v3 (Yang et al., 2019), a widely used\nmethod for Twitter bot detection (Rauchfleisch and\nKaiser, 2020). Additionally, since the model solely\nrelies on language-agnostic features, it can predict\ntweets irrespective of their language.\nSentiment analyzer The app employs V ADER\n(Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) as the sentiment analysis\nmodel. V ADER utilizes a lexicon to assign scores\nto each word, which are subsequently combined\nusing five rules that consider grammatical and syn-\ntactical aspects. The output is a unidimensional\ncontinuous metric ( y) ranging from -1 (most nega-\ntive) to 1 (most positive). To categorize ydiscretely,\nwe use the thresholds provided by the authors: posi-\ntive if y >0.05, negative if y <\u22120.05 , and neutral\nif\u22120.05 \u2264y\u22640.05. V ADER is computationally\nefficient and scalable. Additionally, it performs\nwell across various domains, particularly in analyz-\ning microblogging content. In fact, according to\n(Ribeiro et al., 2016), it is an effective method for\npredicting three-class sentiment in social network\nmessages.\n4 Case study\nThis section displays how the application could be\nused to study bots\u2019 role on a potential disinforma-\ntion campaign. For illustrative purposes, we have\nselected a set of 527 tweets used in experiments\nin (Antenore et al., 2022) from 7th February 2020\nthat contain the words \u2018Trump\u2019 and \u2018deathtoll\u2019, and\ntheir subvariants. These tweets were produced at\nthe start of the COVID-19 pandemic when there\n516\nFigure 1: Screenshots of WIDISBOT output. (Left) Proportion of accounts in the subset labelled as bots/humans\nand the fraction of tweets produced by each type. (Right) Sentiment distribution in human/bots tweets.\nwas still much uncertainty about the health crisis.\nWe aim to display how to use the widget to study\nwhether bots intended to promote certain content by\ntaking advantage of the crisis situation. We follow\nthe steps below to carry out the tweets\u2019 analysis:\n1.Analysis of bot presence. Utilising the M\nfunctionality, we examined the proportion of\ntweets produced by bots compared to humans.\nIn Figure 1(left) we observe that a smaller\nnumber of bots produced a larger proportion\nof the total tweets than humans, an indication\nthat bots are interested to promote content in\nthis conversation.\n2.Checking differences in sentiment. Another in-\ndication of bot activity may be differences\nin the sentiment distribution between bots\nand humans. We used the SAfunctionality\nto determine if any differences were present.\nSpecifically, as depicted in Figure 1(right), we\nobserved substantial discrepancies, evidence\nabout the different content that bots and hu-\nmans are sharing.\n3.Checking differences between hashtags.\nThrough the HAfunctionality, we examined\nhow hashtags were used by both groups\nof accounts. The results for the 10 most\nused hashtags by bots and humans are\ndepicted in Figure 2. We observed that bots\nused more hashtags and, while there was a\nstair-like shape in the human case, the bots\n5Datasets are accesible in https://botometer.\nosome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets.\nhtmlhad several hashtags with the same number\nof occurrences. This may be an indication\nthat bots are promoting their content using\nmultiple hashtags in the same tweets.\n4.Studying tweets with a certain hashtag. We\nstudied hashtag #deathtoll as it was highly\nshared by bots, but not at the same rate as the\nfirst six hashtags, and it was not among the\nmost frequently used hashtags by humans. We\nutilized the ASH functionality and discovered\nthat only one human and one bot posted tweets\nwith the hashtag. However, the bot produced\n44 tweets while the human produced only one.\nFurthermore, we examined the URLs shared\nby the bot on these tweets, observing that it\nshared 34 times the same URL.\n5.Analysis of the most shared URLs. We\nbrowsed the most shared URL by the bot, find-\ning out that it is no longer available. To check\nthe content, we used the ASS functionality\nand retrieved the website content during the\nperiod when the tweet was produced. Figure\n3displays the website. It can be observed that\nsome content is advertised, such as how to\nsurvive without medication or publicity about\nmasks. Hence, we have uncovered that the\nidentified bot was disseminating content that\ncould potentially contribute to disinformation\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\n5 Discussion\nThis paper introduces WIDISBOT, a widget specif-\nically developed to identify automated accounts on\n517\nFigure 2: Ten most shared hashtags by bots and humans.\nTwitter and analyze the content they promote in\ncomparison to human users. By offering various\nfunctionalities, our aim is to provide application\nusers with a comprehensive perspective on the in-\nformation disseminated by both genuine users and\nbots. Additionally, we present a use case demon-\nstrating how the widget can be utilized to uncover\ncampaigns that potentially propagate disinforma-\ntion during COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have developed a user-friendly system uti-\nlizing Streamlit, which features an intuitive inter-\nface specifically designed for non-technical users,\nsuch as journalists and social scientists engaged in\nresearching the spread of disinformation by bots.\nThe widget demonstrates scalability and serves\nas an effective tool for examining disparities in\ncontent between human and automated accounts,\nand it is compatible with different Twitter API ac-\ncess. Future extensions of the widget will con-\nsist of incorporating more ML models to analyze\nother aspects of bot discourse, such as determin-\nFigure 3: Screenshot of the most shared website by bots\nin tweets with hashtag #deathtoll , accessed through\nthe Wayback Machine.\ning whether certain content constitutes any form\nof hate speech. Furthermore, it will be integrated\nwith other applications that concentrate on iden-\ntifying specific forms of misinformation, such as\n(Arroyo Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2023), in order to bol-\nster the versatility of WIDISBOT within specific\ncontexts.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Spanish Ministry\nof Science program PID2021-124662OB-I00;\na fellowship from \u201dla Caixa\u201d Foundation\n(ID 100010434), whose code is LCF/BQ/\nDI21/11860063; and Grant PLEC2021-007681\n(project XAI-DisInfodemics) funded by\nMCIN/AEI/ 10.13039/501100011033 and\nby European Union NextGeneration EU/PRTR;\nand BBV A Foundation project AMALFI.\nReferences\nMarzia Antenore, Jose Manuel Camacho Rodriguez,\nand Emanuele Panizzi. 2022.

AEJMC, Washington, DC,\nUSA, 14 pages.\n1 Introduction\nFrames are predominantly explored using qualitative methods [e.g.,\nMorin 2016] and quantitative methods [e.g., McKeever et al .2022]\nthrough manual labor and analysis of small datasets. The recent\nproliferation of online news reports and social media posts has\nresulted in the generation of a vast amount of digital data that is\ndifficult to analyze manually. To overcome this challenge, scholars\nhave started using various computational methods, broadly divided\ninto two parts: supervised and unsupervised [Ali and Hassan 2022].\nThe supervised methods require pre-determined labels and substan-\ntial human labor, while the unsupervised methods that this current\nresearch focuses on need little human effort and are applicable\nacross domains.\nExisting unsupervised methods (e.g., topic modeling) in framing\nanalysis mainly rely on the frequency and co-occurrence of words,\nThis research received the Top Method Paper Award at AEJMC 2023.\nAEJMC, Washington, DC\n\u00a92023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Published under Creative Commons\nCC-BY 4.0 License.leading to the exploration of topics instead of deeper framing in-\nsights [Ali and Hassan 2022; Entman 1993; Nicholls and Culpepper\n2021]. An improved unsupervised computational solution to this\nlongstanding communication challenge is becoming essential in\nthis era of big data. Scholars [e.g., Ali and Hassan 2022] advocate\nfor methods to capture semantic relationships between words, mov-\ning beyond the traditional bag-of-words approach to enhance the\nmethodological framework. In response to these calls, this arti-\ncle examines semantic relationships between words, presenting a\nnovel unsupervised approach for computational framing analysis\nbased on dependency parsing, a natural language processing (NLP)\ntechnique largely overlooked in framing analysis.\nThis mixed-method article involves two studies. Study 1 employs\na qualitative textual analysis to inductively examine a sample of\nnews reports published by four major U.S. news media outlets on the\n2022 Uvalde school mass shooting in Texas, as a case study. While\nthe political impasse and public debate continue over gun violence,\nit is important to understand how news media outlets frame the\nissue, as media framing determines how people \u201cchoose to act\nupon [the problem]\u201d [Entman 1993, p. 54]. Study 1 examines how\nindividual words, such as adjectives and adverbs, convey different\nmeanings related to the shooter, victims, and the shooting event.\nThis helps us understand how these words and their semantic\nrelationships work together to construct frames. Study 2 employs\nthe computational technique of dependency parsing to analyze\nthe same dataset. Specifically, we investigate dependency parsing,\nalong with word embedding, k-means clustering, and manual input,\nestablishing this method as a viable approach for capturing semantic\nrelationships and analyzing the entity-centric emphasis frames.\nIntegrating qualitative and quantitative approaches in this project\nprovides complementary strengths essential for developing the\nmethodological approach. The qualitative analysis in Study 1 of-\nfers interpretive depth by first manually uncovering whether and\nhow specific words and their semantic relationships contribute to\nframe construction in natural language. This inductive insight helps\nground the methodological design. Through quantitative computa-\ntional techniques, Study 2 validates and extends this insight from\nStudy 1 by systematically extracting these patterns computation-\nally. Together, the two studies demonstrate that semantic structures,\ncaptured through dependency parsing, can reliably identify em-\nphasis frames, laying the foundation for a scalable, unsupervised\ncomputational framing analysis model.\n1\nAEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC Ali and Hassan\nThe outcomes of both studies are discussed. Importantly, this\nmixed-method project solidified and proposed the semantic relations-\nbased approach for framing analysis, named \u201cSemantic Relations-\nbased Unsupervised Framing Analysis.\u201d The step-by-step procedure\nfor applying this approach, along with its strengths, limitations,\nand future research directions, is also discussed.\n2 Literature Review\n2.1 Framing\nScholars have not reached a consensus on a unified definition of\nframing [Goffman 1974; Hertog and McLeod 2001]. However, one of\nthe most widely cited definitions in framing studies comes from Ent-\nman [1993], who posits:\nTo frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality\nand make them more salient in a communicating text,\nin such a way as to promote a particular problem defi-\nnition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or\ntreatment recommendation for the item described. (p.\n52)\nIn the news media context, a frame is \u201ca central organizing\nidea\u201d [Tankard et al .1991], and it \u201cdenotes how journalists, their\nsources, and audiences work within conditions that shape the mes-\nsages they construct as well as the ways they understand and in-\nterpret these messages\u201d [D\u2019Angelo and D\u2019Angelo 2018, p. xxiv].\nGoing beyond the idea of a simple topic, news framing is \u201clike\nmoving a telescope into position\u201d [Fairhurst 2005, p. 125], where\nselected aspects are coherently organized in a way that makes an\nargument, promoting a particular interpretation, evaluation, and\nsolution [Fairhurst 2005]. Importantly, a frame \u201coperates by selecting\nand highlighting some features of reality while omitting others\u201d [Ent-\nman 1993, p. 53]. Echoing with this, Fairhurst and Sarr [1996] notes\nthat a frame is \u201cto choose one particular meaning (or set of meanings)\nover another\u201d (p. 3).\n2.2 Emphasis vs. Equivalency Framing\nThe concept of framing revolves around two broad competing as-\npects: emphasis framing and equivalency framing. Equivalency\nframing involves presenting two or more alternatives with logically\nequivalent phrases (e.g., loss versus gain) Kahneman and Tversky\n[1984]; Levin et al .[1998]. In contrast, emphasis framing refers to\nthe act of repeatedly highlighting or associating certain pieces of\ninformation about an issue or topic, while omitting other relevant\naspects D\u2019Angelo [2017]. This article focuses on analyzing emphasis\nframing with the newly proposed computational approach.\n2.3 Words in Constructing Frames\nScholars have long identified words and phrases that construct\nframes. Prior studies revealed that using certain words helps iden-\ntify frames [Entman 1993; Fairhurst and Sarr 1996; Gamson and\nModigliani 1989; Hertog and McLeod 2001]. For example, \u201cthe use\nofbaby versus fetus signals a very different approach to the topic of\nabortion\u201d [Hertog and McLeod 2001, p. 150]. Prior framing studies\nlooked at various parts of speeches, including verbs, adverbs, and\nadjectives, which enhances researchers\u2019 ability to identify frameboundaries and relationships [Hertog and McLeod 2001]. The fre-\nquent use of verbs such as \u201cfalsifying,\u201d \u201cforging,\u201d and \u201cmanipulating\u201d\nwas found to have been utilized in news reports to frame scien-\ntists [Boesman and Van Gorp 2018]. News reporters also use various\nverbs of attribution (e.g., accused, charged, blamed) to create worth\nfor one person while devaluing another [Dickerson 2001].\n2.4 Conceptualization and Operationalization\nof the Framing Component\nPrior studies provide evidence for using words in constructing\nframes [Hertog and McLeod 2001; Miller 1995]. When a particular\nword is selected or coded as part of a frame, this word directly\nor indirectly operates in relation to other words to express the\nintended framing meaning. In other words, framing meanings are\noften produced not by isolated words but through their associative\nuse with surrounding words, particularly when an entity is modified\nby adjectives, adverbs, or verbs.\nFor example, Bantimaroudis and Ban [2001] reported how Somali\nleaders were framed by U.S. news media through the repeated use\nof the term \u201cwarlords\u201d in contrast to their opposition, the United\nNations forces. They interpreted the frame by exposing how ex-\ntensively the word \u201cwarlords\u201d was used in the news media cover-\nage. This current research argues that the word \u201cwarlords\u201d alone\ndoes not sufficiently convey a practical meaning for understanding\nthe frame about Somali leaders. Instead, we better understand the\nintended frame when the word \u201cwarlords\u201d is seen as an adjective\nmodifier to its noun, \u201cMohammed Siad Barre, \u201d forming a phrase like\n\u201cwarlord Barre.\u201d In this context, the framing component emerges\nfrom a meaningful semantic pair, a modifying word and its head\nnoun, which together construct the framing meaning.\nCrucially, this pair of words is bound by a meaningful semantic\nrelation. For example, in the dependency parsing output of natural\nlanguage processing, the noun \u201cBarre\u201d and its modifier \u201cwarlord\u201d\nare linked by an adjectival modifier relation (known as \u201camod\u201d).\nBased on this linguistic structure, this current research conceptu-\nalizes a framing component as \u201ca pair of words connected by a\nmeaningful semantic relation.\u201d The modifying word may belong\nto various parts of speech, such as adjectives (e.g., young shooter),\nverbs (e.g., shooter kills), or even participles and modal verbs (e.g.,\nshooter accused of [killing]).\nIn qualitative textual and quantitative content analyses that rely\non manual labor, scholars might code the keyword \u201cwarlord,\u201d keep-\ning other parts (e.g., noun and semantic relation) in mind, and con-\nsider its semantic context during interpretation to explore meaning-\nful insights. However, for computational analysis, capturing such\nsemantic structures explicitly becomes essential for scaling framing\nanalysis to large datasets.\nTo this end, this current research operationalizes a framing com-\nponent as a pair of words connected by a meaningful semantic re-\nlation, specifically identified using dependency parsing techniques.\nFor instance, adjective-noun (amod) or verb-subject (nsubj) relation-\nships are used to detect modifier-entity structures, such as \u201cteenage\ngunman\u201d or \u201cshooter kills.\u201d These semantic relations are compu-\ntationally extracted from the dependency tree of each sentence.\nBy identifying the framing components in the semantic relations-\nbased structure, this approach allows for systematic extraction of\n2\nSemantic-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA): A Novel Approach for Computational Framing Analysis AEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC\nentity-modifier pairs in large datasets, ensuring both consistency\nand scalability. This operationalization is particularly well-suited\nfor analyzing entity-centric frames, as it captures how individuals,\norganizations, or groups are framed through specific modifying\nwords in large datasets.\n2.5 Framing Analysis with Computational\nApproaches\nTraditionally, researchers utilize qualitative and quantitative meth-\nods to analyze frames, relying on manual labor and small amounts\nof data [D\u2019Angelo and D\u2019Angelo 2018; Reese et al .2001]. To tackle\nthe challenge of analyzing frames in large-scale datasets, scholars\nhave begun using computational approaches\u2014both supervised and\nunsupervised\u2014in the last two decades [e.g., Card et al .2015; Liu\net al. 2019; Van Atteveldt and Peng 2018; Walter and Ophir 2019].\nSupervised. A supervised approach needs pre-labeled datasets.\nIn this approach, a model is first trained on the labeled data and then\napplied to a new dataset to classify or predict each instance [Kot-\nsiantis et al .2007]. Under the supervised framing analysis ap-\nproach, [Liu et al .2019] proposed a deep learning-based model\ndeveloped with manual codes of headlines of news reports relating\nto gun violence.\nUnsupervised. An unsupervised approach does not require any\npre-annotated datasets. Instead, it inductively explores all unlabeled\ndata [Kotsiantis et al .2007]. Existing unsupervised approaches used\nto analyze frames include topic modeling [DiMaggio et al .2013],\nstructural topic modeling [Gilardi et al .2021], hierarchical topic\nmodeling [Nguyen 2015], cluster analysis [Burscher et al .2016],\nfrequency-based models [Sanderink 2020], and FrameAxis [Kwak\net al.2021]. Compared to supervised models, unsupervised ones\ndemand less time and can be replicated across domains.\nSemantic relations. Existing unsupervised computational ap-\nproaches for framing analysis are mainly based on the ideas of\nfrequency and co-occurrences of words, resulting in the identifi-\ncation of discussion topics or themes, instead of frames [Ali and\nHassan 2022]. Such topics do not provide a coherent framing in-\nterpretation. As per the framing conceptualization [Entman 1993;\nReese et al .2001], semantic relations among words are a key to\ngoing deeper into frames, compared to the current bag-of-words-\nbased practices, such as topic modeling. This limitation calls for\nexploring an unsupervised technique to capture semantic relations\namong words for better identifying frames. This article intends\nto fill the gap by focusing on unsupervised methods of framing\nanalysis.\nAlthough a few studies attempted to address the task with seman-\ntic relations, their approaches are not sufficiently comprehensive or\nsupervised from the data analysis perspective. For example, [Stur-\ndza et al .2018] describes an approach of operationalizing frames\nusing a rule-based system with a software named TurboParser.\nHowever, the author did not execute it using a dataset, leaving its\nusefulness unclear. A recent study by Ziems and Yang [2021] pro-\nposes an NLP framework to understand the frames of an entity or\nissue (e.g., victims in police violence) with relevant attributes (e.g.,\nage, gender, race). However, they pre-determined the attributes and\nthen string-matched relevant tokens as a way of framing particular\nentities, which is also considered supervised.Another study by van Atteveldt et al .[2013] presents a computa-\ntional framing analysis method based on semantic relations. Their\napproach is also a kind of supervised task, as it first determines\nand labels particular frames and then identifies occurrences of each\npre-determined frame in the dataset. Framing analysis scholars in\nrecent studies [e.g., Ali and Hassan 2022; Nicholls and Culpepper\n2021] call for exploring semantic relations for improved framing\nnuances.\nTherefore, this research seeks to fill the gap by offering and\nadvancing a semantic relations-based unsupervised approach for\nframing analysis through two studies\u2014qualitative textual analysis\nand computational analysis. Both studies examine a sample of 100\nnews reports published by four major U.S. news media outlets on\nthe 2022 Texas school mass shooting.\n2.6 Gun Violence and Framing Analysis\nGun violence is a widely studied area in the U.S., as the mass shoot-\ning problem has been on the rise for years [El-Bawab 2022]. The\nbody of gun violence research involves various other issues, such\nas mental illness [McGinty et al .2014], frames [Morin 2016], and\npublic health issues [McKeever et al .2022]. Analyzing a sample of\nnews articles on serious mental illness and gun violence, McGinty\net al.[2014] found that \"dangerous people\" with serious mental\nillness were more likely to be mentioned as a cause of gun vio-\nlence than \u201cdangerous weapons. \u201d A recent study by McKeever et al .\n[2022] conducted an online survey (N=510) and found gun control\nand gun rights as the two salience frames. They also revealed that\npeople held individuals responsible for gun violence and identified\nbackground checks as the most salient solution.\n2.7 Attribution Theory\nThe root of frames is drawn from the assumptions outlined in attri-\nbution theory (AT) [Heider 2013; Kelley 1973; Pan and Kosicki 1993].\nSo, this research analyzes and explains frames through the lens of\nAT. Originally developed within social psychology, the theory pri-\nmarily describes how people explain and perceive the causes of an\nindividual\u2019s behavior [Heider 2013; McLeod 2010]. While defining\nthe theory, Kelley [1973] says:\nAttribution theory is a theory about how people make\ncausal explanations, about how they answer questions\nbeginning with \"why?\" It deals with the information\nthey use in making causal inferences, and with what\nthey do with this information to answer causal ques-\ntions. (p. 107).\nAs na\u00efve psychologists, people tend to make two broad types of\ncausal attributions: a) dispositional attributions and b) situational\nattributions [Heider 2013; Kelley 1973]. Dispositional attributions\npoint to an individual\u2019s internal factors as being responsible for\nan incident. For example, in a car crash, labeling people\u2019s reckless\ndriving behavior as a cause could be a dispositional attribution.\nSituational attributions refer to factors that exist outside an indi-\nvidual and are prevalent in specific situations. In the same example,\nattributing the snowy road as a cause could be considered a situa-\ntional factor. Two prominent frameworks provide potential factors\nand insights that shape people\u2019s perceptions of dispositional and\n3\nAEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC Ali and Hassan\nsituational attributions. These are the covariation model [Kelley\n1973] and the correspondent inference [Jones and Davis 1965].\n2.8 Covariation model\nThe covariation model of Kelley [1973] identified three potential\nfactors leading to causal perceptions. These are consensus, distinc-\ntiveness, and consistency. 1) Consensus is related to a person or\nentity that explains how many individuals behave in the same way.\nHigh consensus indicates a higher level of situational attribution.\n2) Distinctiveness is related to the situations that explain how an\nindividual behaves in other similar situations. High distinctiveness\nindicates a higher level of situational attribution. 3) Consistency\nis related to time, which explains how frequently an individual\u2019s\nbehavior occurs. High consistency indicates a higher level of dispo-\nsitional attributions [Kelley 1973].\n2.9 Correspondent inference\nJones and Davis [1965] offered three key factors in inferring causal\nattributions. 1) People\u2019s degree of choice: A freely chosen behav-\nior is considered to infer an individual\u2019s dispositional attributions\ncompared to forced behavior. 2) Social desirability of behavior:\nAn individual\u2019s behavior that is low in social desirability or so-\ncial expectedness is more likely to make dispositional attributions\ncompared to high social desirability. 3) Intended consequence of\nbehavior: People infer an individual\u2019s behavior as dispositional,\nespecially when the behavior\u2019s intended consequence is negative\nand harmful to people.\n2.10 Case: 2022 Uvalde School Shooting\nThis study analyzes media coverage of a mass shooting that oc-\ncurred on May 24, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas. An 18-year-old former\nstudent named Salvador Ramos entered Robb Elementary School\nwith an AR-15-style rifle and opened fire [Peck and Goodman 2022;\nSandoval 2023]. The shooting resulted in the deaths of 19 students\nand two teachers and the injuries of 17 others [Jacobo and El-Bawab\n2022; Peck and Goodman 2022; Shooting nd]. The Uvalde school\nshooting is one of the deadliest shootings in the United States in\nterms of the number of casualties Shooting [nd].\nThe mass shooting incident received extensive coverage in local,\nnational, and international news media [Kellner 2025], sparking\noutrage and reigniting long-standing debates over gun control and\nschool safety and calls for action [Livingston 2022]. News media\ncoverage of the Uvalde shooting evolved over time [Kellner 2025].\nSoon after the incident, the then-President of the United States, Joe\nBiden, visited Texas to console the victims and pledged to act [Liv-\ningston 2022; The Biden White House Achieve 2022]. Within a\nmonth of the Uvalde school mass shooting that occurred 10 days\nafter another shooting in Buffalo, New York, a gun safety legisla-\ntion was passed by the Senate and Congress and then signed by\nthe President on June 25, 2022. The gun safety law is reported as\nthe first of its kind in the previous 30 years [Clyde and Miranda\n2022]. As the deadliest mass shooting in recent years and drawing\nwidespread media coverage, the Uvalde elementary school shooting\nhas been purposively selected for this study.3 Study 1: Qualitative Textual Analysis\nThis study focuses on an in-depth examination of the usage pat-\nterns of specific words, such as adjectives and adverbs, and their\nsemantic relations in constructing frames. Typically, computational\ntools and traditional research methods, such as qualitative and\nquantitative methods, are broadly pursued as separate lines of in-\nquiry into frames. However, this study seeks to bridge this divide\nby utilizing the insights of inductive qualitative research to inform\ncomputational approaches in framing analysis.\nFor this analysis, we purposively selected the 2022 mass shooting\nas a case that took place at Robb Elementary School. Specifically,\nwe looked at how news media outlets in the right-leaning (a.k.a.\nWSJ and Fox News) and left-leaning categories (a.k.a. NYT and\nCNN) use selected modifying words (e.g., adjectives and adverbs)\nstructured in a semantic pattern to frame the shooter, victims, and\nthe event.\nTherefore, the following research questions are asked for explo-\nration:\nRQ1: How do right-leaning and left-leaning news media outlets\nuse words and phrases to construct frames while covering the 2022\nmass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Texas?\nRQ2: How do the right-leaning and left-leaning news media\noutlets frame the shooter, victims, and the mass shooting event at\nthe Robb Elementary school in Texas?\nRQ3: How do the semantic relations of words in the Texas mass\nshooting news reports inform the computational analysis of frames?\n4 Study 1 Method\nTo answer RQs, study 1 used qualitative textual analysis, a widely\nused approach to analyze frames inductively [Hertog and McLeod\n2001]. It fits with the study\u2019s purpose of inductively analyzing news\nreports to gain an in-depth understanding of frames, word usage\npatterns, and their semantic relations to constructing frames [Ent-\nman 1993]. Qualitative textual analysis is \u201call about language, what\nit represents and how we use it to make sense of our [social reali-\nties]\u201d [Brennen 2017, p. 203]. While exploring \"how texts operate\nto produce meaning\u201d [Browne 2009, p. 53], the qualitative anal-\nysis helps \u201cmake an educated guess at some of the most likely\ninterpretations that might be made of that text\u201d [McKee 2001, p. 1].\n4.1 Data Collection\nWe collected a total of 100 news reports, including 600 news head-\nlines and paragraphs, published by four news media outlets on the\n2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Texas. Each of them in-\ncludes ten news reports on the shooting that took place on May 24,\n2022. Of the news outlets, The New York Times (NYT) and Cable News\nNetwork (CNN) are selected as the left-leaning news media, and the\nWall Street Journal (WSJ) and Fox News as the right-leaning news\nmedia [Check nd]. The news media outlets were categorized based\non their bias scores provided by Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC). The\nMBFC is a non-partisan American independent site that provides\nbias scores for media outlets [Check nd; Odhner 2022].\nIt is important to acknowledge that although Fox News andThe\nWall Street Journal are both considered right-leaning according to\nMBFC scores, they differ in tone and editorial focus. As noted by\nAd Fontes Media (2024), Fox News tends to be more partisan in its\n4\nSemantic-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA): A Novel Approach for Computational Framing Analysis AEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC\nopinion content, whereas The Wall Street Journal is comparatively\nmore centrist in its news reporting [Media nd] (\u201cAd Fontes Media,\u201d\nn.d.). For the purposes of this study, both outlets were categorized\non the right side of the media bias spectrum.\nUsing purposive sampling, we used the keywords \u201c(Texas OR\nUvalde) AND (\u201cshoot*\u201d)\u201d and searched articles on Factiva, a global\nnews database, for these four news media outlets separately from\nMay 24 to 31, 2022. After downloading all news reports identified\nduring the period, we manually scrutinized and removed articles\nthat are not specifically relevant to this Uvalde mass shooting and\nare other types of content, such as editorials. This continued un-\ntil 25 news reports were selected for each new media. Collecting\nnews reports continued until the dataset seemed saturated with\nrelevant words and phrases coded in this study. Data saturation is\nconsidered a useful guide for sampling data in a qualitative study\nthat deals with a relatively small amount of information [Brennen\n2017; Sandelowski 1995]. With this process, a sample of 100 news\narticles was finally selected for this analysis. Since the lead and ini-\ntial paragraphs(s) generally represent the most important messages\nin a news story [Liu et al .2019; Van Dijk 1985], we purposively\nselected the headlines and first five paragraphs of each news report,\ntotaling 600 headlines and paragraphs, for an in-depth analysis.\n4.2 Data Analysis\nThis study analyzed the news reports with word-by-word coding in\nthree phases\u2014open coding, axial coding, and selective coding [Sal-\nda\u00f1a 2021] using NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software. The\ncoding process was guided by the three research questions, framing\ntheory [Entman 1993], and attribution theory [Heider 2013; Kel-\nley 1973]. Following the research purpose and questions, the data\nanalysis focused on using words and their semantic relations in\nconstructing frames [Entman 1993] in the case of the Robb Elemen-\ntary School shooting. The analysis explores whether and how the\nnews reports used various words and phrases to promote particular\ninterpretations or evaluations relating to the shooter, victims, and\nthe event.\nDuring the open coding phase, we specifically looked at the use\nof words and phrases that promoted or highlighted four aspects:\na) the shooter, Salvador Ramos; b) victims, such as school children\nand teachers; c) the shooting incident, in certain ways. Each type of\nword and phrase was coded into a separate code. For instance, the\nwords \u201ckills, \u201d \u201ckilling,\u201d and \u201ckilled\u201d were coded into a single code. In\nthe axial coding phase, where related codes are grouped into broader\ncategories, we organized initial codes into similar categories based\non shared framing purposes. Finally, during the selective coding,\nwhere central theme(s) are refined, a few broad themes emerged\nwith adequate exemplars (Table 1. To ensure validity, we used two\nstrategies: data triangulation (drawing from multiple data sources)\nand disconfirming evidence (intentionally seeking and considering\nboth supporting and opposing evidence from data) [Creswell and\nB\u00e1ez 2016].\n5 Study 1 Findings\nRQ1 and RQ2: The analysis identifies distinct sets of specific words\nand phrases in left-leaning news outlets, such as NYT and CNN,and right-leaning outlets, such as WSJ and Fox News (see Table 1,\nthat frame the shooter, victims, and the shooting event differently.\n5.1 Shooter\n\u201cAccused\u201d killer. The analysis shows that both right-leaning and\nleft-leaning media outlets use some common verbs (e.g., kills, left\ndead, opened fire, and shot) while attributing the shooter\u2019s act. Im-\nportantly, right-leaning media outlets use weaker verbs and modi-\nfiers (e.g., \u201cis accused of shooting,\u201d \u201cclaimed lives,\u201d and \u201callegedly\ncommitted by\u201d), which casts doubt on Salvador Ramos\u2019 crime and\nweakens the gravity of killing people. In contrast, left-leaning me-\ndia use stronger verbs and modifiers (e.g., \u201cshot and killed,\u201d \u201cburst\nin and killed,\u201d and \u201chorrifically\u201d), which presents the incident with\na higher gravity of the mass shooting act.\nDifferences in identifying the shooter also exist between the two\ngroups of media outlets. In contrast to the left-leaning media outlets,\nthe right-leaning ones use weaker terms like \u201calleged gunman\u201d and\n\u201calleged shooter. \u201d For example, a news report published by Fox News\non May 27 said, \u201cSalvador Ramos, the alleged gunman accused of\nshooting his grandmother and then targeting dozens of victims. . . .\u201d\nThis seems to have cast doubts regarding Salvador Ramos\u2019 act of\nkilling people, at least to some extent.\nMental instabilities. In terms of attributing the responsibility\nor blame to Salvador for the mass shooting, both groups of news\nmedia outlets showed their own bias. In contrast to left-leaning\nnews media outlets, the right-leaning ones selected and highlighted\nSalvador\u2019s mental and family-related instabilities, drawing attention\nto the social factors while presenting Salvador as responsible for the\nshooting. For example, the WSJ reported, \u201cSalvador Ramos. . . came\nfrom a broken family and unsettled classmates and co-workers with\nsometimes aggressive behavior and disturbing social-media posts.\u201d\n5.2 Shooting Incident\nLow vs. high severity. The shooting incident has been found to\nhave been presented differently in terms of its severity between the\nright-leaning and left-leaning news media outlets. The former has\nemployed specific words and phrases to portray the incident as a\nless severe one than the latter. The event modifier columns of Table\n1 demonstrate that while some words and phrases are common\nto both groups of news outlets, others are used to attribute the\nshooting incident differently. For example, the NYT used the word\n\u201cslaughter\u201d to describe the incident, while Fox News and the WSJ\ndid not. The left-leaning media also used \u201cterrorist attack,\u201d which\nwas not used by their right-leaning counterparts. In contrast, right-\nleaning media outlets identified the shooting as a \u201csenseless crime. \u201d\nThe use of words such as \u201cterrorist attack\u201d and \u201cslaughter\u201d might\ntrigger nodes in the human brain related to other deadly terrorist\nincidents, portraying the shooting as a more severe act [Collins and\nLoftus 1975]. On the other hand, the use of the phrase \u201csenseless\ncrime\u201d suggests a typical type of crime. Therefore, differences in\nthe use of words have contributed to defining the mass shooting as\na problem in terms of its severity between the right-leaning and\nleft-leaning news media outlets.\n5\nAEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC Ali and Hassan\n6 Victims\nTeenager vs. older. Divergent portrayals of the victims in the\nnews media outlets were observed, with both left-leaning and right-\nleaning news media using distinct words and phrases, although\nsome terms were commonly employed. The left-leaning media\noutlets specifically employed phrases such as \u201cschool children,\u201d \u201cel-\nementary school children,\u201d and \u201ckids,\u201d whereas the right-leaning\noutlets used \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cstudents.\u201d For instance, the NYT re-\nported on \u201cthe killing of at least 19 elementary school children in\nsecond, third, and fourth grades.\u201d Although subtle, this contrast in-\ndicated the left-leaning outlets\u2019 emphasis on the word \u201celementary, \u201d\nframing the shooting incident as an attack on young children of\nthis age group. The word \u201celementary\u201d distinguishes the age range\nof 5-10 years from \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cstudents. \u201d The word \u201celementary\u201d\nemphasizes the victims\u2019 age range more clearly, whereas terms like\n\u201cstudents\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d are more general and can apply across\nvarious age groups, including older youth. By promoting the ages of\nthe victims in distinct ways, both the left-leaning and right-leaning\nnews media outlets presented the severity of the shooting incident\nand drew attention to the shooting problem differently.\nRQ3: Answers to RQ1 and RQ2 highlight the use of words in\nconstructing relevant frames. The RQ3 serves the main purpose of\nStudy 1, which is to investigate the semantic patterns or semantic\nrelations of those words in creating frames. As a way of answering\nit, this analysis provides various groups of words and phrases cen-\ntering on the shooter, victims, and the event, illustrating semantic\nrelations among the words (see Table 1.\n7 Semantic Relations\nThe above results and Table 1 provided in the analysis present\ntwo crucial aspects that contribute to the understanding of frames.\nFirstly, the words used to construct frames are crucial in identify-\ning the framing components utilized by the news media outlets.\nSecondly, the semantic relations among the words are crucial in es-\ntablishing the frames\u2019 meaning. Semantic relations indicate how the\nwords are interrelated and which entity the words are attributed to.\nReading through only the words might provide some insights into\nrelevant framing components, but the insights are not fully mean-\ningful without the words\u2019 semantic relations. When the words are\nread with their semantic relations, it renders particular meanings to\nconstruct frames. For instance, in the excerpt \u201cAn 18-year-old gun-\nman on Tuesday fatally shot 19 children and two adults\u201d from an\nNYT article, the semantic relation between the phrase \u201c18-year-old\u201d\nand the \u201cgunman\u201d (Salvador) highlights that the modifier refers to\nthe gunman and not the children. Without considering the seman-\ntic relations, it appeared challenging to comprehend the relevant\nmeanings of the words and subsequently construct frames.\n8 Study 1 Discussion\n8.1 Highlight and Hide\nAs the findings indicate, both left-leaning and right-leaning news\nmedia highlighted some common and different words regarding\nthe Texas mass shooting, conforming to the framing strategy of\nhighlighting and hiding certain aspects of the event [D\u2019Angelo\nand D\u2019Angelo 2018; Entman 1993; Greussing and Boomgaarden2017]. As a frame functions to purvey various judgments about\nreality [D\u2019Angelo and D\u2019Angelo 2018; Entman 1993], the frames\nconstructed by left-leaning and right-leaning news outlets may\nshape how people perceive and understand the causes of the mass\nshooting and influence their attitudes toward it.\n8.2 Attribution of Responsibility\nLeft-leaning news media outlets attributed more responsibility to\nSalvador for the mass shooting compared to right-leaning ones. As\nthe attribution theory [Kelley 1973] and framing theory [Entman\n1993] suggests, with highlighted salience in situational factors (e.g.,\nbroken family) in right-leaning outlets, people are more likely to\nattribute the shooting\u2019s causes to situational factors. This is sup-\nported by the phrase \u201caccused of\u201d that right-leaning news used in\npresenting Salvador\u2019s shooting.\nRight-leaning news media highlighted aspects of Salvador\u2019s so-\ncial factors, such as his broken family, which may have made his\nactions appear more situationally driven. As per the correspondent\ninference model [Jones and Davis 1965], such social desirability can\nreduce attributions of personal responsibility by shifting away from\ndispositional factors. Overall, the left-leaning news media reports\nfocused on attributing the causal responsibility of the mass shooting\nmore to Salvador, while the right-leaning news media reports went\nbeyond Salvador\u2019s individual responsibility to his family factors.\nSuch causal interpretation is supported by the study of [McGinty\net al.2014], which shows \u201cdangerous people\u201d with mental illness\nwere more likely mentioned as a cause of gun violence than \u201cdan-\ngerous weapons.\u201d The study by [McKeever et al .2022] also extends\nevidence in support of this current study\u2019s findings.\n8.3 Semantic Relations for Computational\nFraming Analysis\nUnsupervised computational methods mostly rely on the ideas of\nfrequencies and co-occurrences of words [Blei 2012; DiMaggio et al .\n2013]. These bag-of-words-based approaches are not designed to\nlook at the semantic relations of words and end up with identifying\ntopics, instead of frames [Ali and Hassan 2022]. The study 1 findings\ndemonstrate that capturing semantic relations helps discern in-\ndepth nuances in the texts through word relations and, thus, identify\nrelevant frames. For example, in the following excerpt from a New\nYork Times article, \u201cAn 18-year-old gunman on Tuesday fatally\nshot 19 children and two adults,\u201d the semantic relations show that\nthe phrase \u201c18-year-old\u201d modifies the \u201cgunman\u201d (aka Salvador),\nnot children. Without knowing this semantic relation, relevant\nmeanings of the words and, subsequently, frames do not emerge\n(see Table 1).\nManual data analysis enables the researchers to identify such se-\nmantic relations and relevant frames, as presented above. Therefore,\nsemantic relations appeared essential for having relevant meanings\nand frames in a text. In a computational method, being able to\ncapture the semantic relations seems to be a one-step advancement\ntoward better identification and analysis of frames. As identified\nin this study 1, the lists of words, their attributes, and semantic\nrelations for the shooter, victims, and the event are so specific that\nthese can be incorporated into an algorithmic model. So, this study\nsuggests incorporating these semantic relations into computational\n6\nSemantic-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA): A Novel Approach for Computational Framing Analysis AEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC\ntechniques (e.g., dependency parsing) for better automatic framing\nanalysis. As envisioned in Nicholls and Culpepper [2021] and Ali\nand Hassan [2022], this current study\u2019s findings extended additional\nevidence of how semantic relations among words and phrases, in-\nstead of just bag-of-words, can better explain nuances of frames,\nespecially in an unsupervised model.\n9 Study 2: Computational Analysis\nStudy 2 of computational analysis builds on the insights and recom-\nmendations from Study 1 of qualitative textual analysis. It focuses\non the potential of using dependency parsing, an NLP technique\nthat analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence by identify-\ning relationships between words, such as which word modifies or\ndepends on another. This approach aims to enhance the identifica-\ntion and analysis of frames computationally. Examining the same\ndataset of news articles from Study 1, this computational analysis\nexplores how dependency parsing can capture the semantic rela-\ntions of words and understand relevant frames. We also compare\nthe results of the unsupervised computational model (Study 2) with\nthose obtained through manual data analysis (Study 1) to evalu-\nate the effectiveness of the computational approach. The findings\ncontribute to a better understanding of the role of the semantic\nrelations-based computational approach in analyzing frames and\noffer insights into the potential of using dependency parsing as a\nmethodological approach for framing analysis.\nSince it is one of the first studies to use semantic relations in\nanalyzing frames, we offer similar research questions established\nin study 1, consistent with the objectives of study 2.\nRQ1: How do right-leaning and left-leaning news media outlets\nuse words and phrases to construct frames at the Robb Elementary\nschool in Texas?\nRQ2: How do the right-leaning and left-leaning news media\noutlets frame the shooter, victims, and the mass shooting event at\nthe Robb Elementary school in Texas?\n10 Study 2 Method\n10.1 Dataset\nTo answer the research questions, we analyzed the same news\nreport dataset as study 1. Parsed by the spaCy NLP language model,\nthe dataset contains a total of 24604 tokens, with 4768 for CNN, 6282\nfor Fox, 6759 for NYT, and 6795 for WSJ. We used the same dataset\nto compare the frames provided by the computational approach\nwith those of the qualitative study.\n10.2 Analysis\nThe data analysis involved the following seven steps:\n1) Coreference resolution: As this study aims to identify mod-\nifying words centering three entities, the shooter, victims, and the\nevent, we needed to identify and resolve the coreferences (e.g., \u201che\u201d\nor \u201csuspect\u201d for the shooter) to capture all possible modifying words\nof both \u201creferences\u201d and \u201cco-references.\u201d To accomplish this, we\napplied NeuralCoref, an extension of the spaCy NLP library that\nprovides coreference resolution.\n2) Token extraction: We then applied a dependency parser of\nthe spaCy language model that parsed all the news reports andgenerated a dependency parse tree. This tree provides the syntactic\nstructure of a sentence that includes nodes, such as heads (e.g.,\ngunman) and children (e.g., suspect), representing words, and edges\nrepresenting the semantic relationships between those heads and\nchildren. Each edge is labeled with a specific dependency relation,\nsuch as \u201camod\u201d (adjective modifier).\n3) Determining keywords: To capture all possible words that\nrefer and co-refer to each of the three entities, we determined\nrelevant keywords for each entity (e.g., Salvador, gunman, shooter).\nThese keywords were determined based on study 1 insights and\nthen refined through manual checking of some tokens in the output\nproduced in step 2 (see Table 2 for details).\n4) Filtering heads and children: Based on the keywords, we\nfiltered out all relevant \u201cheads\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d of each entity, all\ntheir dependency relations, and associated news outlets.\n5) Determining and refining dependency relations: This\nstep determines and refines useful dependency relations based on\nthis study\u2019s purpose. We removed some dependency relations (e.g.,\ncc, punc) that were not useful in making meanings in relation to\nthe RQs, by manual checking of the relations grouped in the output\nproduced in step 4 (see Table 2 for details).\n6) Filtering \u201cframing components\u201d: We consider each pair\nof head and child with certain dependency relation (e.g., the pair\nof \u201cshooting\u201d keyword and \u201cdeadly\u201d child with \u201camod\u201d relation) as\na framing component that provides a particular attribution to an\nentity. This step filtered out all framing components for each entity\nby the news outlets.\n7) Framing components to frames: Until the last step, we an-\nalyzed the data computationally using spaCy and Pandas, a popular\ndata analysis library for Python. In this step, we followed both com-\nputational and manual qualitative explorations. 7a) Computational:\nWe computationally grouped the framing components for each\nentity by dependency relations. To achieve this goal, we used BERT\nword embedding and k-means clustering of the modifying words\n(also known as children). 7b) Qualitative: We inductively coded the\nmodifying words and categorized them into groups following the\nresearch questions manually. Here, we consider a single framing\ncomponent as a candidate for being included in multiple groups\n(Salda\u00f1a, 2016), and triangulation and disconfirming evidence were\nutilized to ensure the validity (Creswell, 2016). In both parts, each\ngroup is considered as a frame. With the process, a number of\nframes emerged with exemplars.\n11 Study 2 Findings\nThis section reports the findings of the qualitative analysis in step 7,\nfollowed by the computational analysis from steps 1 to 6. The results\nof the computational exploration in step 7 are not reported here,\nas we found that the findings from manual analysis outperformed\nthem. The clusters revealed through k-means clustering were not\nfound to be coherent and adequately insightful for understanding\nthe nuances of frames, as we examined the results manually. The\nfindings of the qualitative analysis reveal that right-leaning and\nleft-leaning news media outlets use different words to construct\nframes of the shooter, victims, and the mass shooting event at the\nRobb Elementary school in Texas differently, as presented in Tables\n3, 4, and 5 respectively.\n7\nAEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC Ali and Hassan\n11.1 Shooter: \u201cAccused\u201d killer\nThe shooter was characterized with some words that create doubt\nover the shooter\u2019s killing action. Comparing the attributions used\nby right-leaning and left-leaning news outlets, it was found that the\nformer used the words \"alleged [shooter]\" and \u201csuspected [shooter]\u201d\nmore frequently than the latter. Furthermore, a right-leaning news\noutlet referred to the shooter as \u201caccused [of shooting]\u201d, which was\nnot used by the left-leaning outlets. These attribution differences\nsuggest that the two media outlets utilized different priorities in\nframing the shooter.\n11.2 Shooter: Diversity of attributes\nAs depicted in Table 3, right-leaning news outlets used a greater\nvariety of attributes to highlight various aspects of the shooter than\nleft-leaning outlets. For example, right-leaning outlets used words\nsuch as \u201cunhappy,\u201d \u201cdeceased,\u201d \u201ccivilized,\u201d and \u201cactive\u201d to describe\nthe shooter, which left-leaning outlets did not use. However, these\nwords appear scattered and do not seem to form a coherent ar-\ngument. This may be due to the small dataset used in this study.\nA larger dataset in future research could reveal more modifying\nwords and categorize them into relevant groups, providing further\ninsights into framing strategies.\n11.3 Shooter & Victims: Teenager vs. Older\nRight-leaning news media outlets tend to use words depicting the\n\u201cshooter\u201d as comparatively younger than left-leaning outlets. For\ninstance, words used by the right-leaning outlets to attribute to\nthe shooter include \u201cteenage,\u201d \u201cyoung,\u201d and \u201cstudent,\u201d which left-\nleaning outlets did not mention. Another example is that the shooter\nwas identified as \u201c18-year-old\u201d 26 times in the left-leaning outlets\nand only 10 times in the right-leaning ones (see Table 3. In contrast,\nthe victims were attributed with the word \u201cyoung,\u201d an adjective\nmodifier, five times by the left-leaning outlets and zero times by the\nright-leaning ones. Overall, right-leaning outlets frame the shooter\nas younger and the victims as older, and the scenario is the opposite\nin left-leaning outlets (see Table 4.\n11.4 Victims: Our Kids vs. Your Kids\nThere is not much difference between left-leaning and right-leaning\nnews outlets in using personal pronouns to modify the victims (see\nTable 4. Pronouns addressing victims are important to perceive how\nthe news media outlets stand with them. The left-leaning outlets\nstill used a greater variety of personal words, such as my (2), our\n(2), and your (2), while the right-leaning ones used two such words,\nher (2) and our (3).\n11.5 Shooting Event: Low vs. High Severity\nTo describe the shooting, left-leaning news media outlets tend to\nuse more severe and emotionally charged words, such as deadliest\n(6), deadly (6), horrific (1), horrifying (1), heinous (1), tragic (1),\nand fatally [shot] (1), which frames the issue as a more significant\nproblem. Such words used by right-leaning outlets include deadly\n(4), deadliest (3), awful (4), horrific (3), senseless (2), and devastated\n(1). This shows the right-leaning outlets use less intense words like\n\u201csenseless\u201d and \u201cawful,\u201d which suggests a less severe framing of the\nissue (see Table 5. Overall, the mass shooting framing is constructedby the language deployed by news media outlets, and the severity\nof the framing can differ based on the political leaning of the outlet,\nwhich is aligned with framing aspects suggested by [Entman 1993].\n12 Study 2 Discussion\nStudy 2 investigates how news outlets frame the shooter, victims,\nand the Texas school shooting, applying a new computational ap-\nproach based on semantic relations.\n12.1 Attribution of Responsibility\nFraming the shooter as \u201cyoung\u201d or \u201colder\u201d can have significant\nimplications for how people perceive the shooting and the level\nof responsibility attributed to the shooter [Entman 1993]. The use\nof the \u201cyoung\u201d attribute by right-leaning outlets could soften the\nshooter\u2019s image and create a more sympathetic portrayal, thereby\nreducing the level of responsibility attributed to him [Jones and\nDavis 1965]. On the other hand, the left-leaning outlets\u2019 focus on\nthe victims\u2019 youth could create a greater sense of tragedy and\nurgency and, therefore, a higher level of responsibility attributed to\nthe shooter [Decety et al .2012]. As per attribution theory, people\ntend to attribute a person\u2019s behavior to internal or external factors\nbased on internal and external factors [Heider 2013; Kelley 1973]. In\nthis case, the framing of the shooter and victims differently by the\nnews outlets might shape how people attribute responsibility for\nthe shooting. The framing differences among news media outlets\nmight have been shaped more by established media routines and\npractices [Reese and Shoemaker 2018] than by the specifics of this\nparticular mass shooting event.\n12.2 Taking Actions\nThe news media outlets\u2019 different approaches to highlighting se-\nlected \u201csevere\u201d words might have significant implications for how\nthe public perceives the incident and \u201cchoose[s] to act upon\u201d the\nproblem [Entman 1993, p. 54]. The left-leaning news outlets\u2019 higher\nsalience on words like \u201cdeadly\u201d and \u201cdeadliest\u201d might activate the\n\"amygdala\u201d node in people\u2019s brains, potentially leading them to take\nactions like protest and advocacy [Barry et al .2013; Phelps 2006].\nAt the same time, highlighting more on the words \u201caccused\u201d and\n\u201calleged\u201d regarding the shooter\u2019s act, the right-leaning news outlets,\ncompared to left-leaning ones, offered doubt in people\u2019s perception\nregarding Ramos\u2019s mass shooting. Such higher salience on these\nwords in right-leaning outlets seems to have weakened people\u2019s\nperception of the shooter\u2019s dispositional factors in committing the\noffense [Kelley 1973].\n12.3 Highlight and Hide\nTaking some meanings or words over others as discussed above\nconforms the framing technique of highlight and hide, as proposed\nby Entman [1993] and Fairhurst and Sarr [1996]. Both right-leaning\nand left-leaning news outlets utilized distinct ways of framing the\nshooter, victims, and the event despite some common depictions\nbetween the groups. Overall, the left-leaning outlets attempt to\nelicit people\u2019s sympathy for \u201cvictims\u201d while right-leaning ones\nsympathize with the shooter, as evidenced above.\n8\nSemantic-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA): A Novel Approach for Computational Framing Analysis AEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC\n13 Integrated Discussion of Both Studies\nThis research\u2019s primary objective is to introduce and explore a new\napproach to computational framing analysis. Our initial qualitative\ninquiry in study 1 revealed in-depth insights into the role of seman-\ntic relations in frame construction and suggested that dependency\nparsing, a computational method, could potentially serve as a prac-\ntical unsupervised approach to frame analysis. Based on study 1\u2019s\nfindings and recommendations, study 2 applied dependency parsing\nto the same dataset as an approach to computationally analyzing\nframes. A comparison of the findings of both studies demonstrates\nthe potential of this proposed semantic relations-based approach to\nautomate the identification and analysis of frames in large datasets.\nAs the study 2 discussion suggests, its findings on framing the\nshooter, victims, and the event are well interpretable with relevant\ntheoretical frameworks, and the interpretations are mostly aligned\nwith those of study 1 and prior gun violence research. With that, this\narticle proposes a novel computational framing analysis approach\nbased on dependency parsing named \u201cSemantic Relations-based\nUnsupervised Framing Analysis\u201d (SUFA).\n14 Semantic Relations-based Unsupervised\nFraming Analysis (SUFA)\n14.1 Novelty of SUFA\nThe SUFA is novel in analyzing frames in several ways. First, it is\nbased on semantic relations that extend beyond the bag-of-words\napproach utilized by most existing unsupervised computational\nframing analysis methods, such as topic modeling. Second, as dis-\ncussed above, a few studies have employed semantic relations in\nframing analysis [e.g., van Atteveldt et al .2013; Ziems and Yang\n2021]. However, they did not present it as an unsupervised method.\nIn contrast to these studies, our approach demonstrates its distinc-\ntion as an unsupervised method. Researchers do not need to define\na frame in advance to explore frames within a dataset. Third, our\napproach provides flexibility in using qualitative manual coding\nor computational tools like word embedding and k-means clus-\ntering in step 7 of its data analysis process. In this sense, it is a\nmixed-method approach that prior studies did not include.\n14.2 Data Analysis in SUFA.\nThe procedure for analyzing data in SUFA is outlined in seven\nsteps in the study 2\u2019s method section. To effectively apply SUFA,\nwe recommend following these steps along with a few additional\nconsiderations. If news media outlets have specific identities, such\nas left or right-leaning, we suggest labeling these identities in the\ndata. Steps 3 and 5 require human intelligence. For example, step\n3 involves providing keywords for each entity, which can be in-\nformed by domain knowledge, researchers\u2019 little manual data ex-\nploration, or with the assistance of WordNet [Miller 1995]. In step\n5, researchers may need to manually review the output to identify\nuseful semantic relations for analysis. For step 7, either qualitative\nor computational analyses can be used, depending on the research\ngoals and the number of modifying words derived from the dataset.\nThe computational analysis, such as word embedding and k-means\nclustering, may generally be more appropriate as SUFA is meant\nto analyze large datasets. However, if the size of modifying wordsis small enough to manage manually, a qualitative analysis might\nbe more suitable for step 7, as research suggests that human intelli-\ngence often outperforms machines in tasks that require contextual\ninterpretation and subjective judgment [Lazer et al. 2009].\n14.3 Strengths\nThe SUFA is an unsupervised approach that does not require any\nprior labeling or defining of data frames. Instead, it uses an induc-\ntive approach to explore and group attributions together to reveal\nframing components or frames. One advantage of SUFA is that it\nallows for the flexibility of utilizing both human intelligence and\ncomputational techniques to emerge frames and their interpreta-\ntions, particularly in cases where the size of modifying words is\nsmall enough to be managed manually. Moreover, SUFA can induc-\ntively analyze frames in large datasets in an unsupervised manner.\n14.4 Weaknesses\nThe approach requires manual input in determining relevant key-\nwords (step 3) and semantic relations (step 5), which can be time-\nconsuming and subjective. It is limited to analyzing frames centered\naround entities, such as an individual (e.g., shooter), a group of peo-\nple or community (e.g., victims), and an incident or phenomenon\n(e.g., a shooting event). Since this study focuses on exploring em-\nphasis frames through a semantic relations-based approach, it is\nbetter suited for analyzing emphasis frames [D\u2019Angelo 2017] rather\nthan equivalency frames [Kahneman and Tversky 1984].\nAdditionally, like other computational framing analysis approaches,\nthis study only considers words and phrases, while other framing\ncomponents like metaphor, placement, and visual elements are not\nanalyzed. During coreference resolution (step 1), some words useful\nas framing components could be replaced with co-references (e.g.,\nreplacing the word \u201cgunman\u201d with \u201cSalvador\u201d), which might lead\nto the loss of some words with important nuances.\n15 Conclusion\nThis research introduces a new computational approach called\nSemantic Relations-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA),\nwhich utilizes semantic relations to analyze news frames. While the\nmethod has some limitations, such as the need for manual input and\nits focus on emphasis frames, it provides a useful tool for exploring\nframing components in news media coverage. The mixed-method\napproach of SUFA offers researchers the flexibility to use entirely\ncomputational tools or couple it with qualitative manual coding,\nwhere applicable, for data analysis. Overall, SUFA is a valuable\naddition to the field of computational framing analysis, enabling\nmore comprehensive and nuanced analysis of news media frames.\n16 Limitations and Future Research\nThe SUFA was developed and tested on a single dataset of news re-\nports on gun violence in Study 1 and Study 2. However, the approach\ncan be applied to other domains with the provision of relevant key-\nwords and relations. Further research can be conducted to explore\nthe applicability of this method in other domains and to improve\nits performance. Currently, SUFA only considers words when ana-\nlyzing frames. However, the computational framing analysis needs\n9\nAEJMC, August 07\u201310, 2023, Washington, DC Ali and Hassan\nto include other framing components such as metaphor, visual con-\ntent, placement, differences between headline and body texts, and\nexemplars. Such advancements will provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of framing effects in news media.\nReferences\nMohammad Ali and Naeemul Hassan. 2022.
