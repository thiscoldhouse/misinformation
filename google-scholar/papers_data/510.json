Parler usage was linked to the planning of the Jan.  \n6, 2021 attack on the  United States Capitol building, leading to a shutdown of the \nParler platform. Parler, which is now back online, offers an important lens through \nwhich to examine the broader attempts at platform migration in response to \nchanging content moderation and pla tform governance policies and their impact on \npolitical polarization. We begin by examining the network connections between US \nCongressional Representatives on both Twitter and Parler. We find that Parler has \na homogenous population of users, consisting of  a single isolated group, where \npolarization seems irrelevant, while Twitter demonstrates two clearly polarized \ngroups. We compare how politicians and political pundits use Parler differently. \nFinally,  we examine the evolution of Parler including comparing  Parler\u2019s own \npolicies before and after the shutdown and reflecting  on the future of platforms like \nParler and similar platform migration experiments.   \n \nKeywords  \n \nSocial Media, Platform Migration, Platform Governance, Parler , Political \nPolarization  \n \n \n1. Introduction and Background  \n \nAs social media grows in political influence around the world, the impact of \ncontent moderation and other platform governance decisions grows as well. The \nstakes are high for controlling the social media narrative and in response t o platform \ngovernance decisions, there have increasingly been attempts to organize mass \nmigrations away from both mainstream social media and more traditional media \nplatforms.  \nSocial media platforms can create echo chambers by recommending content \nto users that is similar to other content they have already consumed in order to \nincrease user engagement (Sasahara et al. 2021). The resulting echo chamber effect \nfeeds into a user\u2019s confirmation bias, resulting in not only vastly different \ninterpretations o f facts, but a completely different set of acknowledged facts  \n(Heshmat 2015).  The creation of even more polarized social media platforms with \nthe majority of their user base belonging to one political party can exacerbate these \npolitical echo chambers. Ra ther than an echo chamber being present within a \nportion of a social media platform, the entirety of the platform can become an echo \n2Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), Vol. 5, No. 1 [2023], Art. 5\nhttps://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5\nDOI: 10.22191/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5/\nchamber. The migration of a group of users with a unified mindset and political \nview to a more isolated social media platfo rm can serve to intensify political \npolarization.  \nThe 2020 campaign on the political right in the United States to encourage \nmigration from  Twitter to Parler, is one high profile example. There are many \nothers including campaigns to migrate from Facebook t o MeWe, from Fox News \nto OAN, from Instagram to Mastodon, and from WhatsApp to Signal and Telegram  \n(Isaac, 2019). In Jan.  2021, Signal and Telegram downloads surged as users around \nthe world from Iran to India to Brazil were encouraged to migrate away fro m \nWhatsApp in response to terms of service changes (Nicas & Isaac, 2021). In most \ncases, it is growing dissatisfaction with platform governance decisions at major \nsocial media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram that has led to these \nefforts to  shift to new platforms.  \nIt is worth noting that although some of the most dramatic platform migration \nefforts have originated on the political right, there are examples of calls for \nmigration from the political left as well. In Dec. 2020, a left -leaning movement \ncalled for an exodus from Instagram when it changed their community guidelines  \n(2020)  regarding sexual solicitation to be more restrictive. This change led to \nprotests from sex workers, sexual assault advocates, and sex educators who \nbelieved thei r content would be restricted.  \nIn this paper, we are focusing on political polarization on Twitter and Parler. \nTwitter initially was referred to as \u201cthe free speech wing of the free speech party\u201d \n(Ingram, 2011). However, they also moved to restrict content  after observing \nincreasing abuse on their platform ( Culliford &  Paul, 2020). In May 2020, Twitter \nintroduced a fact checking label primarily on posts about COVID -19 (Roth & \nPickles, 2020)  given the catastrophic wide spreading COVID related \u2018Infodemic\u2019 \n(Pandemic & misinformation) on social media ( Madraki et al. 2021 ). They \naccomplished this through the addition of a \u201cget the facts\u201d tag linking to more \ninformation.  \nOne particularly controve rsial case of content moderation was related to the \nremoval of Donald Trump\u2019s accounts. On the night of Jan. 6, Twitter suspended \nTrump\u2019s account temporarily, as Twitter believed Trump\u2019s tweets were inciting \nviolence to overturn the election. On Jan. 8, 20 21, Twitter (2021) closed Trump\u2019s \naccount permanently and purged more than 70,000 Twitter accounts affiliated with \nQAnon related to the riot (Romm & Dwoskin, 2020). Facebook, YouTube,  and \nother platforms took similar steps to remove Trump\u2019s accounts and co ntent  (Gold \n& Fischer 2021). In July 2021, Trump filed a lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook, \nand YouTube arguing that these platforms violated his First Amendment right in \n\"illegal, unconstitutional censorship\u201d (Segers & Sganga, 2021). Interestingly, \nTrump has reportedly refused to join Parler because Parler did not agree to block \nanti-Trump users and thier negative comments (Wolff, 2021).  \n3Matthews et al.: Political Polarization on Parler and Twitter\nPublished by The Open Repository @ Binghamton (The ORB), 2023\nThe content moderation decisions at Twitter, other social media platforms, \nand even at Fox News were directly related to  calls on the political right to move \nto platforms like MeWe, Parler and OAN that would not remove posts or accounts \neven in response to misinformation, disinformation and calls for violence. People \nparticipating in the Capitol riot, many of them Parler us ers, uploaded thousands of \nvideos of the event. These videos were archived before the Parler shutdown, and \nlater reviewed and published by Propublica which collectively make up solid proof \nof the event through the eyes of the witnesses and participants  (Groeger et al. 2021). \nOn Jan. 7 , 2021 , Parler jumped to number one in Apple's AppStore after Twitter \nand Facebook banned Trump (Shieber, 2020).  \nHowever, after the Jan.  6 attack  on the United States Capitol, Amazon, Apple, \nand Google all took steps to shut down Parler (Nicas & Alba, 2021). Google and \nApple disabled downloads of the Parler app from their app stores because they \nbelieved that Parler failed to regulate appropriate policies to prevent the \nencouragement of crime, hatred, and violence. Later, Amaz on announced that it \nrefuses to host their service due to the violation of Amazon\u2019s rules by Parler. Parler \nhas been suing Amazon in federal court since then due to the sudden termination of \nservice. On Feb.  15 2021, after more than a month, Parler found a new Web host \nand started to revive. SkySilk is a Web infrastructure company based in California \nnow hosting Parler (Allyn & Treisman, 2021). After the comeback , Parler promised \nto take down some categories of content, and improve its community guidelines  \n(2021) .  \nThe old version of the Parler refers to the Parler before its shutdown after \nCapitol Riots on Jan. 6 , 2021 . In this paper we are using the term \u2018Parler\u2019 for the \nnew version of Parler after it came back on Feb. 15 , 2021 . \nThis dramatic Parler story  and its close relationship to the Capitol riot show \nthe importance of studying the relationship between political polarization, platform \nmigration, and the real -world political impacts of platform governance decisions. \nIn this paper, we focus on the role of politicians and political pundits.  \nWe focused our data collection on two categories of users, US Congressional \nmembers and a group of right -leaning political pundits inspired loosely by a list in \n(Lewis, 2018). For both pundits and politicians, we coll ected user metadata \nincluding total followers, total following, and number of posts during our data \ncollection period: July 7 , 2021,  to Sept. 7 , 2021,  on both Parler and Twitter.  \nWe determine whether a user is active or not on a platform based on their \nnumber of posts during our data collection period. If a user published at least one \npost, they are deemed active on that platform. One of the downsides of the Parler \nplatform is that, unlike Twitter showing the actual date that a tweet was posted, \nParler jus t gives a rough estimation of the date the parley was posted.  Table 1 \nsummarizes the data we collected and analyzed. Appendix 1 includes the full list of \n4Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), Vol. 5, No. 1 [2023], Art. 5\nhttps://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5\nDOI: 10.22191/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5/\npundits and politicians active on Parler, along with their Twitter and Parler \nusernames.  \n \n \nTable 1: T he summary of our dataset.  \nItem  Politicians  Pundits  \nDemocrat  273 0 \nRepublican  265 34 \nTwitter Accounts  538 34 \nParler Accounts  109 33 \nActive Parler Accounts \n(Appendix 1)  20 10 \n \nIn Section 2, we examine the network connections between US Congressional \nRepresentatives on both Twitter and Parler. We find that Parler has a homogenous \npopulation of users, consisting of a single isolated group, where polarization seems \nirrelevant, whil e Twitter demonstrates two clearly polarized groups. In Section 3, \nwe compare how politicians and political pundits use Parler differently.  Finally, in \nSection 4, we examine the evolution of Parler including comparing Parler\u2019s own \npolicies before and afte r the shutdown and reflect on the future of platforms like \nParler and similar platform migration experiments.   \n \n2. Political Polarization on Parler vs. Twitter  \n \nComparing the behaviour of users on Parler  and Twitter side to side is \nimportant to understand the  status of migration between platforms about 9 months \nafter Parler\u2019s come -back.  \nWe modeled the network of our sampled users by a directed graph where \nnodes represent users,  and they are colored by the  registered party (red associated \nwith the Republican party and blue associated with the Democratic party). Directed \nedges denote the connection between them (i.e., followers and following friends of \neach user). The size of the nodes is related to the numb er of tweets/parleys \npublished by each user during our collection period: July 7 - Sept. 7 , 2021 , i.e., a \nlarger node represents a more active user with more posts. We used a Python \npackage, NetworkX - 2.6.2, to model the networks and generate our results.  \nWe started our network analysis with 117th Congress members. Figure 1 \nshowcases the entire network of politicians on Twitter and Parler. The connection \nin all networks in this section captions  only the interconnections of the users.  \n5Matthews et al.: Political Polarization on Parler and Twitter\nPublished by The Open Repository @ Binghamton (The ORB), 2023\n \n  \nFigure 1: The ne twork of 117th US congressional representatives on Twitter \n(Left) and on Parler (Right)  \n \nThe Parler network is obviously sparser  because unlike Twitter, only a \nfraction of these politicians has Parler accounts and a few of them are active on \nParler; and they are almost entirely Republican (red).  \nGiven the sheer difference of size of these two networks, it is interesting to \ncompare the Twitter and Parler networks of a sub -sample of users who are present \non both platforms, i.e., the politicians with a Twitte r account who are also active on \nParler (having at least one parley within our data collection period). Figure 2 \nillustrates this comparison such that both networks consist of the users found in the \nAppendix 1.  \nOne may initially notice the decreased size of nodes and decreased number of \nedges. The average number of tweets from these users is 568 while the average \nnumber of parleys is 103. Even among politicians active on both platforms, they \npost on average over 5x more tweets tha n parleys. The average degree of users in \nthe Twitter network is 20 versus 8 in the Parler network. These statistics show that \nfor even those active on Parler, they post on average more tweets and are more well \nconnected on Twitter.  \n \n  \nFigure 2: The Twitter network (Left) and Parler network (right) of active \npoliticians on both  Twitter and Parler  \n \n There is only one politician in our sample, Representative Devin Nunes, \nwho has consistently continued his boycott of Twitter since Dec. 2020  (Otala et al. \n2021). Figure 3 clearly shows this boycott and the lack of boycott by all other active \npoliticians on Parler.  \n6Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), Vol. 5, No. 1 [2023], Art. 5\nhttps://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5\nDOI: 10.22191/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5/\n \n \n \nFigure 3: Parler and Twitter post percentages of our current active group of \npoliticians. Only Devin Nunes has fully boycotted  Twitter  \n \n Next, we analyzed the Twitter network and the Parler network of our \nsampled pundits who have twitter accounts and are active on Parler (having at least \none parley within our data collection period) (Figure 4). Both networks consist of \n9 users (d etails of these users can be found in the Appendix 1).  \n  \n \nFigure 4: The Twitter network (Left) and Parler network (right) of active \npundits on both  Twitter and Parler  \n \nThe comparison of these pundit networks reveals  that the average number of \ntweets from these users is 572 and average number of parleys is 104, similar to \npoliticians. The key difference is the average number of connections of users across \nnetworks (number of edges): the users on Twitter have an averag e of connections \nof 6.22 while they have an average of 7.11 connections on parler. This slight \nincrease of connectivity on Parler may be negligible given such a small sample size \nof pundits.  \nBased on the node size (corresponding to number of tweets or par leys \npublished), this sub -sample of pundits seemingly use Parler less than Twitter \ndespite being far -right conservative. Only one pundit out of our dataset, Mark \nLevin, has fully boycotted Twitter which he has been doing since Jan.  2021 (Figure \n5).  \n \n7Matthews et al.: Political Polarization on Parler and Twitter\nPublished by The Open Repository @ Binghamton (The ORB), 2023\n \nFigure 5: Parler and Twitter post percentages of our active group of pundits. \nOnly Mark Levin has fully boycotted Twitter  \n \n The major takeaway in this section is the comparative lack of usage of Parler \nby even active politicians and pundits. While the messag ing of a boycott of the \nmainstream social media platforms has continued from public Republican \nrepresentatives, the commitment to fully adopt a new platform seems impractical. \nEven some of those who have been banned from mainstream social media platforms \nare not necessarily switching over to Parler.  \n A secondary takeaway is the role of polarization on these platforms. We \ncanonically define something to be polarized when there is a division into two \nsharply contrasting groups. That implicitly requires the pr esence of two groups, \nwhich is easily visualized in the Twitter network in Figure 1. However,  at no point \ndo two distinct groups appear in the Parler networks in Figures 1, 2, and 4. Then by \nour own visualizations, Twitter seems a far more politically pola rized network than \nParler. Parler has a homogenous population of users, consisting of a single isolated \ngroup, where polarization seems irrelevant. However, it is not true, given the \nultimate lack of presence of an alternative opinion on Parler the entire platform at \nthat point turns into an echo chamber.  \n3. Behavior of Politicians vs. Pundits on Parler  \n \nWe compared the behavior  of the politicians and pundits along a few  \ndimensions including their popularity (the number of followers), their activity \nlevels (e. g., parleys and tweets) and the level of polarization reflected in their posts.  \nFigure 6 shows the cumulative number of followers for Democrat and \nRepublican, Senate,  and House members during the time surrounding Jan. 6 , 2021 . \nThe gap in the graph highlig hts the timing of the Congress switch.  \n \n \n8Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), Vol. 5, No. 1 [2023], Art. 5\nhttps://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5\nDOI: 10.22191/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5/\n \nFigure 6: The number of f ollowers  of the 116th and 117th Congress  members \non Parler  \n \nFigure 7 compares the average follower counts for each group. Interestingly, \nthe numbers of followers per Republican and Democrat are on par with one another.  \nThe pundits have several times the amount of influence on average . \n \n \nFigure 7: The a verage number of followers per person in the sample  \n \nOverall, 2% of Senators (2 out of 100) and 4.5% of house members (20 out \nof 441 ) are considered in our list of active users with at least one parley within July \n7 to Sept. 7 , 2021 ; and all but one of these active users were Republicans. 29.4% \nof well-known  Republican pundits (10 out of 34) are active on Parler. We collected \nthe total  of 791 parleys posted by politicians and 740 by pundits within the \ndesignated data collection timeslot.  \nTo have a better understanding of Parler usage by these politicians and \npundits, we also analyzed the content of their parleys. We find that many of o ur \ncollected parleys contain links to news outlets or some biased websites. About 86% \n9Matthews et al.: Political Polarization on Parler and Twitter\nPublished by The Open Repository @ Binghamton (The ORB), 2023\nof the pundits\u2019 parleys were linked to a site/news outlet , and 34% of politicians' \nposts contain a website link.  \nWe identified a set of 12 websites used by both politici ans and pundits. We \nused the \u2018Media Bias/Fact Checking\u2019 (2021) to rank these websites in terms of their \nradicalization score. The score of an individual site can be from +4 (Extreme Right) \nto -4 (Extreme Left).  \nFigure 8 shows the distribution of posts con taining links to these websites. \nThe horizontal axis is sorted based on the radicalization score such that the rightest  \nleaning is sorted on the right.  \n \n \nFigure 8: The percentage of politicians\u2019 and pundits\u2019 parleys containing a link \nto each website ranked by Media Bias/ Fact Check  \n \nFigure 9 shows the density of radical websites in politicians\u2019 posts vs. Pundits' \nposts based on the same radicalism scale. The pundit density is more extreme than \nthe politician density (the average is more than d ouble, based on this scale).  \n \n \nFigure 9: Radicalization density of website links in the collected parleys  \n10Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), Vol. 5, No. 1 [2023], Art. 5\nhttps://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5\nDOI: 10.22191/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5/\n \n4. Classifying and Analyzing Polarized Parleys  \n \nBeside radical website links and far -right media outlets in our sample, \npolarized topics are also freq uently observed in politicians\u2019 and pundits' posts. \nAlthough there is no precise definition/list of \u201cpolarized topics\u201d in the literature, \nwe classified posts as polarized posts according to the following guideline: 1) \nconfirmation of unbiased/less -biased s ources, e.g., fact -checking websites, google \nnews, BBC, etc.; or, 2) the binary nature of the topics,  e.g., pro-vax vs. anti -vax., \nabortion, etc.; or , 3) matching with the list of well -known/classical polarized topics \nsuch as civil rights, gun control, etc . (Tomar, 2021).  \n The posts that pass through our aforementioned definition of the \u2018polarized \npost\u2019 filter explicitly contain misinformation, inflammatory statements, inciting of \nviolence, or other objectively negative connotations can all be cited as pol arizing \nfactors. This classification is subjective and for transparency purposes, we will \nprovide our full database along with the categorization.   \nOf our total 2986 processed parleys, we classified 1531 (51.3%) as polarized \nparleys. On average each pundit in our sample posted almost twice the number of \npolarized posts as a politician as shown in Figure 10.  \n \n \nFigure 10: Comparison of the average number of polariz ed posts produced by \nactive Parler accounts  \n \nWe identified 7 common topic styles and Figu re 11 represents the distribution \nof the posts in each of these categories. For politicians 89% of parleys and for \npundits 85% of parleys fell into at least one of these styles. Criticizing  Biden\u2019s \nadministration and his performance are the topic of the ma jority of polarized posts \namong both politicians and pundits. Moreover,  the bars in this figure show that in \nmost categories, politicians have more polarized posts, although the average \nnumber of polarized posts by pundits is greater. This means that the t opics of \npoliticians\u2019 posts are more homogeneous (less variety of topics). Pundits\u2019 posts \nhave a wider variety of topics and styles.  \n11Matthews et al.: Political Polarization on Parler and Twitter\nPublished by The Open Repository @ Binghamton (The ORB), 2023\n \n \nFigure 11: Distribution of the collected parleys by their topic styles  \n \n5. Parler  Changes and Future Outlook  \n \nWhen Parler came back online around Feb. 15 , 2020,  after being removed \nfrom Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s application stores and cut from Amazon\u2019s web services, \nmany of its foundations including its interface, guidelines, and leadership  had been \nchanged ( Otala  et al. 2021; Walsh, 2021).  \nIn this section, we begin with a comparison of Parler\u2019s user guidelines before \nand after the platform shutdown. There are two relevant versions of the guidelines \n(based on timestamps): pre -shutdown (Dec. 2020) and post -shutdown (May 2021).  \nThe Dec. 2020 guidelines (202 0) heavily supported the idea of free speech with two \nmain rules: no illegal activity and no spam. Slight changes were made to the \nguidelines  (Feb. 2021), such as the word \u201cmember\u201d had been changed to \u201cuser\u201d, \nperhaps because \u201cmember\u201d could connote a sense of belonging to a group while \n\u201cuser\u201d might imply a more distant relationship.  Parler also introduced a Guidelines \nEnforcement document which has a very different tone and seems to us that th is \ndocument is put together as a response to Parler\u2019s role in the Capitol insurrection. \nThe document begins immediately by addressing \u201cthe particular risk posed by \ncontent that threatens or incites violence\u201d by introducing both automated and \nhuman content filtering mechanisms.  The Enforcement document more recently \n(May 2021) addresses stipulations from Apple\u2019s application store contract making \nall trolling content inaccessible on iOS devices.  \nBadges, a notable feature of Parler prior to shut down , was expa nded upon \ncoming back online. Now including a \u2018Verified User Showing Real Name\u2019 badge \nwhich can be attached to an account, this is a great addition to the platform since \npreviously Parler was more relaxed about users impersonating others (Otala et al., \n2021). This led to a large influx of parody accounts which may still exist. Badges \nare present on other platforms, such as Twitter\u2019s blue check mark, and primarily \nserve to verify a user\u2019s identity. Parler previously had an identity verification \nprocess in wh ich users could upload a state -issued ID to obtain a \u2018Verified Real \nUser badge\u2019. While this badge is still listed as one of Parler\u2019s available badges, the \n12Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), Vol. 5, No. 1 [2023], Art. 5\nhttps://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5\nDOI: 10.22191/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5/\nprocess to upload the state -issued ID cannot be found on the new version of the \napplication.  \nPrior to  the Parler shutdown, there were six types of metadata associated with \na given user which could be accessed by visiting that user\u2019s profile while logged \ninto the application: number of followers, number of followings , number of \ncomments, number of votes, n umber of parleys, and number of pieces of media. \nThose pieces of metadata were hidden when trying to access a given user\u2019s Parler \nprofile from a public view (without having logged into a Parler account). This made \nmost web crawling and automated data colle ction processes difficult if not \nimpossible. Unfortunately,  after the resurgence of Parler, they have hidden all \nexcept two types of metadata associated with a user: number of followers and \nnumber of followings . This means we cannot fully compare every asp ect of the \nusage of Parler by politicians before and after the shutdown.  \nAnother feature added to the new version of Parler is trolling and NSFW (Not \nSafe for Work) filters as mentioned in the new user guidelines. Some NSFW \ncontent is filtered,  and some is still present on the application without warning. This \nonly further confirms our previous statements about the immature design of the \nplatform. While conduct ing manual data collection, the search engine shows some \nlevel of  malfunction or irregularity since Dec./Jan. 2021, and occasionally requires \nyou to log in and log back in to complete the search.  \nLooking to the future, Parler is not the only anti -Twitter -and-Facebook \nplatform growing since major networks have boycotted Trump's access.  Gettr, a \nnew platform was launched and led by Trump\u2019s former spokesman, Jason Miller. \nGettr advertised its mission statement as \u201cfighting to cancel culture, promoting \ncommon sense, defending free speech, challenging social media monopolies, and \ncreating a true marketplace of ideas\u201d (MCGraw et al., 2021). It is questionable how \nthis statement can justify the enormous racist and hateful contents observed on \nGettr which would be filtered immediately on major networks.  \nParler and Gettr seem to have similar shared values and organizational \nmissions which makes their comparison relevant to this study.  \nFrom a design and application point of view, Gettr and Parler are both kickoff \nof Twitter. So far, pro -Trump topics have been highly trended on the Gettr posts \nincluding hashtages such as #MAGA, #KeepAmericaGreat, #DefendFreedom \n(Ghaffary, 2021). This also implies that many Gettr users identified themselves as \npolitical far right and  conservative users. Unfortunately,  there are no available \nstatistics on what percentage of Gettr users have been also Parler users. It should \nbe noted that Gettr\u2019s number of users is not much yet, and obviously it cannot \ncompare to Parler\u2019s numbers at thi s point.   \nYet, Trump has not shown any interest in making a personal account on Gettr \nwhich could defeat the purpose of launching such platforms. In May 2021, Trump \nran his own platform named as \u201cFrom the Desk of Donald Trump\u201d to keep in touch \n13Matthews et al.: Political Polarization on Parler and Twitter\nPublished by The Open Repository @ Binghamton (The ORB), 2023\nwith his su pporters. This was a failed effort since it did not have the functionality \nof a social media platform and seemed more like a blog. Also, the site could attract \nonly a small proportion of his followers. Thus, the platform was shut down in less \nthan a month.   \nParler and Gettr are struggling to compete with dominant major platforms  \nwho established content moderation policies.  \n \n6. Conclusion   \n \nIn this paper, we have examined the evolution of the Parler platform. We \ndescribed the changes made following its high-profile shutdown in early 2021. It \nhas not faded away, but gains in follower counts since it came back online have \nbeen modest. The new Parler has new community guidelines as well as new features \nand interfaces.  \n Despite being one of the most impactful migr ation attempts, it really has been \nmore the addition of Parler rather than a migration away from Twitter to Parler. \nParler is still used much less than Twitter and  we only see one true \u201cboycotter\u201d of \nTwitter in our sample of right -wing politicians and pu ndits, underscoring that \nmigration away from a successful platform is not easy.  \nWe compare Twitter and Parler  usage by both US politicians and by a set of \nright -leaning pundits. We find that politicians who are most active on Parler are \nsome of the most right -leaning politicians,  but most of them (with one notable \nexception) post actively on Twitter as well. US H ouse members use Parler much \nmore than US Senators. We perform a manual topic analysis, identifying polarized \nposts and posts in 7 high -level topic styles.  We find that pundits post substantially \nmore polarizing content - both in terms of the type of link s they forward and in \nterms of the average number of posts with polarized content per user.  \nOverall, Parler revived after a massive disruption, but it was forced to change \nits content moderations policies in substantial ways,  and it shows little sign of t ruly \nchallenging the dominance of Twitter. Given that it represents one of the most \ndramatic attempts at platform migration, it seems that Parler and networks like it \nwill put little dent in the dominant social media platform direction of increased \ncontent  moderation. After acquisition by Elon Musk, Twitter itself has drastically \nreduced its own content moderation activity. Comparing the network graphs of \nParler and Twitter, we see that the Twitter network is highly polarized, while the \nParler network is no t. This is primarily because the democratic or left leaning  \n\u201cpole\u201d from Twitter is almost completely absent on Parler.  \nIn future work, we are focusing on strategies for controlling misinformation, \nespecially amplification of misinformation, such as allowi ng users to post content \nbut algorithmically limiting the degree to which it is amplified in the feeds of other \nusers who do not actively seek out such content. We hypothesize that content \n14Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), Vol. 5, No. 1 [2023], Art. 5\nhttps://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5\nDOI: 10.22191/nejcs/vol5/iss1/5/\nmoderation policies that allow users to post what they want but red uce \namplification of extreme views or misinformation could be more useful for keeping \npolitical discourse in a shared digital space.  \n \n \nReferences  \n \nAllyn , B. & Treisman , R.

It has\nweakened public trust in governments and its potential impact on the contentious \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum and the equally\ndivisive 2016 U.S. presidential election \u2013 which it might have affected [Pogue 2017] \u2013 is yet to be realized [Allcott and\nGentzkow 2017; Zafarani et al .2019; Zhou et al .2019b]. The reach of fake news was best highlighted during the critical\nmonths of the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. During that period, the top twenty frequently-discussed fake\nelection stories generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook, ironically, more than the 7,367,000\nfor the top twenty most-discussed election stories posted by 19 major news websites [Silverman 2016]. Research has\nshown that compared to the truth, fake news on Twitter is typically retweeted by many more users and spreads far\nmore rapidly, especially for political news [Vosoughi et al .2018]. Our economies are not immune to the spread of fake\nnews either, with fake news being connected to stock market fluctuations and large trades. For example, fake news\nAuthors\u2019 addresses: Xinyi Zhou, Data Lab, EECS Department, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA, zhouxinyi@data.syr.edu; Reza Zafarani,\nData Lab, EECS Department, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA, reza@data.syr.edu.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not\nmade or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

These events and losses have motivated fake news research and sparked the discussion\naround fake news, as observed by skyrocketing usage of terms such as \u201cpost-truth\u201d \u2013 selected as the international word\nof the year by Oxford Dictionaries in 2016 [Wang 2016].\nWhile fake news is not a new phenomenon [Tandoc Jr et al .2018], questions such as why it has emerged as a global\ntopic of interest and why it is attracting increasingly more public attention are particularly relevant at this time. The\nleading cause is that fake news can be created and published online faster and cheaper when compared to traditional\nnews media such as newspapers and television [Shu et al .2017]. The rise of social media and its popularity also plays\nan essential role in this surge of interest [Olteanu et al .2019; Zafarani et al .2014]. As of August 2018, around two thirds\n(68%) of Americans get their news from social media.1With the existence of an echo chamber effect on social media,\nbiased information is often amplified and reinforced [Jamieson and Cappella 2008]. As an ideal platform to accelerate\nfake news dissemination, social media breaks the physical distance barrier among individuals, provides rich platforms\nto share, forward, vote, and review, and encourages users to participate and discuss online news. This surge of activity\naround online news can lead to grave repercussions and substantial potential political and economic benefits. Such\ngenerous benefits encourage malicious entities to create, publish, and spread fake news.\nTake the dozens of \u201cwell-known\u201d teenagers in the Macedonian town of Veles as an example of users who created\nfake news for millions on social media and became wealthy by penny-per-click advertising during the U.S. presidential\nelection. As reported by the NBC, each individual \u201chas earned at least $60,000 in the past six months \u2013 far outstripping\ntheir parents\u2019 income and transforming his prospects in a town where the average annual wage is $4,800.\u201d [Smith and\nBanic 2016]. The tendency of individuals to overestimate the benefits associated with disseminating fake news rather\nthan its costs, as the valence effect indicates [Jones and McGillis 1976], further attracts individuals to engage in fake\nnews activities. Clearly, when governments, parties, and business tycoons are standing behind fake news generation,\nseeking its tempting power and profits, there is a greater motivation and capability to make fake news more persuasive\nand indistinguishable from truth to the public. But, how can fake news gain public trust?\nSocial and psychological factors play an important role in fake news gaining public trust and further facilitate the\nspread of fake news. For instance, humans have been proven to be irrational and vulnerable when differentiating between\ntruth and falsehood while overloaded with deceptive information. Studies in social psychology and communications\nhave demonstrated that human ability to detect deception is only slightly better than chance: typical accuracy rates\nare in the 55%-58% range, with a mean accuracy of 54% over 1,000 participants in over 100 experiments [Rubin 2010].\nThe situation is more critical for fake news than other types of information. For news, where one expects authenticity\nand objectivity, it is relatively easier to gain public trust. In addition, individuals tend to trust fake news after repeated\nexposures ( validity effect [Boehm 1994]), or if it confirms their preexisting beliefs ( confirmation bias [Nickerson 1998]) or\nattitudes ( selective exposure [Freedman and Sears 1965; Metzger et al .2015]), or if it pleases them ( desirability bias [Fisher\n1993]). Peer pressure can also at times \u201ccontrol\u201d our perception and behavior (e.g., bandwagon effect [Leibenstein 1950]).\nThe many perspectives on what fake news is, what characteristics and nature fake news or those who disseminate it\nshare, and how fake news can be detected motivate the need for a comprehensive introduction and in-depth analysis,\nwhich this survey aims to develop. In addition, this survey aims to attract researchers within general areas of data\nmining, machine learning, graph mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Retrieval (IR). More\nimportantly, we hope to boost collaborative efforts among experts in computer and information sciences, political\n1https://www.journalism.org/2018/09/10/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2018/\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 3\nTable 1.

Before further specification, we present an overview of this survey in Section 1.3.\n1.1 What is Fake News?\nThere has been no universal definition for fake news, even in journalism. A clear and accurate definition helps lay a\nsolid foundation for fake news analysis and evaluating related studies. Here we (I) distinguish between several concepts\nthat frequently co-occur or have overlaps with fake news, (II) present a broad and a narrow definition for the term fake\nnews , justifying each definition, and (III) further discuss the potential research problems raised by such definitions.\nI. Related Concepts. Existing studies often connect fake news to terms and concepts such as deceptive news [Allcott\nand Gentzkow 2017; Lazer et al .2018; Shu et al .2017], false news [Vosoughi et al .2018], satire news [Rubin et al .2015;\nTandoc Jr et al .2018; Wardle 2017], disinformation [Kshetri and Voas 2017; Wardle 2017], misinformation [Kucharski 2016;\nWardle 2017], cherry-picking [Asudeh et al .2020], clickbait [Chen et al .2015] and rumor [Zubiaga et al .2018]. Based\non how these terms and concepts are defined, we can distinguish one from the others based on three characteristics:\n(i)authenticity (containing anynon-factual statement or not), (ii) intention (aiming to mislead or entertain the public),\nand (iii) whether the information is news . Table 1 summarizes these related concepts based on these characteristics.\nFor example, disinformation is false information [news or not-news] with a malicious intention to mislead the public.\nII. Defining Fake News. Challenges of fake news research start from defining fake news. To date no universal\ndefinition is provided for fake news, where it has been looked upon as \u201ca news article that is intentionally and verifiably\nfalse\u201d [Allcott and Gentzkow 2017; Shu et al .2017] (deceptive news), \u201ca news article or message published and propagated\nthrough media, carrying false information regardless of the means and motives behind it\u201d which overlaps with false\nnews, disinformation [Kshetri and Voas 2017], misinformation [Kucharski 2016], satire news [Rubin et al .2015], or\neven the stories that a person does not like (considered improper) [Golbeck et al .2018]. Furthermore, what news is has\nbecome harder to define as it can range from an account of a recent, interesting, and significant event, to a dramatic\naccount of something novel or deviant; in particular, \u201cthe digitization of news has challenged traditional definitions of\n2For example, Golbeck et al. regard satire news as \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d [Golbeck et al .2018] while Tandoc Jr et al. state that \u201cwhere parodies differ from\nsatires is their use of non-factual information to inject humor.\u201d [Tandoc Jr et al. 2018]\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n4 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nnews. Online platforms provide space for non-journalists to reach a mass audience. \u201d [Tandoc Jr et al .2018]. Under these\ncircumstances, we first broadly define fake news as:\nDefinition 1 (Broad definition of fake news). Fake news is false news,\nwhere news broadly includes articles, claims, statements, speeches, posts, among other types of information related to\npublic figures and organizations. It can be created by journalists and non-journalists. Such definition of news raises\nsome social concerns, e.g., the term \u201cfake news\u201d should be \u201cabout more than news\u201d and \u201cabout the entire information\necosystem.\u201d [Wardle 2017] The broad definition aims to impose minimum constraints in accord with the current\nresources: it emphasizes information authenticity, purposefully adopts a broad definition for the term news [Vosoughi\net al.2018], and weakens the requirement for information intention due to the difficulty in obtaining the ground truth\n(true intention). This definition supports most existing fake-news-related studies and datasets, as provided by the\nexisting fact-checking websites (Section 2.1 provides a detailed introduction). Current fake news datasets often provide\nground truth for the authenticity of claims, statements, speeches, or posts related to public figures and organizations,\nwhile limited information is provided on intentions.\nWe provide a more narrow definition of fake news, which satisfies the overall requirements for fake news as follows.\nDefinition 2 (Narrow definition of fake news). Fake news is intentionally false news published by a news outlet.\nThis narrow definition supports recent advancements in fake news studies [Allcott and Gentzkow 2017; Shu et al .\n2017]. It addresses the public\u2019s perception of fake news, especially following the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Note\nthat deceptive news is more harmful and less distinguishable than incautiously false news, as the former pretends to be\ntruth to mislead the public better. The narrow definition emphasizes both news authenticity and intentions; it also\nensures the posted information is news by investigating if its publisher is a news outlet (e.g., CNN and New York\nTimes). Often news outlets publish news in the form of articles with fixed components: a title, author(s), a body text,\nimage(s) and/or video(s) that include the claims made by, or about, public figures and organizations.\nBoth definitions require the authenticity of fake news to be false (i.e., being non-factual). As the goal is to provide a\nscientific definition for fake news; hence, news falsity should be derived by comparing with objective facts and not\nwith individual viewpoints (preferences). Hence, it is improper to consider fake news as articles that do not agree with\nindividuals\u2019 or groups\u2019 interests or viewpoints, which is sometimes how the term fake news is used by the general\npublic or in politics [Golbeck et al .2018]. Such falsity can be assigned to the whole or part of the news content, or even\nto true news when subsequent events have rendered the original truth outdated (e.g., \u201cBritain has control over fifty-six\ncolonial countries\u201d). In this general framework, a more comprehensive strategy for automatic fake news detection is\nneeded, as the aforementioned fake news types emphasize various aspects of detection (see Section 6 for a discussion).\nIII. Discussion. We have differentiated between fake and fake news-related terms based on three properties (au-\nthenticity, intention, and if it is news). We have also defined fake news as (1) deceptive news, narrowly and as (2)\nfalse news, broadly. Questions are thus left, such as how to [manually or automatically] identify the authenticity and\nintention of the given information (news)? Many domain-experts and platforms have investigated ways to analyze news\nauthenticity manually; however, how one can automatically assess news authenticity in an effective and explainable\nmanner is still an open issue. We will detail both manual and automatic assessment of news authenticity (also known\nasfact-checking ) in Section 2. To assess information (news) intention, analyzing the news (i) writing style and its (ii)\npropagation patterns can be useful. First, the information (news) created to mislead or deceive the public intentionally\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 5\n(e.g., deceptive news) should look or sound \u201cmore persuasive\u201d compared to the news without such intentions (e.g., satire\nnews). Secondly, malicious users should play a part in the propagation of deceptive information (news) to enhance\nits social influence. Both news writing styles and propagation characteristics will be discussed with current methods\nin Sections 3-5. For intention analysis, often some level of manual news annotation is necessary. The accuracy of\nsuch annotations dramatically impacts automatic intention analysis within a machine learning framework. When the\nintentions behind non-factual information are determined, intervention strategies can be more appropriate and effective.\nFor example, punitive measures should be taken against non-factual information and those who intentionally create it.\n1.2 Fundamental Theories\nFundamental human cognition and behavior theories developed across various disciplines, such as social sciences\nand economics, provide invaluable insights for fake news analysis. These theories can introduce new opportunities\nfor qualitative and quantitative studies of bigfake news data [Zhou et al .2019a]. These theories can also facilitate\nbuilding well-justified and explainable models for fake news detection and intervention, which, to date, have been\nrarely available [Miller et al .2017]. We have conducted a comprehensive literature survey across various disciplines\nand have identified well-known theories that can be potentially used to study fake news. These theories are provided in\nTable 2 along with short descriptions, which are related to either (I) the news itself or (II) its spreaders.\nI. News-related theories. News-related theories reveal the possible characteristics of fake news content compared to\ntrue news content. For instance, theories have implied that fake news potentially differs from the truth in terms of, e.g.,\nwriting style and quality (by Undeutsch hypothesis ) [Undeutsch 1967], quantity such as word counts (by information\nmanipulation theory ) [McCornack et al .2014], and sentiments expressed (by four-factor theory ) [Zuckerman et al .1981].\nIt should be noted that these theories, developed by forensic psychology, target deceptive statements or testimonies (i.e.,\ndisinformation) but not fake news, though these are similar concepts (see Section 1.1 for details). Thus, one research\nopportunity is to verify whether these attributes (e.g., information sentiment polarity) are statistically distinguishable\namong disinformation, fake news, and the truth, in particular, using big fake news data. On the other hand, these\n(discriminative) attributes identified can be used to automatically detect fake news using its writing style, where a\ntypical study using supervised learning can be seen in [Zhou et al .2019a]; we will provide further details in Section 3.\nII. User-related theories. User-related theories investigate the characteristics of users involved in fake news activities,\ne.g., posting, forwarding, liking, and commenting. Fake news, unlike information such as fake reviews [Jindal and Liu\n2008], can \u201cattract\u201d both malicious and normal users [Shao et al .2018]. Malicious users (e.g., some social bots [Ferrara\net al.2016]) spread fake news often intentionally and are driven by benefits [Hovland et al .1957; Kahneman and Tversky\n2013]. Some normal users (which we denote as vulnerable normal users) can frequently and unintentionally spread\nfake news without recognizing the falsehood. Such vulnerability psychologically stems from (i) social impacts and\n(ii)self-impact , where theories have been accordingly categorized and detailed in Table 2. Specifically, as indicated\nby the bandwagon effect [Leibenstein 1950], normative influence theory [Deutsch and Gerard 1955], social identity\ntheory [Ashforth and Mael 1989], and availability cascade [Kuran and Sunstein 1999], to be liked and/or accepted by\nthe community, normal users are encouraged to engage in fake news activities when many users have done so (i.e.,\npeer pressure ). One\u2019s trust to fake news and his or her unintentional spreading can be promoted as well when being\nexposed more to fake news (i.e., validity effect ) [Boehm 1994], which often takes place due to the echo chamber effect\non social media [Jamieson and Cappella 2008]. Such trust to fake news can be built when the fake news confirms\none\u2019s preexisting attitudes, beliefs or hypotheses (i.e., confirmation bias [Nickerson 1998], selective exposure [Freedman\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n6 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nTable 2.

[Hovland et al. 1957]\nValence effectPeople tend to overestimate the likelihood of good things happening rather than bad things.[Frijda 1986]\nand Sears 1965], and desirability bias [Fisher 1993]), which are often perceived to surpass that of others [Dunning\net al.1990; Pronin et al .2001; Ward et al .1997] and tend to be insufficiently revised when new refuting evidence\nis presented [B\u00e1lint and B\u00e1lint 2009; Basu 1997]. In such settings, strategies for intervening fake news from a user\nperspective (more discussions on fake news intervention are in Section 6) should be cautiously designed for users\nwith different levels of credibility or intentions, even though they might all engage in the same fake news activity. For\ninstance, it is reasonable to intervene with the spread of fake news by penalizing (e.g., removing) malicious users, but\nnot for normal accounts. Instead, education and personal recommendations of true news articles and refuted fake ones\ncan be helpful for normal users [Vo and Lee 2018]. Such recommendations should not only cater to the topics that the\nusers want to read but should also capture topics that users are most gullible to. In Section 5, we will provide the path\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 7\nStage \n2: \nPublication\nPropagation \npath\nFeedback\nPublisher\n(Source \nweb)\nHeadline\nBodytext\nA \nnews \narticle\nCreator\nStage \n1: \nCreation\nStage \n3: \nPropagation\nSource-based\nStyle-based\nKnowledge-based\nPropagation-based\nBodyimage\nUser\n(Spreader)\nFig. 1. Fake News Life Cycle and Connections to the Four Fake News Detection Perspectives Presented in this Survey\nfor utilizing these theories, i.e., quantifying social and self-impact, to enhance fake news research by identifying user\nintent and evaluating user credibility.\nMeanwhile, we should point out that clearly understanding the potential roles that the fundamental theories listed\nin Table 2 can play in fake news research requires further in-depth investigations of interdisciplinary nature.\n1.3 An Overview of this Survey\nWe have defined fake news (Section 1.1) and presented relevant fundamental theories in various disciplines (Section 1.2).\nThe rest of this survey is organized as follows. We detail the detection of fake news from four perspectives (see Fig. 1\nfor an overview): (I) Knowledge-based methods (Section 2), which detect fake news by verifying if the knowledge within\nthe news content (text) is consistent with facts (true knowledge); (II) Style-based methods (Section 3) are concerned\nwith how fake news is written (e.g., if it is written with extreme emotions); (III) Propagation-based methods (Section 4),\nwhere they detect fake news based on how it spreads online; and (IV) Source-based methods (Section 5) detect fake news\nby investigating the credibility of news sources at various stages (being created, published online, and spread on social\nmedia). In Section 6, we discuss open issues in current fake news studies and in fake news detection. We highlight six\npotential research tasks, hoping to facilitate the development of fake news research. We conclude in Section 7.\nComparison to Related Surveys. Our survey varies from related surveys from three perspectives. First, we discuss the\nways fake news is defined in the current fake news research and its harmfulness to the public. We detail how fake news\nis related to terms such as deceptive news, false news, satire news, disinformation, misinformation, cherry-picking,\nclickbait, and rumor. Compared to related surveys and forums that often provide a specific definition for fake news, this\nsurvey highlights the challenges of defining fake news and introduces both a narrow and a broad definition for it.\nSecond, though recent studies have highlighted the importance of multidisciplinary fake news research [Lazer et al .\n2018], we provide a path towards it by conducting an extensive literature survey across various disciplines, identifying\na comprehensive list of well-known theories. We demonstrate how these theories relate to fake news and its spreaders\nand illustrate technical methods utilizing these theories both in fake news detection and intervention.\nThird, for fake news detection, current surveys have mostly limited their scope to reviewing research from a certain\nperspective (or within a certain research area, e.g., NLP [Oshikawa et al .2018] and data mining [Shu et al .2017]). These\nsurveys generally classify fake news detection models by the types of [deep] machine learning methods used [Oshikawa\net al.2018] or by whether they utilize social context information [Shu et al .2017]. In our survey, we categorize automatic\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n8 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nfake news detection methods from four perspectives: knowledge (Section 2), style (Section 3), propagation (Section 4),\nandsource (Section 5). Reviewing and organizing fake news detection studies in such a way allows analyzing both news\ncontent (mainly Sections 2-3) and the medium (often, social media) on which the news spreads (Sections 4-5), where fake\nnews detection can be defined as a probabilistic/regression problem linked to, e.g., entity resolution andlink prediction\ntasks (Section 2), or a classification problem that relies on, e.g., feature engineering and[text and graph] embedding\ntechniques (Sections 3-5). In our survey of fake news detection, patterns of fake news in terms of its content (text and\nimages, see Figs. 7-8) or how it propagates (see Fig. 10 and Fig. 15) are revealed, algorithms andmodel architectures are\npresented (e.g., Figs. 6, 11, 12-14), and performance of various fake news detection methods are compared (e.g., Table 6).\nWe point out that our survey focuses more on how to construct a fake news dataset, i.e., ground truth data, and the\npossible sources to obtain such ground truth (e.g., Section 2.1), rather than detailing existing datasets, which have been\nprovided in past surveys [Oshikawa et al .2018; Shu et al .2017]. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the contributions to\nautomatic fake news detection by these existing datasets (e.g., CREDBANK [Mitra and Gilbert 2015], LIAR [Wang\n2017], FakeNewsNet [Shu et al .2018], FakevsSatire [Golbeck et al .2018], NELA-GT-2018 [N\u00f8rregaard et al .2019],\nFEVER [Thorne et al .2018], PHEME [Kochkina et al .2018], and Emergent [Ferreira and Vlachos 2016]) and systems\nthat can be used for building datasets (e.g., ClaimBuster [Hassan et al .2017b], XFake [Yang et al .2019], Hoaxy [Shao\net al. 2016], MediaRank [Ye and Skiena 2019], Botometer [Davis et al. 2016], and RumorLens [Resnick et al. 2014].\n2 KNOWLEDGE-BASED FAKE NEWS DETECTION\nWhen detecting fake news from a knowledge-based perspective, one often uses a process known as fact-checking . Fact-\nchecking, initially developed in journalism, aims to assess news authenticity by comparing the knowledge extracted\nfrom to-be-verified news content (e.g., its claims or statements) with known facts. In this section, we will discuss the\ntraditional fact-checking (also known as manual fact-checking ) and how it can be incorporated into automatic means to\ndetect fake news (i.e., automatic fact-checking ).\n2.1 Manual Fact-checking\nBroadly speaking, manual fact-checking can be divided into (I) expert-based and (II) crowd-sourced fact-checking.\nI. Expert-based Manual Fact-checking. Expert-based fact-checking relies on domain-experts as fact-checkers to verify\nthe given news contents. Expert-based fact-checking is often conducted by a small group of highly credible fact-checkers,\nis easy to manage, and leads to highly accurate results, but is costly and poorly scales with the increase in the volume\nof the to-be-checked news contents.\n\u25b6Expert-based Fact-checking Websites. Recently, many websites have emerged to allow expert-based fact-checking\nbetter serve the public. We list and provide details on the well-known websites in Table 3. Some websites provide further\ninformation, for instance, PolitiFact provides \u201cthe PolitiFact scorecard\u201d, which presents statistics on the authenticity\ndistribution of all the statements related to a specific topic (see an example on Donald Trump, the 45th President of the\n5http://www.politifact.com/\n6https://www.factcheck.org/\n7https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker\n8https://www.snopes.com/\n9https://www.truthorfiction.com/\n10https://fullfact.org/\n11http://hoax-slayer.com/\n12https://www.gossipcop.com\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 9\nTable 3.

This information can provide the ground truth on the credibility of a topic [Zhang et al .2018],\nand help identify check-worthy topics (see Section 6 for details) that require further scrutiny for verification. Another\nexample is HoaxSlayer , which is different from most fact-checking websites that focus on information authenticity\nbecause it further classifies the articles and messages into, e.g., hoaxes, spams, and fake news. Though the website\ndoes not provide clear definitions for these categories, its information can be potentially exploited as ground-truth\nfor comparative studies of fake news. In addition to the list provided here, a comprehensive list of fact-checking\nwebsites is provided by Reporters Lab at Duke University,11where over two hundred fact-checking websites across\ncountries and languages are listed. Generally, these expert-based fact-checking websites can provide ground-truth for\nthe detection of fake news, in particular, under the broad definition (Definition 1). Among these websites PolitiFact\nandGossipCop have supported the development of fake news datasets that are publicly available (e.g., LIAR [Wang\n2017] and FakeNewsNet [Shu et al .2018]). The detailed expert-based analysis that these websites provide for checked\ncontents (e.g., what is false and why is it false) carries invaluable insights for various aspects of fake news analysis, e.g.,\nforidentifying check-worthy content [Hassan et al .2017a] and explainable fake news detection [Shu et al .2019a] (see\nSection 6 for more discussions); however, to date, such insights have not been well utilized.\nII. Crowd-sourced Manual Fact-checking. Crowd-sourced fact-checking relies on a large population of regular individu-\nals acting as fact-checkers (i.e., the collective intelligence). Such large population of fact-checkers can be gathered within\nsome common crowd-sourcing marketplaces such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, based on which CREDBANK [Mitra\nand Gilbert 2015], a publicly available large-scale fake news dataset, has been constructed. Compared to expert-based\nfact-checking, crowd-sourced fact-checking is relatively difficult to manage, less credible and accurate due to the\npolitical bias of fact-checkers and their conflicting annotations, and has better (though insufficient) scalability. Hence,\nin crowd-sourced fact-checking, one often needs to (1) filter non-credible users and (2) resolve conflicting fact-checking\nresults; both requirements become more critical as the number of fact-checkers grows. Nevertheless, crowd-sourcing\n11https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n10 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\n(a) (Expert-based) PolitiFact: the PolitiFact scorecard\n (b) (Crowd-sourced) Fiskkit: the tag distribution\nFig. 2. Illustrations of Manual Fact-checking Websites\nplatforms often allow fact-checkers to provide more detailed feedback (e.g., their sentiments or stances), which can be\nfurther explored in fake news studies.\n\u25b6Crowd-sourced Fact-checking Websites. Unlike expert-based fact-checking, crowd-sourced fact-checking websites\nare still in early development. An example is Fiskkit ,12where users can upload articles, provide ratings for sentences\nwithin articles, and choose tags that best describe the articles. The given sources of articles help (i) distinguish the\ntypes of content (e.g., news vs. non-news) and (ii) determine its credibility (Section 5 provides the details). The tags\ncategorized into multiple dimensions allow one to study the patterns across fake and non-fake news articles (see Fig. 2(b)\nfor an example). While crowd-sourced fact-checking websites are not many, we believe more crowd-sourced platforms\nor tools will arise as major Web and social media websites start to realize their importance in identifying fake news\n(e.g., Google,13Facebook,14Twitter,15and Sina Weibo16).\n2.2 Automatic Fact-checking\nManual fact-checking does not scale with the volume of newly created information, especially on social media. To address\nscalability, automatic fact-checking techniques have been developed, heavily relying on Information Retrieval (IR),\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, as well as on network/graph theory [Cohen\net al.2011]. To review these techniques, a unified standard representation of knowledge is first presented that can be\nautomatically processed by machines and has been widely adopted in related studies [Nickel et al. 2016]:\nDefinition 3 (Knowledge). A set of (Subject, Predicate, Object) (SPO) triples extracted from the given\ninformation that well-represent the given information.\nFor instance, the knowledge within sentence \u201cDonald Trump is the president of the U.S.\u201d can be ( DonaldTrump ,\nProfession ,President ). Based on the above representation of knowledge, we present the following widely-accepted\n12http://fiskkit.com/\n13https://blog.google/topics/journalism-news/labeling-fact-check-articles-google-news/\n14https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/12/news-feed-fyi-addressing-hoaxes-and-fake-news/\n15https://blog.twitter.com/2010/trust-and-safety\n16http://service.account.weibo.com/ (sign in required)\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 11\nKnowledge\nextraction\nOpen \nWeb\nRaw \n\"facts\"\nKnowledge-base\n(Reference)\nA \nnews \narticle\n(Input)\nKnowledge\ncomparison\nAuthenticity\n(Output)\nRedundancy\nInvalidity\nConflicts\nUnreliability\nIncompleteness\n100\nStage \n1: \nFact \nextraction\nStage \n2: \nFact-checking\nFig. 3. Automatic News Fact-checking Process\ndefinitions for the key terms that often appear in automatic fact-checking literature for a better understanding [Ciampaglia\net al. 2015; Dong et al. 2014; Shi and Weninger 2016]:\nDefinition 4 (Fact). A fact is a knowledge (SPO triple) verified as truth.\nDefinition 5 (Knowledge Base). Knowledge Base (KB) is a set of facts.\nDefinition 6 (Knowledge Graph). Knowledge Graph (KG) is a graph structure representing the SPO triples in a\nknowledge base, where the entities (i.e., subjects or objects in SPO triples) are represented as nodes and relationships (i.e.,\npredicates in SPO triples) are represented as edges.\nAs a systematic approach for automatic fact-checking of news has never been presented before, here we prioritize\norganizing the related research to clearly present the automatic news fact-checking process over presenting each related\nstudy in detail. The automatic fact-checking process is shown in Fig. 3. It can be divided into two stages: fact extraction\n(a.k.a. knowledge-base construction , see Section 2.2.1) and fact-checking (a.k.a. knowledge comparison , see Section 2.2.2).\n2.2.1 Fact Extraction. To collect facts and construct a KB (KG), knowledge is first extracted from the open Web as\nraw \u201cfacts\u201d that need further processing. Such process often refers to knowledge extraction or relation extraction [Nickel\net al.2016]. Knowledge extraction can be classified into single-source oropen-source knowledge extraction. Single-source\nknowledge extraction, which relies on one comparatively reliable source (e.g., Wikipedia) to extract knowledge, is\nrelatively efficient but often leads to incomplete knowledge (see related studies in [Auer et al .2007; Bollacker et al .2008;\nSuchanek et al .2007]). Open-source knowledge extraction aims to fuse knowledge from distinct sources; hence, it is\nless efficient that single-source knowledge extraction, but leads to more complete knowledge (see related studies in\n[Carlson et al .2010; Dong et al .2014; Nakashole et al .2012; Niu et al .2012]). More recent studies in relation extraction\ncan be seen in [Di et al .2019; Lin et al .2019; Yu et al .2019]. Finally, to form a KB (KG) from these extracted raw \u201cfacts\u201d,\nthey need to be further cleaned-up and completed by addressing the following issues:\n\u2022Redundancy . For example, (DonaldJohnTrump, profession, President) is redundant when having (Donald-\nTrump, profession, President) asDonaldTrump andDonaldJohnTrump match the same entity. The task to\nreduce redundancy is often referred to as entity resolution [Getoor and Machanavajjhala 2012], a.k.a. deduplication\norrecord linkage [Nickel et al .2016] (see related studies in, e.g., [Altowim et al .2014; Bhattacharya and Getoor\n2007; Christen 2008; Steorts et al. 2016; Whang and Garcia-Molina 2012]);\n\u2022Invalidity . The correctness of some facts depends on a specific time interval, for example, (Britain, joinIn,\nEuropeanUnion) has been outdated and should be updated. One way to address this issue is to allow facts to\nhave beginning and ending dates [Bollacker et al .2008]; or one can reify current facts by adding extra assertions\nto them [Hoffart et al. 2013];\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n12 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\n\u2022Conflicts . For example, (DonaldTrump, bornIn, NewYorkCity) and(DonaldTrump, bornIn, LosAngeles)\nare a pair with conflicting knowledge. Conflicts can be resolved by Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)\nmethods [Deng 2015; Kang and Deng 2019; Pasi et al. 2019; Viviani and Pasi 2016];\n\u2022Unreliability (Low-credibility) . For example, the knowledge extracted from The Onion,17a satire news organization,\nis unreliable knowledge. Unreliable knowledge can be reduced by filtering low-credibility website(s) from which\nthe knowledge is extracted. The credibility of website(s) can be obtained from resources such as NewsGuard18\n(expert-based), or systems such as MediaRank [Ye and Skiena 2019]. Section 5 provides more details; and\n\u2022Incompleteness . Raw facts extracted from online resources, particularly, using a single source, are far from\ncomplete. Hence, reliably inferring new facts based on existing facts, a.k.a. KG completion , is necessary to improve\nthe KG being built. KG completion performs link prediction between entities, where the methods can be classified\ninto three groups based on their assumptions: (1) latent feature models , that assume the existence of KB triples is\nconditionally independent given latent features and parameters (e.g., RESCAL [Nickel et al .2012], NTN [Socher\net al.2013], DistMult [Yang et al .2014], TransE [Bordes et al .2013], TransH [Wang et al .2014], TransR [Lin et al .\n2015], ComplEx [Trouillon et al .2016], SimplE [Kazemi and Poole 2018], and ConMask [Shi and Weninger 2018]);\n(2)graph feature models that assume the existence of triples is conditionally independent given observed graph\nfeatures and parameters (e.g., Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) [Lao and Cohen 2010]); and (3) Markov Random\nField (MRF) models , that assume existing triples have local interactions [Nickel et al. 2016].\nNote that instead of building a KB (KG) from scratch, one can rely on existing large-scale ones, e.g., YAGO [Hoffart\net al.2013; Suchanek et al .2007], Freebase [Bollacker et al .2008], NELL [Carlson et al .2010], PATTY [Nakashole et al .\n2012], DBpedia [Auer et al. 2007], Elementary/DeepDive [Niu et al. 2012], and Knowledge Vault [Dong et al. 2014].\n2.2.2 Fact-checking. To assess the authenticity of news articles, we need to compare the knowledge extracted from\nto-be-verified news content (i.e., SPO triples) with the facts (i.e., true knowledge). KBs (KGs) are suitable resources for\nproviding ground truth for news fact-checking, i.e., we can reasonably assume that the existing triples in a KB (KG)\nrepresent facts. However, for non-existing triples, their authenticity relies on assumptions made \u2013 we list three common\nassumptions below \u2013 and we may need further inference:\n\u2022Closed-world assumption : non-existing triples indicate false knowledge;\n\u2022Open-world assumption : non-existing triples indicate unknown knowledge that can be either true or false; and\n\u2022Local closed-world assumption [Dong et al .2014] : the authenticity of non-existing triples can be determined by\nthe following rule: let T(s,p)denote the set of existing triples in the KB (KG) for subject sand predicate p. For\nany(s,p,o)<T(s,p), if|T(s,p)|>0, we say the triple is false; if |T(s,p)|=0, its authenticity is unknown.\nGenerally, the fact-checking strategy for a ( Subject ,Predicate ,Object ) triple is to evaluate the possibility that the\nedge labeled Predicate exists from the node labeled Subject to the node representing Object in a KG. Specifically,\nStep 1: Entity locating .Subject (Similarly, Object ) is first matched with a node in the KG that represents the same entity\nas the Subject (similarly, Object ), where entity resolution techniques (e.g., [Altowim et al .2014; Bhattacharya\nand Getoor 2007; Trivedi et al. 2018]) can be used to identify proper matchings.\nStep 2: Relation verification . Triple ( Subject ,Predicate ,Object ) is considered as truth if an edge labeled Predicate\nfrom the node representing Subject to the one representing Object exists in the KG. Otherwise, its authenticity\nis (1) false based on the aforementioned closed-world assumption, or (2) determined after knowledge inference .\n17https://www.theonion.com/\n18http://www.newsguardtech.com/\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 13\nStep 3: Knowledge inference . When the triple ( Subject ,Predicate ,Object ) does not exist in the KG, the probability for\nthe edge labeled Predicate to exist from the node representing Subject to the one representing Object in the\nKG can be computed, e.g., using link prediction methods such as semantic proximity [Ciampaglia et al .2015],\ndiscriminative predicate path [Shi and Weninger 2016], or LinkNBed [Trivedi et al. 2018].\nFinally, we conclude this section by formally defining the problem of automatic news fact-checking in Problem 1,\nand discussing the potential research avenues in automatic news fact-checking in Section 2.2.3.\nProblem 1 (Fact-checking). Assume a to-be-verified news article is represented as a set of knowledge statements, i.e.,\nSPO triples(si,pi,oi),i=1,2, . . . , n. Let GKBrefer to a knowledge graph containing a set of facts (i.e., true knowledge)\ndenoted by(stj,ptj,otj),j=1,2, . . . , m. News fact-checking is to identify a function Fthat assigns an authenticity value\nAi\u2208[0,1]to each corresponding (si,pi,oi)by comparing it with every (stj,ptj,otj)in the knowledge graph, where Ai=1\n(Ai=0) indicates the triple is true (false). The final authenticity index A\u2208[0,1]of the to-be-verified news article is obtained\nby aggregating all Ai\u2019s. To summarize,\nF:(si,pi,oi)GKB\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Ai,\nA=I(A1,A2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,An),(1)\nwhereIis an aggregation function of choice ( e.g., weighted or arithmetic average). The to-be-verified news article is true if\nA=1, and is [completely] false if A=0. Specifically, function Fcan be formulated as\nF((si,pi,oi),GKB)=P(edge labeled pilinking s\u2032\nitoo\u2032\niinGKB), (2)\nwhere P(\u00b7)denotes the probability, and s\u2032\niando\u2032\niare the matched entities to siandoiinGKB, respectively:\ns\u2032\ni=arg min\nstj|D(si,stj)|<\u03b8,o\u2032\ni=arg min\notj|D(oi,otj)|<\u03b8. (3)\nIn Eq. (3),D(a,b)measures the distance between entity aandb. Such distance can be computed by, e.g., Jaccard distance\ndirectly, or by cosine distance after entity embedding. When the distance between aandbis zero (i.e.,D(a,b)=0), or the\ndistance is less than a certain threshold \u03b8(i.e.,|D(a,b)|<\u03b8), one can regard aas the same entity as b.\n2.2.3 Discussion. We have detailed fact extraction (i.e., KB/KG construction) and fact-checking (i.e., knowledge\ncomparison), the two main components of automatic news fact-checking. There are some open issues and several\npotential research tasks. First, when collecting facts to construct KB (KG), one concern is the source(s) from which\nfacts are extracted. In addition to the traditional sources such as Wikipedia, some other sources, e.g., fact-checking\nwebsites that contain expert analysis and justifications for checked news content, might help provide high-quality\ndomain knowledge. However, such sources have rarely been considered in current research. Second, we highlight the\nvalue of research on dynamic KBs (KGs) for news fact-checking that can automatically remove invalid knowledge and\nintroduce new facts. Such properties are especially important due to news timeliness \u2013 news articles are often not\nabout \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d, but around recent events. Third, it has been verified that fake news spreads faster than\ntrue news [Vosoughi et al .2018], which attaches great importance to fast news fact-checking to achieve fake news\nearly detection (see Section 6 for a summary and discussion). Current research in building KBs (KGs) has focused on\nconstructing KBs (KGs) with as many facts as possible. However, fast news fact-checking requires not only identifying\nparts of the to-be-verified news that is check-worthy (see Section 6 for a discussion on identifying check-worthy\ncontent), but also a KB (KG) that only stores as many \u201cvaluable\u201d facts as possible (i.e., a KB (KG) simplification process ).\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n14 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\n3 STYLE-BASED FAKE NEWS DETECTION\nSimilar to knowledge-based fake news detection (Section 2), style-based fake news detection also focuses on analyzing\nthe news content. However, knowledge-based methods mainly evaluate the authenticity of the given news, while\nstyle-based methods can assess news intention , i.e., is there an intention to mislead the public or not? The intuition\nand assumption behind style-based methods is that malicious entities prefer to write fake news in a \u201cspecial\u201d style\nto encourage others to read and convince them to trust. Before discussing how such \u201cspecial\u201d content styles can be\nautomatically identified, we first define fake news style in a way that facilitates use of machine learning:\nDefinition 7 (Fake News Style). A set of quantifiable characteristics (e.g., machine learning features) that can well\nrepresent fake news content and differentiate it from true news content.\nBased on this definition for fake news style, style-based fake news detection is often formulated as a binary (or at\ntimes, a multi-label) classification problem:\nProblem 2 (Style-based Fake News Detection). Assume a to-be-verified news article Ncan be represented as a set\nofkcontent features denoted by feature vector f\u2208Rk. The task to verify the news article based on its content style is to\nidentify a functionS, such that\nS:fT D\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u02c6y (4)\nwhere \u02c6y\u2208{0(true ),1(fake )}is the predicted news label and T D={(fl,yl)|fl\u2208Rk,yl\u2208{0,1},l=1. . .n}is\nthe training dataset. The training dataset helps estimate the parameters within Sand consists of a set of nnews articles\nrepresented by the same set of features ( fl) with known news labels ( yl).\nHence, the performance of style-based fake news detection methods rely on (I) how well the style of news content\n(text and images) can be captured and represented (see Section 3.1); and (II) how the classifier (model) is performing\nbased on different news content representations (see Section 3.2). In addition, we summarize (III) some verified patterns\nof fake news content style in Section 3.3, and provide (IV) our discussion on style-based methods in Section 3.4.\n3.1 Style Representation\nAs provided in Definition 7, the content style is commonly represented by a set of quantifiable characteristics, often\nmachine learning features. Generally, these features can be grouped into textual features (see Section 3.1.1) and visual\nfeatures (see Section 3.1.2), representing news text and images, respectively.\n3.1.1 News Text. Broadly speaking, textual features can be grouped into (I) general features and (II) latent features .\n\u25b6General textual features. General textual features are often used to detect fake news within a traditional machine\nlearning framework (detailed in Section 3.2.1). These features describe content style from (at least) four language levels:\n(i)lexicon , (ii) syntax , (iii) discourse and (iv) semantic [Conroy et al .2015]. The main task at the lexicon level is to assess\nthe frequency statistics of lexicons, which can be basically conducted using a Bag-Of-Word (BOW) model [Zhou et al .\n2019a]. At the syntax level, shallow syntax tasks are performed by Part-Of-Speech (POS)-taggers to assess POS (e.g.,\nnouns and verbs) frequencies [Feng et al .2012; Zhou et al .2019a]. Deep syntax tasks are performed by Probabilistic\nContext-Free Grammar (PCFG) parse trees (see Fig. 4 for an example) that enable assessing the frequencies of rewrite\nrules (i.e., productions) [Feng et al .2012; P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al .2017; Zhou et al .2019a]. Four different encodings of rewrite\nrules can be considered for a PCFG parse tree [Feng et al. 2012]:\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 15\nFig. 4. PCFG Parse Tree for the sentence \u201cThe CIA confirmed Rus-\nsian interference in the presidential election\u201d in a fake news article (di-\nrectly from [Zhou et al .2019a]). The lexicalized rewrite rules of this\nsentence are: S\u2192NP PP, NP\u2192DT NNP VBN JJ NN, PP \u2192IN NP, NP\u2192DT\nJJ NN, DT\u2192\u201cthe\u201d, NNP\u2192\u201cCIA\u201d, VBN\u2192\u201cconfirmed\u201d, JJ\u2192\u201cRussian\u201d,\nNN\u2192\u201cinterference\u201d, IN\u2192\u201cin\u201d, JJ\u2192\u201cpresidential\u201d, and NN \u2192\u201celection\u201d.\nFig. 5. Rhetorical Structure for the partial content \u201cHuffington Post is\nreally running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA\nconfirming Russian interference in the presidential election. They\u2019re saying\nif 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!\u201d in a\nfake news article (directly from [Zhou et al .2019a]). Here, one elaboration,\none attribution, and one condition rhetorical relationship exist.\n\u2022r: unlexicalized rewrite rules, i.e., all rewrite rules except for those with leaf nodes such as IN \u2192\u201cin\u201d;\n\u2022r\u2217: lexicalized rewrite rules, i.e., all rewrite rules;\n\u2022\u02c6r: unlexicalized rewrite rules with grandparent nodes, e.g., PP\u02c6S \u2192IN NP; and\n\u2022\u02c6r\u2217: lexicalized rewrite rules with grandparent nodes, e.g., IN\u02c6PP \u2192\u201cin\u201d.\nAt the discourse level, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and rhetorical parsing tools can be used to capture the\nfrequencies of rhetorical relations among sentences as features [Karimi and Tang 2019; Zhou et al .2019a] (see Fig. 5 for\nan illustration). Finally, at a semantic level, such frequencies can be assigned to lexicons or phrases that fall into each\npsycho-linguistic category (e.g., those defined in Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) [P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al .2017]), or\nthat fall into each self-defined psycho-linguistic attribute. These attributes can be derived from experience, or be inspired\nby related deception theories (see news-related theories in Table 2 or [Zhou et al .2019a] as a typical interdisciplinary\nfake news study). Based on our investigation, such attributes and their corresponding computational features can\nbe grouped along ten dimensions: quantity [McCornack et al .2014], complexity ,uncertainty ,subjectivity [Undeutsch\n1967], non-immediacy ,sentiment [Zuckerman et al .1981], diversity [Undeutsch 1967], informality [Undeutsch 1967],\nspecificity [Johnson and Raye 1981], and readability (see Table 4), which are initially developed for identifying deception\nin computer-mediated communications [Fuller et al .2009; Zhou et al .2004b] and testimonies [Afroz et al .2012], and\nrecently used in fake news detection [Bond et al. 2017; P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al. 2017; Potthast et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2019a].\nIt should be noted that \u201cfrequency\u201d can be defined and computed in three ways. Assume a corpus Ccontains p\nnews articlesC={A1,A2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,Ap}and a total of qwords W={w1,w2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,wq}(POS tags, rewrite rules, rhetorical\nrelationships, etc.). xi\njdenotes the number of wjappearing inAi. Then the \u201cfrequency\u201d of wjfor newsAican be:\n\u2022Absolute frequency fa, i.e., fa=xi\nj;\n\u2022Standardized frequency fs, which removes the impact of content length, i.e., fs=xi\nj\u00cd\njxi\nj[Zhou et al. 2019a]; or\n\u2022Relative frequency frby using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which further compares\nsuch frequency with that in other news articles in the corpus, i.e., fr=xi\nj\u00cd\njxi\njlnp1\u00cd\nixi\nj[P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al .2017].\nIn general, TF-IDF can be applied at various language levels, so can n-gram models which enable capturing the sequence\nof words (POS tags, rewrite rules, etc.) [Feng et al. 2012; P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al. 2017].\n\u25b6Latent textual features. Latent textual features are often used for news text embedding. Such an embedding can\nbe conducted at the word-level [Mikolov et al .2013; Pennington et al .2014], sentence-level [Arora et al .2016; Le and\nMikolov 2014], or document-level [Le and Mikolov 2014]; results are vectors representing a news article and can be\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n16 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nTable 4.

Such embeddings (often at the word-level) can be further\nincorporated into neural network architectures (e.g., Convolution Neural Networks, CNNs [He et al .2016; Huang\net al.2017; Krizhevsky et al .2012; LeCun et al .1989; Simonyan and Zisserman 2014; Szegedy et al .2015], Recurrent\nNeural Networks, RNNs [Cho et al .2014; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997; Schuster and Paliwal 1997], and the\nTransformer [Devlin et al .2018; Vaswani et al .2017]) to predict fake news within a deep learning framework (see\ndetails in Section 3.2.2), where CNNs represent news text from a local to global view, and RNNs and the Transformer\ncapture the sequences with news text. Theoretically, such latent representation can also be obtained by matrix or tensor\nfactorization; current style-based fake news detection studies have rarely considered them, while a few studies focusing\non the propagation aspects of fake news have considered these methods, which we will review later in Section 4.\n3.1.2 News Images. Currently, not many studies exist on detecting fake news by exploring news images [Shu et al .\n2017]. News images can be represented by hand-crafted (i.e., non-latent) features, e.g., the visual features defined in [Jin\net al.2017] (see Table 5). On the other hand, to be further processed by neural networks such as VGG-16/19 [Simonyan\nand Zisserman 2014] to obtain a latent representation, each image is often embedded as a pixel matrix or tensor with\nsizewidth\u00d7hei\u0434ht\u00d7#channel(s), where channels can be the gray value (#channels=1) or RGB data (#channels=3).\n3.2 Style Classification\nWe detail style-based fake news detection models that rely on traditional Machine Learning (ML) (in Section 3.2.1) and\non Deep Learning (DL) [LeCun et al. 2015] (in Section 3.2.2), along with their performance results.\n3.2.1 Traditional Machine Learning-based Models. Within a traditional ML framework, news content is represented\nby using a set of manually selected [latent and non-latent] features, which can be extracted from news images, or text\nat various language levels (lexicon-, syntax-, semantic-, and discourse-level) [Feng et al .2012; P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al .2017;\nZhou et al .2019a]. Machine learning models that can detect news type (e.g., true or fake) based on this representation\ncan be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised, where supervised methods (classifiers) have been mainly used\nfor style-based fake news detection, e.g., style-based methods have relied on SVMs [Feng et al .2012; P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al .\n2017], Random Forests (RF) [Zhou et al. 2019a], and XGBoost [Chen and Guestrin 2016; Zhou et al. 2019a].\nWithin the same experimental setup as that in [Zhou et al .2019a], the performance of [latent and non-latent]\nfeatures at various levels is presented and compared in Table 6.

Multimodal Fake News Detection Models\n3.2.2 Deep Learning-based Models. Within a deep learning framework, news content (text and/or images) is often\nfirst embedded at the word-level [Mikolov et al .2013] (for text), or as a pixel matrix or tensor (for images). Then,\nsuch an embedding is processed by a well-trained neural network (e.g., CNNs [He et al .2016; Huang et al .2017;\nKrizhevsky et al .2012; LeCun et al .1989; Szegedy et al .2015] such as VGG-16/19 [Simonyan and Zisserman 2014]\nand Text-CNN [Kim 2014]; RNNs such as LSTMs [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997], GRUs [Cho et al .2014], and\nBRNNs [Schuster and Paliwal 1997]; and the Transformer [Devlin et al .2018; Vaswani et al .2017]) to extract latent\ntextual and/or visual features of news content. Ultimately, the given news content is classified as true news or fake\nnews often by concatenating and feeding all these features to a well-trained classifier such as a softmax.\nThis general procedure can be improved to, e.g., facilitate explainable fake news detection and enhance feature\nrepresentativeness \u2013 more discussions on explainable fake news detection are provided in Section 6. An example is\nthe Event Adversarial Neural Network ( EANN ) [Wang et al .2018], which can enhance feature representativeness by\nextracting features that are invariant under different world events to represent news content (text and images). Fig.\n6(a) presents the architecture of the EANN model, which has three components: (1) multi-modal feature extractor,\nwhich extracts both textual and visual features from a given news article using neural networks; (2) event discriminator,\nwhich further captures event-invariant features of the given news by playing a min-max game ; and (3) fake news\ndetector for news classification (true or fake). In EANN , the event discriminator ensures that the extracted features are\nrepresentative. Another example is SAFE , a multimodal fake news detection method (see its architecture in Fig. 6(b)).\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 19\nFake True 00.010.020.030.04 % Swear Words \nFake True 00.10.2% Unique Verbs \nFake True 00.020.040.06 % Report Verbs \nFake True 00.050.1% Emotional Words \nFig. 7.

Specifically, SAFE\nassumes that a \u201cgap\u201d often exists between the textual and visual information of fake news by observing that (i) to attract\npublic attention, some fake news writers prefer to use attractive while irrelevant images, and (ii) when a fake news\narticle tells a fake story, it is difficult to find both pertinent and nonmanipulated images to match such fake contents.\n3.3 Patterns of Fake News Content Style\nSome patterns of fake news content (text and images) style are distinguishable from those of the true news. Recent\nstudies have revealed such patterns [Jin et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2019a]. Particularly,\n\u2022Fake news text , compared to true news text as shown in Fig. 7, has higher (i) informality (% swear words), (ii) diversity\n(% unique verbs), (iii) subjectivity (% report verbs), and is (iv) more emotional (% emotional words); and\n\u2022Fake news images , compared to true news images as illustrated in Fig. 8, often have higher clarity and coherence,\nwhile lower diversity and clustering scores (see Table 5 for a description of these features).\n3.4 Discussion\nWe have detailed how to (1) represent and (2) classify news content style, the two main components of style-based fake\nnews detection, along with some [textual and visual] patterns within fake news content that can help distinguish it from\ntrue news content. It should be pointed out that patterns in Fig. 7 are limited to political news articles and those in Fig. 8\ntarget a mix of English (Twitter) and Chinese (Weibo) news articles from vague domains. Hence, a more comprehensive\nanalysis of fake news content style across different domains, languages, time periods, etc. is highly encouraged as\nfake news content style may vary across domains and languages, evolve over time, and ultimately impact prediction\nperformance [P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al .2017] (more discussions on this topic are presented in Section 6). Furthermore, the\nwriting style can be manipulated. Style-based (or knowledge-based) fake news detection relies heavily on news content,\nwhich enables the models to identify fake news before it has been propagated on social media (i.e., to achieve fake\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n20 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nnews early detection , which we discuss more in Section 6). However, such heavy dependence \u201chelps\u201d malicious entities\nbypass style-based models by changing their writing style. In other words, style-based fake news detection sometimes\ncan be a cat-and-mouse game; any success at detection, in turn, will inspire future countermeasures by fake news\nwriters. To resist such an attack, one can further involve social context information into news analysis to enhance\nmodel robustness, which we will discuss next in Sections 4 and 5.\n4 PROPAGATION-BASED FAKE NEWS DETECTION\nWhen detecting fake news from a propagation-based perspective, one can investigate and utilize the information related\nto the dissemination of fake news, e.g., how users spread it. Similar to style-based fake news detection, propagation-\nbased fake news detection is often formulated as a binary (or multi-label) classification problem as well, however,\nwith a different input. Broadly speaking, the input to a propagation-based method can be either a (I) news cascade , a\ndirect representation of news propagation, or a (II) self-defined graph, an indirect representation capturing additional\ninformation on news propagation. Hence, propagation-based fake news detection boils down to classifying (I) news\ncascades or (II) self-defined graphs. We review fake news detection using news cascades in Section 4.1 and fake news\ndetection using self-defined propagation graphs in Section 4.2, and provide our discussions in Section 4.3.\n4.1 Fake News Detection using News Cascades\nWe first define a news cascade in Definition 8, a formal representation of news dissemination that has been adopted by\nmany studies (e.g., [Castillo et al. 2011; Ma et al. 2018; Vosoughi et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2015]).\nDefinition 8 (News Cascade). A news cascade is a tree or tree-like structure that directly captures the propagation of\na certain news article on a social network (Fig. 9 provides examples). The root node of a news cascade represents the user\nwho first shared the news article (i.e., initiator); Other nodes in the cascade represent users that have subsequently spread\nthe article by forwarding it after it was posted by their parent nodes, which they are connected to via edges. A news cascade\ncan be represented in terms of the number of steps (i.e., hops) that the news has traveled (i.e., hop-based news cascade) or\nthe times that it was posted (i.e., time-based news cascade).\nHop-based news cascade , often a standard tree,\nallowing natural measures such as\n- Depth: the maximum number of steps (hops)\nthat the news has traveled within a cascade;\n- Breadth (at hop k): the number of users that\nhave spread the news ksteps (hops) after it was\ninitially posted within a cascade; and\n- Size: the total number of users in a cascade.Time-based news cascade , often a tree-like structure,\nallowing natural measures such as\n- Lifetime: the longest interval during which the news\nhas been propagated;\n- Real-time heat (at time t): the number of users\nposting/forwarding the news at time t; and\n- Overall heat: the total number of users that have\nforwarded/posted the news.\nFig. 9. Illustrations of News Cascades\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 21\nTable 7. News Cascade Features\nFeature Type Feature Description H T P\nCascade Size Overall number of nodes in a cascade [Castillo et al. 2011; Vosoughi et al. 2018] \u2713\u2713\u2713\nCascade Breath Maximum (or average) breadth of a news cascade [Vosoughi et al. 2018] \u2713 \u2713\nCascade Depth Depth of a news cascade [Castillo et al. 2011; Vosoughi et al. 2018] \u2713 \u2713\nStructural Virality Average distance among all pairs of nodes in a cascade [Vosoughi et al. 2018] \u2713 \u2713\nNode DegreeDegree of the root node of a news cascade [Castillo et al. 2011] \u2713\nMaximum (or average) degree of non-root nodes in a news cascade [Castillo et al. 2011] \u2713\nSpread SpeedTime taken for a cascade to reach a certain depth (or size) [Vosoughi et al. 2018] \u2713 \u2713\nTime interval between the root node and its child nodes [Wu et al. 2015] \u2713\nCascade Similarity Similarity scores between a cascade and other cascades in the corpus [Wu et al. 2015] \u2713\nH: Hop-based news cascades; T: Time-based news cascades; P: Pattern-driven features.\nNote that a specific news article can lead to multiple simultaneous cascades due to multiple initiating users. Further-\nmore, often within a news cascade, nodes (users) are represented with a series of attributes and additional information,\ne.g., whether they (support or oppose) the fake news, their profile information, previous posts, and their comments.\nBased on Definition 8, classifying a news article (true or fake) using its cascade(s) boils down to classifying its\ncascade(s) as true or fake. To perform this classification, some proposed methods rely on (I) traditional machine learning,\nwhile others utilize (II) [deep] neural networks.\n\u25b6Traditional Machine Learning (ML) Models. Within a traditional ML framework, to classify a news cascade that has\nbeen represented as a set of features, one often relies on supervised learning methods such as SVMs [Castillo et al .2011;\nKwon et al .2013; Wu et al .2015], decision trees [Castillo et al .2011; Kwon et al .2013], decision rules [Castillo et al .\n2011], na\u00efve Bayes [Castillo et al .2011], and random forests [Kwon et al .2013]. Table 7 summarizes the news cascade\nfeatures used in current research.\nAs shown in Table 7, cascade features can be inspired by fake news propagation patterns observed in empirical studies.\nFor example, a recent study has investigated the differences in diffusion patterns of all verified true and fake news\nstories on Twitter from 2006 to 2017 [Vosoughi et al .2018]. The study reveals that fake news spreads faster, farther, more\nwidely, and is more popular with a higher structure virality score compared to true news . Specifically, the cascade depth,\nmaximum breadth (and mean breadth at every depth), size, and structural virality [Goel et al .2015] (i.e., the average\ndistance among all pairs of nodes in a cascade) for fake news are generally greater than that of true news. Also, the\ntime it takes for fake news cascades to reach any depth (and size) is less than that for true news cascades (see Fig. 10).\nThe cascade features in Table 7 can be viewed from another perspective, where they can either capture the local\nstructure of a cascade, e.g., its depth and width [Castillo et al .2011; Vosoughi et al .2018], or allow comparing the overall\nstructure of a cascade with that of other cascades by computing similarities [Wu et al .2015]. A common strategy to\ncompute such graph similarities is to use graph kernels [Vishwanathan et al .2010]. For example, Wu et al. develop a\nrandom walk graph kernel to compute the similarity between two hop-based news cascades that contain additional\ninformation, e.g., the user roles ( opinion leader ornormal user ) as well as approval, sentiment, and doubt scores for user\nposts (see the structure of such a cascade in Fig. 11(a)).\n\u25b6Deep Learning (DL) Models. Within a DL framework, learning the representation of news cascades often relies on\nneural networks, where a softmax function often acts as a classifier. For example, Ma et al. develop Recursive Neural\nNetworks (RvNNs), a tree-structured neural network, based on news cascades [Bian et al .2020; Ma et al .2018]. A\ntop-down RvNN model with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) is shown in Fig. 11(b). Specifically, for each node jwith a\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n22 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nFig. 10.

Formally, hjis derived using a standard GRU formulation:\nrj=\u03c3(WrxjV+UrhP(j)),\nzj=\u03c3(WzxjV+UzhP(j)),\nhj=zj\u2299tanh(WhxjV+Uh(hP(j)\u2299rj))+(1\u2212zj)\u2299hP(j),(5)\nwhere rjis a reset gate vector, zjis an update gate vector, W\u2217,U\u2217, and Vdenote parameter matrices, \u03c3(\u00b7)is the sigmoid\nfunction, tanh(\u00b7)is the hyperbolic tangent, and \u2299denotes entry-wise product. In this way, a representation (hidden\nstate) is learned for each leaf node in the cascade. These representations are used as inputs to a max-pooling layer,\nwhich computes the final representation hfor the news cascade. Max-pooling layer takes the maximum value of each\ndimension of the hidden state vectors over all the leaf nodes. Finally, the label of news cascade is predicted as\n\u02dcy=Softmax(Qh+b), (6)\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 23\nN\nS\nN\nS\nN\nS\n: \nSusceptible \nuser\nN\n: \nNormal \nuser\n: \nInfluential \nuser\nFollowing \nrelation\n(a) Spreader Net.

These networks can be (1) homogeneous, (2) heterogeneous, or (3) hierarchical.\n\u25b6Homogeneous Network. Homogeneous networks are networks containing a single type of node and a single type\nof edge. One example is the news spreader network (see Fig. 12(a)), a subgraph of social network of users, where each\nnetwork is for a news article; each node in the network is a user spreading the news; and an edge between two nodes\nindicates the following relationship of two news spreaders [Zhou and Zafarani 2019]. Classifying a news article (fake or\ntrue) using its spreader network is equivalent to classifying the network. Recently, Zhou et al. analyze such networks at\nthe level of node,ego,triad ,community , and the overall network [Zhou and Zafarani 2019], respectively, and reveal four\npatterns within fake news spreader networks: (1) More-Spreader Pattern , i.e., more users spread fake news than\ntrue news; (2) Farther-Distance Pattern , i.e., fake news spreads farther than true news; (3) Stronger-Engagement\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n24 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nFake True010203040 Network Diameter\n(a)Farther-Distance\nFake True050010001500# News Spreaders (b)More-Spreaders\nFake True05001000# Engagements (c) Stronger-Engagements\nFake True00.010.020.030.04Ego Density (d) Denser-Networks\nFig. 15. Fake News Network-based Propagation Patterns [Zhou and Zafarani 2019] (PolitiFact+BuzzFeed, data are from FakeNews-\nNet [Shu et al .2018]). Compared to the truth, fake news can (a) spread farther and (b) attract more spreaders, where these spreaders\nare often (c) more strongly engaged with fake news and (d) more densely connected within fake news spreader networks.\nPattern , i.e., spreaders engage more strongly with fake news than with true news; and (4) Denser-Network Pattern ,\ni.e., fake news spreaders form denser networks compared to true news spreaders (see Fig. 15). Another example of a\nhomogeneous network is a stance network [Jin et al .2016], where nodes are news-related posts by users and edges\nrepresent supporting (+) or opposing (-) relations among each pair of posts, e.g., the similarity between each pair of\nposts that can be calculated using a distance measure such as Jensen-Shannon divergence [Jin et al .2016] or Jaccard\ndistance [Jin et al .2014]. The stance network is shown in Fig. 12(b). Fake news detection using a stance network boils\ndown to evaluating the credibility of news-related posts (i.e., lower credibility = fake news), which can be further cast\nas a graph optimization problem. Specifically, let A\u2208Rn\u00d7ndenote the adjacency matrix of the aforementioned stance\nnetwork with nposts and c=(c1, . . . , cn)denote the vector of post credibility scores. Assuming that supporting posts\nhave similar credibility scores, the cost function in [Zhou et al. 2004a] can be used and the problem can be defined as\narg minc\u00b5||c\u2212c0||2+(1\u2212\u00b5)n\u00d5\ni,j=1Aij(ci\u221aDii\u2212cjpDjj)2, (7)\nwhere c0refers to true credibility scores of training posts, Dij=\u00cd\nkAik, and\u00b5\u2208[0,1]is a weight parameter.\n\u25b6Heterogeneous Network. Heterogeneous networks have multiple types of nodes or edges. An early instance is\na (users)-(tweets)-(news events) network using which Gupta et al. [Gupta et al .2012] evaluate news credibility by\ndesigning an algorithm similar to PageRank [Page et al .1999]. Their algorithm determines credibility relationships\namong these three entities with the assumption that users with low credibility tend to post tweets that are often related\nto fake news. Another example is the network capturing relationships among news publishers, news articles, and news\nspreaders (users) shown in Fig. 13(a). Using this network, Shu et al. [Shu et al .2019c] classify news articles (as fake\nnews or true news) using a linear classifier, where\n(I) News article are represented using latent features, derived using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF):\nmin\r\rX\u2212DV\u22a4\r\r2\nFs.t.D,V\u22650, (8)\nwhere X\u2208Rm\u00d7t+ is the given article-word matrix for mnews articles. Xwill be factorized as D\u2208Rm\u00d7d+ (i.e.,\narticle-latent feature matrix) and some weight matrix V\u2208Rt\u00d7d+;\n(II)Assuming that the political bias for each publisher is known: left ( \u22121), least-biased ( 0), or right ( +1), let b\u2208\n{\u22121,0,1}ldenote the political biases for lpublishers. Assuming that the political biases of publishers can be\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 25\nrepresented by the latent features of their published articles, the publisher-article relationship is derived by\nmin\r\r\u00afPDq\u2212b\r\r2\n2, (9)\nwhere \u00afP\u2208Rl\u00d7mis the normalized publisher-article relation (adjacency) matrix, and q\u2208Rdis the weights; and\n(III)Assuming that non-credible (credible) users spread fake (true) news, a similar optimization formulation can be\nutilized to derive the relationship between spreaders (users) and new articles.\nFinally, Zhang et al. develop a framework for a heterogeneous network of users (news authors), news articles, and\nnews subjects to detect fake news (see Fig. 13(b)). They introduce Gated Diffusive Units (GDUs), a neural network\ncomponent that can jointly learn the representations of users, news articles, and news subjects [Zhang et al. 2018].\n\u25b6Hierarchical Network. In hierarchical networks, various types of nodes and edges form set-subset relationships (i.e.,\nahierarchy ). One example is the news-tweet-retweet-reply network (see Fig. 14(a)), an extension of the news cascade\ndefined in Definition 8 [Shu et al .2019b]. Hence, the same features listed for news cascades in Table 7 (e.g., cascade\ndepth and size) can be used to predict fake news using this hierarchical network within a traditional ML framework.\nAnother example of a hierarchical network is shown in Fig. 14(b), which includes relationships across (i.e., hierarchical\nrelationships ) and within (i.e., homogeneous relationships ) news events, sub-events, and posts. In such networks, news\nverification can be transformed into a graph optimization problem [Jin et al .2014], extending the optimization in Eq.

By involving\ndissemination information (i.e., social context) in fake news detection, propagation-based methods are more robust\nagainst writing style manipulation by malicious entities. However, propagation-based fake news detection is inefficient\nforfake news early detection (see Section 6 for more details) as it is difficult for propagation-based models to detect fake\nnews before it has been disseminated, or to perform well when limited news dissemination information is available.\nFurthermore, mining news propagation and news writing style allow one to assess news intention. As discussed, the\nintuition is that (1) news created with a malicious intent, that is, to mislead and deceive the public, aims to be \u201cmore\npersuasive\u201d compared to those not having such aims, and (2) malicious users often play a part in the propagation of\nfake news to enhance its social influence [Leibenstein 1950]. However, to evaluate if news intentions are properly\nassessed one relies on the ground truth (news labels) in training datasets often annotated by domain experts. This\nground truth dependency particularly exists when predicting fake news by (semi-) supervised learning within graph\noptimization [Shu et al .2019c], traditional statistical learning [Zhou and Zafarani 2019], or deep neural networks [Zhang\net al.2018]. Most current fake news datasets have not provided a clear-cut declaration on whether the annotations\nwithin the datasets consider news intention, or how the annotators have manually evaluated it, which motivates the\nconstruction of fake news datasets or repositories that provide information on news intention.\nFinally, research has shown that political fake news spreads faster, farther, more widely, and is more popular with a higher\nstructure virality score than fake news in other domains such as business, terrorism, science, and entertainment [Vosoughi\net al.2018]. Discovering more dissemination patterns of fake news are hence highly encouraged by comparing it with\ntrue news, or fake news from different domains and languages. Such patterns can deepen the public understanding of\nfake news and enhance explainability of fake news detection (we discuss explainable fake news detection in Section 6).\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n26 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\n5 SOURCE-BASED FAKE NEWS DETECTION\nOne can detect fake news by assessing the credibility of its source, where credibility is often defined in the sense\nof quality and believability \u2013 \u201coffering reasonable grounds for being believed\u201d [Castillo et al .2011; Viviani and Pasi\n2017]. As presented in Fig. 1, there are three stages within a [fake] news life cycle: being created, published online,\nand propagating on social media. This section will present how credibility of news stories can be assessed based on\nthat of their sources at each stage. In other words, we deem \u201csources\u201d as a general concept that includes (I) the sources\ncreating the news stories, i.e., the news writers (Section 5.1), (II) the sources that publish the news stories, i.e., the news\npublishers (Section 5.1), as well as (III) the sources that spread the news stories on social media, i.e., the social media\naccounts (users, Section 5.2). We combine (I) and (II) into one subsection for two reasons: (i) not many studies have\ninvestigated news authors and (ii) news authors and publishers often form an employee-employer relationship; hence,\ntheir credibilities intuitively should have some correlations. Note that though the role of news authors, publishers, and\nspreading users in detecting fake news has been illustrated in Sections 2 to 4 (see related work such as [Shu et al .2019c;\nZhang et al .2018; Zhou and Zafarani 2019]), the focus has been on each news story. In contrast, in this section, the\nfocus is on each author, publisher, and user who might have written, published, or spread the news stories. That is why\nwe, to some extent, regard assessing the credibility of news sources as an indirect way to detect fake news, i.e., one can\nconsider news articles from unreliable news sources as fake news though it is not unlikely for these sources to post\ntrue news. Such an approach to detecting fake news might seem arbitrary but is efficient [N\u00f8rregaard et al .2019], as\nevidence has revealed that many fake news stories come from either fake news websites that only publish hoaxes, or\nfrom hyper-partisan websites that present themselves as publishing real news [Silverman 2016].\n5.1 Assessing Source Credibility based on News Authors and Publishers\nBased on existing related studies, we organize this subsection as follows. We first present (I) some patterns shared among\n(un)reliable authors or publishers. These patterns can help assess the credibility of unknown authors or publishers\nby exploring their relationships with other authors or publishers. Next, we review (II) Web spam detection as a\nrepresentation of the way to detect unreliable websites. Such methods can be used to identify spam publishers. Finally,\nwe introduce (III) resources that can help obtain the credibility (or political bias) of news publishers (ground truth).\nI. Patterns of (Un)reliable Authors or Publishers. Research has shown that news authors and publishers exhibit\nhomogeneity in the networks that they form. Specifically, Sitaula et al. [Sitaula et al .2020] construct the collaboration\nnetwork of news authors (i.e., coauthorship network ) based on FakeNewsNet dataset [Shu et al .2018]. The network is\npresented in Fig. 16. In this network, each node represents a news author, and the edge between two authors indicates\nthat they collaborate in writing one (the dashed line) or more (the solid line) news articles. All nodes (authors) are\ngrouped as (i) true-news authors (green nodes) who are associated with two or more true news stories; (ii) fake-news\nauthors (red nodes), who are associated with two or more fake news stories; and (iii) the authors who have published\nboth fake and true news stories (yellow nodes). As we can observe from Fig. 16, the coauthorship network exhibits\nhomogeneity: the authors within the same group are more densely connected compared to the authors from different\ngroups. Similarly, such homogeneity has been observed in the network formed by news publishers (i.e., content sharing\nnetwork ). See Fig. 17 for an illustration [Horne et al .2019]. In this directed network, each node represents a news\npublisher, and the edge between two publishers indicates the flow of news articles. Nodes (publishers) can be clearly\ngrouped into five communities: (1) Russian/conspiracy community (orange nodes); (2) right-wing/conspiracy community\n(yellow nodes); (3) U.S. mainstream community (green nodes); (4) left-wing blog community (magenta nodes); and\n(5) U.K. mainstream community (cyan nodes), representing various nations and importantly, various political biases.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 27\nFig. 16. Coauthorship Network (directly from\n[Sitaula et al .2020], data is from FakeNews-\nNet [Shu et al .2018]): Red nodes represent au-\nthors only associated with [two or more] fake\nnews articles; Green nodes represent authors only\nassociated with [two or more] true news articles;\nyellow nodes represent authors writing both fake\nand true news; dashed lines indicate that two\nauthors collaborate only once; and solid lines in-\ndicate that two authors collaborate at least twice.\nFig. 17. Content Sharing Network (directly from [Horne et al .2019]):\nNodes are news publishers and edges are the flows of news articles\namong publishers. Orange: Russian/conspiracy community; Yellow: Right-\nwing/conspiracy community; Green: U.S. mainstream community; Ma-\ngenta: Left-wing blog community; and Cyan: U.K. mainstream community.\nII. Web (Publisher) Spam Detection. News publishers often publish their news articles on their own websites. Detecting\nunreliable publishers thus can be reduced to detecting low-credible websites. To assess website credibility, many\npractical techniques have been developed such as Web ranking algorithms. Traditional Web ranking algorithms such as\nPageRank [Page et al. 1998] and HITS [Kleinberg 1999] assess website credibility to improve search engine responses\nto user search queries. However, the weaknesses of these Web ranking algorithms provide opportunities for Web\nspam , to try to unjustifiably improve website rankings; thus, motivating the development of Web spam detection . A\ncomprehensive survey is available in [Spirin and Han 2012]. Web spam can be categorized as (i) content spam , which\nleads to a spam webpage appearing among normal search results primarily due to fake word frequencies (e.g., TF-IDF\nscores). Content spam includes spamming of title, body, meta-tags, anchors, and URLs; (ii) [outgoing and incoming] link\nspam , where the former mostly targets algorithms similar to HITS to achieve high hub scores, and the latter enhances\nwebsite authority scores by attacking algorithms similar to PageRank; and (iii) other types of spam such as cloaking ,\nredirection , and click spams . Algorithms to identify Web spam thus can be classified into (i) content-based algorithms,\nwhich analyze Web content features, such as word counts and content duplication [Baly et al .2018; Fetterly et al .2005;\nNtoulas et al .2006]; (ii) link-based algorithms, which detect Web spam by utilizing graph information [Horne et al .\n2019; Zhou and Pei 2009], learning statistical anomalies [Dong et al .2015], and performing techniques such as (dis)trust\npropagation [Gy\u00f6ngyi et al .2004], link pruning [Bharat and Henzinger 1998] and graph regularization [Abernethy et al .\n2010]; and (iii) other algorithms that are often based on click streams [Dou et al .2008] or user behavior [Liu et al .2015].\nIII. Resources for Understanding News Publishers. We introduce several resources that can help obtain the ground truth\non the credibility (or political bias) of news publishers. One resource is the Media Bias/Fact Check website,19which\nprovides a list of media along with their political slant: left, left-center, least biased, right-center, and right. Another\nsource is NewsGuard,18which relies on expert-based evaluations and rates the reliability of a news source in terms of\nnine criteria: if it repeatedly publishes false content, responsibly presents information, regularly corrects or clarifies\nerrors, responsibly handles the difference between news and opinion, avoids deceptive headlines, discloses ownership\n19https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n28 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nand financing, clearly labels advertising, reveals who\u2019s in charge that includes any possible conflicts of interest, and\nprovides information about content creators. Finally, a system named MediaRank ranks news sources associated with\ntheir peer reputation, reporting bias, bottomline financial pressure, and popularity [Ye and Skiena 2019].\n5.2 Assessing Source Credibility based on Social Media Users\nSocial media users can be the initiating source for a news story spreading on social media. Intuitively, users with low\ncredibility are more likely to become the spreading source of a fake news story than reliable users. Here we define and\ngroup such low-credible users as (I) malicious users and (II) normal users that are vulnerable to spreading fake news (or\nany disinformation).\nI. Identifying Malicious Users. Identifying malicious users can often be reduced to detecting social bots , a software\napplication that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. Note that social bots can be benign and designed to\nprovide useful services, e.g., automatically aggregating content from different sources, like simple news feeds.\nMeanwhile, some bots are created to harm by manipulating social media discourse and deceiving social media users,\nfor example, by spreading fake news [Ferrara et al .2016]. One recent study \u2013 that classifies accounts based on observable\nfeatures such as sharing behavior, number of social ties, and linguistic features \u2013 estimates that between 9 to 15 percent\nof active Twitter accounts are bots [Varol et al .2017]. It has been suggested that millions of social bots have participated\nin online discussions around the 2016 U.S. presidential election,20and some of the same bots were later used to attempt\nto influence the 2017 French election [Ferrara 2017]. Research has significantly contributed to differentiating bots from\nhumans on social media. For example, a feature-based system, Botometer (formally BotOrNot),21extracts six main\ngroups of features ( network ,user,friend ,temporal ,content ,sentiment ) of a Twitter account and uses random forests to\npredict whether it is a bot or not with a 0.95 AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) performance. Similarly, Cai et al. propose\na bot detection model that uses deep learning to learn features from both user posts and behavior [Cai et al .2017].\nMorstatter et al. work on striking the balance between precision and recall value in predicting social bots [Morstatter\net al.2016]. From 14 million messages spreading 400 thousand articles on Twitter during a ten-month period in 2016\nand 2017, Shao et al. find evidence that bots spread unreliable news at an earlier time compared to humans to increase\nthe chances that an article goes \u201cviral.\u201d (see Fig. 18) [Shao et al .2018]. They also discover that humans do most of the\nretweeting, and they retweet articles posted by [likely] bots almost as much as those by other humans (see Fig. 19).\nSuch discoveries demonstrate the difficulty in recognizing social bots and the vulnerability of humans (or normal users)\nto online information with low credibility. Next, we will discuss the possible ways to identify this group of vulnerable\nnormal users, which, thus far, has been rarely investigated.\nII. Identifying Vulnerable Normal Users. Fake news, unlike information such as fake reviews [Jindal and Liu 2008], can\n\u201cattract\u201d both malicious and normal users, where each group is attracted for different reasons (i.e., different intentions).\nMalicious users such as some social bots [Ferrara et al .2016]) often spread fake news intentionally. In contrast, some\nnormal users can frequently and unintentionally do so without recognizing the falsehood. Compared to normal users\nthat are \u201cimmune\" to fake news, these normal users are \u201csusceptible\" and vulnerable to fake news, i.e., their credibility is\nrelatively lower compared to other normal users. Theories in Table 2 imply that a user engages in spreading fake news\nless intentionally when spreading bears a greater (i) social influence , e.g., more users spreading the news [Ashforth and\nMael 1989; Boehm 1994; Deutsch and Gerard 1955; Kuran and Sunstein 1999; Leibenstein 1950; MacLeod et al .1986]\n20http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/public-scholarship/resource-for-understanding-political-bots/\n21https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 29\nFig. 18. Temporal Engagements of Social Bots (directly\nfrom [Shao et al .2018]), which indicates that bots\nspread unreliable news at an earlier time compared\nto humans.\nFig. 19. Impacts of Bots on Humans (directly from [Shao et al .2018]). ( a):\nJoint distribution of bot scores for tweeters and retweeters of unreliable\nnews; ( b): Distribution of bot scores for retweeters, who are mostly hu-\nmans; and ( c): Distribution of bot scores for tweeters, where bots and\nhumans both share a significant proportion.\nand (ii) self-influence , e.g., high similarity between the knowledge within the fake news and the preexisting knowledge\nof the user [Fisher 1993; Freedman and Sears 1965; Nickerson 1998]. Preexisting knowledge can be captured by user\nposts. Nevertheless, few studies have quantified the impact of social and self-influence on the vulnerability of users to\nfake news, or have considered the effect of intention in assessing user credibility and further in fake news intervention\n(see Section 6 for more discussions on fake news intervention ).\n6 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nWhile we have detailed four fake news detection strategies ( knowledge -based, style-based, propagation -based and source -\nbased) separately in Sections 2-5, they are not independent. Predicting fake news jointly from multiple perspectives is\nencouraged, where one can combine their strengths. Furthermore, there is a motivation to detail open issues shared\namong different strategies. Based on fake news characteristics and current state of fake news research, we highlight\nthe following potential research tasks that can facilitate a deeper understanding of fake news, and improve the\ninterpretability and performance of current fake news detection studies.\nI. Detection of Non-traditional Fake News. Based on how fake news was defined, fake news can also be news articles\nwith (1) outdated knowledge, e.g., \u201cBritain has control over fifty-six colonial countries\u201d or (2) false claims in some parts\nof the news content (text and images), i.e., news content is partially (in)correct. These non-traditional forms of fake\nnews emphasize different aspects of detection and motivate one to develop more thorough and comprehensive detection\nstrategies. For example, to detect fake news with outdated knowledge, one is encouraged to construct a dynamic\nknowledge graph; To detect fake news that is only partially correct, extending fake news detection to a multi-label\nclassification or regression problem may be more appropriate than defining it as a binary classification problem.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n30 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nII. Fake News Early Detection. Fake news early detection aims to detect fake news at an early stage before it becomes\nwide-spread, so that one can take early actions for fake news mitigation and intervention. Early detection is especially\ncrucial for fake news as the more fake news spreads, the more likely for people to trust it (i.e., validity effect [Boehm\n1994]). To detect fake news at an early stage, one has to primarily and efficiently rely on news content and limited\nsocial context information, which leads to facing multiple challenges. First, newly emerged events often generate new\nand unexpected knowledge that has not been stored in existing knowledge graphs, or is difficult to be inferred. Second,\nfeatures that have well-represented the style of fake news in one domain or in the past, may not be as useful in the\nother domains or in the future, especially due to the different patterns of fake news in different domains, and the\nconstant evolution of deceptive writing style [Castelo et al .2019]. Finally, limited information may adversely impact the\nperformance of machine learning methods. To address these challenges and detect fake news early, one can focus on\n(1)timeliness of ground truth , for example, technologies related to dynamic (real-time) Knowledge Graph (KG) con-\nstruction should be developed to facilitate timely updates of the ground truth;\n(2)feature compatibility [Wang et al .2018], specifically, features that can capture the commonalities of deceptive\nwriting style across topics, domains, languages, and the like, as well as the evolution of deceptive writing style; and\n(3)verification efficiency [Liu and Wu 2018; Zhou et al .2019a], for example, by improving the efficiency of fake news\ndetection by effectively using a small amount of information in a news article (e.g., headlines), or by identifying\ncheck-worthy content and topics, which we will discuss next.\nIII. Identifying Check-worthy Content. With new information created and circulated online at an unprecedented rate,\nidentifying check-worthy content or topics can improve the efficiency of fake news detection and intervention by\nprioritizing content or topics that are check-worthy [Hassan et al .2017a]. Whether a given news content or topic is\ncheck-worthy can be measured by, e.g., (i) its newsworthiness or potential to influence the society, or (ii) its historical\nlikelihood of being fake news. Thus a content or topic that is newsworthy and generally favored by fake news creators\nis more check-worthy. Newsworthiness can be assessed in many ways, e.g., by verifying if the title of the news article is\na clickbait [Zhou et al .2019a], if its content will trigger widespread discussions on social media [Vosoughi et al .2018],\nor if its topic relates to national affairs and matches with public concerns [Hassan et al .2017a]. As shown in Fig. 2(a),\nthe historical likelihood of a topic being fake news is available in some online resources, e.g., \u201cthe PolitiFact scorecard\u201d5\ngives statistics on the authenticity distribution of all the statements on a specific topic [Zhang et al. 2018].\nFurthermore, identifying check-worthy portions within a news content (e.g., sentences) is a pathway to explainable\nfake news detection , which we will also discuss as a potential research task in this section. A news portion that\ncontributes more to detecting fake news is more check-worthy; thus, an attention mechanism becomes a natural choice\nfor identifying (i.e., weighting) such portions in a Recurrent Neural Network -based fake news detection model [Shu\net al.2019a]. Expert-based analyses and justifications provided for each verified news article on fact-checking websites\n(detailed in Section 2.1) can be potentially combined with such identified portions to provide explanations; however, to\ndate, such research directions have not been well explored.\nIV. Cross-domain (-topic, -website, -language) Fake News Analysis. We highlight this potential research task for two\nreasons. First, current fake news studies emphasize on distinguishing fake news from truth with experimental settings\nthat are generally limited to a particular social network and a specific language. Second, analyzing fake news across\ndomains, topics, websites, and languages allows one to gain a deeper understanding of fake news and identify its\nunique non-varying characteristics, which can further assist in fake news early detection and in the identification of\ncheck-worthy content, both of which we have discussed in this section.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nA Survey of Fake News:\nFundamental Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities 31\nV. Explainable Fake News Detection. Facilitating interpretability has been of great interest in artificial intelligence [Vilone\nand Longo 2020] and machine learning [Du et al .2018] research. For fake news detection models, interpretability can\nbe provided by mining social feedback, e.g., the stance taken within (re-)posts and comments [Shu et al .2019a], and\nmining expert analyses available on fact-checking websites, while both have been rarely utilized. Model interpretability\ncan also be provided and enhanced by conducting interdisciplinary research, e.g., by relying on fundamental theories\nidentified in Table 2 (see Section 1.2). While there have been studies that have conducted theory- or pattern-driven\nfeature engineering to detect fake news within a traditional machine learning framework [Zhou et al .2019a; Zhou and\nZafarani 2019], there has been limited research on using related theories or domain knowledge to guide the learning\nprocess in machine learning, e.g., in [deep] neural networks.\nVI. Fake News Intervention. Fake news studies have emphasized the importance of new business models adopted\nby social media sites to address fake news intervention, which suggests shifting the emphasis from maximizing user\nengagement to that on increasing information quality, e.g., by using self- or government regulations [Lazer et al .2018].\nIn addition to introducing new policies and regulations, efficiently blocking and mitigating the spread of fake news\nalso demands technical innovations and developments. Technically, a fake news intervention strategy can be based\non network structure, or based on users as we have discussed in Section 1.2. When intervening based on network\nstructure, one aims to stop fake news from spreading by blocking its propagation paths, relying on analyzing the\nnetwork structure of its propagation and predicting how fake news is going to further spread. From a user perspective,\nfake news intervention relies on specific roles users play in fake news dissemination. One such role is being an (i)\ninfluential user (i.e., opinion leader ). When blocking certain fake news in a social network, targeting these influential\nspreaders leads to a more efficient intervention compared to those with a negligible social influence on others. Another\nbeneficial role is being a (ii) corrector , users on social networks who take an active role in mitigating the spread of fake\nnews by attaching links to their posts or comments that debunk the fake news [Vo and Lee 2018]. Furthermore, the\nintervention strategy for (iii) malicious users and (iv) normal users should be different, while they can both spread fake\nnews; malicious users should be penalized, while normal users should be assisted to improve their ability to distinguish\nfake news. For example, personal recommendation of true news articles and/or articles with refuting evidence can be\nhelpful to normal users. These recommendation should not only cater to the topics that the users want to read but also\nthose topics that they are most gullible to due to their political biases or preexisting knowledge.\n7 CONCLUSION\nThis survey extensively reviews and evaluates current fake news research by (1) defining fake news, differentiating it\nfrom deceptive news, false news, satire news, misinformation, disinformation, clickbaits, cheery-picking, and rumors\nbased on three characteristics: authenticity, intention, and being news; (II) detailing interdisciplinary fake news research\nby firstly and comprehensively identifying related fundamental theories in, e.g., social sciences; (III) reviewing the\nmethods that detect fake news from four perspectives: the false knowledge fake news communicates, its writing style ,\nitspropagation patterns, and the credibility of its source ; and (IV) highlighting challenges in current research and some\nresearch opportunities that go with these challenges. As fake news research is evolving, we accompany this survey\nwith an online repository http://fake-news.site, which will provide summaries and timely updates on the research\ndevelopments on fake news, including tutorials, recent publications and methods, datasets, and other related resources.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n32 Xinyi Zhou and Reza Zafarani\nREFERENCES\nJacob Abernethy, Olivier Chapelle, and Carlos Castillo. 2010.

To address this, we have col-\nlected RTCas-COVID-19 , a large corpus of 35M COVID-\n19 tweets from 2020, and weak-labeled 2M with a semi-\nsupervised approach. We have also developed an inductive\nframework, RTCS-HGT (Retweet Cascade Subgraph Sam-\npling Heterogeneous Graph Transformer), which achieves\n0.918 test accuracy on tweet trustworthiness classification on\nour dataset and improves training time by 93%.1\n1 Introduction\nThe spread of misinformation has become a major issue in\nmodern society, aided by the increasing popularity of so-\ncial media (Pazzanese 2020). Misinformation online has de-\ngraded trust in many mainstream media outlets and influ-\nenced the way governments, political parties and public in-\ndividuals are perceived (Ognyanova et al. 2020), leading to\nincreased suspicion and division in society. Recently, mis-\ninformation has played a large role in the persistence of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, as much false information about it has\nbeen spread: how serious it is, what cures are effective, how\ndangerous vaccination is and how to avoid infection. As a\nresult, the public\u2019s ability to respond to COVID-19 is se-\nriously affected (Barua et al. 2020). This brings to light the\nmany challenges in distinguishing between true and false in-\nformation, and the negative consequences of failing to do so.\nWhile automated fact-checkers and misinformation identifi-\ncation systems are widely used on social media platforms\n(Facebook 2020), they do not always achieve their purpose.\nThus it is important to continue to develop more robust sys-\ntems to identify misinformation.\nTo improve the effectiveness of fact-checking models,\none possible strategy is to employ a robust initial screen-\ning process that can identify low-credibilty information and\ndetermine whether it requires additional fact-checking. To\naddress this challenge, we have constructed a novel cor-\nCopyright \u00a9 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\n1Our corpus and source code are available in the Github repos-\nitory https://github.com/lynneeai/RTCS-HGT.git.pus of 35M COVID-19 tweets, namely RTCas-COVID-\n19(Retweet Cascade COVID-19 ), including source tweets\n(original tweets that initiate retweet cascades) and retweet\ncascades, with 2M source tweets weak-labeled as trustwor-\nthy or untrustworthy and a small subset of human-annotated\nsource tweets. Using these corpora, we propose an inductive\nframework, RTCS-HGT (Retweet Cascade Subgraph Sam-\npling Heterogeneous Graph Transformer), that effectively\ncaptures social context and tweet propagation patterns, and\nimproves the performance of tweet trustworthiness classifi-\ncation. The contributions of this paper are twofold:\n\u2022 We have constructed RTCas-COVID-19, a large Twit-\nter corpus of COVID-19 tweets and their corresponding\nretweet cascades. The corpus is weak-labeled for untrust-\nworthy information detection, and provides richer and\nhigher quality social context information compared to\nother currently existing rumor detection corpora.\n\u2022 We propose RTCS-HGT, an inductive tweet trustworthi-\nness classification framework that utilizes textual infor-\nmation, tweet propagation patterns, and social context in-\nformation. The model outperforms all the baseline mod-\nels on our corpus, and is more scalable to larger real-\nworld data.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Fake News Detection on Social Media\nAs Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu (2019) note, the spread of mis-\ninformation has declined sharply on Facebook but has con-\ntinued to rise on Twitter since 2016; thus, much recent work\non social media misinformation detection focuses on Twit-\nter. While early work on fake news detection relied primarily\non linguistic features (P \u00b4erez-Rosas et al. 2018; Rashkin et al.\n2017; Ajao, Bhowmik, and Zargari 2018), information prop-\nagation patterns provide richer contexts for detecting mis-\ninformation, as fake news propagates differently from true\nnews (V osoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018; Kwon, Cha, and Jung\n2017). Propagation-based approaches (Ma et al. 2016; Ma,\nGao, and Wong 2017; Yu et al. 2017; Ma, Gao, and Wong\n2018) make use of tree-structured propagation patterns of\nmicroblog posts and learn contextual representations using\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) models.\nSince users on social media tend to follow like-minded\npeople (Shu, Bernard, and Liu 2019), false information such\nas conspiracy theory generates homogeneous and polarized\ncommunities having similar information consumption pat-\nterns (Del Vicario et al. 2016), resulting in an echo chamber\neffect. Therefore, many studies (Ruchansky, Seo, and Liu\n2017; Monti et al. 2019) add social context components to\nthe process, using user profiles in addition to textual features\nand information propagation patterns. Shu, Wang, and Liu\n(2019) make use of tri-relationships among users, news, and\nnews publishers to detect fake information, creating multiple\ncomponents which are however less flexible and scalable in\nadapting to new datasets or adding new features and entities.\nMost graph neural networks (GNNs) models, such as\nGCN (Kipf and Welling 2016), GAT (Veli \u02c7ckovi \u00b4c et al. 2017)\nand GraphSage (Hamilton, Ying, and Leskovec 2017), are\nnatively designed only for homogeneous graphs. The Het-\nerogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) (Hu et al. 2020) is\nproposed to tackle this problem, with node-type and edge-\ntype parameters built with an attention mechanism applied\nover each edge type during target-specific message aggrega-\ntion. Recently, a heterogeneous graph to represent user and\ncontents has been utilized in fake contents detection (Huang\net al. (2020), Agarwal et al. (2022), He et al. (2022), Min\net al. (2022)). However, Huang et al. (2020) and He et al.\n(2022) fail to capture users\u2019 interaction in their models. Min\net al. (2022) and Agarwal et al. (2022) do not utilize sam-\npling methods and thus are potentially slow in training time\nwith millions of nodes and edges in their proposed data.\n2.2 COVID-19 False Information\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak, a large amount of false in-\nformation has been spread over social media platforms. The\nWorld Health Organization has also labeled the spread of\nfake news on COVID-19 as an \u201cinfodemic\u201d (Thomas 2020).\nTo address this challenge, many studies have attempted to\nidentify false information on COVID-19 in social media.\nChen, Lerman, and Ferrara (2020) and Banda et al. (2020)\nhave collected large-scale COVID-19 Twitter datasets that\nare publicly available. Sharma et al. (2020) maintain a dash-\nboard tracking unreliable information on Twitter between\nMarch and May 2020. Shaar et al. (2020) and Cheema,\nHakimov, and Ewerth (2020) detect COVID-19 tweets worth\nfact-checking using linguistic features and language models.\nZhao et al. (2022) analyze the user profile and method uti-\nlized to spread COVID-19 related misinformation in social\nmedia. While most existing studies on COVID-19 misinfor-\nmation only conduct separate analyses on either linguistic or\nsocial context characteristics, we address this challenge by\nincorporating both, along with tweet propagation patterns.\n3 Data Collection\n3.1 RTCas-COVID-19 Corpus\nWe have collected and cleaned a new COVID-19 corpus\nbased on 2 publicly available datasets (Chen, Lerman, and\nFerrara 2020; Banda et al. 2020), namely RTCas-COVID-\n19. So far, we have retrieved 480M tweets from January toDecember 2020. To filter out less informative tweets, we se-\nlect a set of source tweets, defined as original tweets posted\nby users, in contrast to retweets, quote tweets, and replies,\nfrom the full corpus using keyword search. The keywords\nare extracted from the debunked COVID-19 rumor state-\nments provided by CMU IDeaS2. This process selects source\ntweets on specific topics that potentially contain balanced\nportions of rumor tweets and debunking tweets. In addition,\nwe keep only the source tweets that have embedded URLs\nand are in English only. For each source tweet, its associ-\nated retweet cascade is also collected. The cleaned corpus\nincludes 35M tweets (10M source tweets, 25M retweets).\nGiven the expense and time-consuming nature of human\nannotation, particularly for a new and time-sensitive topic\nlike the COVID-19 pandemic, we employ a semi-supervised\nweak-labeling approach to label each tweet as \u201dtrustwor-\nthy\u201d (i.e. \u201dreliable\u201d) or \u201duntrustworthy\u201d (i.e. \u201dunreliable\u201d)\nusing the source credibility of the URLs shared in the tweet.\nTo elaborate further, we categorize tweets that have a low\ncredibility and necessitate further fact-checking. Therefore,\nthe process of \u201dtrustworthiness classification\u201d serves as a\nprecursor for identifying the veracity of the information\ntweeted. We collect a set of trustworthy sources from Me-\ndia Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)3. We also add the list of main-\nstream news media (Wikipedia contributors 2021b) to our\ntrustworthy sources set. In total, we identify 1357 trust-\nworthy sources. Similarly, we collect a set of untrustwor-\nthy sources from MBFC, NewsGuard4, and the Zimdars\u2019 list\nof fake and misleading news websites (Zimdars 2016). We\nalso add the list of satirical news websites (Wikipedia con-\ntributors 2021a) to our untrustworthy sources set to include\ntweets that are intended to be amusing but whose content is\nnot intended to be believed as true. In total, we identify 1518\nuntrustworthy sources. A source tweet will be automatically\nlabeled as trustworthy or untrustworthy if it shares a URL\nfrom our trustworthy or untrustworthy sources sets. Over-\nall, 2M tweets are weak-labeled (1.64M trustworthy tweets,\n360K untrustworthy tweets).\n3.2 Human Annotation\nTo verify the effectiveness of our weak-labeling approach,\nwe (lab members) have manually annotated 380 tweets,\nsampled randomly from our full corpus, where each is an-\nnotated by three annotators. Both Cohen\u2019s kappa and Fleiss\u2019\nkappa inter-annotator agreement scores on these annotated\ntweets are 0.810. Evaluated with the human-annotated set,\nour weak-labeling approach achieves an accuracy of 0.71,\nwith an F1 score of 0.64 for the trustworthy class and 0.76\nfor the untrustworthy class. Table 1 shows the overall statis-\ntics of our corpus.\n4 Model Design\n4.1 Tweet-User Heterogeneous Graph\nSince users tend to interact more with like-minded people,\nfalse information is more likely to be spread and more eas-\n2https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/\n3https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\n4https://www.newsguardtech.com/\nFigure 1: Tweet-user heterogeneous graph: Red user nodes are users who often tweet or retweet untrustworthy tweets; green\nuser nodes are users who often tweet or retweet trustworthy tweets; yellow nodes are users with mixed behavior. The bottom\nright section shows a 2-hop retweet cascade subgraph sampling.\nTotal Source Retweets\nFull Corpus 35M 10M 25M\nTotal Trust Untrust\nWeak-Labeled 2M 1.64M 360K\nHuman-Annotated 380 215 165\nTable 1: RTCas-COVID-19 Statistics\nily diffused within certain communities (Del Vicario et al.\n2016; Shu, Bernard, and Liu 2019); thus social context may\nbe very useful for false information detection. For exam-\nple, on Twitter, retweeting can be understood as a form\nof information diffusion, by which users amplify tweets to\nnew audiences and publicly agree or validate these tweets\n(Boyd, Golder, and Lotan 2010). Therefore, we represent\nsocial context as a tweet-user heterogeneous graph, where\nthe nodes are connected by \u201dtweeting\u201d and \u201dretweeting\u201d\ninteractions, as illustrated in Figure 1. This heterogeneous\ngraph captures tweet propagation patterns and user relation-\nships. The two node types in this graph are Tweet nodes and\nUser nodes, and the types of edges are summarized in Ta-\nble 2. The Tweet nodes are embedded using the BERTweet\n(Nguyen, Vu, and Tuan Nguyen 2020) model. With these\nnodes, we are able to take linguistic features into account in\naddition to social context features. For the User nodes, we\nextract Twitter profile features using the Twitter Developer\nAPI5. In addition, Ferrara (2020) suggest that high bot score\naccounts are used to promote political conspiracies along-\nside with COVID-19 content. Thus we also extract users\u2019 bot\nscore features using a Botometer API (Sayyadiharikandeh\net al. 2020). The user nodes are therefore embedded using\nthe concatenation of Twitter profile features and bot score\nfeatures.\n4.2 RTCS-HGT Framework\nHeterogeneous Graph Transformer We utilize an induc-\ntive HGT for node representation learning. Our model also\noptimizes 2 loss types simultaneously during training:\n5https://developer.twitter.com/enEdge Type Weight\nuser-tweeted-tweet undirected1\n1+T= 1\nuser-retweeted-tweet undirected1\n1+T\nuser-retweeted-user directed retweet count\nTable 2: Tweet-User Heterogenoues Graph Edges: T, time\ndifference in minutes between tweet\u2019s posting and user\u2019s\nretweeting; for the tweeters, T= 0.\n\u2022Supervised Tweet Classification Loss: The negative log\nlikelihood classification loss. Our tweet trustworthiness\nclassifier stacks 2 layers of HGT and concatenates the\noutput tweet nodes\u2019 representations with a feed forward\nlayer and a log softmax output layer to perform classifi-\ncation.\n\u2022Unsupervised User Proximity Loss: Based on the hy-\npothesis that users who interact with each other fre-\nquently often share similar behaviors or characteristics,\nwe want to encourage closely-connected user nodes to\nlearn similar representations, while enforcing distanced\nones to learn distinct representations, specifically:\nproxloss =E[\u2212Elog\u03c3(z\u22a4\nuzvp)\n\u2212Q\u00b7Elog\u03c3(\u2212z\u22a4\nuzvn)](1)\nfor all users u\u2208G,vp\u2208Pu, and vn\u2208Nu.Pudenotes\na set of randomly sampled neighboring nodes of node u,\nNudenotes a set of randomly sampled non-neighboring\nnodes of node u, and zvdenotes the representation of a\nnodev.\nRetweet Cascade Subgraph Sampling To make the\nmodel scalable to large graphs and to reduce training time,\nwe propose a tweet-centered subgraph sampling approach,\nvisualized in Figure 1. For each tweet, we perform a 2-hop\nneighbor sampling, where the first hop samples the tweeter\nand the retweet user cascade of the tweet, and the second\nhop samples entities that are closely related to the tweet,\nincluding users in the same communities and some other\ntweets spread within these communities. With this sampling\napproach, the concise sampled subgraph captures the diffu-\nsion patterns and enough social context features with respect\nto the tweets. This approach optimizes the training process\nand provides rich information for newly-seen tweets during\ninference time.\n5 Experiments\n5.1 Dataset\nWe train and test the RTCS-HGT model on our weak-\nlabeled subset of the RTCas-COVID-19 corpus. To build a\ntweet-user heterogeneous graph with significant density, we\nchoose equal sets of trustworthy and untrustworthy tweets\nthat have been retweeted at least 100 times and sample the\ntop 1% users by their number of interactions (either tweet\nor retweet) with the selected tweets. Table 3 summaries the\ndata statistics.\nNodes Edges\n# Source Tweets 5,714 # u-tweeted-t 5,714\n# Users 39,822 # u-rt-t 562,284\n# Trust 2,857 # u-rt-u 482,544\n# Untrust 2,857\nTable 3: RTCS-HGT Data Statistics\n5.2 Experimental Settings and Results\nWe compare our model with the following text classification\nbaseline models:\n\u2022RCNN (Lai et al. 2015): A model with a recurrent struc-\nture that captures the contextual information and a max-\npooling layer that captures the influential word in the\ngiven class of labels. We encode the tweets using a\nBERTweet model as inputs to the RCNN model and con-\ncatenate the last layer hidden states output of RCNN with\na feed forward layer and a log softmax output layer.\n\u2022BERTweet (Nguyen, Vu, and Tuan Nguyen 2020):\nA pre-trained BERT base (Devlin et al. 2019) lan-\nguage model for English tweets, which outperforms a\nRoBERTa base(Liu et al. 2019) model on text classifica-\ntion. We concatenate the last layer hidden states output of\nBERTweet with a feed forward layer and a log softmax\noutput layer.\n\u2022CT-BERT (M\u00a8uller, Salath \u00b4e, and Kummervold 2020): A\npre-trained BERT LARGE model trained on 160M COVID-\n19 tweets. We concatenate the last layer hidden states\noutput of CT-BERT with a feed forward layer and a log\nsoftmax output layer.\n\u2022HGATRD (Huang et al. 2020): A heterogeneous graph\nattention network framework that captures global seman-\ntic relations of text content and source tweet propagation\npatterns.\n\u2022HGT (Hu et al. 2020): This model is equivalent to our\nframework without retweet cascade subgraph sampling.\nOur model has 55142 trainable parameters. Hyperparam-\neters are tuned with a held-out validation set for all mod-\nels, with a train-validation-test split ratio of 7/1/2. For afair comparison, 5-fold cross validation is utilized, and all\nnumbers reported in Table 4 are the average results of the\n5-fold test sets. As shown in Table 4, our RTCS-HGT model\noutperforms all baseline models on our weak-labeled subset\nof RTCas-COVID-19 corpus. Specifically, the RTCS-HGT\nmodel trained without user proximity loss achieves an aver-\nage test accuracy of 0.918.\nThe CT-BERT model also achieves comparable perfor-\nmance, but since this model is specifically pre-trained on\nCOVID-19 tweets, it cannot be easily applied to data on\nother topics without re-training on a large amount of data.\nHGATRD is also a strong baseline. However, it is transduc-\ntive, which means it cannot make inference on unseen data,\nnor is it scalable to other larger datasets. In addition, HGT\nshows close performance to our model but requires signifi-\ncantly longer runtime compared to our model. We illustrate\nthis gap in Section 5.3.\nModel Test Acc.Macro Trust Untrust\nF1 F1 F1\nRCNN-LSTM 0.844 0.844 0.846 0.842\nRCNN-GRU 0.844 0.843 0.848 0.839\nBERTweet 0.847 0.847 0.850 0.843\nCT-BERT 0.893 0.893 0.894 0.893\nHGATRD 0.894 0.894 0.894 0.895\nHGT 0.908 0.908 0.910 0.906\nRTCS-HGT 0.913 0.913 0.913 0.912\nRTCS-HGT0.918 0.918 0.918 0.918(noproxloss )\nTable 4: RTCS-HGT vs. Baselines on Weak-Labeled\nRTCas-COVID-19 Test Sets\n5.3 Ablation Study\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of the tweet-centered retweet\ncascade subgraph sampling approach and the user proximity\nloss by comparing different model variants with a baseline\nHGT model. For all model variants, we report test accuracy,\nmacro-average F1, and epoch elapsed time. All model vari-\nants are trained for 30 epochs with 1 Nvidia Quadro RTX\n8000 GPU.\nRetweet Cascade Subgraph Sampling In order to study\nwhether the retweet cascade subgraph sampling approach\nimproves model performance and how the sampled subgraph\nsize makes a difference, we set a base sampler configura-\ntion and increase the sampling size by Ntimes. For each\nbatch of tweets, the base sampler samples the tweeter user\nand 10 retweet users in the first hop. In the second hop, each\nsampled user samples: (a)5 other unsampled users that this\nuser has retweeted, (b)5 other unsampled users that has\nretweeted this user, (c)5 tweets that this user has posted,\nand(d)12 tweets that this user has retweeted. These num-\nbers are the results of grid searches from 0 to the average\nnode degrees listed in Table 7. We then multiply these num-\nbers by a sampler multiplier Nranging from 2 to 5. This set\nof model variants is trained without user proximity loss.\nFrom Table 5, we see that, in general, adding retweet cas-\ncade subgraph sampling improves the model\u2019s performance.\nThe best performing model is trained with the base sampler,\nachieving 0.918 test accuracy, outperforming the HGT base-\nline model by 1%. Larger sampler multiplier Nincreases\ntraining time, and does not necessarily improve model accu-\nracy. On our dataset, the base sampler provides a very good\nbalance between time and accuracy.\nWe further increase the sampler multiplier independently\nfor hop 1 and hop 2 sampling. Table 5 shows that increasing\nthe hop 1 sampler multiplier boosts performance, meaning\nthat sampling more retweet users helps with the trustworthi-\nness classification; with more retweet users sampled, richer\nsocial context information is obtained in the second hop as\nwell. Increasing the hop 2 sampler alone however does not\nimprove model performance.\nThe most significant improvement produced by adding\nthe subgraph sampling is the training time. From Table 5,\nwe see that the average time elapsed per epoch for training\na HGT model is 3 minutes and 49.32 seconds, whereas the\naverage epoch elapsed time for training RTCS-HGT mod-\nels without user proximity loss ranges from 15.06 seconds\nto 40.13 seconds, which is 83% to 93% faster than training\na HGT model. Therefore, we conclude that the retweet cas-\ncade subgraph sampling approach improves model accuracy\nand also significantly decreases the training time by utilizing\na small subgraph with rich social context information.\nUnsupervised User Proximity Loss We also evaluate the\neffectiveness of unsupervised user proximity loss. In the\nbaseproxloss configuration, we randomly sample 10% of\nthe user nodes from the sampled subgraph in each itera-\ntion; then each sampled user node samples 5 neighboring\nuser nodes and 5 non-neighboring user nodes to calculate\nproxloss . These numbers are empirical results. We then\ntrain different RTCS-HGT variants by multiplying these\nnumbers by a proxloss multiplier N(N\u2208[2,5]). We also\ntrain a HGT+ proxloss model with the base proxloss con-\nfiguration.\nFrom Table 6, we see that, in general, adding user prox-\nimity loss makes model performance worse. Our assump-\ntion is that, when calculating proxloss , the randomly sam-\npled non-neighboring user nodes add noise into the training,\nand therefore, worsen performance. Sampling a good quality\nof negative samples has always been a challenging problem\nin the area of self-supervised contrastive learning. However,\nwe believe that learning good representations for users si-\nmultaneously with training the tweet trustworthiness model\ncould potentially boost model performance, and thus benefit\nother downstream tasks such as communities identification\nand unreliable accounts detection. Therefore, improving the\nsampling approach for calculating proxloss is one of the\nfuture directions of our study.\n6 Corpus Social Context Information\nAnalysis\nIn order to utilize tweet propagation patterns in misinfor-\nmation detection, we construct a COVID-19 corpus of 10M\nsource tweets along with their retweet cascades, our RTCas-\nCOVID-19 corpus. Previously, Liu et al. (2015) and Ma et al.\n(2016) have collected Twitter 15 and Twitter 16, with sourcetweets and their corresponding propagation threads, which\nhave been used as 2 benchmark corpora for rumor detection\nin social media. In this section, we compare the user interac-\ntion density and community distinction between our corpus\nand Twitter 15 and 16. We argue that our corpus provides\nricher and higher quality social context information, which\nbetter mimics the real-world data we see in social media.\n6.1 User Interaction Density\nFor a graph G(V, E), where Vis the set of nodes and Eis\nthe set of edges, and a subgraph S(V\u2032, E\u2032), where V\u2032\u2208V\nandE\u2032\u2208E, we define the density d(S)of the subgraph to\nbed(S) =|E\u2032|\n|V\u2032|, and the density d(G)of the graph Gto be\nd(G) =max S\u2286G{d(S)} (2)\nWe construct tweet-user heterogeneous graphs using the\nmethod described in Section 4.1 with Twitter 15 and 16 data:\nthese have graph densities of 2.41 and 2.34, respectively.\nFor comparison, the RTCas-COVID-19 graph has a density\nof 23.07, which is more than 9.5 times higher than that of\nTwitter 15 and 16. To better study the effect of graph den-\nsity on model performance, we select denser subgraphs from\nthe full Twitter 15 and 16 graphs using Charikar\u2019s greedy\napproximation algorithm (Charikar 2000) and train and test\nRTCS-HGT models on them. We convert the annotations of\nTwitter 15 and 16 to binary labels for a more direct compar-\nison, where \u201dnon-rumor\u201d and \u201dtrue\u201d tweets are considered\ntrustworthy, and \u201dunverified\u201d and \u201dfalse\u201d tweets are consid-\nered untrustworthy. As listed in Table 8, the model achieves\nthe highest accuracy on the Twitter 15 and 16 subsets with\ngraph densities of 5.36 and 4.85, which are both denser\nthan the full datasets, achieving test accuracies of 0.781 and\n0.744, respectively. Thus, denser graphs help model perfor-\nmance. However, we observe that performance drops when\nthe model is tested on subsets with densities higher than\nthese. This is reasonable, as a denser subgraph might not\ncontain enough nodes for the models to perform well, given\nthe size of the corpora \u2014 Twitter 15 and 16 contain 1490 and\n818 source tweets respectively, and our sampled corpus con-\ntains 5714 source tweets, as summarized in Table 3. There-\nfore, Twitter 15 and 16 do not provide enough graph density\nas RTCas-COVID-19 does for our model to achieve a SOTA\nperformance. Without further specification, all subsequent\nexperiments of user interaction density are conducted on the\nTwitter15/5.35 and Twitter16/4.85 variants, with 5.36 and\n4.85 graph densities, respectively.\nWe further examine the density of user retweeting in-\nteractions by examining the node degrees of user nodes in\ntweet-user heterogeneous graphs. As summarized in Table\n7, on average, each user in RTCas-COVID-19 posts 0.14\nsource tweets. However, in Twitter 15 and 16, the numbers\ndrop 79% to 86%, where each user posts only 0.03 to 0.02\nsource tweets on average. Similarly, in RTCas-COVID-19,\neach user retweets 14.12 times on average, whereas in Twit-\nter 15 and 16, each user retweets 2.96 and 2.67 times on\naverage, respectively \u2014 79% and 81% less frequently. In\nRTCas-COVID-19, each user is retweeted by 12.12 other\ndistinct users on average, whereas in Twitter 15 and 16, the\nModel Test Acc.

Figure 2\ndemonstrates the distribution of these retweet counts. We ex-\nclude numbers larger than 99% percentile to avoid outliers\nwhen plotting the figures. In RTCas-COVID-19, the major-\nity of the users have retweeted at least 5 to 30 other users\nand have been retweeted 0 to 300 times themselves by other\nusers. These numbers are significantly smaller in Twitter 15\nand 16, where the majority of users have retweeted at most8 other users and have been retweeted less than 40 times by\nother users.\nFigure 2: Retweet counts distribution. Figures in the left col-\numn illustrate the distribution of number of users each user\nhas retweeted in RTCas-COVID-19, Twitter 15, and Twitter\n16 respectively. Figures in the right column illustrate the dis-\ntribution of number of times each users has been retweeted\nin these corpora.\nWe select popular tweets that have been retweeted at\nleast 100 times and sample the top 1% of users with the\nmost number of interactions to construct the graph we build\nin Section 5. This makes our graph significantly denser\nthan those built with Twitter 15 and 16. Although Ma,\nGao, and Wong (2017) state that Twitter 15 and 16 are\nalso constructed with popular source tweets that are highly\nretweeted or replied, the analysis above shows that our\nRTCas-COVID-19 corpus not only contains more popular\ntweets with a larger numbers of retweets, but also captures a\ndenser social context graph, which enables the model to uti-\nlize more community-based knowledge to perform untrust-\nDatasetGraph\nDensity# Users Test Acc.Macro\nF1\nTwitter 152.41 (full) 477,293 0.765 0.761\n5.36 53,951 0.781 0.779\n7.49 20,216 0.729 0.726\n9.84 7,787 0.727 0.724\nTwitter 162.34 (full) 287,119 0.734 0.728\n4.85 33,216 0.744 0.737\n7.00 10,159 0.666 0.627\n9.49 2,137 0.595 0.477\nTable 8: RTCS-HGT on Twitter 15 and 16 with different\ngraph densities.

More importantly, our\ncorpus is significantly larger in size compared to Twitter 15\nand 16, even with our sampling standard. We would be able\nto sample a even larger subset if we are satisfied with tweets\nthat have comparable numbers of retweets to those in Twitter\n15 and 16.\n6.2 Community Distinction\nIn order to further analyze the quality of social context in-\nformation captured by RTCas-COVID-19 \u2014 specifically,\nwhether we can identify communities where false informa-\ntion is spread more easily and frequently, we visualize the\ntweet-user heterogeneous graph of RTCas-COVID-19, Twit-\nter 15, and Twitter 16, as shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5.\nFor RTCas-COVID-19, we randomly sample 2000 nodes to\nplot the graph as the full corpus is too large. For Twitter 15\nand 16, we convert the labeling into binary. In these graphs,\ngreen nodes are trustworthy tweet nodes, red nodes are un-\ntrustworthy tweet nodes, and black nodes are user nodes.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, the nodes naturally form 2 clus-\nters where, in one cluster, the tweet nodes are mostly green,\nmeaning that they are trustworthy, whereas in the other clus-\nter, the tweet nodes are mostly red, implying that they are\nuntrustworthy. We also observe that users within each clus-\nter tend to interact more frequently with other users in the\nsame cluster rather than with users from the other cluster,\ncreating a distinct boundary between the two clusters. How-\never, we do not observe such clear boundaries and clus-\nters in the Twitter 15 and 16 graphs. In Figures 4 and 5,\ngreen nodes and red nodes are mostly mixed together, mean-\ning that the user interactions are not dense enough to form\ndistinguishable communities. Twitter 16\u2019s graph is slightly\nbetter than that of Twitter 15, in which we see a relatively\ndenser cluster of red nodes, but it is still not as clear as what\nwe see in RTCas-COVID-19\u2019s graph. This observation in-\ndicates that our RTCas-COVID-19 corpus contains popular\nsource tweets with more complex retweet cascades; in ad-\ndition, the denser user interactions also make it possible to\ndistinguish \u201dred\u201d communities from \u201dgreen\u201d communities,\nwhere much more untrustworthy tweets are being propa-\ngated within \u201dred\u201d communities. These features would also\nbenefit other challenging tasks such as unreliable accounts\ndetection.\nFigure 3: Sampled tweet-user heterogeneous graph of\nRTCas-COVID-19. Green and red nodes are trustworthy and\nuntrustworthy tweet nodes. Black nodes are user nodes.\nFigure 4: Tweet-user heterogeneous graph of Twitter 15.\nGreen and red nodes are trustworthy and untrustworthy\ntweet nodes. Black nodes are user nodes.\n7 Conclusions and Future Work\nIn this paper, we present RTCas-COVID-19 , a novel cor-\npus of 35M COVID-19 tweets, including source tweets\nand retweet cascades, along with 2M weak-labeled source\ntweets labeled with their trustworthiness and a small sub-\nset of human-annotated source tweets. We demonstrate that\nRTCas-COVID-19 provides richer and higher quality social\ncontext information compared with other currently existing\nrumor detection corpora. There are significantly more user\ninteractions in this corpus, making the social context graph\nmuch denser than those of other corpora and forming clearly\nFigure 5: Tweet-user heterogeneous graph of Twitter 16.\nGreen and red nodes are trustworthy and untrustworthy\ntweet nodes. Black nodes are user nodes.\ndistinguishable communities where different information is\nbeing spread. With these characteristics, this corpus can be\nused for studying not only untrustworthy information detec-\ntion tasks, but also other computational social media tasks,\nsuch as early rumor detection, communities identification,\nand unreliable accounts detection.\nIn addition, we propose RTCS-HGT , an inductive hetero-\ngeneous graph framework, and present its results on clas-\nsifying tweet trustworthiness. RTCS-HGT outperforms all\nthe baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our\ntweet-user heterogeneous graph and retweet cascade sub-\ngraph sampling approach in capturing social context features\nand tweet propagation patterns on tweet trustworthiness\nclassification. Specifically, the retweet cascade subgraph\nsampling approach improves model performance, both in\naccuracy and runtime, by utilizing a concentrated subgraph\nwith rich social context information. As an inductive learn-\ning model, it is also more flexible and scalable when adapt-\ning to new datasets.\nIn future work, we will incorporate more Twitter user in-\nteractions into our corpus and heterogeneous graph, such as\nreplies and follows, to interpret more complex social con-\ntext features. Moreover, we are investigating fact-checking\napproaches, which can be used as an addition to source cred-\nibility for weak-labeling the tweets. We will also explore\nsemi-supervised or unsupervised training approaches, such\nas Xie et al. (2020), to train the model efficiently with a\nsmall amount of gold data, avoiding the cost of high qual-\nity human annotation. Furthermore, we plan to investigate\ndifferent neighbor and non-neighbor sampling approaches\nwhen calculating the unsupervised user proximity loss in or-\nder to learn better user representations. This would poten-\ntially benefit many downstream tasks, such as unreliable ac-\ncounts detection.8 Broader Perspective and Ethics Statement\nWe discuss the ethical considerations of our collected\nRTCas-COVID-19 corpus and the further usage of RTCS-\nHGT as follows:\nData Collection: We present a novel COVID-19 Twit-\nter corpus, namely RTCas-COVID-19, which is collected\nbased on the two publicly available datasets: (Chen, Lerman,\nand Ferrara 2020; Banda et al. 2020). Since both of these\ndatasets provide only Tweet IDs, we hydrate the full tweets\u2019\ncontent using Twarc6. All content retrieved from Twarc is\npublic information, and is provided by the official Twitter\nDeveloper API.\nFeature Extraction: Twitter users\u2019 public profile infor-\nmation is extracted using the official Twitter Developer API,\nand users\u2019 bot scores are extracted using the Botometer API\n(Sayyadiharikandeh et al. 2020). Neither of these APIs pro-\nvides personal information or can be used to identify indi-\nviduals, and the fully hydrated data will not be released pub-\nlicly.\nData Annotation: All the annotations are done by our lab\nmembers, who participate voluntarily and are fully aware of\nany risks of harm associated with their participation.\nData Release: To comply with Twitter\u2019s Terms of Ser-\nvice7, we will only publicly release the Tweet IDs and User\nIDs of the collected Tweets for non-commercial research\npurposes.\nPotential Biases: Tweets in our corpus are English-only,\nwhich potentially causes the analysis and models to be bi-\nased towards English-speaking populations. In addition, to\ntrain our model, we select tweets with large retweet counts\nand users with more interactions, which might lead the anal-\nysis and results biased towards users with higher activity or\nstronger attractiveness on Twitter.\nMis-classification: Note that the current RTCS-HGT\nmodel is trained on weakly-labeled data, and mis-\nclassification is inevitable in real-world applications. Any\nfurther usage of the model and interpretations of the results\nshould be made with caution and under expert judgment to\navoid misinterpretation and altering of credibility.\n9 Acknowledgments\nThis research was done with funding from the Defense Ad-\nvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract\nNo. HR001120C0123.

The dissemination\nof fake content brings with it serious political, economical, and health-related real-world impacts,\nwhich makes it imperative to \ufb01nd ways to mitigate this problem. In this dissertation we propose\na machine learning-based approach to tackle it by automatically identifying tweets associated\nwith questionable content. To that end, we employ a practical approach with a case study using\nnewly collected data from Twitter related to the 2020 US presidential election. In order to\ncreate a sizable annotated data set, we use an automatic labeling process based on the factual\nreporting level of links contained in tweets, as classi\ufb01ed by human experts, resulting in a labeled\ndata set containing 150 thousand tweets representative of the real-world scenario of fake news\ndistribution in social media. We derive relevant features from that data, based on a combination\nof text content representation, linguistic attributes, user pro\ufb01le, and post metadata. We compare\ndi\ufb00erent variations of these features and identify the most applicable methods to the problem at\nhand, with an approach generally based on data obtained from an individual tweet, enabling\nclassi\ufb01cation as soon as a tweet is posted, therefore helping to prevent the harm inevitably\ncaused by fake news di\ufb00usion. We additionally demonstrate the speci\ufb01c contribution of features\nderived from named entity and emotion recognition techniques, including a novel approach using\nsequences of prevalent emotions in sentences, analogous to n-grams. We conclude the dissertation\nby evaluating and comparing the performance of several machine learning models on a number\nof test sets, created with di\ufb00erent contexts and time periods, and show they are applicable to\naddressing the issue of fake news dissemination.\ni\n\nResumo\nDesde 2016, com a populariza\u00e7\u00e3o da express\u00e3o, temos observado uma prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o das chamadas\n\u201cfake news \u201d (termo em ingl\u00eas para \u201cnot\u00edcias falsas\u201d), que tem sido exponenciada pelo uso das\nplataformas de redes sociais. A dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de conte\u00fados falsos traz consigo graves impactos\nreais, seja no campo da pol\u00edtica, da economia ou da sa\u00fade p\u00fablica, o que torna essencial encontrar\nmaneiras de atenuar esse problema. Nesta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o, propomos uma abordagem para enfrent\u00e1-lo\ncom base em aprendizagem computacional, por meio da identi\ufb01ca\u00e7\u00e3o automatizada de tweets\nassociados a conte\u00fados question\u00e1veis. Adotamos uma abordagem pr\u00e1tica, realizando um caso\nde estudo com dados recolhidos do Twitter exclusivamente para esse \ufb01m, relacionados \u00e0 elei\u00e7\u00e3o\npresidencial norte-americana de 2020. Para obter um conjunto de dados de tamanho consider\u00e1vel,\nempregamos um processo automatizado de etiquetagem baseado no grau de reportagem factual\ndelinkspresentes em tweets, conforme avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de especialistas. Esse processo resultou em um\nconjunto de dados etiquetado com 150 mil tweetsque \u00e9 representativo da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o real das\nfake news em redes sociais. A partir desses dados, cri\u00e1mos atributos relevantes, com base em\numa combina\u00e7\u00e3o de representa\u00e7\u00e3o de texto, propriedades lingu\u00edsticas, no per\ufb01l do utilizador\ne em metadados das publica\u00e7\u00f5es. Compar\u00e1mos varia\u00e7\u00f5es desses atributos e identi\ufb01c\u00e1mos os\nm\u00e9todos mais adequados para enfrentar o problema em quest\u00e3o, com uma abordagem baseada\nem dados que podem ser obtidos a partir de cada tweet, o que possibilita que ele seja classi\ufb01cado\nassim que \u00e9 publicado, o que por sua vez pode ajudar a evitar o dano que \u00e9 inevitavelmente\ncausado pela divulga\u00e7\u00e3o de fake news . Al\u00e9m disso, demonstr\u00e1mos a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00ed\ufb01ca de\natributos derivados de t\u00e9cnicas de reconhecimento de entidades nomeadas e de emo\u00e7\u00f5es, com uma\nnova abordagem que utiliza sequ\u00eancias de emo\u00e7\u00f5es dominantes em frases, an\u00e1logas a n-gramas.\nConclu\u00edmos a disserta\u00e7\u00e3o com a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e a compara\u00e7\u00e3o do desempenho de diversos modelos de\naprendizagem computacional em uma s\u00e9rie de conjuntos de teste, criados em diferentes contextos\ne per\u00edodos, com os quais demonstr\u00e1mos a adequa\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos para enfrentar o problema da\ndissemina\u00e7\u00e3o das fake news .\niii\n\nAcknowledgments\nMy gratitude to my supervisor, professor \u00c1lvaro Figueira, for his

Fake news can be broadly de\ufb01ned as misleading information\npresented as news. It has also been used to denote any kind of misinformation, often published\nwith the goal of promoting a political or personal agenda, or for \ufb01nancial gain through advertising\nrevenues [78].\nThe recent surge in the use of the term \u201cfake news\u201d has been attributed to former US president\nDonald Trump, who popularized the term during the 2016 election campaign. However, when he\nmentioned fake news, he often said so simply as a means to dismiss negative press coverage of\nhimself. The 2016 US presidential race saw many examples of fake news in\ufb01ltrate the public\ndiscourse. In particular, fake news were employed with the objective of direct political interference,\nwith systematic operations conducted by the Russian government to in\ufb02uence the results of the\nAmerican election [ 61]. Russian e\ufb00orts involved promoting fake advertising and videos to favor\ncandidate Donald Trump and oppose Hillary Clinton, publishing content that potentially reached\ntens of millions of Americans (see \ufb01gure 1.1). Other goals of the Russian campaign were to\n\u201cprovoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States,\u201d according to the o\ufb03cial\ninvestigation conducted by American authorities [61].\nOther than political gain, another example of fake news dissemination in the 2016 US election\ncame from the country of Macedonia, where teenagers set up hundreds of fraudulent news websites\nwith content promoting Donald Trump. However, contrary to the previous example, they had no\npolitical agenda, aiming instead at obtaining advertisement earnings from website views. They\neven created websites with left-leaning fake content, but found the right-wing content was more\npopular.\nWhileitisdi\ufb03culttoquantifytheimpactsuchcaseshadontheactualoutcomeoftheelections,\nother examples have had concrete and serious consequences.

Fueled by this conspiracy theory, one man drove to one of these restaurants\narmed with a ri\ufb02e, which he proceeded to \ufb01re inside the restaurant [ 42]. Another example of\nconcrete and direct impact of fake news took place in 2013, when US$ 130 billion in stock value\nquickly vanished after the Associated Press Twitter account was hacked and published that\nBarack Obama had been injured in an explosion [ 71]. More recently, the covid-19 pandemic has\nsparked several cases of fake news dissemination, with the Director-General of the World Health\nOrganization calling it an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of misinformation [ 63]. Misleading information published\nonline can compromise access to valid and accurate health messaging, and lead to complications\nincluding stress and anxiety, use of toxic substances, as well as a general harm to collective public\nhealth, with misinformation conveyed by anti-vaccination groups [ 5]. All these dangers\u2014political,\neconomical, and health-related\u2014posed by fake news warrant a prompt interdisciplinary response\nby organizations worldwide with the goal of diminishing its serious impact.\nSince 2016, we have seen the proliferation of websites dedicated to publishing false or\nmisleading information, which are also replicated by users or bots on several di\ufb00erent social\nmedia platforms. These platforms themselves play a signi\ufb01cant part in spreading these articles due\nto their algorithms which are commonly optimized for maximizing user engagement. Additionally,\nmany users are locked in an \u201cecho chamber\u201d in their social networks, where their exposure\nto homogeneous content limits their tolerance for alternative points of view and increases\npolarization [ 47]. The fact that in recent years there has been a general trend of decreasing\n1.1. Objectives 3\ncon\ufb01dence in mass media outlets [ 47,75], coupled with the fact that, as of 2020, half of Americans\nget their news from social media [ 82], only compound the problem of fake news dissemination in\nsocial media platforms. Also, the deluge of information conveyed on social networks makes it\nincreasingly hard and in many cases infeasible for an individual to verify sources and con\ufb01rm\ncontent reliability, creating an opportunity to employ automated methods to assist in that task.\nEven though a purely mechanical solution to this problem is not likely to completely eliminate\nit, any tool that can aid readers in distinguishing between legitimate content and misinformation\ncan help mitigate this serious issue.\nFake news have a number of de\ufb01ning attributes that can be leveraged when trying to \ufb01nd\nsolutions to the problem of their dissemination. The \ufb01rst is, of course, that they must present\ninaccurate information, which can range from a small imprecision to a complete fabrication.\nAnother attribute of fake news content is its appeal to emotions, exploiting existing prejudices\nor biases in the reader to elicit a strong emotional response [ 78]. That can be accomplished\nin a number of ways, from using captivating pictures to employing linguistic features, such as\nexcessive use of adverbs, and words in all capital letters [ 89]. Fake news is also optimized for\nsharing, and often spread in short bursts [ 87] at a higher di\ufb00usion rate than real news once they\nbecome viral [31].\nFalse information is commonly divided into subcategories, including rumor, misinformation,\ndisinformation, hoax, satire, clickbait, propaganda, conspiracy theories, opinion spam, and\nfake news [ 55]. While these categories each present their own attributes that enable distinguishing\nthem from one another\u2014notably in motivation, style, and impact\u2014they also exhibit a degree of\nsimilarity and overlapping characteristics. As an example, based on motivation, we can distinguish\nmisinformation, de\ufb01ned as false information that circulates inadvertently, from disinformation,\nwhich is false information deliberately created with a prede\ufb01ned intention [ 55]. Additionally,\nbased on style, we can contrast both with fake news, which can be de\ufb01ned as false information\nspread with the resemblance of legitimate news but without the editorial processes adopted by\nnews media organizations to ensure information accuracy [ 47]. This study considers \u201cfake news\u201d\nto be news content that is veri\ufb01ably false and misleading, regardless of the speci\ufb01c intent or style.\nFor the sake of brevity and consistency, we use the term \u201cfake tweets\u201d to denote tweets that are\nassociated with deceptive or unreliable content, while the term \u201cnon-fake tweets\u201d denotes tweets\nassociated with reliable content.\n1.1 Objectives\nWith the goal of helping to mitigate the fake news problem, our main objective is to implement\na machine learning model capable of automatically identifying posts associated with fake news\ncontent on Twitter, as well as investigate what characteristics of that model contribute to a\nsuccessful result. To that end, we propose three di\ufb00erent research questions that we attempt to\nanswer in the course of this research:\n4 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\u2022RQ1: Is it possible to automatically identify posts associated with fake news\nbased on a set of features? This is the main research question, for which a positive\nanswer will enable answering the remaining ones. As previously discussed in this chapter,\nthe volume of fake content being posted and shared online, specially on social media\nplatforms, turns manual fact-checking into an unfeasible task. Therefore, a tool capable\nof automating that job, to any extent possible, should be an important asset in the \ufb01ght\nagainst fake news.\n\u2022RQ2: How does a time gap between the model creation and its use impact the\nidenti\ufb01cation of fake news? After creating a model that can successfully identify fake\nnews content in Twitter posts, is it possible to apply such model in temporally spaced\ndata? Can we identify any concept drift [ 104]? In other words, is the information used\nby the model to classify tweets still applicable to fake news classi\ufb01cation after a period of\ntime has passed? A positive answer to this question would make it easier to deploy such\nmodels in production, reducing the need to frequently retrain the models on new data.\n\u2022RQ3: Is it possible to improve classi\ufb01cation performance using features based\non emotions and named entities? As discussed further throughout this dissertation,\nfake news make heavy use of emotionally charged constructs in an attempt to generate\nstrong emotional responses and increase the likelihood of being shared. Additionally, named\nentities in the text can help identify a fact. Therefore, can we combine features based on\nboth of those concepts in order to enhance the identi\ufb01cation of tweets associated with fake\nnews?\nIn answering these research questions, this study has a number of related contributions. One\nis creating an annotated data set of fake news and legitimate content from Twitter, along with\nattributes for each tweet. We also implement di\ufb00erent machine learning models for automatically\nidentifying tweets associated with fake content, and compare and discuss their results. Finally,\nwe investigate the enhancement provided by features derived from named entities and emotion\nrecognition in the automatic identi\ufb01cation of fake news, and demonstrate their applicability to\nhelp address that issue.\n1.2 Organization\nThis document is divided into six chapters\u2014including this \u201cIntroduction\u201d\u2014which are organized\nas follows.\nChapter 2 presents a literature review in the \ufb01eld of fake news identi\ufb01cation with machine\nlearning-based approaches. Before going in more detail over the recent advances in this \ufb01eld,\nwe present some foundational concepts that are essential for the discussion contained in the\nrest of this document. Section 2.1.1 explains basic concepts related to machine learning, the\nalgorithms used in this work, and how to evaluate their performance for data classi\ufb01cation. Since\n1.2. Organization 5\na large portion of this work involves the processing of textual data, section 2.1.2 presents a basic\noverview of natural language processing and the main approaches for working with this type of\ndata in a machine learning context. Next, in section 2.2, we discuss more recent developments in\nautomatic fake news detection, summarizing approaches from di\ufb00erent studies in terms of data\ncollection, employed features, classi\ufb01cation models, and results obtained.\nIn the next chapters we go into detail about our work. Chapter 3 describes the data used for\nthis investigation. Section 3.1 explains the reasoning behind the di\ufb00erent phases and approaches\nused in the data collection, as well as the need to collect a new data set. Section 3.2 discusses\nthe data processing and transformation steps taken in order to obtain a clean and consistent\ndata set. Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 address two data processing operations performed, related to\nsentiment analysis and named entity recognition, with the comparison of di\ufb00erent approaches\nfor each task. Section 3.2.3 presents our proposed approach to obtain a labeled data set based\non a publisher\u2019s factual reporting level. Section 3.3 concludes the chapter with a discussion on\nthe samples extracted from our collected data and the objectives behind the creation of each of\nthose sets.\nFollowing the discussion on data collection and processing, the \ufb01rst section on chapter 4\naddresses our feature engineering process. We propose a main set of baseline features, described in\nsection 4.1.1. In section 4.1.2 we compare di\ufb00erent text representation approaches for converting\ntweet content into features, and use the best performing one as basis for a new feature based\non model stacking. The following subsections address additional proposed features, notably\nbased on named entity recognition (section 4.1.3) and emotion recognition (section 4.1.4), in\nwhich we investigate emotion frequencies (section 4.1.4.1) and the sequence of emotions in a\ntweet (section 4.1.4.2). The discussion on features is closed with section 4.1.5, detailing our\nfeature selection process. The chapter is \ufb01nished with section 4.2, which presents our methodology\nfor creating and evaluating machine learning models based on our selected features.\nIn chapter 5 we present the results from our experiments and how they relate to our research\ngoals. We discuss results obtained with the complete proposed feature set (section 5.1), compare\nthe baseline features with features based on emotion and named entity recognition (section 5.2),\ndiscuss experiments with re-sampling methods to tackle class imbalance (section 5.3), and evaluate\nwhich were the most discriminating features (section 5.4).\nFinally, in chapter 6 we discuss our main conclusions from the study and answer our research\nquestions. Additionally, we present a general summary of the work performed (section 6.1), the\nlimitationsandchallengesfaced(section6.3), andpossibilitiesforextendingthiswork(section6.4).\n\nChapter 2\nRelated Work\nBefore we discuss the details of our work, it is important to present a number of basic concepts,\nas well as provide a literature review of relevant studies conducted to tackle the same problem.\nThe discussion in this chapter aims to provide the reader with the tools and context to review\nour work, which is presented in detail in chapters 3 to 6.\n2.1 Basic Concepts\nIn this section we provide some fundamental concepts that are used in further discussion in this\ndocument.\n2.1.1 Machine Learning\nFundamentally,machinelearningcanbede\ufb01nedasthestudyofcomputersystemsthatautomatically\nimprove with experience and through the use of data [ 56]. It is seen as a sub-\ufb01eld of arti\ufb01cial\nintelligence. Machinelearningalgorithmsbuildamodelbasedondatainordertomakepredictions\nor draw conclusions without any explicit programming. The application used in this work is the\nclassi\ufb01cation task, in which the model attempts to label a given instance as belonging to one of\na number of classes\u2014in our case, two classes, making it a binary classi\ufb01cation. More formally,\nwe can de\ufb01ne the classi\ufb01cation task as a function approximation. Considering there exists an\nunknown function that attributes an instance to a class Ci:\nf(X) :{input domain}\u2192{C1,C2,...,C K} (2.1)\nThe goal is to \ufb01nd a function \u02c6f(X)that approximates f(X).\nApproaches in machine learning are commonly divided between supervised, unsupervised,\nand reinforcement learning. This work adopts the supervised learning approach, where the\nalgorithm learns the function approximation by inference based on labeled examples [ 77]. We\ncompare the application of \ufb01ve di\ufb00erent supervised learning algorithms to our task of classifying\n7\n8 Chapter 2. Related Work\ntweets associated with fake news: Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector\nMachines (SVMs), and AdaBoost. Naive Bayes are statistical classi\ufb01ers based on Bayes\u2019 Theorem\nthat, even though they have strong assumptions of independence between features\u2014which makes\nthem \u201cnaive\u201d on assuming that\u2014have shown good performance when compared with more\nsophisticated methods [ 34]. Decision trees are models that perform a recursive partitioning of\nthe input space based on logical tests on features in order to classify instances. Despite their\nsimplicity, they are also powerful classi\ufb01ers [ 34]. Random forests are a popular ensemble method\ncomposed of several decision trees, each generated with a bootstrap sample and selection of a\nsubset of features in each split [ 11]. The output is the class predicted by the majority of trees.\nSupport vector machine is a method commonly used for linear and non-linear classi\ufb01cation, and\nattempt to perform an optimal separation of hyperplanes by transforming the feature space and\nobtaining a linear boundary [ 17]. AdaBoost is an ensemble method that relies on the output of a\nset of so-called \u201cweak learners\u201d, each subsequently \ufb01tted on a modi\ufb01ed version of the data in\norder to focus on examples which are harder to classify. These outputs are combined through a\nweighted sum to generate the \ufb01nal prediction by the model [23].\nIn supervised machine learning, the model is \ufb01tted using example input-output pairs. The\ndata available is commonly split into training andtestsets, where the training set is used to \ufb01t\nthe model, while the test set is used at the \ufb01nal stage of the process to evaluate the performance\nof the \ufb01tted model on previously unseen data, in order to provide a reliable estimate of the\nexpected prediction error. However, when dealing with a small data sample, there is the risk\nthat the test set will be too small to provide an accurate estimation of the prediction error, or\nthat the training set will have too much data removed that would otherwise be useful in \ufb01tting\nthe model.\nOne approach to counter these issues is performing cross validation. In this work we make\nuse ofk-fold cross validation, which consists in creating kpartitions on the training data to\nbe used for training and validation. For each kth partition, the model is \ufb01tted on the other\nk\u22121partitions and its performance is evaluated on the kth partition, commonly referred to as a\nvalidation set. This process is repeated for all kpartitions and the \ufb01nal estimate of the prediction\nerror is obtained by aggregating the errors in all validations sets, typically by averaging [ 34].\nCommon values for kare 5 and 10. Figure 2.1 shows an example of data partitions in 5-fold\ncross validation.\nBut how exactly are the results evaluated? In the case of binary classi\ufb01cation, the classes can\nbe de\ufb01ned as positiveandnegative according to the context of the problem under investigation.\nThen there are four possible outcomes: a correct prediction of an example as belonging to either\nthe positive or the negative classes, or an incorrect prediction of each class. Correct predictions\nare usually called true positives ( Tp) or true negatives ( Tn), according the respective class they\nrefer to. Similarly, incorrect predictions are called false positives ( Fp) or false negatives ( Fn).\nThese results can be summarized in a confusion matrix, which is a kind of contingency table\nwith the actual classes displayed in rows and the predicted classes, in columns (although the\nrows and columns layout varies in literature). The contents of each cell can be presented as\n2.1.

Common\nmetrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, false positive rate (FPR), and speci\ufb01city.\nThese are de\ufb01ned as follows:\n\u2022Accuracy: Simply put, the accuracy measures how often the model made correct\npredictions. It is de\ufb01ned as the proportion of the sum of true positives ( Tp) and true\nnegatives (Tn) to the total number of examples evaluated ( N).\nAccuracy =Tp+Tn\nN(2.2)\n10 Chapter 2. Related Work\n\u2022Precision: Intuitively, the precision measures how often the model is correct in the cases\nwhere it is detecting something. Precision is de\ufb01ned as the proportion of true positives\n(Tp) to all examples predicted as positive, i.e., the sum of true positives ( Tp) and false\npositives (Fp).\nPrecision =Tp\nTp+Fp(2.3)\n\u2022Recall: Measures the proportion of the positive class that is being detected by the model.\nRecall is de\ufb01ned as the proportion of true positives ( Tp) to all examples actually in the\npositive class, i.e., the sum of true positives ( Tp) and false negatives ( Fn). It is also known\nas sensitivity or true positive rate.\nRecall =Tp\nTp+Fn(2.4)\n\u2022F1-score: Itistheharmonicmeanbetweenprecisionandrecall.

The false positive rate is de\ufb01ned as the proportion of false\npositives (Fp) to all examples from the negative class, i.e., the sum of false positives ( Fp)\nand true negatives ( Tn).\nFalse positive rate =Fp\nFp+Tn(2.6)\n\u2022Speci\ufb01city: Similar to the recall, the speci\ufb01city measures the proportion of the negative\nclassthatisbeingdetectedbythemodel.

The speci\ufb01city is also known as true negative rate.\nSpecificity =Tn\nTn+Fp(2.7)\nWe also de\ufb01ne a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. This is a curve commonly\nused to compare the balance between the true positive rate (recall) and the false positive rate. It\nplots the recall versus the false positive rate at various model parameter settings [ 34], and the\narea under the ROC curve (AUC) is a common measure when comparing the performance of\ndi\ufb00erent models on the same data. Finally, we can make use of the ROC curve when de\ufb01ning an\noptimal threshold for classi\ufb01cation by choosing a point in the curve that maximizes informedness,\nwhich is de\ufb01ned as follows:\nInformedness =Specificity +Sensitivity\u22121 (2.8)\nInformedness is a metric that represents the probability of an informed decision by the model,\nwith a high value indicating an optimal balance between the sensitivity and the speci\ufb01city [69].\n2.1. Basic Concepts 11\n2.1.2 Natural Language Processing\nFake news classi\ufb01cation has frequently been posed as a text mining problem. Therefore, this\nsection introduces some concepts related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) that are used\nthroughout this study.\nBefore attempting to classify text in the context of a machine learning classi\ufb01cation task,\none issue must be dealt with \ufb01rst: it is not possible to directly use raw text\u2014a sequence of\ncharacters, words, symbols\u2014with most classi\ufb01cation algorithms, as these work with numerical\nfeatures, especially with \ufb01xed-size vectors instead of varied-length text. Therefore it is necessary\nto employ methods capable of transforming the text into numerical vectors.\nPlenty of methods have been proposed in order to overcome this issue, including the bag of\nwords [54]. Representing a text corpus using the bag of words approach encompasses two main\nsteps: \ufb01rst, constructing a vocabulary based on tokens (e.g. words) from the corpus, and second,\ncomputing a measure of the presence of these words in each document, commonly the number\nof times each word appears in the given document. Therefore, each document is represented\nby a \ufb01xed-size vector\u2014whose length is the size of the constructed vocabulary\u2014where each\nelement is the chosen measure of presence for each word from the vocabulary for that speci\ufb01c\ndocument. Consequently, the corpus is represented by a matrix, where each row corresponds to\none document, and each column to one token from the vocabulary.\nThe word \u201cbag\u201d from the name of this approach alludes to the fact that, when creating a bag\nof words, all information about the order of tokens is eliminated. In order to tackle this issue,\nthe bag of words can be extended into a bag of n-grams. An n-gram is de\ufb01ned as a contiguous\nsequence of nitems from the given text. With this approach, we construct a vocabulary of\nn-grams (instead of single words, i.e., unigrams) and proceed in the same way as with the bag of\nwords approach. By using bigrams ( n-grams of size 2) instead of unigrams, for example, some\ninformation about the ordering of words is preserved, resulting in a generally more powerful\ninput for document classi\ufb01cation purposes [26].\nAnother common attempt to improve the basic bag of words model involves normalizing\nthe count of tokens and weighting with smaller importance tokens that appear frequently and,\nthus, are deemed to contain less discriminating power for characterizing a document. A common\nmethod to weight the tokens is to use TF\u2013IDF (Term Frequency\u2013Inverse Document Frequency)\nterm weighting. TF\u2013IDF is a numerical value for a word that aims to represent the importance\nof said word to a document in a collection [ 80]. As its name implies, it is a combination of\ntwo di\ufb00erent elements: the term frequency and theinverse document frequency . We de\ufb01ne the\nterm frequency ( tft,d) of a term tin a document das the number of times term tappears in\ndocumentd. The inverse document frequency of a term t(idft) relates to the inverse of the\nproportion of documents that contain the given term. Considering the total number of documents\nin the corpus as N, it is computed as follows:\n12 Chapter 2. Related Work\nidft= logN\ndft(2.9)\nThe idea behind the inverse document frequency is to give increasing weights to rarer\u2014and\npotentially more discriminating\u2014terms. Combining the two measures results in a composite\nweight for each term in each document of a corpus:\ntf-idft,d=tft,d\u00d7idft (2.10)\nTF\u2013IDF weighting makes rarer and potentially more interesting terms receive higher weight\nthan words that appear very frequently. While this method has its origins in the information\nretrieval \ufb01eld, it has also found extensive use for document classi\ufb01cation purposes.\nEven though the bag of words method has been widely used, it relies on the exact form\nof tokens, without considering its context or meaning, to generate a high-dimensional sparse\nvector representation of text. Word embeddings, in contrast, are dense learned representations\nof a piece of text in a low-dimensional vector space, where words with similar meaning have\na similar representation, and are expected to be closer to each other in the vector space [ 53].\nSeveral methods have been proposed to generate word embeddings from text, and in this work,\nwe employ GloVe [ 66] vectors. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm that constructs word\nembeddings by leveraging global word-word co-occurrence statistics in a corpus.\n2.2 State of the Art\nDue to the widespread impact and implications of the fake news problem, discussed in chapter 1,\nthere has been a recent surge in academic research related to the issue of fake news. Figure 2.3\nshows the number of papers published per year that mention the terms \u201cfake news\u201d and also\n\u201cmachine learning\u201d. Since 2016, when the term was popularized by then US presidential candidate\nDonald Trump, there has been an ever-increasing trend and growing interest towards research in\nthat area.\nOut of all research being conducted into fake news, we can also observe a growing proportion\nare related to machine learning. One of the motivations for employing machine learning techniques\nto deal with this problem arises from the sheer volume of data that is published and shared\nonline, especially on social media platforms. Twitter alone receives an average of 500 million\nposts per day1, making it an impossible task to manually verify the accuracy of the content\nin each tweet. Therefore, any tool capable of systematically and automatically evaluating the\nreliability of content being shared online is bound to be of great assistance, especially to the\nend-user.\n1https://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/\n2.2. State of the Art 13\nFigure 2.3: Publication of research papers related to \u201cfake news\u201d over time.\nWe can de\ufb01ne four main stages a work can include when investigating machine learning\napplications for fake news detection, namely: data collection, feature engineering, classi\ufb01cation\nusing machine learning-based models, and evaluation metrics. Let us discuss how other studies\napproach each of these areas.\n2.2.1 Data Collection\nOne of the major challenges faced when dealing with the fake news problem is obtaining a sizable\nannotated data set. Such a data set is essential for establishing a ground truth to be used for\nderiving useful features and verifying a model\u2019s performance in correctly identifying fake news\nwith supervised learning. Some annotated data sets have been published, for di\ufb00erent platforms,\nbut not many focus on social media use data from Twitter (a trend that has been reversing since\nFacebook\u2019s restriction of some of its APIs in 2018). These data sets are undoubtedly useful tools\nbut many are limited in a number of ways.\nLIAR [93] is a data set based on approximately 12,800 short text statements, along with\nsome associated context, obtained from fact-checking website PolitiFact, ranging from 2007 to\n2016. These were manually labeled by PolitiFact editors into one of 6 levels of truthfulness.\nLIAR-PLUS [ 2] enhances the LIAR data set by adding automatically-extracted justi\ufb01cation\ninformation for the editors\u2019 classi\ufb01cation. The LIAR and LIAR-PLUS data sets are based mostly\non textual data and lack metadata that can be obtained on social media platforms such as\nTwitter and are potentially useful for automatic classi\ufb01cation purposes.\n14 Chapter 2. Related Work\nThe PHEME rumor data set [ 105] contains Twitter data annotated by journalists, however it\nis relatively small (4,842 tweets in total) and focused on rumors, not fake news.\nCREDBANK [ 57] is a large collection of around 60 million tweets from October 2014 to\nFebruary 2015, manually annotated via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Those tweets were grouped\ninto events, which were then annotated with the aim of assessing general event credibility, not\n\ufb01ne-grained tweets associated with fake news content.\nFakeNewsNet [ 87] was created in 2018 as an attempt to consolidate fake news content, and the\nsocial context and spatiotemporal information of users sharing this content. It uses an automatic\nprocess for extracting fake news stories based on rankings by fact-checking websites PolitiFact\nand GossipCop, and obtaining the Twitter posts associated with these stories. However, due to\ntweet decay, as of November 2019, only 33% of news stories from GossipCop still had related\ntweet data available2.\nIt should be noted that the data in many data sets currently available or created in di\ufb00erent\nstudies provide a mostly balanced sample, whether for binary or multiclass scenarios. However,\nthe average user is exposed to fake content at a much lower rate than to regular content [ 28,64],\na fact which many works that employ readily available data sets do not take into consideration\nwhen devising their methods to tackle the fake news issue [ 3,86]. With a di\ufb00erent approach,\nZhou et al. [ 103], citing a lack of studies with the actual ratio between true news and fake\nnews, experimented with varying proportions of those classes on the data set, obtaining accuracy\n\ufb02uctuations between 0.75 and 0.9. Other studies opt to create their own data sets for investigation,\nwhich range from balanced [67], moderately imbalanced [4, 89], to highly imbalanced [60, 68].\n2.2.2 Features\nThe life cycle of a fake news article encompasses three main stages: creation, publication, and\nsharing. Many websites have been created with the sole purpose of publishing fake news content.\nThese are usually made to resemble known and trustworthy news outlets, either adopting a\nsimilar layout or mimicking an actual publication (e.g. fake news website NBCNews.com.co\nversus original NBCNews.com) in an outright attempt to deceive the user. The stories published\nby these websites are then shared mainly on social media platforms, either by malicious users,\nautomated bots, or by unsuspecting users who have fallen for the deception [ 102]. With\napplications in di\ufb00erent parts in the life cycle of a fake news article, we have observed three main\napproaches adopted by studies when deriving features to use for classi\ufb01cation: content-based,\nsocial context-based, and network-based [83].\nContent-based features typically comprise linguistic attributes in di\ufb00erent levels, including\nstructural, lexical, syntactic, and semantic [ 67]. Commonly included are metrics such as the\nnumber of words and sentences [ 89], and length of text and sentences [ 99]. Variations of text\nrepresentation in vector space, with di\ufb00erent weighting schemes, are also widely used for directly\n2https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet/issues/37\n2.2. State of the Art 15\nderiving features from the textual content [ 36,75,91]. Punctuation is also explored, including the\nnumber of exclamation and question marks [ 67,99], as well as the number of capital letters [ 89].\nRegarding syntactic features, part-of-speech (POS) tagging is often performed, with features\nbased on the frequency adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and pronouns [91, 99, 103].\nStudies also attempt to quantify di\ufb00erences in writing style between fake and true news.\nThese types of features are mostly suited for application in longer form fake news articles, whereas\nthe shorter length common to posts in social media might not present the amount of content\nnecessary to explore style-based features. Rubin et al. [ 75] had an early study for detecting\nsatire-based fake news according to writing style, employing several bag of words variations with\nadditional features. Additionally, Potthast et al. [ 68] attempt to leverage potentially di\ufb00erent\nwriting styles in highly partisan stories and fake news, and achieve good results in distinguishing\npartisan from more balanced news, but conclude writing style alone is not able to di\ufb00erentiate\nfake articles from real ones.\nWith respect to semantic features, many studies employ sentiment analysis [ 1,67,89,99] due\nto the in\ufb02ated emotional tone typical of fake news content. In the same vein, the psychological\nmeaning is also explored in other studies, using features derived from the Linguistic Inquiry\nand Word Count (LIWC)3dictionaries [ 67,75,91,103]. Additionally, the Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) [ 8] model has been used for identifying topics in social media posts [ 32,40].\nWord embeddings have also been used as features with success in several studies for identifying\nunreliable content [4, 52, 76, 103].\nOne of the de\ufb01ning attributes of fake news lies in its attempt to elicit strong emotional\nresponses in the reader, as discussed in chapter 1. Giachanou and Crestani [ 24] provide an\noverview of sentiment analysis methods for application on Twitter, and describe a number of\nstudies focused on emotion detection. However, despite the relevance of emotions to fake news\ncontent it is surprising that emotion-based features are not commonly found in the literature.\nAiming to close that gap, Giachanou et al. [ 25] study the impact of emotional signals on credibility\nassessment. They employ di\ufb00erent lexicons to extract the emotion in a claim along with its\nemotional intensity, and use additional models to predict the emotional level of reactions to\nthe claim. Their work combines word embeddings and emotional signals, and compare di\ufb00erent\nneural networks and an SVM model for predicting emotional reactions and distinguishing credible\nfrom non-credible claims. They \ufb01nd that, in the case of emotional reactions, SVM outperforms\nthe neural network-based approaches by a large margin. On the other hand, for detecting\ncredibility in claims, they conclude that the use of emotional signals in their proposed neural\nnetwork improves performance, with a best F1-score of 0.6.\nContent-based features are derived from the textual content of fake news articles or posts, and\ntherefore can be used regardless of the stage in the fake news life cycle. When fake news content\nreaches the stages of publication and specially sharing, it makes more information available\nthat can be leveraged for creating features based on social media context and post propagation.\n3https://www.liwc.net\n16 Chapter 2. Related Work\nWith regard to social media, features are commonly based on the user\u2019s pro\ufb01le and on message\nmetadata.\nPro\ufb01le-based features are meant to help identify some signs that can assist with fake news\nclassi\ufb01cation. For example, a user who follows a large number of accounts but has few followers,\na recently-created account with a large number of posts, or accounts that mark a high number\nof messages as \u201cfavorites\u201d or \u201cliked\u201d are all patterns that have been observed in connection\nwith dissemination of fake news content [ 84]. Features in this group include a user\u2019s number\nof followers and friends, their geographical location, number of messages posted, account age,\nand veri\ufb01cation status (i.e., if the account has been veri\ufb01ed as authentic by the social media\nplatform) [4, 36, 45, 87].\nPosts on social media have metadata and message-speci\ufb01c content that can also be explored\nand has proven useful as a basis for creating features. These include the presence of links [ 52],\nnumber of times a post was marked as \u201cliked\u201d or \u201cfavorite\u201d [ 89], and time of publication [ 87].\nSpeci\ufb01cally for Twitter, commonly used features include the number of mentions of another user\nand hashtags [52, 60].\nFinally, some studies employ network-based features, aiming to explore propagation properties\nof fake news content in social media platforms. These studies leverage patterns that emerge\nin fake news sharing, such as echo chambers and \ufb01lter bubbles, where users in a social media\nplatform have their media exposure limited to content aligned with their prede\ufb01ned beliefs. This\npresents psychological factors that directly impact in user consumption and acceptance of fake\nnews content [ 85]. Other studies attempt to model the propagation tree of these messages [ 92,98],\nand also include features such as the number of times a message was replicated or replied to, or\nthe propagation times [51, 87].\nItshouldbenotedthatalthoughnetwork-basedfeatureshavebeenemployedbyseveralstudies,\ntheir use evidently depends on the spreading of fake news across the network. Nevertheless, it\nhas been shown that it is not easy to revert the impact of incorrect information once a person\nhas been exposed to it [ 74]. Therefore, it is essential to identify fake news content as early as\npossible [52, 103].\nOther studies make use of purpose-speci\ufb01c features that attempt to leverage additional\npatterns. As an example, Reis et al. [ 73], observing that fake news creation and publishing as\na pro\ufb01table business has on occasion taken place in speci\ufb01c locations, explore the information\npotentially provided by the location of domains that host fake news content.\n2.2.3 Classi\ufb01cation Models and Results\nFor machine learning-based fake news classi\ufb01cation, a common approach is the use of supervised\nlearning techniques, ranging from more traditional algorithms to deep neural networks. Their\nresults are commonly evaluated with widely used classi\ufb01cation metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F-score. Many studies work with binary classi\ufb01cation [ 60,67,75,89], while\n2.2. State of the Art 17\nsome tackle the problem through a multiclass perspective [33, 72, 91, 93].\nSupport Vector Machines have shown good results in several studies. Rubin et al. [ 75] make\nuse of SVM-based algorithms with combinations of vector text representations and obtain F-scores\nbetween 0.82 and 0.87. P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al. [ 67] test di\ufb00erent sets of linguistic-based features with\nan SVM model and achieve 0.78 accuracy with readability-related features. Additionally, they\ntest content from di\ufb00erent domains and \ufb01nd a large di\ufb00erence in cross-domain classi\ufb01cation\nperformance, with high accuracy in some domains (0.91 for politics content) and low in others\n(0.51 for sports content). Decision Trees and Random Forests are also widely used, with Random\nForests frequently \ufb01guring among the best performers for classi\ufb01cation [ 68,86]. A common\napproach adopted by several studies is to compare the performance of di\ufb00erent classi\ufb01ers on the\nsame data sets in order to evaluate which provide the best results. Zhou et al. [ 103] combine\nLogistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and XGBoost, and\nobtain a general accuracy of 0.88, with Random Forest and XGBoost as the best performing\nalgorithms. Similarly, Reis et al. [ 73] compare traditional algorithms and also obtain the best\nresults from Random Forest and XGBoost, with an F1-score of 0.81.\nSome studies also employ deep learning for classi\ufb01cation, since this family of techniques\nhas shown good results in natural language processing problems, especially Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This approach di\ufb00ers from\nmore traditional methods in that while those require manually created features, deep neural\nnetworks obtain latent features from data [ 85]. Wang [ 93] utilizes a CNN model with text vector\nrepresentations combined with metadata features and obtains a best accuracy of 0.27 on a\nsix-label classi\ufb01cation task. Ruchansky et al. [ 76] has proposed a model that combines three\ndi\ufb00erent characteristics of fake news consumption, based on text, response, and source. They\nuse a RNN model that receives temporal data related to user engagement, \ufb01nd it is able to\nextract meaningful representations of fake news content and users, and obtain an accuracy of\n0.89 on a Twitter data set from [ 52]. Volkova et al. [ 91] build CNN and RNN models to classify\ntweets in a binary and in a four-label setting, using bag of words and word embeddings as text\nrepresentations combined with network and semantic features, and obtain 0.95 accuracy in the\nbinary classi\ufb01cation task.\nIn this chapter we have explored fundamental concepts in machine learning and natural\nlanguage processing that are at the foundation of our research into automatic fake news\nidenti\ufb01cation. Additionally, our literature review prompts a number of conclusions that help\nde\ufb01ne the course of this work. From the discussion of existing data sets, we \ufb01nd creating a\nnew data set with recently collected data helps to ensure that we obtain up-to-date and more\ncomplete information. Additionally, we discuss the importance of maintaining a data set that\nis representative of the real-world scenario of fake news distribution in social media. We have\nalso explored di\ufb00erent approaches to feature creation in the context of fake news identi\ufb01cation\nand their common categorization into content-based, social context-based, and network-based\nfeatures. Finally, we have seen common algorithms used for fake news classi\ufb01cation in di\ufb00erent\ncontexts\u2014from social media posts to news articles and an overview of the best results that have\n18 Chapter 2. Related Work\nbeen achieved with each. After exploring these fundamental concepts and a literature review, we\nproceed in the following chapters to detail our approach and discuss the results obtained.\nChapter 3\nThe Data\nSince the US elections are an event with global implications, we expected there would be many\nexamples of fake news dissemination around it, as was the case with the 2016 presidential election.\nFurthermore, the volume of fake news posts tends to increase during elections [ 31]. For that\nreason, in this research we opted to use the 2020 US presidential elections as a case study,\nspeci\ufb01cally with data posted on Twitter.\n3.1 Data Collection\nThe data was collected in two di\ufb00erent phases and approaches, to account for two of the research\nquestions.\nIn the \ufb01rst phase, we used keywords and selected accounts (from the main candidates and\ntheir parties) to collect data over a period encompassing approximately three months, from late\nSeptember to late December in 2020. The keyword search was based on a data set about the\n2016 United States presidential election published by the Harvard Dataverse Repository [ 49], and\n\ufb01ltered tweets that mentioned the main candidate names, their accounts, and election-related\nhashtags (#USelection and #election2020). Additionally, on the days surrounding the three main\ncandidate debates and the vice-president debate, the set of keywords, accounts, and hashtags\nwas expanded to include tweets related to these events as well. Listing 3.1 presents a sample\nquery used in the collection process.\n\u0003 \u0000\nUSelection OR election2020 OR election OR trump OR pence OR biden OR kamala OR\n@realDonaldTrump OR @joebiden OR @KamalaHarris OR @Mike_Pence OR\nfrom:realDonaldTrump OR from:Mike_Pence OR from:joebiden OR\nfrom:KamalaHarris lang:en\u0002 \u0001\nListing 3.1: One of the Twitter API queries used in data collection.\nWith the aim of assessing a tool that would suit our data collection needs, several tools were\n19\n20 Chapter 3. The Data\ninvestigated and compared (table 3.2). For the comparison, we looked for tools with varying\nvalues across a number of attributes, including the platform, search capabilities, result output\nformat, price, and maximum collection size, among others. In the end, the Netlytic tool was\nchosen due to its balance of ease of use, export capability, and ability to continuously run the\ntweet collection process. The collection with Netlytic was performed by means of the Twitter\nAPI, which throttles results at a maximum of 1,000 tweets per 15-minute interval, for up to\n10 simultaneous queries. The collection started on September 21st, 2020, and ran through\nDecember 27th, 2020, amounting to a total of 21,675,705 unique tweets, with an average of\n209,000 tweets per day. Figure 3.1 shows the variation of the number of collected tweets over\ntime, and table 3.1 presents some statistics about the tweets collected in 2020.\nOct\n2020Nov Dec\nPublication date0100000200000300000400000Number of tweetsFirst debateVP debateSecond debateThird debate\nElection day\nResults certified\nFigure 3.1: Number of tweets per day collected from September to December 2020.\nTable 3.1: Statistics about the data collected in 2020.\nDescription Value\nNumber of unique users 3,610,206\nNumber of veri\ufb01ed users 219,788\nNumber of unique posts 21,675,705\nNumber of retweets 7,624,259\nNumber of replies 6,021,714\nIn order to answer research question RQ2and assess whether the classi\ufb01cation model would\nbe able to generalize its results to temporally spaced data, the second phase of data collection\nwas performed on May 2021. For the second collection we did not use keywords, choosing instead\nto collect tweets from four reputable US and UK news sources and from three accounts known\nfor publishing fake news content. This was done in order to verify how well our solution was able\nto generalize to tweets gathered in a di\ufb00erent context, with content not necessarily related to the\ncontent the original model was trained on. The two reputable US news sources selected were The\nNew York Times and the Washington Post1, the two most frequent news sources on the 2020\ndata set. Due to the context of our 2020 collection being the US elections, no U.K. news outlets\n\ufb01gured among the most frequent sources.

The Data\nchosen due to their factual reputation and their focus on economic and business issues, enabling\nus to verify model applicability beyond its original context. The questionable outlets picked\nwere the three most frequent sources of fake news from the 2020 data set, namely The Gateway\nPundit (which by itself accounts for 48% of all fake news shared in that data set), The Daily\nMail (U.K.), and National File. The Gateway Pundit is a popular website known for publishing\nfalse information and conspiracy theories. It features in lists of fake news websites, such as\nOpenSources2and PolitiFact3, and its founder\u2019s account was suspended by Twitter on February\n6, 2021 due to posting misinformation about the 2020 US presidential election4. The Daily Mail\nis an established British tabloid, with the highest circulation among daily newspapers in the\nUnited Kingdom. It has been criticized for publishing sensationalist and inaccurate information,\nand has been banned as an unreliable source by Wikipedia. National File is a website founded in\n2019 that reports conspiracy and pseudoscience stories5. Its collaborators have been associated\nwith several known fake news websites, such as Breitbart, InfoWars, and The Gateway Pundit.\n3.2 Data Preparation\nAfter the data had been collected, several steps of cleaning and processing were necessary. Initially,\nthe data was exported from Netlytic in several CSV \ufb01les. Some of these contained errors that\nneeded to be manually handled, including malformed separation in CSV \ufb01elds, mismatch between\nheaders and data \ufb01elds, line ending inconsistencies, and invalid characters that were unable to be\nread by the sedutility or the Pandas library. These \ufb01les were then combined using Pandas into\na single data frame, at which point any duplicated tweets were removed. Also, since the Twitter\ndata provided by Netlytic had some limitations, omitting some data such as the \u201cveri\ufb01ed\u201d status\nof each Twitter user, for example, that data had to be complemented through what is called a\nhydration process. This process involves querying the Twitter API with the list of identi\ufb01ers for\nthe desired tweets, and have it return the complete publicly available data for each tweet, a task\nfor which we used the Hydrator desktop tool6. The additional data from this process was also\nincorporated into the Netlytic data, and formed the complete initial data set from 2020, which\namounted to a total of 21,675,705 unique tweets.\nSince this research involved performing several natural language processing (NLP) tasks to\nidentify linguistics attributes on the tweets content, the next step was selecting only tweets\nwritten in English. We also \ufb01ltered for only tweets with a minimum length of 100 characters\nand 20 words, values which were close to the median values from the beginning of the collection\nprocess (\ufb01gure 3.2). After these conditions were applied, the data set was then reduced from\n21,675,705 to 13,060,234 tweets.\n2https://github.com/OpenSourcesGroup/opensources\n3https://infogram.com/politifacts-fake-news-almanac-1gew2vjdxl912nj\n4As the @gatewaypundit account had been suspended prior to the 2021 data collection, tweets from the\npublication were collected through the query \u201cvia @gatewaypundit\u201d.\n5https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-\ufb01le\n6https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator\n3.2. Data Preparation 23\nFigure 3.2: Distribution of words from tweets collected for the \ufb01rst debate in 2020.\n3.2.1 Sentiment Analysis\nSentiment analysis is a task of natural language processing which aims to uncover the feelings and\nemotions contained in a piece of text. There are three main approaches to performing sentiment\nanalysis: lexicon, rule, and learning-based [ 18]. In the lexicon-based approach, a dictionary of\nwords orn-grams with their corresponding sentiment labels is used as the basis for detecting\nsentiment in text. The sentiments represented by these words are aggregated in some form, such\nas averaging, to compute the overall sentiment for the entire text. In order to help overcome\nsome of the shortcomings of this simple method, rules can also be used as an additional step.\nThese rules aim to enhance the identi\ufb01cation of sentiments by taking into account the order of\nco-occurrence of words. As an example, a rule for detecting negation can consider the presence\nof the word \u201cnot\u201d to reverse the sentiment of the succeeding words, therefore giving a positive\nsentiment to the expression \u201cnot bad\u201d. Another straightforward rule is considering the intensity\nof the sentiment, distinguishing di\ufb00erent sentiment values between \u201creally good\u201d and \u201cextremely\ngood\u201d, for example. Finally, the learning-based approach relies on machine learning models\ninstead of dictionaries and decision rules. In this approach, the system learns to distinguish what\ntokens represent di\ufb00erent sentiments based on previously labeled examples it is fed.\nWe performed sentiment analysis on the tweets using three di\ufb00erent Python libraries:\nTextBlob [ 50], VADER [ 39], and Stanza [ 70]. TextBlob is a library for processing textual\ndata, and includes rule-based sentiment analysis. Its main appeal is combining ease of use\nwith powerful functionality, based on the established NLTK and pattern libraries. VADER is a\nlexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool speci\ufb01cally attuned to sentiments expressed in\nsocial media, which makes it an interesting library to test for this project. Its desirable features\ninclude interpreting negations, slang, punctuation, and emoji when computing the sentiment\nof a document. Stanza is an NLP library maintained by the Stanford NLP Group, the team\nbehind the popular CoreNLP library. Unlike the other two libraries mentioned, Stanza uses\ndeep learning techniques for NLP tasks, and provides models trained on data sets which include\n24 Chapter 3. The Data\nTwitter posts for sentiment analysis.\nOne of the most elementary tasks in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given\npiece of text. Polarity is a measure that represents the sentiment of some text, and ranges\nfrom negative, to neutral, to positive. TextBlob and VADER provide a compound score, from\n-1 to 1, indicating how negative or how positive the input text is. In order to standardize the\nclassi\ufb01cation of positive, neutral, and negative text, we used the following typical threshold\nvalues [39]:\n\u2022positive : compound polarity \u22650.05;\n\u2022neutral: compound polarity >\u22120.05and compound polarity <0.05;\n\u2022negative : compound polarity \u2264\u22120.05.\nOn the other hand, Stanza outputs instead a categorical value of positive, neutral, or negative\nper sentence. In order to obtain a similar compound score, we assigned 1 to positive sentences,\n0 to neutral sentences, and -1 to negative sentences. These values were summed up and the\nresulting value was used with the thresholds shown above to arrive at the \ufb01nal polarity for the\nwhole tweet.\nThe result of the sentiment analysis was uneven, as shown in \ufb01gure 3.3. Stanza seems more\nlikely to classify tweets as negative, and classify few as neutral or positive. TextBlob and VADER\nboth have a high amount of positively-classi\ufb01ed tweets\u2014however, while VADER classi\ufb01es many\nas negative, TextBlob favors a neutral classi\ufb01cation. Overall, only 24.7% of tweets were classi\ufb01ed\nthe same by all libraries. Thus, to ensure consistency and to provide security that sentiment-based\nfeatures would re\ufb02ect the actual meaning contained in tweets, the 2020 data set was \ufb01ltered to\ntweets where the same polarity category was identi\ufb01ed by all three libraries, leaving 3,252,751\ntweets in the data set after this processing step.\n3.2.2 Named Entity Recognition\nBefore trying to distinguish what constitutes real and fabricated information (which is composed\nof facts), one question must be answered \ufb01rst: What is a fact? One simple answer is that a fact is\nsomething that occurs at a given time, somewhere, and with or to something or someone [ 21]. In\nother words, a fact should answer the questions of \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d. These answers\ncan be associated with named entities in the text, which are, simply put, real-world objects\nthat can be indicated by a proper name, and numeric expressions. They are classi\ufb01ed into\ndi\ufb00erent categories, including person, organization, location, and time [ 62], and therefore can\nhelp provide the aforementioned answers that characterize a fact. The complete list of 18 entity\ntypes commonly used for NER and their descriptions [96] is shown in table 3.3.\nThere are automated ways of extracting named entities from the text, in a sub-task of the\nInformation Extraction \ufb01eld called Named Entity Recognition (NER).

The\nmajor di\ufb00erence can be observed in the di\ufb00erent number of recognized entities of types PERSON\nand ORG. That disparity relates to classifying mentions of former US president Donald Trump.\nWhile spaCy had Trump recognized as a person almost as often as it recognized him as an\norganization, Stanza was more consistent, correctly identifying him as a person 94% of the time.\nFor the remaining types of entities, both libraries identi\ufb01ed a similar number of occurrences.\nWe also investigated how much consistency there was between the entities identi\ufb01ed by both\nlibraries. In order to measure that concordance, we used the Jaccard similarity coe\ufb03cient, de\ufb01ned\nas the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:\n3.2. Data Preparation 27\nFigure 3.6: Types of recognized entities on the 2020 data set.\nJ(A,B) =|A\u2229B|\n|A\u222aB|(3.1)\nFor each tweet, we considered the set of entities recognized by both the Stanza and spaCy\nlibraries, with any duplicate entities removed. Then, the Jaccard similarity coe\ufb03cient was\ncomputed to measure the similarity between those two sets. In the cases where no entities were\nrecognized by both libraries in a given tweet, they were considered to have elicited the same\nresults, and the Jaccard coe\ufb03cient was computed as 1. The distribution of the Jaccard coe\ufb03cient\nfor all tweets is shown in \ufb01gure 3.7. We can observe there is roughly as much agreement as there\nis disagreement in the results from these libraries. For approximately the same number of tweets,\nthere was both zero and total concordance between the entities recognized by the two libraries.\nAdditionally, for about that same number of tweets, only half of the total entities recognized\nwere equivalent.\nGiven this somewhat discordant output from both libraries, their results were compared and\nthe entities recognized by Stanza were considered more precise, since they provided more concise\n(as re\ufb02ected by the number of unique entities shown in table 3.4) and accurate entities on the\nevaluated samples. For that reason and to maintain consistency, the Stanza output was chosen\nas the source for named entities when deriving features from the data set.\n28 Chapter 3. The Data\nFigure 3.7: Similarity between Stanza and spaCy NER results on the 2020 data set.\n3.2.3 Data Labeling\nWhen considering whether to work with one of published data sets dedicated to fake news\ndetection or to create our own data set, we opted for the latter. Collecting data ourselves\nprovided more \ufb02exibility in how that data was obtained, enabling keyword-based collection\nor account-based collection in response to di\ufb00erent needs, as well as changing the context as\nnecessary.\nIn addition to that, performing the data collection ourselves allowed us to avoid as much as\npossible the data set decay problem (described in section 2.2.1), which is a common challenge\nto be faced in this \ufb01eld of study. Tweets are removed over time, either by their own authors\nor, more recently, by Twitter in its e\ufb00orts to counter the spread of fake news and misuse of its\nplatform7. Since Twitter terms of service restrict the redistribution of tweet content to third\nparties8, and only allow distributing data sets composed of identi\ufb01er codes, these data sets\nhave to be \u201chydrated\u201d to provide the complete data, which makes it important to work with\nrecently collected data in order to access as much of it as possible. Even in our 2020 data set, by\nthe end of December (approximately three months after the beginning of the data collection),\napproximately 19% of the tweets had already been deleted or came from subsequently suspended\naccounts.\nManually annotating tweets for the reliability of their contents is a massive undertaking with\nsubstantial e\ufb00ort and, in many cases, expert knowledge required in order to create a sizable data\nset. In this research we evaluated a manual labeling process. The \ufb01rst step in this process was\nsearching fact-checking websites such as PolitiFact and Snopes for validated information related\nto our data set context, the 2020 US presidential election and its candidates. Then we \ufb01ltered\nour data set based on keywords associated with that veri\ufb01ed information. Finally, we manually\nlabeled each tweet based on its contents and its stance regarding the veri\ufb01ed information. As\n7https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation\n8https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy\n3.2. Data Preparation 29\nexpected, this process proved too time-consuming and was dropped in favor of a systematic\napproach.\nFor the systematic labeling process, we considered an article to be fake at the level of the\npublisher, not of the article itself, as done in previous research [ 28,29,47]. To that end, we\nadopted a common approach to overcome the scale challenges, by leveraging a curated list of\nwebsites classi\ufb01ed according to the their trustworthiness to label tweets at the domain level,\nfollowing previous work [ 9,30,32]. Our process is detailed in the following steps and in the\ndiagram in \ufb01gure 3.8.\nLowVery Low2020 data setExtract tweets containing linksTweets with linksVery HighHighDomain factual reporting levelFake tweetsNon-fake tweetsMostly FactualMixed\n1\nFigure 3.8: Steps of the automatic labeling process.\nFirst, only tweets that contained links were selected. Then, the domains those links pointed\nto were compared against their level of factual reporting as determined by Media Bias Fact\nCheck (MBFC) [ 100]. MBFC is an independent fact-checking organization that classi\ufb01es news\noutlets in one of 6 levels of factual reporting, ranging from very low tovery high . Our criterion\nwas to consider tweets with links to websites classi\ufb01ed as very low orlowto be associated with\nquestionable content, while we considered tweets with links to websites classi\ufb01ed as highorvery\nhighto be associated with reliable content. If a tweet contained links both to websites classi\ufb01ed\nas reliable and to websites classi\ufb01ed as questionable, these tweets were removed from the data set\n(only 4 tweets needed to be removed based on this criterion). While MBFC is constantly working\nto update its database, in this research we worked with the set of 1,915 domains classi\ufb01ed as very\nlow,low,high, orvery high as of February, 2021. Figure 3.9 shows the distribution of domains\nbased on their factual reporting level as determined by MBFC, while \ufb01gure 3.10 shows the most\nfrequent domains contained in links in our data set.\nMany domains classi\ufb01ed by MBFC specify the fully quali\ufb01ed domain name, including a \u201cwww\u201d\nhostname pre\ufb01x (e.g. www.nbcnews.com). In order to identify as many tweets as possible with\nlinks to a domain\u2014and further increase the size of our labeled data set\u2014we had the option of\nremoving the \u201cwww\u201d pre\ufb01x, which would include links to subdomains within a classi\ufb01ed domain.\nHowever, we found that the assumption of factual reporting level could not be generally extended\nto subdomains. To illustrate with an example, MBFC classi\ufb01es the US House of Representatives\nwebsite (www.house.gov) with a very high factual reporting level. Nevertheless, removing the\n30 Chapter 3.

Consequently, to\navoid any potential inconsistencies, we opted to maintain the domain names exactly as speci\ufb01ed\nby MBFC, even if it resulted in a smaller labeled data set.\nThis approach allowed us to obtain a data set with 150,677 labeled tweets, described in table\n3.5. The imbalance seen in the classes winds up re\ufb02ecting the actual imbalance of these types of\nposts in the real world. Approximately 5% of tweets with links were associated with questionable\ncontent. Interestingly, a similar proportion was observed during the 2016 election [ 28] and also\non tweets collected after the 2016 election through 2019 [ 64], which further supports our labeling\nstrategy.\nThe evolution of the data set size with the application of the processing steps is shown in\n9https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/04/politics/k\ufb01le-marjorie-taylor-greene-history-of-conspiracies/\n3.3.

In the \ufb01rst data set, with keyword-based tweet collection\nfrom September to December 2020, the proportion of fake tweets was approximately 5% of the\nwhole data set. This is common to many real-world data sets and constitutes a problem to\nmany machine learning algorithms when attempting to learn a concept from an underrepresented\nclass [48]. An e\ufb00ective solution to overcome this issue is applying re-sampling techniques to\nchange the data distribution [ 10]. These techniques include two common approaches: removing\nexamples from the majority class until the desired class balance is achieved (undersampling), or\nconversely generating new examples for the minority class (oversampling), which can be done\nby simply replicating existing examples from the minority class or by synthesizing non-existing\nexamples for the minority class based on underlying distributions [ 44]. The most straightforward\ntypes of these approaches are random undersampling and random oversampling, where new\nexamples of the respective class are randomly removed or replicated. Another popular option for\noversampling is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), where a new example\nof the minority class is synthesized by interpolation with one of its nearest neighbors [15].\nEach of these techniques presents its own bene\ufb01ts and challenges. While performing random\nundersamplingcanpotentiallyremoveimportantexamplesfromthedataset\u2014thereforedecreasing\nclassi\ufb01cation performance\u2014random oversampling can lead to model over\ufb01tting, which in turn\nwill result in decreased performance [ 10,35]. We compared three re-sampling methods: random\nundersampling, random oversampling, and SMOTE. Out of those three approaches, random\nundersampling showed the most promising results in our initial experiments, therefore we chose\nTable 3.5: Number of labeled tweets according to the presence of links.\nLink domain Total Excluding retweets\nQuestionable 7,057 3,613\nReliable 143,620 37,702\n32 Chapter 3. The Data\nto perform random undersampling when needed to balance the class distribution in our \ufb01nal\ndata set. Indeed, random undersampling is generally considered one of the best approaches to\ntackle the issue of an underrepresented class [ 10,94]\u2014especially when such class is the one whose\nclassi\ufb01cation carries higher importance [ 41]. Additionally, we compared random oversampling\nand SMOTE with the performance from our undersampled \ufb01nal data set. The results obtained\nin those experiments with the oversampling methods are discussed in section 5.3.\nBefore extracting samples from the data set, an additional processing step was necessary.\nOur labeled data set contains many instances of retweets\u2014which are posts made by an user that\nreplicate the contents of other users\u2019 posts\u2014as shown in \ufb01gure 3.12. Since these retweets contain\nthe same text content as their original tweets, all retweets were removed from the data set before\nextracting the training set. If they had been kept, the features set would contain duplicated\nvalues for several instances of tweets on content-derived features, which would result in a higher\nweight being given to these values during model training. Additionally, if some of these retweets\nwere placed in the test set by chance, the model would have already been trained on instances\nwith the same feature values as these retweets, resulting in overestimating its performance on\ndata it has not seen before.\n0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000\nNumber of tweetsFalseTrueTweet related to fake newsRetweets in 2020 labeled data set\nOriginal tweet\nRetweet\nFigure 3.12: Comparison between original tweets and retweets in 2020 labeled data set.\nIn addition, since the 2020 data collection was mostly keyword-based, and the 2021 data\ncollection was account-based (targeting accounts known for publishing reliable or unreliable\ninformation), we observed a di\ufb00erence between the proportion of fake tweets in each data set.\nFigure 3.13 shows the proportion di\ufb00erence between those two data sets (after retweet removal).\nDue to its more general collection process, the proportion of approximately 5% in the 2020 data\nset was found to be more representative of the general data distribution in Twitter, in addition\nto being consistent with observations in other contexts, as discussed in section 3.2.3.\nFor this research, we created a number of subsets with several goals. As discussed, the \ufb01rst\nstep was removing all retweets from the 2020 data set, generating subset NoRT. Then, with\nrandom undersampling, a balanced sample S1was taken from NoRT. It is composed of 6,000\ntweets, with an equal number of tweets from each class, and its main purpose is to serve as\n3.3. Data Samples 33\nKeyword-based collection2020\nNon-fake\nFake\nAccount-based collection2021\nFigure 3.13: Di\ufb00erence in fake news proportion in 2020 and 2021 data sets.\nthe training set for our model. For testing purposes, we created sample T1, composed of 2,000\ntweets from NoRT. Examples for T1were randomly selected with no re-sampling, in order to\npreserve the original class distribution and represent as closely as possible new data the model\nwould encounter in a real-world application [ 12]. And, given their use as training and test sets,\nS1andT1are disjoint. Finally, from NoRT, sampleO1was also extracted, with the following\nproperties:\nO1 =NoRT\\T1 (3.2)\nS1\u2282O1 (3.3)\nSince, due to undersampling, many examples were removed from NoRTto generate training\nsetS1, the purpose of O1was to include these extra potentially useful examples when computing\nsummaries and analyzing the data set during feature engineering. Test set T1was removed when\ncreatingO1to avoid any data leakage [ 43]\u2014which would have happened had we derived any\nsummaries or statistics using examples from T1\u2014and to prevent overestimating performance on\nnew data in a production environment.\nIn addition to test set T1, three other sets A1,A2, andA3were used for testing purposes.\nA1andA3included examples from the May 2021 data set, and their primary goal was to assess\nhow well the classi\ufb01cation model could generalize its results to data temporally spaced from\nthe data the model was trained on. Given the di\ufb00erent class distribution in the 2021 data set\n(cf. \ufb01gure 3.13), test sets A1andA3were created preserving the more representative class\ndistribution found in the 2020 data set. Test set A2includes retweets of tweets that belong\nto training set S1, with the goal of assessing our expectation that classi\ufb01cation performance is\nhigher\u2014though potentially unrealistic for new data\u2014when classifying retweets of tweets already\nseen by the model during training.\nNo test sets contain any tweet or any retweet of a tweet from training set S1. The data sets\ncreated for this work are summarized in table 3.6, and their creation process is presented in\n\ufb01gure 3.14.\n34 Chapter 3.

In other words, we only need a tweet and\nits direct data to classify it, instead of relying on the tweet author\u2019s other posts, on the posts of\nits network of neighbors, or on the content from replies. This streamlines the process of deriving\nfeatures for use in classi\ufb01cation and helps with scalability.\nThis chapter details our feature engineering process and the reasoning behind our decisions.\n4.1 Features\nOnce the data were gathered, processed, and labeled, we went through the process of deriving\nfeatures to be used in our classi\ufb01cation model. Since our research question RQ3is to investigate\nthe contribution of named entities and emotion recognition to the identi\ufb01cation of fake news, the\nfeatures were split into two groups: a baseline set of features, and an \u201cextended\u201d set, containing\nall features present on the baseline set plus features based on named entities and emotions.\n4.1.1 Baseline Features\nThe baseline features can be further divided into three main groups: metadata from the author\npro\ufb01le, metadata from the tweet itself, and linguistic attributes derived from the tweet content.\nThese features are summarized in table 4.1.\nPrevious research [ 84] has shown that there is a correlation between user pro\ufb01les on Twitter\nand fake news consumption, with several attributes from a user\u2019s pro\ufb01le that have the potential\nto indicate if these users are more likely to access and believe in fake news stories. Therefore, in\nthis research we implemented some features directly derived from a tweet author\u2019s pro\ufb01le, as\ndetailed in table 4.1. The values for each feature of this group, such as the number of posts by\n35\n36 Chapter 4.

As we have discussed, with the goal of eliciting a strong emotional response, a\ntweet with fake news may employ a picture or video to grab the reader\u2019s attention [ 14]. Therefore\nwe used a Boolean feature to indicate the presence or not of media (image or video) in the tweet.\nAdditionally, since tweet replication plays a big part in fake news dissemination [ 88], we also\nused as features the number of times the tweet was retweeted (if any), and also a \ufb02ag indicating\nwhether the tweet itself is a retweet. Finally, in the tweet metadata group, we also used the\nnumber of times a tweet as marked as favorite [84].\nThe third group contains features derived from the tweet content. With this group the\naim was to leverage the actual textual content of the tweet, and derive features representing\nlinguistic attributes typical of fake news text that could contribute to classifying a tweet. These\nare described in detail in the following paragraphs.\n4.1. Features 37\nAs was the case with some features in the tweet metadata group, with the text content we\naimed to leverage the fact that fake news attempt to generate a strong emotional response in\nthe reader. With the goal of quantifying some of the means by which that could be achieved, a\nnumber of features were created. Feature proportion_all_caps represents the proportion of words\nin the tweet body that are written in all capital letters, which are a prominent attribute for many\nfake news article titles [ 38,89]. These are meant to draw the reader\u2019s attention and convey the\ntext in an exaggerated and sensationalist tone. In this research we took an additional step and\ncomputed that proportion excluding usernames, hashtags, and named entities recognized by the\nNER task. This last measure was intended to exclude from the computation words and acronyms\n(e.g. US, GOP, DNC) that are written in capital letters but have no underlying sensationalist\nintention, leaving only words that would not necessarily have to be written completely in capital\nletters.\nAnother stylistic feature in the text that represents in\ufb02ated emotions is the use of exclamation\npoints, particularly when they are employed in excess [ 99]. Therefore we included as a feature the\nnumber of exclamation points contained in the tweet. In that vein, we also considered the number\nof adverbs and adjectives present in the tweet text [ 75,83]. Adverbs are description words that\nare auxiliary to verbs, and are capable of adding urgency or other emotions to the verbs they\ndescribe, contributing to the aforementioned sensationalism in the text [ 72,78]. Adjectives are\nmodi\ufb01er words for nouns, and can similarly increase the level of expressiveness in a text [ 59]. As\ndone for the proportion_all_caps feature, when computing the number of adverbs and adjectives,\nwe also excluded username mentions and hashtags. The number of adverbs and adjectives was\nalso computed as a proportion. This gives more weight to these classes of words when they are\nmore prominent in the text, in an attempt to capture the underlying stylistic structure and\nquantify said expressiveness of the text potentially better than a simple count would [101].\nPreviousresearch[ 6]hasshownthatsomeemotions\u2014particularlyanger, awe,andanxiety\u2014can\nincrease the likelihood of an article or post being shared. Conversely, the same work concluded\nthat the more positive a piece of content is, bigger are the chances of it being shared. With the\naim of quantifying and measuring these attributes, the polarity (discussed in section 3.2.1) of a\ntweet was used as a feature. After our comparison between three sentiment analysis libraries, we\nopted to use for the feature the results provided by the VADER library, since it was created by\nspeci\ufb01cally evaluating sentiments from social media posts, besides presenting balanced results in\nour analysis.\nIn addition, as another potential indicator of negative emotions, we used a Boolean \ufb02ag\nto mark the presence of any profanity or o\ufb00ensive content in the tweet. Similarly to what we\ndid with sentiment analysis, we compared three di\ufb00erent libraries, with two approaches for\nautomatically detecting profanity: profanity-check1, profanity\ufb01lter2, and better_profanity3. The\nprofanity-check library employs a machine learning-based approach. It checks for profanity using\n1https://github.com/vzhou842/profanity-check\n2https://github.com/areebbeigh/profanity\ufb01lter\n3https://github.com/snguyenthanh/better_profanity\n38 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\na SVM model trained on 200,000 human-labeled data samples containing profanity and o\ufb00ensive\ntext content. The other two libraries are based on a word list approach, using a hard-coded list of\no\ufb00ensive words. The profanity\ufb01lter library utilizes a word list containing approximately 400 words,\nwhile the list used by better_profanity has over 900 words. Additionally, better_profanity tries\nto catch modi\ufb01ed spellings of its word list using common changes from \u201cleetspeak\u201d4, such as\nreplacing the letter \u201ca\u201d with \u201c4\u201d or \u201co\u201d with \u201c0\u201d. For the comparison, we extracted a random\nsample of 1,000 tweets from the 2020 data set and ran it through all three libraries. The number\nof tweets with profanity or o\ufb00ensive content is shown in \ufb01gure 4.1. Between the two libraries\nthat employ the word list approach, better_profanity detected almost twice as many tweets\nas profanity\ufb01lter. Since the former\u2019s word list is over twice as large as the latter\u2019s, that result\nappears reasonable. Also, 94% of the tweets \ufb02agged by profanity\ufb01lter were also \ufb02agged by\nbetter_profanity. When analysing some entries identi\ufb01ed only by better_profanity, those results\nincluded a number of seemingly innocuous sentences, indicating that library is more sensitive\nthan the others. When considering the concordance between the libraries, we observed that\n27 tweets were \ufb02agged by all the libraries, which shows the level of disparity in the results.\nRegarding performance, there was a sizable di\ufb00erence, with profanity-check performing at least\nthree orders of magnitude faster than the other libraries, in our benchmark of 7 runs for each\nlibrary. That is mainly due to the vectorized operations in the scikit-learn library it uses for its\nclassi\ufb01cation model. For that reason, profanity-check was chosen and applied to the whole data\nset in order to compute the feature values.\n0 20 40 60 80\nNumber of tweets with profanityprofanity-checkbetter_profanityprofanityfilterLibraryProfanity detection in a sample of 1,000 tweets\nFigure 4.1: Comparison between profanity detection libraries.\nOn Twitter, a user can call the attention of another user by mentioning their username in a\npost, which results in a noti\ufb01cation being sent to the desired user. Di\ufb00erences have been observed\nbetween the number of username mentions in messages from known fake news spreaders and in\nmessages from regular users [ 90]. We implemented two features for comparison: the absolute\ncount of username mentions, and the proportion of username mentions to the number of words\nin a tweet (excluding any links when computing the proportion).\n4https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet\n4.1. Features 39\n4.1.2 Text Representation\nSince the main portion of our data set is text-based, namely the content of the tweets themselves,\nbeing able to leverage the content information when classifying tweets could potentially lead to\nbetter overall results. However, as discussed in section 2.1.2, we cannot directly use raw text\ndata with many classi\ufb01cation algorithms. It is necessary \ufb01rst to apply transformations to textual\ndata in order to obtain a numerical representation suitable for use as input to those algorithms.\nBefore applying any of the techniques mentioned in section 2.1.2 to obtain a numerical\nrepresentation of text, several pre-processing steps were performed. First, all text was converted\nto lower case, and all links were removed. Then, we also removed any usernames mentioned in\nthe tweet. This step is particularly important in this scenario due to our data labeling process\n(described in section 3.2.3). Since that process is based on the information publisher\u2019s level\nof factual reporting, in case that publisher is mentioned as a username, the presence of that\nspeci\ufb01c token could be highly correlated to the target label, and result in a mistakenly optimistic\nclassi\ufb01cation performance. Additionally, all hashtags were converted to words by removing the\n\u201c#\u201d character. Then, lemmatization was applied using the spaCy library to derive the lemma for\neach word. Finally, in order to maintain only words capable of conveying meaningful information,\nwe removed all stop words based on spaCy\u2019s integrated list of English stop words.\nIn order to leverage the tweet content as features for use in classi\ufb01cation purposes, in this\nwork we compared di\ufb00erent versions of all of these approaches to represent the tweet text as\nfeature vectors, summarized in table 4.2. Using the bag of words with unigrams as tokens, we\ncomputed three di\ufb00erent feature vectors for comparison: using token counts, using a Boolean\nvalue to indicate whether the token is present in document, and weighing each token using\nTF-IDF. In addition to these representations, we also constructed a bag of unigrams and a bag\nof bigrams. The two resulting matrices were combined to create a feature vector of unigram and\nbigram counts for each document. Finally, the last experiment with the bag of words approach\nconsisted of employing character n-grams, instead of n-grams composed of words. In a bag of\nunigrams, any misspellings or variations are considered completely di\ufb00erent tokens. By using\ncharactern-grams, we can attempt to circumvent that limitation, so that the feature vectors\ngenerated for misspelled words are more similar to the vectors for the correct words than if we\nwere using a bag of words. Since the quality and register of text in Twitter is very diverse, and\nword misspellings and variations are common, we decided to experiment with this approach\nfor representing tweets. The character 2-grams were composed only of characters from a single\nword\u2014no character 2-grams were generated with characters from two di\ufb00erent words\u2014padded\nwith space when necessary.\nIn addition to the bag of words approach, we also employed two di\ufb00erent applications of word\nembeddings. We used pre-trained 300-dimension word embeddings from the en_core_web_lg\nspaCy model, which contains 685,000 unique GloVe [ 66] vectors trained on the Common Crawl5\ncorpus, a large data set containing petabytes of web data collected since 2008. In order to\n5http://commoncrawl.org\n40 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\nrepresent the whole tweet text as a \ufb01xed-size 300-dimension feature vector for use with the\nselected algorithms, we employed a simple yet e\ufb00ective approach that has been widely used\nin other works [ 16,19,97]: aggregating each word vector in the tweet by computing their\ncoordinate-wise mean and using the resulting vector as features. Additionally, we also computed\nthe coordinate-wise minimum, mean, and maximum values for each word vector, concatenated\nall three resulting vectors, and used the \ufb01nal 900-dimension vector as features.\nTable 4.2: Approaches compared for representing text as feature vectors.\nRepresentation type Description\nUnigram counts Bag of unigrams using token counts as values.\nUnigram Boolean \ufb02ag Bag of unigrams using a Boolean \ufb02ag to indicate token\npresence.\nUnigram TF-IDF Weighted bag of unigrams using TF-IDF term weighting.\nUnigram and bigram counts Combination of bag of unigrams and bag of bigrams using\ntoken counts as values.\nCharacter bigram counts Bag of character 2-grams token counts as values.\nMean word embeddings Coordinate-wise mean of word vectors.\nMinimum, mean, maximum\nword embeddingsConcatenation of coordinate-wise minimum, mean, and\nmaximum value of word vectors.\nIn order to estimate which approach yields better results for our classi\ufb01cation purposes, we\ntested them using two commonly used algorithms for text classi\ufb01cation: Naive Bayes and Support\nVector Machines (SVMs). Using each text representation approach, we computed feature vectors\nfor the tweets in S1. Then, using 5-fold cross validation, we \ufb01tted and evaluated a Naive Bayes\nmodel and an SVM model with linear kernel using only each feature matrix as inputs. The\naverage F1-scores obtained in the cross validation process are displayed in table 4.3. The best\nresults were obtained using the feature vector with unigram and bigram counts, with a very\nclose performance from the bag of unigrams using TF-IDF weighting. Considering only the text\ncontent was used as input in this experiment, the overall results are quite reasonable and suggest\nthe text does convey information that helps distinguish between tweets associated with reliable\nversus questionable content.\nTable 4.3: Cross validation F1-scores (mean and std. deviation) for classifying tweets from S1.\nRepresentation type Naive Bayes SVM\nUnigram counts 0.733 (0.007) 0.788 (0.013)\nUnigram Boolean \ufb02ag 0.733 (0.006) 0.794 (0.013)\nUnigram TF-IDF 0.726 (0.007) 0.812 (0.013)\nUnigram and bigram counts 0.772 (0.008) 0.813 (0.015)\nCharacter bigram counts 0.669 (0.003) 0.775 (0.005)\nMean word embeddings 0.700 (0.020) 0.761 (0.017)\nMinimum, mean, maximum word\nembeddings0.736 (0.014) 0.755 (0.015)\n4.1. Features 41\nBased on the results obtained from this experiment, we chose to use the feature vector from\nthe bags of unigrams and bigrams as the basis for a new feature. This is based on the stacking\nmethod of ensemble models, and the main idea is to use the predictions made by the SVM\ntrained on the chosen feature vector as an additional feature, called txt_vector_pred , for training\nthe \ufb01nal model. This additional feature was computed as follows: First, the \ufb01ve classi\ufb01ers\nresulting from the 5-fold cross validation in S1were used to make out-of-sample predictions\nfor each of the \ufb01ve respective test folds. These were used as the txt_vector_pred values forS1.\nAdditionally, for each test set ( T1,A1,A2, andA3), the predictions were made using the same 5\nclassi\ufb01ers trained on the S1cross validation, and their predictions were averaged to generate\nthetxt_vector_pred feature values for the test sets. This process is summarized in \ufb01gure 4.2.\nWe experimented with two types of values for this feature: the real probability output by the\nSVM model, and converting the probability into the actual class prediction (True or False) after\nchoosing an optimal threshold in cross validation.\nModel 1TrainingTestDivide into 5 folds for cross validationS1Model 1Fit models on training partitionsModel 2Model 3Model 4Model 5Pred. test 1Make predictions for each test foldPred. test 2Pred. test 3Pred. test 4Pred. test 5txt_vector_pred values for S1T1\nModel 3Model 2Model 4Model 5Predictions from model 1Predictions from model 2Predictions from model 3Predictions from model 4Predictions from model 5Make predictions for whole test set using each model\ntxt_vector_pred values for T1Average predictionsAverage predictions from each model\n1\nFigure 4.2: Obtaining feature values from text representation using model stacking.\n4.1.3 Named Entity Recognition\nIn order to try to answer research question RQ3, several features based on the named entities\nidenti\ufb01ed in the tweets text were implemented.\nHorne and Adali have observed that titles for fake news articles tend to use more proper\nnouns than regular articles [ 38]. The identi\ufb01cation of these proper nouns is one of the goals of\nnamed entity recognition. In addition, given the short nature of text in tweets\u2014with its 140 or,\nmore recently, 280-character limitation\u2014it bears resemblance to the structure of article titles [ 79].\nTherefore, we attempted to leverage those insights by computing the number of mentions to\n42 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\neach of the 18 named entity types (cf. table 3.3) in each tweet. In other words, the number of\noccurrences of each entity type in a tweet was used as a feature for that tweet, totaling a set\nof 18 features. For comparison, instead of the number of entity mentions, we also created an\nadditional set of 18 Boolean features indicating whether an entity type was present or not in a\ntweet.\nGiven that 92% of the named entities identi\ufb01ed belong to 6 of the 18 types (person,\norganization, geopolitical entity, date, cardinal, and nationalities or religious or political groups),\nthose matrices of 18 features are somewhat sparse, containing many zero values. In addition to\nthat, with the goal of combining the characterization of fact as something capable of answering\nthe questions of \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d (as described in section 3.2.2) with the identi\ufb01cation\nof a fact in a tweet, we combined the 18 named entity types into \ufb01ve categories: who,where,\nwhen,quantity, andother, as detailed in table 4.4. This helped indicate whether the tweets\ncontained the information needed to characterize a fact. This grouping also helped reduce feature\ndimensionality by combining the original 18 entity types into 5 di\ufb00erent categories.\nTable 4.4: Grouping of entity types into groups.\nEntity group Entity type\nWho ORGANIZATION, PERSON\nWhen DATE, TIME\nWhere EVENT, GPE (Geopolitical entity), LOCATION\nQuantity CARDINAL, ORDINAL, PERCENT, QUANTITY\nOther FACILITY, LANGUAGE, LAW, MONEY, NORP\n(Nationalities or religious or political groups), PRODUCT,\nWORK OF ART\nWe further analysed the data in search of additional properties related to named entity\nrecognition that could aid in distinguishing between fake and non-fake tweets. For instance, we\ncompared the distribution of fake and non-fake tweets that contain all three \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d\nand \u201cwhen\u201d entity types, under our assumption that a mention to these entities means a likely\ndiscussionofafact(fakeorotherwise). However,nomeaningfuldi\ufb00erencewasfound\u2014approximately\n92% of tweets contain those three types of entities, regardless of whether they are fake or not.\nTherefore we concluded reliable tweets are as likely to mention \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d as\nnon-fake tweets.\nWe also compared all entity type distributions between fake and non-fake tweets. Most did\nnot exhibit a marked di\ufb00erence, except for mentions to the ORG entity type, which was most\nprominent in non-fake tweets. Figure 4.3 shows the entity types for which we observed the biggest\ndi\ufb00erence in distributions.\nInvestigating further the relationship between mentions to organizations in fake and non-fake\ntweets, we compared them to person mentions\u2014the most common entity type\u2014by creating\ncontingency tables for ORG versus PERSON mentions for both fake and non-fake tweets. By\n4.1. Features 43\nORG WORK OF ART NORP\nEntity type024681012Number of entities per tweetNon-fake\nFake\nFigure 4.3: Comparison between distribution of entity types.\nanalyzing those tables we found an additional relation to mentions of persons, as shown in\ntable 4.5. In addition to observing that fake tweets are less likely to mention organizations, we\nfound they also favor mentions of persons with no accompanying mention to organizations. In\nother words, this \ufb01nding suggests a tweet is more likely to be fake if it contains mentions to\npersons but no mention to organizations. This led to creating two features in an attempt to\nquantify this relationship: has_PERSON_no_ORG andPERSON_minus_ORG . As their names\nimply,has_PERSON_no_ORG is a Boolean feature with a True value in case a tweet mentions\na PERSON entity but not an ORG entity, and False otherwise. For PERSON_minus_ORG\nwe computed the di\ufb00erence between the number of PERSON entity mentions and ORG entity\nmentions, attempting to take the \ufb01nding described in table 4.5 one step further and quantify\nnot only the presence or absence of an entity, but also the degree to which one type of entity is\nfavored over the other in the text.\nTable 4.5: Relationship between mentions to ORG and PERSON entities.\nFake Non-Fake\nTweet contains ORG 38% 52%\nTweet contains PERSON but not ORG 46% 32%\nWe also observed a possible relation in the repetition of entity types, where tweets associated\nwith fake news content potentially made repeated mentions to the same entity type per tweet.\nIn order to quantify the variability of the entity set contained in each tweet, the entity type\nentropy was computed. We used the Shannon entropy [ 81] with a logarithm base of 2, calculated\nas follows:\nH/prime=\u2212E/summationdisplay\ni=1pilog2pi (4.1)\nIn the formula above, Eis the number of unique entity types recognized in the tweet, and\nthe probabilities piused in the calculation were computed empirically and individually for the\nentities identi\ufb01ed in each tweet. For example, let us suppose in a given tweet three entities were\n44 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\nidenti\ufb01ed, with respective types: ORG, PERSON, ORG. Then we used their proportions and\nconsidered the probability of an entity of type ORG to be 2/3, and of PERSON to be 1/3.\n4.1.4 Emotion Recognition\nIn addition to named entity recognition, we investigated the application of emotion recognition\nto fake news identi\ufb01cation. Our goal was twofold: \ufb01rst, to investigate if any emotions were more\nprevalent on tweets associated with fake news than with reliable content, and also to investigate\nif there were any sequences of emotions typical of one of those classes.\nTo compute the emotions, we used the NRCLex6Python library. The library makes use\nof the National Research Council Canada (NRC) word-emotion association lexicon [ 58], which\ncontains associations of words with eight emotions ( anger,anticipation ,disgust,fear,joy,sadness,\nsurprise, andtrust) and two sentiments ( negative andpositive). This lexicon was manually\nannotated by crowdsourcing, and each word can be associated with multiple emotions. On top\nof the 10,000 words in the NRC lexicon, the NRCLex library uses NLTK WordNet synonyms to\nexpand the volume to a total of 27,000 words.\nBefore computing the emotions, several pre-processing steps were performed in each tweet,\nsimilarly to what was described for text representation in section 4.1.2. First, since NRCLex\ncontent is in lower case letters, the text in all tweets was converted to lower case. Then, any links\nwere removed, and hashtags were converted to words by removing the leading \u201c#\u201d character.\nSince the many uses of hashtags include expressing emotions [ 13], removing the \u201c#\u201d character\nwas necessary to allow the resulting word to be analyzed and categorized by NRCLex. The\nnext step was lemmatizing the text, extracting the lemma for each word. Since NRCLex uses\na dictionary-based approach to matching words to emotions, this step was important in order\nto obtain as many matches as possible. A \ufb01nal step of pre-processing, needed in this speci\ufb01c\ncase study, was removing the word \u201cTrump\u201d from the tweets. Due to the context of our case\nstudy and data collection process, that word, referring to former US president Donald Trump, is\nvery common in the data set, appearing in 62% of tweets in O1. That proper noun is neutral\nand indicates no emotion, however it is mistakenly recognized as the verb \u201cto trump\u201d by the\nNRCLex library, resulting in a misleading prevalence of the \u201csurprise\u201d a\ufb00ect associated with that\nword in the emotion lexicon.\nThe computed emotions were used as the basis for a number of features, which are discussed\nin the following sections.\n4.1.4.1 Emotions per Tweet\nEach word represents a number of emotions. For each emotion, we computed its proportion among\nall emotion indicators that were recognized. For example, let us suppose a sentence contains\n6https://github.com/metalcorebear/NRCLex\n4.1. Features 45\ntwo words with which emotions were associated: \u201ccommitted\u201d (emotion trust), and \u201cforesight\u201d\n(emotions trustandanticipation ). In that sentence, 3 emotion indicators were recognized in total,\nwith a proportion of 2/3oftrustand1/3ofanticipation . These would be the emotion proportion\nfeature values for this hypothetical sentence (with the proportion of the remaining emotions set\nto zero). We observed di\ufb00erences between the distribution of emotion proportions for fake tweets\nand reliable tweets (cf. \ufb01gure 4.4), therefore those proportions were used as features.\nfear anger trust surprise sadness\nEmotion0.00.10.20.30.40.5ProportionNon-fake\nFake\npositive negative disgust joy anticipation\nEmotion0.00.10.20.30.4ProportionNon-fake\nFake\nFigure 4.4: Frequency distribution of di\ufb00erent emotions in the O1data set.\nWe also used the raw emotion count in each tweet. We de\ufb01ne raw emotion count as how\nmany times in total any given emotion was recognized in the text. To illustrate with an example,\na tweet containing 3 words indicating fearand 2 words indicating angerhas a raw emotion count\nof 5. Since words can convey more than one emotion at once, this value not only represents how\nemotionally charged a tweet is, but it also helps capture the intensity of emotions contained in a\ntweet. This is desirable because, as previously discussed in chapter 1, in\ufb02ated emotions are one of\nthe many methods fake news authors use to increase the likelihood of their content being shared.\nIn addition to the number of emotions, we also computed the number of emotion-carrying words\nfor each tweet. Figure 4.5 shows the most common emotions based on the number of words that\n46 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\nrepresent them in the O1data set. When comparing the distribution of raw emotion counts of\nfake and non-fake tweets, tweets associated with reliable content surprisingly displayed a larger\nmedian value both of raw emotion counts and of the number of emotion-carrying words, as shown\nin \ufb01gure 4.6. This is unexpected since, as we have just discussed, fake news are often designed to\nelicit a strong emotional response in the reader.\n0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000\nNumber of wordssurprisejoydisgustanticipationsadnessangerfeartrustEmotion\nFigure 4.5: General prevalence of emotions in the O1data set.\nNon-fake Fake051015202530Raw emotion count\nNon-fake Fake024681012Number of emotion words\nFigure 4.6: Number of emotions in fake and non-fake tweets.\n4.1.4.2 Emotion n-grams\nThe in\ufb02uence of the sequence of prevalent emotions in a tweet was also investigated in a number\nof experiments. For each sentence, the most frequent emotion was computed, resulting in a\nsequence of prevailing emotions in a tweet. Then, sequences analogous to n-grams were extracted,\nwhere each prevalent emotion represents one item in the sequence. Due to the short length\nof text in tweets, these sequences were limited to bigrams and trigrams of emotions. These\n4.1. Features 47\nsequences represent the \ufb02ow of emotions through a piece of text, more precisely between one\nsentence and the next in the case of bigrams. In case there were any ties, where more than one\nemotion was found to be prevalent in a sentence, these were combined in a \u201ccomposite\u201d emotion.\nFor example, in case a sentence contained the emotions fearandsadnesswith equal frequency,\nthese were combined into fear_sadness . These composite emotions were limited to a maximum\nof three single emotions. When more than three emotions were the most frequent in a sentence,\nwe considered it was not possible to systematically determine the actual prevalent emotion in\nthat sentence and the sentence was ignored.\nThen-grams were identi\ufb01ed as tuples of emotions. To illustrate with an example, consider\nthe tweet shown in \ufb01gure 4.7, composed of three sentences. The \ufb01rst sentence was classi\ufb01ed with\na prevalent emotion of surprise, the second sentence with a prevalent emotion of anticipation , and\nthe third, anger. In that case, the tweet contains two corresponding emotion bigrams, identi\ufb01ed\nas (surprise,anticipation ) and (anticipation ,anger).\nBREAKING!#NYTimes edit board member @jessewegman discovers something called the \"#ElectoralCollege\"!Which didn\u2019t seem to give #Obama too much trouble. #politics #Constitution #FactsMatter #history #Election2020Sentence 1Sentence 2Sentence 3\nsurpriseanticipationangersurprise \u2192 anticipationanticipation \u2192 angerExtract prominent emotionCombine into emotion n-gram\n1\nFigure 4.7: Extracting emotion bigrams from a tweet.\nWith the goal of identifying which n-grams, if any, are typical of fake or non-fake tweets, the\n20 most frequent n-grams were computed for each of those classes in O1, as shown in \ufb01gure 4.8.\nOut of the top bigrams for each class, in many cases there was no overlap in the most frequent\nn-grams in fake and non-fake tweets. These were considered typical of the respective class. In\ncase the frequent n-grams for fake and non-fake tweets overlapped, n-grams were considered\ntypical if they were at least 25% more frequent in one class versus the other.\nDue to the short length in tweets, trigrams were usually infrequent and for that reason\ndeemed not to be representative of any class, so most of the analysis focused on bigrams.\nThis process resulted in two sets: bigrams considered typical of fake tweets and, conversely,\nbigrams typical of non-fake tweets (displayed in table 4.6). The fake bigrams set included\n7 bigrams, while the non-fake set included 12 bigrams. For each tweet, we counted how many of\nits bigrams belonged to the fake and non-fake bigrams sets, and these two amounts were used as\nextended features.\n48 Chapter 4.

As displayed in \ufb01gure 4.9,\nthe most common prevailing emotions in sentences, as identi\ufb01ed by the NRCLex library, are\npositiveandnegative. However, these emotions are more general, and frequently appear along\nother, more \ufb01ne-grained, emotions. Therefore, their high frequency might obscure a higher\ngranularity of emotions that could, in turn, lead to identifying a larger number of n-grams. In\norder to evaluate these modi\ufb01ed features and compare them against the original emotion bigrams\nobtained, we ran an experiment with two Random Forest models with the S1data set as input\nand 5-fold cross-validation. Both used the baseline features, together with the respective version\nof the emotion bigrams we have just described. The chosen metric for comparison was the\nF1-score. Since the model with all emotions, including positiveandnegative, provided better\n4.1.

When analyzing why it displayed such a\nprominent dominance, we found that most words associated with trustare in fact related to the\nelection process (e.g. vote, ballot), or to o\ufb03cial authorities (e.g. president, senate). As our main\ndata set relates to the US elections, that behavior is to be expected, and somewhat diminishes\n50 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\nthe level of information conveyed by identifying the emotion trust, in a manner analogous to stop\nwords in NLP. Therefore, we experimented with a di\ufb00erent approach to computing the frequent\nbigrams, this time ignoring not only positiveandnegative, but also trust. Again we compared this\nversion of the emotion bigram features with the initial version, using the same experimental setup\nwe described in the above paragraph. Even though this version led to identifying more typical\nbigrams, the result from the classi\ufb01cation model was similar to the one previously obtained\nabove, showing no improvement over the initial version of these features.\nNext, in an attempt to identify more typical bigrams, we reduced the 8 basic emotions used\nin the NRCLex lexicon into a di\ufb00erent set of 6 basic emotions, proposed by Ekman [ 20]. For this\nexperiment, surprise was converted into fear, anddisgustwas converted into anger. In case a\nword already represented both emotions, we ignored the former and kept only the latter emotion\n(i.e.fearoranger), so as not to increase the emotion weight when computing their frequency.\nAs with the previous experiment, no signi\ufb01cant improvement in the results were obtained, so we\ndecided to keep all 8 original emotions.\nWe also explored converting emojis into natural language, in an attempt to increase the\nnumber of words capable of expressing emotions in a tweet. However, this experiment did\nnot result in a substantial change in the number of typical bigrams identi\ufb01ed or in the \ufb01nal\nclassi\ufb01cation metric.\nFinally, we investigated expanding the initial emotion n-grams by incorporating a neutral\nemotion. While in the initial version, we ignored the sentences where no dominant emotion was\nidenti\ufb01ed, in this experiment we considered their dominant emotion to be neutral. As a result,\nthe top recognized emotion was neutral, being approximately three times as frequent as the next\nmost frequent emotion, negative, and the most common bigram was ( neutral,neutral)\u2014with a\nfrequency about two times higher in fake versus non-fake tweets. In this experiment, there was\na decrease in the classi\ufb01cation metric, so the inclusion of the neutralemotion was not taken\nfurther.\nAfter completing all the experiments described above, we decided to adopt the \ufb01rst version\nof the emotion bigrams (described in table 4.6), using as features the number of typical fake\nand non-fake bigrams contained in each tweet. This version maintains the complete emotion\nrecognition provided by the NRCLex library, and provided the best results in our classi\ufb01cation\nexperiments.\n4.1.5 Feature Selection\nAfter all features were computed, we proceeded to selecting which features would be actually\nused in the \ufb01nal models. This is an important step as having highly correlated or redundant\nfeatures in the data set can actually decrease classi\ufb01cation performance for some algorithms [ 46].\nDuring feature engineering, we created some instances of potentially redundant features.\nThese were intended to capture similar information using a di\ufb00erent approach, e.g. computing\n4.1. Features 51\nthenumberversus the proportion of username mentions in a tweet. In order to select which\nfeature in each of these pairs of related features would be used, we created box plots comparing\ntheir value distributions for each class, to visualize which feature had most di\ufb00ering distributions\nfor fake and non-fake tweets. The box plots comparing the raw emotion count with the number\nof emotion-carrying words was previously discussed in section 4.1.4.1 and is shown in \ufb01gure 4.6.\nFigure 4.10 displays the box plots for other numerical pairs of features, representing the absolute\nnumber versus the proportion of adverbs, adjectives, and username mentions, using data from\ntraining set S1. For adverbs and adjectives, there seems to be a more pronounced di\ufb00erence in\ntheir distributions, while that di\ufb00erence appears smaller for username mentions.\nAdverbs\nUsername mentionsAdjectives\n1\nFigure 4.10: Comparing pairs of related variables.\nIn order to quantify that di\ufb00erence and evaluate its application, similarly to what was\n52 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\ndone for emotion n-gram features (as described in section 4.1.4.2), for each pair of features we\nexperimented with \ufb01tting two Random Forest models with the S1data set as input and 5-fold\ncross-validation. Both models used baseline features, along with the respective feature that was\nbeing compared. To evaluate which feature would be the most useful, we compared their average\nimportance from the 5 models \ufb01tted during cross validation by considering the mean decrease in\nimpurity (MDI) for each feature.\nIn addition to the number and proportion of adverbs, adjectives, and username mentions,\nwe conducted the experiment described above with a pair of entity-based features created\nto encode similar information, namely the di\ufb00erent proportions of mentions to persons or\norganizations: PERSON_minus_ORG , andhas_PERSON_no_ORG . Finally, the experiment\nwas also conducted to compare the raw emotion count with the number of emotion words. The\nresults are presented in table 4.7.\nTable 4.7: Selection of related features via importance.\nFeature 1 Imp. Feature 2 Imp.\nadverb_count 0.026 adverb_proportion 0.037\nadjective_count 0.050 adjective_proportion 0.063\nemotion_count 0.030 num_emotion_words 0.024\nmention_count 0.053 mention_proportion 0.056\nPERSON_minus_ORG 0.021 has_PERSON_no_ORG 0.008\nOverall the importance for each feature in each pair was relatively similar. The largest\ndi\ufb00erence was observed for the entity-based pair of features\u2014 PERSON_minus_ORG had an\naverage importance 2.5 times larger than has_PERSON_no_ORG . As a result of this process,\nthe feature with largest importance in each pair was kept and the other was removed.\nIn addition, we also examined each emotion frequency feature. As can be observed in \ufb01gure 4.4,\nsome emotion frequencies appear to have larger di\ufb00erences in their distribution for fake versus\nnon-fake tweets. In order to quantify that di\ufb00erence, we conducted the Mann Whitney U test,\nwhich is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test for verifying whether two samples are likely\nto derive from the same population. The hypotheses were de\ufb01ned as follows:\nH0: The two populations are equal.\nH1: The two populations are not equal.\nFor the tests using emotion frequency features, we used data from training set S1, comparing\nthe sample of fake tweets versus non-fake tweets. Since the sample size for both samples in S1is\nthe same (i.e. 3,000 examples), the resulting p-value for the Mann Whitney U test was compared\nas a measure of the degree of di\ufb00erence between the two samples, potentially indicating their\ndi\ufb00erentiating power.\nWith a signi\ufb01cance level of 5%, we did not reject the null hypothesis for a few features,\nnamelyemotion_fear ,emotion_anger ,emotion_positive , andemotion_joy . These features did\n4.1. Features 53\nnot exhibit a statistically signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence for the fake and non-fake tweets, a result which\nsuggests they could be removed from our feature set without a\ufb00ecting performance. However, as\na \ufb01nal veri\ufb01cation step, we employed the SelectPercentile method from the scikit-learn library.\nIn this method, all but a user-speci\ufb01ed percentage of features is removed after being scored and\nranked using the ANOVA F-value between each feature and the target classes. Iterating the\npercentile from 10% to 100%, we observed a nearly constant increase in the F1-score from the\ncross validation, as shown in \ufb01gure 4.11. Corroborating the results from the Mann Whitney U test,\nthe emotion features that did not exhibit a statistically signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence were among the last\nto be chosen in the SelectPercentile method. However, since their inclusion still resulted in an\nincrease in the evaluation metric, even if slight, we chose to keep them in the feature set.\n20 40 60 80 100\nPercentage of features kept0.660.680.700.720.74F1-score\nFigure 4.11: Variation of validation performance based on selection of top-performing features.\nWith the selected variables up to this point in the selection process, we computed the pairwise\ncorrelation between all variables in S1, which can be seen in \ufb01gure 4.12. The largest correlations\nwere observed between the number of a user\u2019s followers and the number of lists that user is\nincluded in, and the number of retweets and the number of times a tweet was marked as favorite,\nboth of which are above 0.9. Regarding the former correlation, we decided to remove the variable\nwith the number of lists for the user. Since those are variables related to a user\u2019s pro\ufb01le, it likely\nwill not vary as much as the variables with data on speci\ufb01c tweets, therefore by removing that\nvariable we expect to maintain the level of information for training.\nWith respect to the latter high correlation, we eliminated the variable with the number of\nfavorite marks for a tweet. As discussed in chapter 1, fake news are often created with the goal\nof being spread as widely as possible. With that in mind, the number of times a tweet was\nreplicated (via retweet) is an important measure, therefore it was kept instead of the favorite\ncount. Also, related to that discussion, the variable is_RTwas also removed from the data set.\n54 Chapter 4.

Therefore, since all examples in the\ntraining set contained the value Falsefor that variable, it was not possible to employ it in the\ninvestigated models.\nFinally, it is interesting to note the moderate correlations that can be observed between the\npolarity of a tweet and its emotion frequency, which were computed by di\ufb00erent means. We can\nnote a negative correlation between the polarity and the frequency of negative emotions, such\nas disgust or anger, and conversely a positive one between the polarity and the frequency of\npositive emotions, such as joy. Those results are mutually con\ufb01rming and support the accuracy\nof the automatic sentiment and emotion recognition processes.\nThe features from the extended set chosen in the feature selection process are displayed in\n4.2.

For Support Vector Machines,\nwe used the radial basis function kernel, and for AdaBoost we used one-level decision trees as\nthe weak learner. For all algorithms, we made use of the implementations in the scikit-learn [ 65]\nmachine learning framework in Python. We tested all models on two di\ufb00erent feature sets:\nbaseline and extended, as discussed on section 4.1.\nAll training was performed using the S1sample, which is composed of 6,000 tweets. With\nvalues learned from that training set, features were standardized by removing the mean and\nscaling to unit variance.\nThe next step was running 5-fold cross validation on the training set for hyperparameter\ntuning, using the same folds for all models tested so their results could be directly compared.\nOur strategy for hyperparameter tuning was to use randomized search, a process which involves\niterating a given number of times over di\ufb00erent hyperparameter values in order to identify which\nvalues yield the best results. In each iteration with this approach, for each hyperparameter to be\n56 Chapter 4. Classi\ufb01cation Model\ntuned, a distribution or list of values is supplied. Those values are randomly combined and each\ncombination is used to train the cross validation models using data from each of the 5 training\nfolds. These models are then used to make predictions for each validation fold, and the resulting\nF1-scores were computed and averaged. This process was repeated 100 times for each tested\nalgorithm using the baseline and extended feature sets. The models with the best classi\ufb01cation\nresults on the validation set had their hyperparameter values used to train a \ufb01nal model for each\nalgorithm on the whole training set. Table 4.9 shows the list of values tested and eventually\nselected in the randomized hyperparameter search for each algorithm.\nTable 4.9: Randomized search for hyperparameter tuning.\nAlgorithm Hyperparameter Tested valuesChosen value\nBaseline Extended\nDecision TreeMaximum depth [2..20] 2 9\nMinimum number of samples\nin a leaf[1..20] 2 15\nMinimum number of samples\nto split a node[1..20] 4 7\nRandom ForestNumber of trees {200n}10\nn=1400 200\nMaximum features to\nconsider in split (with set of\nfeaturesF)/braceleftBig/radicalbig\n|F|,log2|F|/bracerightBig\nlog2|F| log2|F|\nMaximum tree depth {10n}11\nn=1110 20\nMinimum number of samples\nto split a node{2, 5, 10} 5 5\nMinimum number of samples\nin a leaf{1, 2, 4} 1 1\nUse bootstrap samples {True, False} True True\nSVMRegularization parameter C {10n}3\nn=\u221211 0.1\nRadial basis function kernel\ncoe\ufb03cient\u03b3{10n}0\nn=\u221240.0001 0.001\nAdaBoostMaximum number of base\nestimators[50..200] 53 0.1\nLearning rate {0.5,0.2,0.1,0.01,0.001}53 0.1\nThe tuned models were then evaluated on test set T1, providing an estimate of their\nperformance on new data. Since T1contains 2,000 tweets, the split between training and test\ndata from 2020 had the proportion of 75%-25%. Finally, we also tested the models on the A1,\nA2, andA3sets (described in table 3.6). The results from these experiments are discussed in the\nnext chapter.\nChapter 5\nResults\nIn this chapter we present the results of our experiments, compare them to each other and discuss\ntheir implications in relation to the research questions posed in chapter 1.\n5.1 Complete Feature Set\nFirst, we provide the results obtained from using all proposed features, which include features\nbased on the user pro\ufb01le, tweet metadata and content, named entity recognition, emotion\nrecognition, and text vectorization, discussed in chapter 4. The main metrics used to evaluate\nthe models\u2019 performances were F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy. The metrics obtained\nfrom running the tuned models against test set T1are presented in table 5.1.\nThe metrics were uniformly high, with a weighted F1-score of 0.92 from all models, except\nfor the 0.90 F1-score from Naive Bayes. The models were particularly e\ufb00ective in identifying\nnon-fake tweets, with an F1-score of 0.95 from the top performing models. The performance on\ndetecting fake news was lower, with a recall of 0.68 and a best precision of 0.51. The main reason\nfor the low precision in this sample can be attributed to the class imbalance. Although the false\npositive rate was relatively low, at 6%, the class imbalance close to 5%\u201395% means the models\nare likely to generate almost as many false positives as true positives. Nevertheless, we regard\nthe weighted F1-score of 0.92 satisfactory enough to answer positively to RQ1, and consider it\nis possible to automatically distinguish tweets associated with reliable versus unreliable content\nbased on a set of features.\nThere were virtually no changes to the resulting metrics between the baseline and extended\nfeature sets, though, which prevents us from answering RQ3through this experiment. This stems\nfrom the e\ufb00ectiveness of the bag of words-derived features, which overshadowed the remaining\nfeatures. The txt_vector_pred feature (described in section 4.1.2) had so much discriminating\npower that it was the sole feature considered by decision trees and AdaBoost (using the decision\ntree as the weak learner), as well as carrying 70% of the importance in the random forest with\nthe extended feature set.\n57\n58 Chapter 5.

That concern arises from the fact that the bag of words vocabulary is created from\nthe initial corpus. Therefore, its application to other types of content might be limited to content\nwith a similar enough vocabulary. We investigated that concern by using the models trained on\nS1to make predictions for test set A1. As described in section 3.3, test set A1contains samples\ncollected in May 2021 with an account-based collection, instead of the keyword-based approach\nemployed for creating T1. The results from this experiment are displayed in table 5.2.\nThe results were once more satisfactory, with an improvement over general results from test\nsetT1. OnA1the best models\u2014Naive Bayes and SVM\u2014achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.97\nand 0.96, respectively, while the remaining models produced a result of 0.91. Another remarkable\nimprovement was also observed in the identi\ufb01cation of fake news tweets by the best performing\nmodels, with a 1.00 precision and 0.81 F1-score from Naive Bayes. These results suggest that\nthe proposed features are also helpful in identifying tweets collected with a di\ufb00erent context and\npotentially di\ufb00erent subjects. In order to further verify that \ufb01nding, we computed the similarity\nbetween the bag of words vocabulary in test sets T1andA1. The Jaccard coe\ufb03cient between the\nvocabulary sets from T1andA1is 0.05, which indicates a high degree of dissimilarity between\nthem. Despite this low level of equivalence, the models were able to extract useful information\ncapable of distinguishing non-fake versus fake tweets with good performance. That result further\nsupports our \ufb01nding that the bag of words features are useful for classi\ufb01cation even in di\ufb00erent\ncontexts.\n5.1.

Since there was an\napproximately six-month time gap between the data collections for T1andA1, the results we\nobtained support the \ufb01nding that the models are applicable to data sets collected with a time\nperiod between them.\nIn order to con\ufb01rm our expectation of higher performance when classifying retweets of content\nthat was present in the training sample, we also evaluated the models on test set A2. Indeed,\nwe obtained perfect results for all models but Naive Bayes. However, instead of indicating a\nstrong performance, this is a sign of over\ufb01tting to the training data, since the most important\nfeatures are directly derived from the text content and are, therefore, identical to feature values\nin samples from training set S1. For that reason we cannot consider the output from these\nmodels to be representative of their performance on new data, which supports our decision to\nremove all retweets from the training set.\nRegarding application on test set A3, results were as expected, given its creation as a sort\nof intermediate set between T1andA1. Accordingly, we obtained intermediate values for the\nmetrics, in line with the results from the two mentioned sets.\nThe results presented so far were achieved by using the txt_vector_pred feature as a Boolean\nvalue, obtained from converting the real output of the SVM text classi\ufb01cation model into a\nBoolean value denoting the predicted class. This was done with a threshold computed through\ncross validation on the training data with the goal of maximizing informedness. Complementing\nour investigation into the bag of words features, we also tested keeping the txt_vector_pred\n60 Chapter 5. Results\nfeature value as the real output of the SVM model instead of converting it into a Boolean value.\nResults were still satisfactory, with a weighted F1-score of 0.9 from the best-performing models\n(random forest and AdaBoost). Two major di\ufb00erences were observed: in the negative class, there\nwas a slight decrease in the recall, with roughly the same values for the precision. In the positive\nclass, however, a small increase in recall was o\ufb00set by a slightly larger decrease in precision,\ncausing a general reduction in the F1-score.\n5.2 Baseline Versus Extended Sets\nSince the models using the bag of words-derived feature saw a dominance from that feature, we\ndecided to remove it in order to attempt to answer RQ3and evaluate the contribution, if any,\nof features based on emotions and named entities. The results obtained on test set T1without\nthetxt_vector_pred feature are displayed in table 5.3.\nTable 5.3: Results from applying models to test set T1after removing txt_vector_pred feature.\nFor each metric, the \ufb01rst value refers to the extended feature set, while the value in parenthesis\nrefers to the baseline set.\nAccuracy Precision Recall F1-score\nNaive Bayes 0.35 (0.25)Non-fake 0.94 (0.95) 0.31 (0.19) 0.46 (0.32)\nFake 0.10 (0.10) 0.81 (0.90) 0.17 (0.18)\nWeighted Avg. 0.87 (0.88) 0.35 (0.25) 0.44 (0.31)\nDecision Tree 0.73 (0.80)Non-fake 0.96 (0.96) 0.74 (0.81) 0.84 (0.88)\nFake 0.20 (0.24) 0.67 (0.62) 0.31 (0.35)\nWeighted Avg. 0.89 (0.89) 0.73 (0.80) 0.79 (0.83)\nRandom Forest 0.84 (0.82)Non-fake 0.97 (0.97) 0.85 (0.83) 0.91 (0.89)\nFake 0.31 (0.29) 0.70 (0.72) 0.41 (0.43)\nWeighted Avg. 0.91 (0.91) 0.84 (0.82) 0.87 (0.85)\nSVM 0.73 (0.78)Non-fake 0.96 (0.96) 0.74 (0.79) 0.83 (0.87)\nFake 0.19 (0.23) 0.65 (0.64) 0.30 (0.34)\nWeighted Avg. 0.89 (0.89) 0.73 (0.78) 0.79 (0.82)\nAdaBoost 0.75 (0.75)Non-fake 0.96 (0.96) 0.76 (0.76) 0.85 (0.85)\nFake 0.21 (0.21) 0.69 (0.67) 0.33 (0.32)\nWeighted Avg. 0.90 (0.89) 0.75 (0.75) 0.80 (0.80)\nAlthough there was a general\u2014and expected\u2014decrease in performance after eliminating the\nbag of words-derived feature, the removal allowed us to compare the features among themselves\nwith regard to their importance and to better compare the baseline and extended feature sets.\nAs for the performance in identifying examples from the negative class, we observed a decrease\nin recall, while the precision was mostly maintained. On the other hand, for fake tweets, the\nprecision was generally low, which resulted in a large number of false positives.\nWhen comparing baseline and extended feature sets, the best performing model\u2014the random\n5.3. Re-sampling Methods 61\nforest\u2014obtained a 0.02 increase in the weighted F1-score with the extended feature set. For\nthe AdaBoost-based model, which had the second best performance, the results showed no\ndi\ufb00erence on the baseline and extended feature sets. And for the decision tree and SVM-based\nmodels, there was a decrease in classi\ufb01cation performance from using the extended feature set in\ncomparison with the baseline. For further comparing the models\u2019 performances on the di\ufb00erent\nfeature sets, we also constructed ROC curves, shown in \ufb01gure 5.1. The AUC values for the\ncurves are consistent with the results from table 5.3, with an improvement in performance in the\nrandom forest model, and additionally in the AdaBoost-based model.\nFigure 5.1: ROC curves of tested models on T1.\n5.3 Re-sampling Methods\nAll the results and discussion presented throughout this dissertation consider the use of random\nundersampling to balance the class distribution in our data set. However, as discussed in\nsection 3.3, we also experimented with random oversampling and SMOTE and compared those\napproaches with the results obtained with random undersampling. The experiments with\noversampling methods were conducted with the same feature sets and algorithms discussed in\nsection 5.2.\nTheoutcomewasassuggestedbyourinitialexperiments, whererandomundersamplingshowed\nconsistently better results. With both random oversampling and SMOTE, the models favored\nthe negative (majority) class. With random oversampling, that e\ufb00ect was more pronounced, and\ndi\ufb00erent models classi\ufb01ed virtually all tweets as non-fake. Therefore, the recall was very low,\nwith a conversely high number of false negatives. The experiments with SMOTE were more\nbalanced in that regard, even though a tendency toward negative classi\ufb01cation could still be\nobserved.

However, more false negatives were generally observed as well.\nWith regard to the AUC on these experiments, almost all models had a lower value with\neither oversampling method in comparison with undersampling. The notable exceptions were the\nrandom forest and SVM models with SMOTE, which were able to maintain the same general\nAUC values as with random undersampling. However, as discussed, these were obtained with a\nslant towards the classi\ufb01cation of the negative class, resulting in a lower recall of fake tweets.\n5.4 Feature Importance\nThecon\ufb02ictingresultsdiscussedinsection5.2werenotenoughtoenableustoanswersatisfactorily\ntoRQ3. Therefore, in order to further compare the baseline and extended sets, we also\nassessed the relative contribution of each individual feature by considering the mean decrease in\nimpurity (MDI) to estimate their importance in three of the tested algorithms: decision tree,\nrandom forest, and AdaBoost. The comparison of feature importance is shown in \ufb01gure 5.2. The\nfeature with the most consistently large contribution was the proportion of words in all capital\nletters, by itself responsible for close to 30% of the MDI in the decision tree-based models. Other\nimportant features, for both baseline and extended sets, are those based on the user\u2019s pro\ufb01le,\nincluding the number of friends, followers, and posts, time of account creation and number of\nposts marked as favorite, which collectively help demonstrate the signi\ufb01cance of data from a\nuser\u2019s pro\ufb01le for fake news classi\ufb01cation in a social media context. With regard to content-based\nand linguistic attributes, the number of username mentions in the text of a tweet was also\ngenerally important for all three models, and, to a lesser degree, the proportion of adjectives and\nadverbs, as well as the sentiment polarity.\nWhen considering the extended set of features, we observed the baseline features described\nabove were still the major contributors in MDI, specially in the random forest model, whose\nbaseline model had the same top 10 features ranked for importance as the model with extended\nfeatures. However, with extended features they accounted of 59.6% of the MDI, instead of\n93.2%. A major part of the remaining contribution was provided by features based on emotion\nrecognition, most notably emotion frequencies. Collectively, their highest contribution among\nthe three models was a 28% MDI with Random Forest. Among named entity-based features,\nentropy had the single highest contribution in the three models.\nTherefore, while the top baseline features still ranked higher on the extended models, the\ncontribution of the extended features was evident when assessing their importance, which supports\na conclusion that emotion and entity-based features can be helpful in fake news classi\ufb01cation as\nan answer to RQ3. It is also interesting to note that roughly the same features, both on the\nbaseline and extended sets, ranked similarly on di\ufb00erent algorithms, attesting to the validity of\ntheir general importance.\nIn light of the results explored in this chapter, in the next chapter we discuss some conclusions\ntaken from this work, as well as some challenges faced and limitations, and also possibilities of\n5.4.

This is a serious collective problem which requires a multidisciplinary approach to its\nmitigation, from reeducating readers about news consumption to technological solutions that\nhelp curb the reach of misinformation. As the widespread use of social media has contributed\nto the dissemination of fake news in ever-increasing volumes, any tool that helps identify these\nitems, hopefully automatically, is an important asset in the arsenal against fake news.\nThis chapter presents a general summary of the work that was performed to help tackle\nthat problem, along with a recapitulation of the research questions, and some conclusions that\nwere taken as a result. Finally, we also discuss some limitations and challenges, and provide\nopportunities of future work.\n6.1 General Summary\nThe work conducted in this research involved several stages. First, we de\ufb01ned the scope of\nour case study\u2014the 2020 US presidential election, more speci\ufb01cally through posts on social\nmedia platform Twitter. Then the data collection was planned and carried out, with a \ufb01rst\nphase between September and December 2020, and a second phase in May 2021. The process of\npreparing the data ensued, encompassing cleaning and pre-processing tasks in order to get the\ndata ready for further processing. These were followed by a data selection step, where we chose\na subset of data, based on criteria including length and sentiment analysis concordance, with the\ngoal of ensuring it was consistent and capable of providing useful features for classi\ufb01cation.\nIn order to obtain a ground truth against which to perform classi\ufb01cation, we adopted\na systematic data labeling process with a publisher-based approach. This process involved\nleveraging the level of factual reporting of a news website, as de\ufb01ned by human experts, to label\n65\n66 Chapter 6. Conclusions\ntweets that contained links to those websites. This process enabled us to overcome the scale\nproblem of obtaining a sizable labeled data set essential to verifying the validity of our results.\nWith the pre-processed and labeled data ready, the next step was performing feature\nengineering. After a review of other studies in this \ufb01eld, we derived a set of relevant features,\nfocused on linguistic attributes, text content, and social media metadata. These were considered\nour baseline features. Aiming to answer one of our research questions and investigate the potential\ncontribution of features derived from named entities and emotion recognition, an additional set of\nfeatures was devised, which we called the extended set. These included a group of features based\non named entity recognition in which di\ufb00erent entity types were grouped into categories such as\nwho,where, andwhen, with the goal of identifying relevant entities that could characterize a fact,\nas well as a feature computing the variability of entities mentioned in a tweet. Emotion-based\nfeatures included the frequency of eight basic emotions and two sentiments, and the number\nof times emotions were conveyed in the tweet, based on emotion-carrying words, with the aim\nof capturing a tweet\u2019s emotional intensity. Additionally, we explored features derived from the\nsentence-based sequencing of emotions in the \ufb02ow of text, using emotionn-gramsto identify\nn-grams typical of fake or non-fake tweets.\nAdditionally, for select features, we ran several experiments in order to compare di\ufb00erent\nversions of the constructed features and assess which showed more potential discriminating power\nfor our classi\ufb01cation task. These were then selected to compose the \ufb01nal set of selected features.\nWith those selected features, we compared \ufb01ve di\ufb00erent machine learning algorithms to seek\nthe best performance for each feature set, and attempt to answer the three research questions\nposed in chapter 1. Those questions are restated below, along with the answers obtained in the\ncourse of this project.\n\u2022RQ1: Is it possible to automatically identify posts associated with fake news\nbased on a set of features? With the complete set of proposed features, we were able\nto achieve a 0.92 weighted F1-score on a test set. Therefore, we answer positively to this\nquestion, and conclude it is possible to leverage a set of features to automatically identify\ntweets associated with fake news.\n\u2022RQ2: How does a time gap between the model creation and its use impact the\nidenti\ufb01cation of fake news? To answer this question, we made use of an account-based\ndata set collected approximately six months after the initial data collection. We observed\neven improved results over the performance on the previous test set, with a weighted\nF1-score of 0.97, and enhanced detection of fake news, with a F1-score of 0.81 on that class\nof tweets. Therefore, we conclude it is possible to employ a model to classify data with a\ntime gap between the model\u2019s creation and its application.\n\u2022RQ3: Is it possible to improve classi\ufb01cation performance using features based\non emotions and named entities? After comparing the models\u2019 performances on the\nbaseline and extended features sets, the results were con\ufb02icting. While lower-performing\n6.2. Contributions 67\nmodels displayed a decrease in performance with the addition of features based on emotions\nand named entities, the best-performing models\u2014random forest and AdaBoost\u2014actually\nhad their performance increased with the use of those features. Therefore, we can conclude\nthose features potentially have discriminating power and are indeed helpful for fake news\nclassi\ufb01cation, although we believe further work should be conducted for a more conclusive\nanswer.\n6.2 Contributions\nIn the course of answering these research questions, this study o\ufb00ers a number of contributions,\nwhich are listed below.\n\u2022We have created a data set of tweets focusing on the 2020 US presidential election,\ncomprising data from over three months, centered on the election day. It was systematically\nannotated containing tweets with links to news content, using an approach based on the\npublishers\u2019 level of factual reporting. The result is an annotated data set of fake news and\nlegitimate content from Twitter, composed of approximately 144k tweets associated with\nreliable content and 7k associated with unreliable content.\n\u2022We demonstrate the applicability of a set of features based on di\ufb00erent characteristics of\na tweet\u2014text content, linguistic attributes, user pro\ufb01le, post metadata\u2014for fake news\nidenti\ufb01cation in Twitter with satisfactory results in a comparison of di\ufb00erent machine\nlearning models. Additionally, we point out this approach is based only on data that can\nbe obtained from an individual tweet\u2014as opposed to approaches based on a user\u2019s history\nor on a post\u2019s propagation \ufb02ow\u2014which means a tweet is potentially ready for classi\ufb01cation\nas soon as it is posted, enabling early detection and helping to prevent the harm caused by\nfake news dissemination.\n\u2022We show the relevance of features derived from named entities and emotion recognition in\nthe automatic identi\ufb01cation of fake news. We demonstrate in particular the applicability of\nusing emotion frequencies and the entity type entropy as features. In addition, we employ\nsequences of prevalent emotions per sentence, analogous to n-grams, in order to identify\nsequences of emotions typical of fake and non-fake tweets, for use in classi\ufb01cation.\n\u2022We have submitted a paper to the WEBIST\u201921 conference (already approved), which\ndemonstrates some of the results obtained in this work [7].\n6.3 Limitations\nRegarding the general classi\ufb01cation of tweets associated with fake news content, we can name a\nnumber of limitations and challenges faced in this work.\n68 Chapter 6. Conclusions\nIn connection with feature engineering, one limitation we dealt with is that it was not possible\nto use links in tweets, i.e., the news source, as basis for any features. The reputation of a\nsource has been considered by human evaluators as the most important factor in assessing tweet\ncredibility [ 40]. In fact it is such a strong indicator that it formed the basis for our automatic\nlabeling process. On the other hand, the features derived from tweets labeled based on links\ngeneralized well to tweets without regard to the presence of links, and also with other contents not\nrelated to the US election. Additionally, some commonly used features for fake news classi\ufb01cation\nbased on text content, including the overall number of words or sentences, the number of words\nper sentence, or other length-related features, are more suited for longer pieces of text, and could\nnot be easily explored for fake news classi\ufb01cation in shorter text content such as tweets.\nConcerning the classi\ufb01cation task, the class imbalance presented a signi\ufb01cant challenge to\nbe faced. As discussed in section 5.1, even though the models generally displayed a relatively\nlow false positive rate, the high proportion of reliable to unreliable tweets translated into a high\nnumber of false positives, i.e., a lower precision. Additionally, the need to collect and label our\nown data led to limitations in the size of the created data set, which contained approximately\n3,600 original tweets associated with fake news. Due to that resulting data set size, no neural\nnetwork or deep learning-based approaches were experimented with, since those techniques\ncommonly require more data in order to achieve acceptable performance [27].\n6.4 Future Work\nThere are several promising possibilities for extending this work. The favorable classi\ufb01cation\nresults obtained by our model using the proposed set of features in the speci\ufb01c case study\ninvestigated in this work raise the question of how well those results can be generalized to other\ndomains outside of politics. An encouraging initial result was obtained in this work, with the\ngood classi\ufb01cation performance on a test set with low vocabulary similarity to the one the model\nwas trained on. Nevertheless, a deeper investigation into the applicability of the classi\ufb01cation,\nspecially cross-domain, is an interesting direction for further research. This additional test set was\nalso collected with a time gap relative to the \ufb01rst data set collection. Due to the time constraints\ninherent to this research, that time gap consisted of approximately six months. While we obtained\ngood results using that data, an interesting option to examine is to make a comparison with\nother test sets collected at di\ufb00erent intervals.\nRegarding our proposed features, there is much room to expand with emotion and name\nentity-based features. One option to be explored is narrowing down the emotions recognized for\neach word. Since the NRC lexicon usually identi\ufb01es several emotions per word, when computing\nemotion frequencies in a sentence, these emotions often overlap, potentially diluting some of the\ninformation. Being able to precisely identify a single prevalent emotion in a word would likely\nlead to a clearer representation of the overall prevalent emotions in a sentence. One possible\napproach to tackle this problem is leveraging the context each word appears in. For example, if\na word that conveys the emotions of fearandsadnessappears between two segments with the\n6.4. Future Work 69\nprevailing emotion fear, that word could be deemed to express the fearas well, helping to \ufb01lter\nout extraneous emotions and provide a more precise identi\ufb01cation. One additional possibility for\nenhancing the emotion recognition precision is leveraging the context speci\ufb01c to the investigated\ndata. As mentioned in section 4.1.4.2, the most frequent emotion in our 2020 data set\u2014 trust\u2014is\npresent in words that are actually associated with the election process or to o\ufb03cial authorities,\ni.e., they lack relative discriminating power in that context. Therefore, being able to take the data\ncontext into consideration when identifying emotions in the text could lead to richer features.\nIn addition to emotion-based features, those based on named entities also contain room for\nfurther investigation. In particular, we would like to deepen the relationship between recognized\nentities, and look into \ufb01nding semantic connections between di\ufb00erent entities in order to extract\na more precise representation of a tweet content and how it relates potentially false information\nas a fact.\nIn all, we demonstrate in this work the potential for the automatic identi\ufb01cation of fake\nnews. We describe steps taken since the initial data collection and processing, using the 2020\nUS presidential election as the main context, with an automated labeling approach. We present\nand compare the results of applying di\ufb00erent machine learning models to that data, and obtain\nsatisfactory performance from many models\u2014notably based on random forest and AdaBoost\u2014on\ndi\ufb00erent test sets created with di\ufb00erent approaches, showing the model is capable of generalizing\nto other contexts. Additionally, we investigate and show the contribution of employing features\nderived from named entities and emotion recognition in enhancing the automatic identi\ufb01cation\nof fake news.\nWe believe the machine learning-based model proposed in this work to automatically identify\nposts associated with fake news on Twitter has several possible uses. Since our model works\ndirectly with data that can be obtained from individual posts, and is not reliant on propagation-\nbased features, it can be employed in an early warning system. As discussed in section 2.2.2, this\ntype of approach is vital in an attempt to contain as much damage as possible before harm is\nirreversibly caused. Other possible uses range from alerting end-users about potentially unreliable\ncontent, to assisting organizations, online content providers, and fact-checkers in automatically\n\ufb01ltering questionable content for further screening, contributing to the mitigation of a serious\nproblem that a\ufb00ects us all.\n\nBibliography\n[1]Hadeer Ahmed, Issa Traore, and Sherif Saad.

This near disappearance serves as a symbol of the \nregion\u2019s victimisation, as the Sovie ts diverted the waters of what was once the fourth largest lake in the world to \nirrigate cotton fields and boost agricultural output. Once spanning 68,000 square kilometres, the sea has shrunk \nby 90%. Being a key player in Central Asia, Kazakhstan has take n the lead in regional efforts to find solutions to \nthis critical environmental, social, and economic disaster. As a young state striving for recognition, Kazakhstan \nhas come under close attention, implementing various initiatives, including the constructi on of the first sand dam \nin the Berg Strait and the Kokaral Dam, the signing of the Almaty Agreement, the establishment of the \nInternational Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) and the organisation of EXPO 2017.  \nThe paper attempts to explain Kazakhstan\u2019s efforts in resolving the crisis in the Aral Sea and its impact \non its international representation and media engagement. The findings indicate that Kazakhstan\u2019s environmental \nactions may potentially support not on ly the restoration of local ecology but also strengthen the country\u2019s image \nas an important regional player in sustainable development. This paper addresses environmental diplomacy in the \ncontext of strategic action for countries seeking better positions g lobally while seeking solutions for pressing \necological problems.  \nKeywords : Kazakhstan, Aral Sea crisis, environmental diplomacy, international representation, media \nengagement  \n \nIntroduction  \nThe Aral Sea was the fourth largest lake in the world, but it has shrunk to just 10 percent of its \nformer size due to the large -scale withdrawal of water from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers for \nirrigation. Situated between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, th e Aral Sea \u2019s rapid decline since the 1960s \nhas had a profound impact on local ecosystems, economies, and public health. This crisis completely \ndeteriorated the fishing industry, agricultural output shrunk, and shipping came to a halt as desiccation \nset in.  This situation has significantly worsened the health consequences, as toxic air and water have led \nto respiratory diseases, kidney diseases, and widespread diseases such as typhoid fever and hepatitis \n(Micklin, 2004). After the fall of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, Central Asian \nstates realised the necessity to cooperate in order to adapt to climate change and be able to conserve \nwater supplies (Joshi & Kumari, 2019). The efforts to address these issues are underway, but full \nrestoration is impossible, though partial rehabilitation may restore some ecological and economic \nfunctions.  \nIn line with these efforts, as a newly established state, Kazakhstan strived to improve the \ncountry \u2019s international image in order to promote the development of economic, political, and social \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n19  spheres. The formation of a positive image was an important factor contributing to increasing the \ninvestment attractiveness of the state. Environmental diplomacy plays a key part in forming the status \nof the state (Gazizov, 2017). Thus, the country \u2019s dynamic cooperation in understanding cross -border \nnatural issues contributes to reinforcing its expertise  in global governance  and enhancing  territorial \nparticipation. The government has given priority to expanding its representation in the international \narena and has put this on the agenda of its foreign policy. In 2006, it established a special agency, the \nInternational Information Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan, \nwhich is responsible for execution and control capacit ies on fortifying the positive image of the state in \npolitical, financial, social, humanitarian, and other aspects (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic \nof Kazakhstan, n.d.). This information and image work became an essential part of a state\u2019s soft  power \nto strengthen existing positive trends and create new ones.  \nIn the context of the Aral Sea crisis, Kazakhstan\u2019s government presented itself as a \u201cregional \nleader \u201d in Central Asia, seeking to demonstrate its willingness to take voluntary measures, in particular \nin matters related to the Aral Sea. The key point of Kazakhstan \u2019s efforts is the effective restoration of \nthe sea, especially through the construction of a dam in the Northern Aral Sea region in cooperation with \nthe World Bank (Saltybaev, 2018). These activities have not only restored local fisheries but, more over, \nimproved the well -being and living conditions of approximately one million people in the region. \nKazakhstan \u2019s activities in the field of environmental management have been universally recognised, and \nprominent figures have highly appreciated this (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023).  \nThe purpose of the research is to analy se the international reputation of the Republic of \nKazakhstan in the global media with emphasis on its attempts to solve the issue of the Aral Sea. The \nstudy is carried out to identify shifts in the perception of Kazakhstan by foreign traditional media \nthroughout its attempts to counter the environmental crisis, and identify how its attempts affected the \ntone of representation of the nation by the world media. Findings of this study can be used to prepare \nrecommendatio ns for the development of the foreign policy of Kazakhstan, namely through the foreign \nmedia channel, which is capable of improving the image of the country positively. It is worth no ting that \nthis work is original, as it fills the gap in the literature, which investigates the world media portrayal of \nKazakhstan in the context of solving the problem of the Aral Sea, which was not previously covered by \nthe research.  \nThe study started with a literature review that presents Kazakhstan \u2019s primary activities within \nthe field of natural disasters, such as the reclamation of the Aral Sea, the development of the Kok aral \ndam and the creation of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS). It endeavoured to discuss \nKazakhstan \u2019s activities in settling the emergency within the Aral Sea and its effect on its universal \nrepresentation and participation. The literature review demonstrated that Kazakhstan has built up itself \nas a driving player within the field of water strategy in Central Asia, encouraging the conclusion of key \nascension with neighbouring nations on the utilisation of transboundary waterways. Understandings \nwere made together with the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbe kistan on the impartial dissemination of water \nassets of the Shu, Talas, and Syr Darya streams. In expansion, Kazakhstan is arranging with China the \njoint administration of more than 20 transboundary streams, counting Ili and Irtysh (Ualikhanova, 2024). \nIn recent years, the government has increased the volume of incoming water from the Syr Darya, which \nhas led to significant sea level rise. By the end of 2024, the volume of water in the Northern Aral Sea \nregion increased by 42% (to 27 billion m3), and the w ater surface area increased by 111  square \nkilometres  compared to 2022. These achievements were made possible thanks to the systematic \nmanagement of water resources and new agreements with neighbouring states on the redistribution of \nrunoff in the off -seaso n (\u201cRevival of the Aral Sea \u201d, 2025). The effect of these steps on the universal \nrecognition of Kazakhstan and its part in territorial and worldwide understandings is at that point \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n20  analysed. These factors are essential in shaping Kazakhstan\u2019s status. Based on this, the literature review \nanalysed Kazakhstan \u2019s key initiatives to address the Aral Sea crisis that are important in the \nrepresentation in international traditional media. The main research question is formulated as follows: \nHow have Kazakhstan\u2019s initiatives in addressing the Aral Sea crisis been portrayed in foreign traditional \nmedia?  This question aimed to investigate how Kazakhstan \u2019s efforts to mitigate the crisis affect its  \nstanding on the international stage and promote collaborative approaches to environmental challenges \nin the region.  The research hypothesis posited that Kazakhstan \u2019s measures in addressing the Aral Sea \ncrisis functioned as a strategic platform to elevate its representation in foreign media.  Next, the \nMethodology part gave point -by-point data about the research process, including the approach to \nselecting sources and criteria for analysis. In specific, the method of selecting foreign media sources is \ndepict ed, as well as the strategies utilised to conduct high -quality substance investigation. The Analysis \nand discussion  section looked at the hypothesis of the study and answered a key question on how \nKazakhstan \u2019s activities to solve the issue of the Aral Sea influence its representation. Most subjects \nraised in outside media are examined, as well as their effect on the recognition of Kazakhstan as a \ndynamic member in the region. The paper concluded with a discuss ion of the outcomes, restrictions, and \nproposals  for future research that may develop an understanding of the part of Kazakhstan \u2019s natural \nstrategy in forming its worldwide picture.  \nLiterature review  \nWater resource tensions in Central Asia  \nWhile water resource tensions remain in Central Asia due to competing needs and ineffective \nmanagement, diplomacy helps mitigate the risk of conflict. In the study by Bernauer and Siegfried (2012) \non how the collapse of the USSR led to ongoing disputes over water allocation between Kyrgyzstan, \nUzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, the focus was on how these tensions arose from competing needs for \nirrigation (downstream) and hydropower (upstream) (p. 231). Centr al Asian political leaders respond to \ncriticism about the  environment \u2019s state, but very often, there are arguments in politics over the \nimpossibility of working out ecological brakes. Additionally, climate change is expected to worsen these \ntensions by altering the seasonality of river flows, particularly in Uzbekistan (Bern auer & Siegfried, \n2012, p. 235). While water management institutions like the Interstate Commission for Water \nCoordination (ICWC) exist, they have been largely ineffective, which leaves room for further diplomatic \nengagement. The authors find that despite these challenges, the risk of climate -induced militarised \nconflict is low in the short to medium term (Bernauer & Siegfried, 2012, p. 236). While the article gives \ngood insights into water conflicts and climate change impacts in Central Asia, it does not go deep into \nwhat specific proactive measures Kazakhstan has taken so far to address the crisis in the Aral Sea. This \nomission creates a space to discuss Kazakhstan \u2019s diplomatic and policy -driven efforts to reduce tensions \nrelated to water.  \nSimilarly, Dehshiri & Hekmatara (2019) assume that water can create tensions among nations \nbut because of this, militarised conflicts should not be expected, provided that the countries continue \ndiplomatic efforts (p. 749). Although the paper gives a clear  emphasis on the significance of regional \ncooperation and recommendations for water diplomacy, it has not clearly explained what the tangible \noutcomes of the initiatives of Kazakhstan are, such as restoration projects or leadership in environmental \ndiploma cy. Kazakhstan\u2019s specific strategies are not fully explored in this context, which limits the \nunderstanding of Kazakhstan \u2019s contribution to the Aral Sea crisis.  \n \n \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n21  Challenges and effectiveness of the regional cooperation on the Aral Sea Crisis  \nCentral Asian governments have established cooperative initiatives to address the Aral Sea crisis , \nwhich are limited by either an emphasis on short -term political expediency or the lack of multi -\ndimensional analysis regarding the results about the crisis in the Aral Sea. Most studies focused on what \nwas done but not on the effectiveness of these action s. In 1993, Central Asian states established the \nInterstate Council on the Problems of the Aral Sea Basin (lCAS). A major purpose of the new \norganisation was to facilitate assistance from the World Bank and other international donors as well as \nassume responsibility for various Aral Sea Basin assistance programs. The presidents also created an \nInternational Fund for the Aral Sea (IFAS) with the responsibility t o collect revenue from each basin \nstate for financing rehabilitation efforts. Further, Micklin (2004) discusses projects and programs such \nas the construction of the Kok aral dam, and the CAMP4ASB (Climate Adaptation and Mitigation \nProgram for the Aral Sea Basin) (p. 100). However, the lack of information on insights into their \noutcomes or the effectiveness of regional cooperation prevents a thorough understanding of how such \nprojects and programs help to mitigate water -related conflicts (Joshi & Kumari, 201 9, p. 34). Micklin\u2019s \nchapter is informative on the historical background and environmental and social impacts of the crisis \nin the Aral Sea, but it does not stress continuous participation of Kazakhstan in ecological restoration \nwork, or its effort to link  these actions with its international image. Such a perspective is important for \nan evaluation of the country \u2019s diplomatic positioning.  \nOn the contrary, Weinthal (2001) mentions that although Central Asian states aim to solve \nsecurity threats, their domestic priorities often give preference to politically expedient measures rather \nthan meaningful environmental reforms (p. 55). Leaders pref er to grow cotton monoculture rather than \nwater -saving crops, which resulted in an environmental protection solution that is politically expedient \nin the short term but ineffective in the long term. This challenges whether Central Asian countries can \nimpro ve their positions in the world. Moreover, external actors endorsed these decisions because they \nprioritised maintaining social and political stability (Weinthal, 2001, pp. 71 -72). However, there is \nlimited focus on how individual states, such as Kazakhsta n, have sought to address the Aral Sea crisis \nwithin a global context. More precisely, there is a lack of understanding of how Kazakhstan has used \ninternational platforms and partnerships in balancing its economic dependencies, like cotton production, \nwith the urgent need for environmental reforms. Hakala et al. (2024) talk about key issues for territorial \nparticipation in water assets in Central Asia. The creators note that vague borders and competition for \nassets, particularly in locales such as the Fergh ana Valley, lead to clashes between nations (Hakala et \nal., 2024). Political issues such as debasement and authoritarianism complicate the circumstance and \nruin participation. Issues related to unlawful exchange and organised wrongdoing that increment \nflimsiness are moreover highlighted. They also emphasise that the uneven dissemination of water assets \nand powerless coordination at the state level make boundaries to viable administration of water assets \nwithin the locale (Hakala et al., 2024).  \nThese articles basically focused on the natural and political results inside the locale but did not \ninvestigate the worldwide media accounts and their impact on Kazakhstan \u2019s universal picture. This gap \nin understanding the depiction of Kazakhstan \u2019s part within the crisis on the global stage , especially \nwithin the setting of outside conventional media, clears out a vital viewpoint of the country \u2019s political \nand natural endeavours unexplored.  \nInternational cooperation in the Aral Sea Basin management  \nInternational organisations have played a decisive role in promoting cooperation among the \nCentral Asian states in the Aral Sea basin. Micklin (2004) provides an overview of this. International \naid donors have played a critical role in promoting cooperatio n in transnational water management in \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n22  the Aral Sea basin, with the World Bank being a key player (Micklin, 2004. p. 107). The World Bank \ntook part in the formulation of the Aral Sea Basin Assistance Programme (ASBP) targeted rehabilitation, \nstrategic planning, and institutional development, wh ile its budget grew from $250 million to $470 \nmillion. The program initiated the Interstate Council on the Problems of the Aral Sea Basin and the \nInternational Fund for the Aral Sea, with subsequent projects such as the Water and Environmental \nManagement P roject further reinforcing regional commitments (Micklin, 2004, p. 108). USAID also \nplayed an active role, financing projects connected with the improvement of drinking water supplies and \nregional water management policies, whereas the Water Resources Mana gement and Agricultural \nProduction in the Central Asian Republics (WARMAP) project of the European Union (EU) supported \nthe elaboration of methodologies for water use and management for the five Central Asian republics \n(Micklin, 2004, p. 108). The UN and i ts structures, such as UNESCO and UNICEF, have provided \nfinancial support for ecological research, health programs, and sustainable development in the region \n(Micklin, 2004, p. 110). NATO participation includes sponsorship of research workshops and the \ndevelopment of an overall GIS for the Amu Darya delta to assist in decision -making concerning land \nand water management (Micklin, 2004, p. 111).  \nAt last, Hakala et al. (2024) highlight struggle variables and variables contributing to peace \nwithin the administration of transboundary water assets, with the assistance of the IFAS. It moreover \nproposes changes to move forward the viability of IFAS and gives data on activities such as the United \nNations Multi -Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region. The hole within the writing \nlies within the restricted thought about how Kazakhstan \u2019s diplomatic endeavours inside this system are \nsecured within the global media. In spite of the fact that the ponders of Miklin (2004) and Hakala et al. \n(2023) dissect the part of universal organisations, they don \u2019t consider how Kazakhstan \u2019s activities are \ndisplayed in remote media.  \nKazakhstan \u2019s role in international environmental governance  \nKazakhstan is positioning itself as a regional leader in environmental restoration to raise its \ninternational status while overcoming the contradiction of its ambition for an economically strong future \nbased on fossil fuel with its commitment to sustainable development and environmental justice. O \u2019Neill \nand Primiano (2023) argue that since independence, Kazakhstan has been actively seeking to enhance \nits international status along three dimensions: international security, democratic development, and \necological challenges (p. 81). It also places itse lf as one of the key players in regional diplomacy, which \nis underlined by its c hairmanship in such organisations as the OSCE and hosting events like EXPO 2017. \nA very important aspect enclosed within the policy of Kazakhstan is environmental justice. In light of \necological catastrophes following Soviet politics, which have totally or  partly destroyed big parts of the \nAral Sea, Kazakhstan tries to be very active in this direction. Kazakhstan, through its role in the \nInternational Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, has led regional efforts to combat the Aral Sea environmental \ndisaster and ha s made significant progress in restoring parts of this critical ecosystem with its neighbours \nsince 1993 (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023, p. 90). Zhanalieva (2020) notes that international donor \norganisations enhance the bargaining power of downstream states, allowing Kazakhstan to secure World \nBank financing for the Kok aral dam (pp. 65 -66). Thanks to this, it was possible to successfully revive \nthe northern part of the Aral Sea, which is a significant achievement for Kazakhstan (O \u2019Neill & \nPrimiano, 2023, p. 90).  Not only did it help restore local fisheries and economies but also garnered \npositive recognition from international organisations and the global media, reinforcing Kazakhstan \u2019s \nimage as a regional leader in environmental restoration (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023, p. 91).  \nHowever, Kazakhstan has also been criticised for its environmental initiatives due to the \ncontradiction between its economic ambitions and environmental sustainability. Although it positions \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n23  itself as a \u201cchampion\u201d of green policies such as the Green Economy Concept and compliance with \nEuropean Union environmental standards, the country continues to prioritise fossil fuel exports as its \nmain economic driver (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023, p. 83). The authors support the view that \nenvironmental initiatives in Kazakhstan have an enhancing effect on its international status but provide \nlimited evidence on how these actions contribute to long -term ecological sustainability. The lack of \nstrong data weakens the argument and leaves room t o investigate substantive contributions versus \nsymbolic efforts by Kazakhstan.  \nGap in Existing Literature  \nSome studies (e.g., Micklin, 2004) cover the effectiveness of regional cooperation but stop short \nof linking these initiatives to Kazakhstan \u2019s international reputation. While Micklin (2004) and O\u2019Neil & \nPrimiano (2023) focus on bilateral and multilateral cooperation and Kazakhstan \u2019s role in addressing the \nAral Sea crisis, they often show these initiatives as uncontested successes and fail to link Kazakhstan \u2019s \ninitiatives addressing the Aral Sea crisis with its international representation and role in foster ing cross -\nborder collaboration. This research examined their implications for Kazakhstan\u2019s international \nrepresentation.  \nThere are also conflicting views on Kazakhstan\u2019s motivations for its actions in this crisis. While \nZhanalieva (2020) notes that Kazakhstan did a good job in solving this crisis and improved its status (p. \n76), O\u2019Neil & Primiano (2023) have the opposite vie w by criticising the country for prioritising its \neconomic ambitions over environmental problems and being the world \u2019s 4th fossil -fuel exporter (p. 83).  \n \nMethodology  \n \nTo answer the research question and test hypothesis, the researcher conducted a qualitative case \nstudy based on content analysis to investigate Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental initiatives surrounding the \nAral Sea crisis. The study aimed to understand how Kazakhstan \u2019s actions influence its international \nrepresentation and foster cross -border collaboration. For this purpose, research  papers and foreign online \nnewspapers were collected.  \nThe choice of foreign newspapers was based on several factors, such as a wide international \naudience and a high reputation for independence and objectivity. According to ratings such as Media \nBias/Fact Check, these publications occupy high positions in the  field of trust and influence the \ninternational perception of events (Media Bias Fact Check, 2025). These resources actively cover \nenvironmental issues and provide different perspectives, which are important for a comprehensive \nunderstanding of how the int ernational community perceives Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental policy.  \nThe time period covered was from January 1, 2018, to February 10, 2025. This time period was \nselected because it included several significant events in Kazakhstan . The 2019 resignation of Nursultan \nNazarbayev and the 2019 and 2022 presidential races marked changes in Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental \napproach, influencing the reporting of the nation \u2019s activities in settling natural challenges by foreign \nmedia (Zhiltsov & Zonn, 2019). COVID -19 widespread moreover influenced endeavours for universal \nparticipation, a s a few sources expressed that environmental projects were delayed due to financial issues \n(Haruna et al., 2022). The IFAS administration by Kazakhstan (2023 -2026) has drawn noteworthy media \nattention. Natural emergencies in 2023, counting large -scale fire s, and the 2024 floods also influenced \nmedia coverage with a few sources covering Kazakhstan \u2019s dynamic reaction, whereas others emphasised \nsystemic issues (Newtimes.kz, 2025). The units of analysis were the articles that contained one of the \nfollowing word s: \u201cAral Sea,\u201d \u201cKazakhstan,\u201d \u201cenvironmental initiatives,\u201d \u201cIFAS,\u201d \u201cinternational \ncooperation\u201d.  \nThe analysis focused on Kazakhstan \u2019s several important initiatives to address the Aral Sea crisis, \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n24  including the construction of the first sand dam in the Berg Strait and the Kok aral Dam, the signing of \nthe Almaty Agreement, the establishment of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) and \nthe organisation of EXPO 2017. These initiatives were analysed alongside relevant academic articles, \npolicy documents, and media na rratives to provide a comprehensive understanding of Kazakhstan \u2019s \nenvironmental diplomacy. The content analysis will involve systematically examining selected \ndocuments to iden tify patterns and themes related to Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental actions. A diverse \nrange of sources were selected and categorised based on key themes such as diplomacy, international \ncollaboration, environmental leadership, and public perception. Each document was reviewed for \nrelevant content that alig ns with the research question. The researcher analysed keywords associated \nwith Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental initiatives to understand how these actions are framed about \ninternational cooperation and representat ion. \nCase study: Kazakhstan\u2019s proactive measures for the Aral Sea  \n \nKazakhstan has sought to enhance its international standing while addressing domestic economic \nlimitations and environmental disasters inherited from the Soviet era, particularly the gradual drying of \nthe Aral Sea. The country \u2019s environmental measures are driven by a pragmatic foreign policy positioning \nKazakhstan as a regional leader and a significant international actor in global sustainable development. \nThis approach aligns with the directives of Strategy 2050, highlighting K azakhstan \u2019s increasing role in \nworld affairs and its commitment to establishing a sustainable international presence and a positive \nglobal i mage (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023). The government aims to be recognised not only for tackling \ndomestic environmental issues but also for its cooperation and leadership on regional and global \nenvironmental challenges. Consequently, the government takes environmental actions that are positively \nperceived by Western states, thereby enhancing Kazakhstan \u2019s representation as a key player in climate \nchange and environmental initiatives in the region (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023).  \nAs a downstream country, Kazakhstan became one of the most responsible actors in the Aral Sea \nCrisis (Zhanalieva, 2020). It takes a responsible approach to programs to improve the ecological state of \nthe sea and strives for long -term solutions for the regi on. In this process, international organisations such \nas the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), the European Union, the Asian Development \nBank, and the World Bank play a significant role, with which about 300 projects have been implemented \nfor a total of $8.5 billion (Aitkhozha, 2017, as cited in Nechayeva, 2017). It is important to note that \ncollaboration with international organisations may assist not only in the achievement of domestic goals \nbut also acts as a channel for newer states to improve their international status and credibility (O \u2019Neill \n& Primiano, 2023).  \nKazakhstan \u2019s success in restoring the Aral, relative to its neighbours, has been notable. Efforts \nbegan in 1992 when residents constructed the first sand -filled dam in the Berg Strait, raising the water \nlevel in the Small Aral Sea by 1 metre. However, the constructio n of the dam from poor materials led to \nits complete destruction by 1999 (Saltybaev, 2018). In response to this, Kazakhstan requested a loan \nfrom the World Bank in 2005. The 13 -kilometre -long Kok aral Dam was constructed with a bank loan \nof $64.5  million, although the government of Kazakhstan covered the remaining $21.5 million. As a \nresult, water levels in the Small Aral Sea rose to 42 metres (Saltybaev, 2018).  \nIn 1992, in Almaty, Kazakhstan, the ministers of Central Asian states met and signed the \ndocument \u201cCooperation in joint management, use and Protection of Transboundary water resources\u201d, \nwhich was later referred to as the Almaty Agreement. It resulted in th e creation of the Interstate \nCommission for Water (ICWC) but was dissolved in 1997 (Zhanalieva, 2020).  Following that, the \nInterstate Council on the Problems of the Aral Sea Basin (ICAS) was established in March 1993 \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n25  (Micklin, 2002, as cited in Micklin, 2004). Further emphasising its commitment, Kazakhstan \u2019s former \npresident, Nursultan Nazarbayev, initiated the formation of the IFAS in 1993 with other Central Asian \nleaders (Idrissov, 2013, as cited in O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023). Because of its strategic geographical \nposition and economy based on water resources, Kazakhstan plays an important role in the IFAS. Thus, \nthe country presents itself as an active promoter of sustainable water distribution and pres ervation of the  \nAral Sea ecosystem, underpinning its diplomatic weight at the Central Asian level (Zhanalieva, 2020). \nMoreover, Kazakhstan attracts international donors to solve ecological problems and strengthen its \nleading positions in the region in water policy (Zhana lieva, 2020).  \nThe country \u2019s efforts included supporting local communities, in particular, through the \nrenovation of the fishing industry. Some fish -processing plants and hatcheries, such as the \nAtamekenrybprom, have been built by the government to support local fishing (Aitkhozha, 2017, as \ncited in Nechayeva, 2017). Over 5,000 relocated to work in its revitalised fishing industry, which \nincreased 8.8 times between 2000 and 2011. This serves as a relevant teaching moment for countries \nfaced with a similar ecological catas trophe (Aitkhozha, 2017, as cited in Nechayeva, 2017).  \nKazakhstan became the IFAS chairman in 2024. According to Zauresh Alimbetova, acting \nexecutive director of the IFAS, the first priority project to be implemented under Kazakhstan \u2019s current \nchairmanship is the World Bank \u2019s North Aral Development and Restoration Project, which will lead to \nthe restoration of the Saryshyganak Bay and, subsequently, allow the Aral Sea to reach Aral \n(Zhakibayeva, 2024). Kazakhstan has put forward a number of strategic options to achieve this goal, \nthus emphasising its commitment  to finding new solutions. This unwavering commitment allows \nKazakhstan to not only actively address the most pressing environmental issues related to the Aral Sea \ncrisis, but also further strengthen its relationship with the World Bank (Zhakibayeva, 2024) .  \n \nAnalysis and Discussion  \n \nThe international community has recognised Kazakhstan \u2019s leadership in mitigating the Aral Sea \ncrisis, thereby building its global image and diplomatic relations. Leaders of international organisations \nand some media representations have positively commented on Kazakhstan \u2019s actions and recognised a \ncountry as a leader in the Aral Sea crisis. In 2008, the World Bank \u2019s President Robert Zoellick called \nFormer President Nazarbayev a visionary, using Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental efforts as an example of \nlife-changi ng change in the region (Golovnina, 2008, as cited in O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023). In addition, \nin 2022, USAID hailed Kazakhstan as a \u201cregional leader in integrated water resource management\u201d due \nto its contributions toward sustainable practices and water conservation within Central Asia. The EXPO \n2017 showed the  environmental feats of Kazakhstan, which was reported in Forbes as an important \nmoment when Kazakhstan sealed its international role (Rapoza, 2017, as cited in O \u2019Neill & Primiano, \n2023).  \nIn 2018, the BBC, a British public service broadcaster, called Kazakhstan \u201cthe country that \nbrought a sea back to life\u201d (Chen, 2018). The article provided a brief comparative analysis of Kazakhstan \nand Uzbekistan policies, interviewing local people. The re sult of the analysis was that Kazakhstan had \nmore positive outcomes in comparison with its neighbour (Chen, 2018). In the 1990s both of them were \nmoving towards similar results. However, the situation changed after the intervention of the World Bank, \nwhich  allocated 87 million dollars (66 million pounds) to Kazakhstan for the implementation of the \nrescue project (Chen, 2018). As part of the project, a 12 -kilometre dam was erected, blocking the narrow \nstrait between the Northern and Southern Aral Seas, which  reduced water losses in the southern part. \nAdditionally, the system of water channels of the Syr Darya River, originating in the Tian Shan \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n26  Mountains, was modernised, which contributed to an increase in the water flow into the Northern Aral \nSea. According to BBC, the Northern Aral Sea in Kazakhstan is undergoing a renaissance \u2013 both water \nand economic activity have returned to the region (Chen, 2018). In 2006, the total volume of fish caught \nreached 1,360 tons, the bulk of which was flounder. By 2016, with the return of freshwater species such \nas walleye, bream, rapeseed and catf ish, the Aral Fish Inspection recorded an increase in catch to 7,1 06 \ntons (Chen, 2018). A comparison of Kazakhstan \u2019s efforts with those of Uzbekistan was later used as an \naddition to showing Kazakhstan \u2019s successes. The article highlights that, while in Uzbekistan, the World \nBank has also implemented several projects to restore existing reservoirs around the Southern Aral Sea, \nsuch as Lake Sudochye. However, the results were not as successful as in Kazakh stan because of \nUzbekistan \u2019s high demand for water resources. A significant part of the Amu Darya River is used for \nirrigation of agricultural land because Uzbekistan \u2019s economy depends on cotton production. From 1930 \nto 1990, more than two -thirds of the cotton produced in the Soviet Union was supplied by Uzbekistan, \nwhich also remains the fifth largest cotton exporter in the world after the United States, India, Brazil and \nAustralia. This leaves insufficient water to replenish the Southern Aral Sea, which has practically \ndisappeared, and local residents are suffering from deteriorating air quality (Chen, 2018).  \nA French state -owned publicly funded international news television network, France 24, presented \nKazakhstan\u2019s actions within a broader regional and historical context, focusing on its collaboration \nwith the World Bank ( France , 2016 ; France 24, 2025). According to the Ministry of Water Resources \nof Kazakhstan, since 2008, the volume of water in the northern part of the Aral Sea has increased by \n42%, reaching 27 billion cubic metres (France 24, 2025).  \nAlongside BBC and France 24, the EU Reporter, a Brussels -based news website, also presented \nKazakhstan \u2019s role in the restoration of the Aral Sea ( EU Reporter, n.d. ; Stevens, 2024). In the article, \nStevens (2024) highlights Kazakhstan \u2019s leadership, innovation, and sustainable development measures. \nThe active strategies and methods of sustainable management of water resources made it possible to \nreverse a serious environmental disaster (Stevens, 2024). The Kok aral dam project, modernization of \nirrigation syst ems and regional agreements on the sharing of water resources, Kazakhstan \u2019s work with \nthe Central Asia Regional Environmental Centre are also used as an example of the country \u2019s leadership \nin this matter. Unlike the BBC and France 24, the EU Reporter looks at the situation on a broader global \nscale, positioning Kazakhstan as a model for international efforts to restore the environment. The article \nconsiders Kazakhstan as an exam ple of other countries facing similar environmental crises, which further \nstreng thens Kazakhstan \u2019s image as a responsible and innovative global player (Stevens, 2024).  \nThis research paper focused on the proactive role of Kazakhstan in resolving the crisis of the \nAral Sea and its effects on the improvement of the country \u2019s international position and the development \nof regional cooperation. In the introduction, the following research questions were provided: whether \nproactive measures of Kazakhstan in addressing the Aral Sea crisis enhance its international \nrepresentation a nd cooperation. Made content analysis indicates that, in the case of the crisis of the Aral \nSea, Kazak hstan \u2019s government \u2019s approach has improved its standing in the international community. It \nhas successfully positioned itself as an environmental governance leader, addressing the most local \necological challenges while simultaneously strengthening its diplomatic profile. The  growing \nrecognition of Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental initiatives by major international media outlets, including \nthe BBC, France 24, and the EU Reporter, demonstrates the media \u2019s role in shaping Kazakhstan \u2019s \nreputation worldwide. As a resu lt, Kazakhstan is seen not only as a leader in environmental restoration \nin the region but also as a developing diplomatic force in global efforts to ensure sustainable \ndevelopment. Such media coverage strengthens Kazakhstan \u2019s position in international relations, proving \nthat an active environmental policy can strengthen the country \u2019s soft power and global influence. This \nis aligned with the fact that environmentalism can be a key factor in shaping national identity and \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n27  international relations (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023). Specifically, Kazakhstan \u2019s investments in \nrehabilitation projects, such as the Kok aral Dam, have brought about a marked improvement in local \necosystems and livelihoods, reinforcing its image of being a responsible regional player dedicated to \nsustainable development.  \nFurthermore, the analysis reveals several key patterns. First, Kazakhstan \u2019s proactive measures \nhave resulted in increased international collaboration. The successful recovery of the Northern Aral Sea \nhas drawn the attention of international organisations, such as the World Bank and various UN agencies, \nwhich have provided financ ial support for ongoing projects. This illustrates ways in which Kazakhstan \nis using international partnerships to strengthen its environmental initiatives (Bernauer & Siegfried, \n2012). Second, Kazakhstan \u2019s alignment of its environmental policy with broader foreign policy goals \ndemonstrates a strategic view of diplomacy. Strategy 2050 emphasises its ambitions to become a pivotal \nplayer in global sustainable development, reflecting a commitment to addressing  historical \nenvironmental injustices inherited from Soviet policies. This dual reliance on domestic ecological \nrestoration and international representation underlines the interconnectedness of environmental \ngovernance and foreign pol icy.  \nHowever, an unexpected conclusion was found regarding the tension between Kazakhstan \u2019s \neconomic ambitions and its dedication to sustainable development. Despite the significant progress made \nin restoring the Aral Sea, there remains a tension between promoting environmentally sustainable \npractices and continuing to export fossil fuels. This  finding suggests that while Kazakhstan seeks to \nenhance its international reputation through environmental initiatives, underlying economic motivations \nmay hinder compreh ensive sustainability efforts. The significance of this tension lies in its potential to \nundermine long -term ecological goals if not addressed within national economic planning (O \u2019Neill & \nPrimiano, 2023; Micklin, 2004).  \nDespite these positive findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. One notable weakness \nis the dependence on foreign finances by international organisations which could bring up a question of \nsustainability in terms of Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental efforts. Moreover, political interests influence \ndecision -making, meaning short -term policies for ecosystem restoration rather than long -term ones. \nThen there is the fact that Kazakhstan is one of the leading fossil fuel providers in the wo rld. The \nvariables  involved could affect the overall validity of the findings because some might not have been \ntaken into consideration in this present study (O \u2019Neill & Primiano, 2023; Micklin, 2004).  \nIn analysing the research question, \u201cHow have Kazakhstan\u2019s initiatives in addressing the Aral \nSea crisis been portrayed in foreign traditional media? \u201d the speculation that natural activities of \nKazakhstan have had a positive effect on its image and conciliatory relations within the locale is backed \nby the findings . International organisations, such as the World Bank and United Nations, alongside \nUSAID and worldwide media, such as BBC, France 24, and the EU Reporter, have all frequently \nascribed Kazakhstan f or environmental administration and maintainable improvement authority. The \nKokaral Dam venture, coupled with modernization in water system frameworks, altogether reestablished \nthe Northern Aral Sea and moved forward nearby environments. The support of international \norganisations and the positive attitude of the media are all evidence  of Kazakhstan \u2019s growing positive \nimage. This gives validity to the view that Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental arrangement has effectively \nsituated the nation as a territorial frontr unner in participation and worldwide natural administration.  \nMoreover, the findings highlight the pressures between Kazakhstan \u2019s natural desire and financial \ninterface. In spite of Kazakhstan \u2019s victory with the revival of the Aral Sea, its status as a noteworthy \nexporter of fossil powers puts an address check on the long -term achievability of its natural drive. Its \neconomic interest in the diligent exportation of fossil fuels has the inclinatio n to weaken Kazakhstan \u2019s \ncommon commitment to environmental sustainability. This creates a complication within the \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n28  discretionary position of Kazakhstan, whereby financial interfaces are likely to urge within the way of \ntotal achievement of its natural objectives. Thus,  whereas the speculation is by and large affirmed, these \nbasic strains recommend that the reasonability of Kazakhstan \u2019s natural arrangement may be \ncompromised by its broader economic ambitions . \nThe study confirms that Kazakhstan \u2019s dynamic natural measures have generally enhanced its \ninternational recognition, which has been viewed as a sign of economic progress and a responsible \nterritorial leader. There are financial issues that could potentially limit the long -term success of th ese \nnatural measures, particularly the assumed reliance on fossil fuels. The research also presents \ncomplexities that need to be investigated beforehand, even though the theory is highly supported.  \n \nConclusions  \n \nThis paper explored Kazakhstan \u2019s efforts to address the crisis in the Aral Sea and its implications \nfor international representation and media engagement. The ability to showcase successful \nenvironmental initiatives enhances Kazakhstan \u2019s bargaining power in global negotiations and positions \nit as a leader in regional environmental governance. Considering the scarce literature at the intersection \nof these variables, findings indicate proactive behaviour may be related to an increase in th e international \nstanding of Kazakhstan and the development of international collaboration on global environmental \nissues. A solution to the Aral Sea crisis seems to potentially enhance the country \u2019s prestige and position \nin the international arena. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of how environmental \ngovernance can serve as a tool for enhancing national identity and international relations.  \nThe lack of complete data inhibits making any conclusive judgments regarding the impact of \nthese programs on the image of Kazakhstan. Further research is needed to investigate this relationship \nin much greater detail, which should focus on the long -term im plications of Kazakhstan \u2019s environmental \npolicies for regional stability and cooperation, as climate change continues to intensify tensions in \nCentral Asia over water resources. Academics can delve deeper into these dynamics to find more insight \nin their a nalyses of the relationship between environmental governance and geopolitics in the region. \nBetter insight into how environment -related initiatives strengthen a nation \u2019s international image has \nmuch to teach not only Kazakhstan but also other countries grappling with similar environmental \nchallenges.  \nFunding details:  None.  \nDisclosure statement:  Author has nothing to disclose.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSDU Journal of Media Studies 2025/1 (1)  \n  \n29   \nReferences  \nAitkhozha, M.

The book aims to illumin-\nate IFLA \u2019s extensive history over the past century,\noffering a critical and interdisciplinary re \ufb02ection on\nthe broad social impacts of IFLA and the library pro-\nfession. The project invites contributors to engagewith IFLA \u2019s impact at both regional and global\nlevels and to consider the ways in which IFLA andthe\ufb01eld have impacted society, culture, and the infor-\nmation professions.\n1As libraries have functioned as\nboth cultural symbols and pillars of community resili-\nence, the history of IFLA embodies broader narratives\nof adaptation and innovation amidst visons for societalprogress that have characterized the library and infor-\nmation science (LIS) \ufb01eld since its inception.\nLibrary history and the \u201chistory of the\npresent \u201d\nThis special issue and the Library History SIG \u2019s plans\nfor an edited book on IFLA \u2019s history aim to ensure\nthat the history of LIS professions isn \u2019t overlooked\namidst the rapid social and technological changes\nthat are impacting libraries and information organiza-\ntions. Whether because of the proliferation of arti \ufb01cial\nintelligence (AI) or ongoing concerns about how\nknowledge and information are produced and evalu-\nated in an era when truth and shared realities arecontested, it is essential that the history of libraries iskept alive through methodological frameworks that\nreveal the interconnectedness of historical events andcontemporary phenomena. Michel Foucault \u2019s\nconcept of the \u201chistory of the present \u201doffers a frame-\nwork that allows us to use historical inquiry toexamine current practices in the LIS \ufb01eld (Foucault,\n1980). The \ufb01eld tends to use its history to memorialize\nitself in ways that re \ufb02ect contemporary priorities yet\nmay eschew historical evidence. As David Garlanddescribes, Foucault \u2019s genealogical method can help\nremedy the \ufb01eld\u2019s myopia by using history to critique\ncontemporary institutions by revealing the dynamicsand socio-political factors that have shaped them(Garland, 2014). Drawing upon Foucault \u2019s work\nhelps to remind us that power produces knowledge,and that a knowledge of history can help improvethe present by giving us a critical and skeptical lens\nthrough which to view ourselves and the institutions\nwe build.\nEmphasis on the contingencies of history resonates\nwith Alistair Black \u2019s work on both library and infor-\nmation history, which explores the complex and per-vasive role of information across different social\ncontexts. Black argues that \u201cinformation history \u201d\nshould not be con \ufb01ned to narrow de \ufb01nitions but\nrather encompass a broad set of information activities,\nincluding the history of libraries, publishing, and\ninformation management (Black, 1995, 2006). By\ntracing the \u201chistory of the present, \u201dwe can more crit-\nically re-examine the heritage and evolution of library\norganizations, exposing the transformations they have\nundergone in response to technological advances andcontinuous social change that increasingly challenge\nnotions of \u201chow information becomes information \u201d\n(Mak and Renear, 2023).\nThrough this work, it is important to also re \ufb02ect on\nhow our understanding of the present and its relation\nto library and information history is situated withinbroader global trends. Akira Iriye \u2019s notion of trans-\nnational history provides another valuable perspective\n(Iriye, 2013). By placing the development of libraries\nwithin the context of transnational movements, wegain a more nuanced understanding of how library\npractices, in \ufb02uenced by international collaboration,Editorial\nInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions2024, Vol. 50(4) 691 \u2013695\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024Article reuse guidelines:sagepub.com/journals-permissionsDOI: 10.1177/03400352241299307\njournals.sagepub.com/home/i \ufb02\nuniversalized standards, and globalized information\nnetworks, contribute to a shared global society that\nis increasingly viewed as a global information\nsociety. This approach highlights the critical need topreserve the heritage and activities of professionalassociations and institutions that constitute the\nbroader transnational LIS community. As trans-\nnational and technological forces converge, theboundaries between the local and the global, the\nembodied and the disembodied, continue to blur, chal-\nlenging both the historiographical approaches tolibrary history and the roles libraries play in both\nlocal and global information systems.\nThese ideas are furthered by Paul James \u2019notion of\n\u201cdisembodied globalization, \u201da concept that can help\nunderscore the relevance of studying library history\nthrough a critical lens. James contends that disembod-ied globalization, mediated through technologies suchas digital platforms, data \ufb02ows, and technoscience, has\nbecome the dominant form of global interaction(James, 2023). Libraries, of course, sit at the middleof the transformation James describes. This mode of\nglobalization prioritizes virtual, immaterial exchanges\nover embodied interactions, leading to the reframingof social relations \u2014including how institutions like\nlibraries connect with users, organize knowledge,provide access, and preserve cultural heritage. In thiscontext, the study of library history, especiallyframed around the global LIS community that IFLA\nforms, must account for the ways in which the\nhistory of technological mediation and the evolutiontoward \u201cdisembodied globalization \u201dhave reshaped\nhow libraries ful \ufb01ll their roles and serve publics that\nremain embodied and largely local in scope andmission.\nThis theoretical framework enhances our under-\nstanding of the ongoing digitization of libraries andthe shifting power dynamics that govern information\naccess and preservation in an increasingly intercon-\nnected world. As we re \ufb02ect on the history of IFLA\nand other library associations, it becomes evidentthat social and technological change are continuously\nin dialogue as the functions and structures of our insti-\ntutions evolve over time. Libraries, called to serveembodied community-centered activities and physical\ncollections are also an active part of the global infor-\nmation infrastructure they helped create. This specialissue and subsequent activities of the IFLA Library\nHistory SIG aim to encourage the writing of library\nhistory in a manner that is sensitive to the profession \u2019s\nown power and positionality within changing social\nstructures in order to help plot a path forward during\ntimes when information and knowledge are moreand more important within a world caught up incultural, technological, structural, and environmentalupheaval.\nOrganization of this special issue on library\nhistory\nArticles in this issue are drawn from both the Library\nHistory SIG meeting in Mons and general submissions\nto the journal that aligned well with the issue \u2019s theme.\nThe discussions presented at the Library Historymeeting in Mons emphasized the importance of cap-turing both celebrated and overlooked aspects of the\nrecord-keeping processes of library associations, as\nwell as key themes relevant to library history moregenerally. To facilitate a more coherent understanding,the articles presented can be organized into three dis-\ntinct categories: Archival Practices and Institutional\nMemory, International Collaboration and the Role ofLibraries in Global Information Systems, and\nLibraries as Cultural Institutions.\nArchival practices and institutional\nmemory\nThe importance of archives in preserving institutional\nmemory is a central theme explored in several of the\narticles in this issue. Libraries, library associations,\nand documentation centers are not merely collectionsof information but are also responsible for safeguard-\ning their institutional history. Alistair Black \u2019s work\npositions library associations as meta-memory organi-\nzations, responsible for their immediate services while\nalso preserving their archives (Black, 2024). By revi-\nsiting the concept of lieux de m\u00e9moire (sites of\nmemory), Black examines how library associationsmaintain their heritage while highlighting instances\nof archival neglect. This discussion is particularly rele-\nvant in the context of IFLA \u2019s centenary, as the organi-\nzation \u2019s legacy rests not only on its activities and their\nimpacts but also on the archives and records that havedocumented its actions and decisions over the pastcentury.\nJenny Bossaller and Tatjana Aparac-Jelu \u0161ic extend\nthis conversation by focusing on the archival practicesof professional associations such as the Association\nfor Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T)\n(Bossaller and Aparac-Jelu \u0161ic, 2024). Their work\nhighlights the value of archiving records that extendbeyond of \ufb01cial publications \u2014such as correspond-\nence, voting outcomes, and internal decision-makingprocesses \u2014which are often overlooked but are critical\nfor understanding the social and political dynamics\nthat shape library associations.692 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nCara Bertram \u2019s study of the American Library\nAssociation Archives at the University of Illinois pro-\nvides a testament to the evolving nature of archival\npractices (Bertram, 2024). Bertram details how theAmerican Library Association \u2019s digital transformation\nhas enabled greater access to its historical records,\nthereby preserving its heritage for future generations.\nSuch practices underscore the broader signi \ufb01cance of\narchives, both as preservers of organizational history\nand as proactive instruments that shape future direc-\ntions for library associations, including IFLA.\nMary Carroll et al. provide a detailed examination\nof Charles Sturt University \u2019s efforts to document the\npublic output of school libraries and teacher librarian-ship in Australia and New Zealand from 1900 to the\npresent (2024). By creating a digital corpus of text,\nthe Knowledge Bank of Australian and New ZealandLibraries provides insights into how digital humanitiestechniques can inform histor ical work while helping to\nilluminate the development and impact of teacher librar-ianship in Australia and New Zealand.\nDeborah Schachter and Debbie Millward contribute\na unique perspective on the rise and fall of theVancouver Sun andVancouver Province newspaper\nlibrary, utilizing oral history to understand the dynam-\nics surrounding the dissolution of its collections\n(Schachter and Millward, 2024). Their narrativeserves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of insti-tutional memory and the necessity of safeguarding\nvaluable records to maintain cultural heritage.\nPaola Castellucci \u2019sr e\ufb02ection on the evolution of\nthe National Collective Archive of Periodicals andthe legacy of Paolo Bisogno is another example of\nthe importance of libraries in preserving culturalmemory (2024). Castellucci \u2019s analysis emphasizes\nthe important role of this periodical archive but alsoasks important questions about how to historize andremember the history of documentation represented\nin Bisogno \u2019s work.\nInternational collaboration and the role of\nlibraries in global information systems\nAnother recurring theme is the role of international\ncollaboration in the development of libraries as partof a broader global information infrastructure. Peter\nLor\u2019s article on IFLA \u2019s history provides an in-depth\noverview of the organization \u2019s activities and its sig-\nni\ufb01cance on the international stage (Lor, 2024a). His\nanalysis of IFLA \u2019s historiography re \ufb02ects the central-\nity of libraries to information access, public engage-\nment, and knowledge production on a global scale.\nW. Boyd Rayward \u2019s examination of the\nUNESCO-sponsored World Science InformationSystem (UNISIST) and the 1974 IntergovernmentalConference on Documentation further emphasizes\nthe in \ufb02uence of international collaboration\n(Rayward, 2024). Rayward presents an account of\nhow geopolitical developments and changes in inter-national organizations such as UNESCO affected the\nprogress and ambitions of the global library commu-\nnity. This analysis serves as a reminder of thebroader context in which IFLA has operated, navigat-\ning the challenges and opportunities posed by the\nchanging landscape of international informationcooperation.\nPeter Lor \u2019s second contribution on the International\nCommittee on Intellectual Cooperation and itsSubcommittee for Bibliography highlights the histor-\nical signi \ufb01cance of cooperative initiatives among\nlibraries and bibliographic institutions during the\nearly 20th century (Lor, 2024b). Such collaborationbetween international bodies, including those initiated\nby Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine, illustrates the\npersistent ambition to connect libraries beyondborders \u2014a goal that has been fundamental to\nIFLA \u2019s mission since its founding in 1927.\nYasuyo Inoue \u2019s article on the international in \ufb02u-\nence over Japanese libraries before World War II\nexplores how a combination of civil society actors\nand Japanese librarians engaged in internationalexchanges and library activities, re \ufb02ecting the global\ninterconnectedness of library practices and the\ncomplex dynamics between national and international\nidentities (Inoue, 2024). This analysis of cultural dip-lomacy aligns with the need to examine how develop-\nments in the profession intersect with both local and\ninternational political currents, thus in \ufb02uencing per-\nspectives on library history.\nJorge Prado \u2019s article on the representation of\ncountries in IFLA adds another layer to this cat-egory, examining how global participation in\nIFLA has been shaped by national representation\n(2024). Prado \u2019s work reveals the importance of\nexpanding diversity within IFLA, particularly toensure that Global South countries such as those\nin Latin America and Africa play a more prominent\nrole. This call for greater inclusivity and regionalrepresentation is critical for fostering a more equit-\nable global information network, aligning with\nIFLA \u2019s mission of strengthening libraries world-\nwide for more literate, informed, and participatory\nsocieties.\nLibraries as cultural institutions\nThe third category pertains to the role of libraries ascultural institutions and their responsibilities inWitt: Libraries at the intersection of history and the present 693\npreserving and fostering knowledge across communi-\nties. Libraries have long functioned not only as reposi-\ntories of information but also as active agents in\ncultural preservation and community identity forma-tion. The articles in this category underscore the multi-faceted roles libraries have played in societal\ndevelopment, cultural preservation, and navigating\ncomplex cultural landscapes.\nMatilde Fontanin \u2019s exploration of the code-\nbreakers \u2019reading library at Bletchley Park offers a\ncompelling perspective on the role that librariesplayed during moments of national crisis (2024).\nAdditionally, it provides a compelling case on the\nuse of multiple forms of primary source evidence,from material objects to oral histories.\nRaffaella Vincenti \u2019s study on the Vatican Library\npresents an insightful examination of the complexdual role of such an institution \u2014as both a preserver\nof intellectual heritage and as an evolving entity\nmeeting the demands of contemporary information\naccess (2024). The Vatican Library, with its historic-ally signi \ufb01cant collections, serves as a testament to\nthe challenges faced by cultural institutions seekingto balance preservation and the necessity for increaseddigital access.\nJeffrey Garrett \u2019s discussion of Carl Sagan and the\nrole of libraries in human intellectual evolution posi-tions libraries as extensions of human cognition,re\ufb02ecting their broader cultural and educational sig-\nni\ufb01cance (Garrett, 2024). Drawing on Marshall\nMcLuhan, Garrett illustrates how libraries have func-tioned as critical agents in the preservation and dis-\nsemination of accumulated human wisdom. This\nportrayal resonates with the concept of libraries asactive cultural institutions, continually adapting and\ninterpreting knowledge to ensure its relevance across\ntime. Libraries, in this sense, are not static entitiesbut are deeply embedded in the ongoing cultural evo-\nlution of humans as a species that has come to domin-\nate the planet.\nConclusion\nThe articles in this special issue highlight the centralimportance of library history, not merely as a recordof institutional development but as a critical lens\nthrough which we can examine the evolving relation-\nship between knowledge, culture, and society.Libraries, as dynamic cultural institutions, have con-sistently responded to societal shifts, technological\nadvancements, and global transformations.\nUnderstanding their historical context helps us seehow libraries preserve cultural memory, support soci-\neties, and shape intellectual life.As we continue to confront the challenges posed by\ndigitization, AI, and globalization, the preservation oflibrary history becomes even more critical. Libraries\nplay a unique role in both safeguarding the past andnavigating an uncertain future, where the boundariesbetween local and global, physical and digital, authen-\ntic and generated, are increasingly blurred. The cap-\nacity of libraries and the profession to adapt andevolve ensures they remain both vital to their commu-\nnities and integral to the broader global information\nsystems they help sustain. In this regard, the studyof library history is not simply an academic exercise\nbut an essential part of understanding how knowledge\nis produced, preserved, shared, and contested in acomplex world.\nSteven Witt\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA\nDeclaration of con \ufb02icting interests\nThe author declared no potential con \ufb02icts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nFunding\nThe author received no \ufb01nancial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.See https://www.i \ufb02a.org/news/call-for-book-chapter-\nproposals-on-the-history-of-the-international-federation-of-library-associations-and-institutions/ for call forproposals.\nReferences\nBertram C (2024) Preserving the history of the American Library\nAssociation.

Yet the efforts of\nassociations to secure their own history and protect t heir corporate memory for the future, especially in\nterms of safeguarding their internal archives, appear patchy. The ideas of the French historian Pierre Nora\nare examined, particularly his concept of lieux de m \u00b4emoire (\u201csites of memory\u201d), alongside associated concepts\nof invented tradition and heritage , which can be seen to intersect with the memorializing proclivities of\nnational associations. Evidence i s presented from a modest 2008 study o f the archival policies of national\nlibrary and information associations worldwide, report ed by IFLA\u2019s Library History Section. It is important\nto revisit this study because little p ublicity was given to it at the time; also, it provides a context for a recent\ncase study undertaken by the author of the archival pra ctices of the UK\u2019s Chartered Institute of Library and\nInformation Professionals.\nKeywords\nNational library and information associ ations, archives, collective memory, lieux de m \u00b4emoire , Chartered\nInstitute of Library and Information Professionals\nLibrary and information institutions are in essence\nmemory organizations, preserving and making acces-\nsible accumulated stocks of knowledge and culture\nperpetually created by the flow of time (Byrne,\n2015). Consequently, more than many professions,\nthe library and information professions should, in an\nideal world, possess a keen awareness of the impor-\ntance of their own histories and professional memory,\nrequiring that attention be paid to managing the\narchives created by past professional practice.\nReplicating the essential memory function of\nlibrary and information institutions, national library\nand information associations can be conceptualized as\nmeta -memory organizations, with one of their main\nroles\u2014their primary role perhaps\u2014being the oversee-\ning and facilitating of the efforts of member organi-\nzations to stock and preserve the records of human\nexistence for future recall and use. Yet evidence sug-\ngests that the achievements of national associations to\nsecure their own history and to safeguard professional\nmemory are extremely uneven. Associations occupy\nplaces on a wide spectrum, ranging at one end fromthe proficient curation of professional memory,\nbacked up by good archival practices, to severe\nprofessional amnesia at the other, where little or no\nattention is paid to maintaining archival materials.\nCollective memory and history\nHaving introduced the word \u201cmemory\u201d into the\ndiscussion, an investigation of the concept is required.\nThis will involve, in the section that follows, an anal-\nysis of the ideas of the French theorist Pierre Nora\nand, in particular, his conceptualization of lieux de\nm\u00b4emoire (\u201csites of memory\u201d) and milieux de m \u00b4emoire\n(\u201ccontexts of memory\u201d), both of which link into the\nrecent upsurge of interest in heritage culture, from\nwhich library and information institutions have drawn\nsustenance.

Memories, the\nliterature tells us, are of two kinds\u2014individual and\ncollective\u2014and both have contributed to a recent\n\u201cmemory boom\u201d (Olick et al., 2011b: 3). Individual\nmemories are what we personally know, believe, and\nfeel. They are the fundamen tal units of collective\nmemory, a useful analogy for which is public opinion\n(Schwartz, 2016: 11), which is invariably flavored\nwith historical perception. The location of collective\nmemory\u2014\u201cpopular memory\u201d might be a synonym\n(Samuel, 1994: 3)\u2014ranges from the family, the local\ncommunity, and the social or racial group to the\nnation and even beyond, to the global (the Holocaust,\nfor example, is a prime example of what might be\nconsidered to be a \u201cglobalised memory culture\u201d\n(Legg, 2005: 497)). Collective memory can also be\norganizational or professional\u2014the foci, indeed, of\nthis study.\nOne strain of discussion in the discourse of\nmemory studies is the tension, perceived by some,\nbetween collective memory and history. Stereotypi-\ncally, collective memory has been seen as authentic\nand spontaneous, even emotional, as in the case of\nfolklore and the oral tradition. By contrast, history\nis conceptualized as rational and scientific, its find-\nings submitted to judgement in the courts of empirical\nproof (Samuel, 1994: ix). The way we look at the past,\nit is proposed, is split between memory and history.\nMemory occurs naturally and is the vehicle for trans-\nmitting information about the past down the genera-\ntions. History is an intellectual activity and is often\noverseen by state and academic institutions.\nIn reality, the division between history and\nmemory is unhelpful and difficult to defend. In fact,\nit might be more appropriate to see the two as being\nlocked in an \u201cintimate embrace\u201d rather than in an\naggressive duel (Legg, 2005: 500). There are a num-\nber of reasons that support this proposition. Both col-\nlective memory and history can be considered fallible\nor, as Schwartz (2016: 12) has put it, \u201cinherently sub-\nject to distortion.\u201d Both can be warped and selective.\nBoth operate with the present in mind. The capacity of\nhumans to twist the past to their liking for contempo-\nrary purposes, by influencing either popular memory\nor the production of history, is \u201cuniversal and infinite\u201d\n(Schwartz, 2016: 9). History has often been written by\nthe \u201cwinners,\u201d which can be broadly conceived tocontain the literate, the powerful, and triumphant\nnations and dynasties. Further, it has been\nconstructed, the argument goes, by elitist professional\nhistorians who buy into particular discourses that have\nmore to do with the present than the reality of the past.\nHistory is produced\u2014reproduced indeed\u2014mostly\nthrough the filter of a professional academic class.\nIn the anti-history and anti-historian vocabulary of\nMichel Foucault, history is a form of knowledge that\nclaims neutrality and objectivity but is, in fact, the\nproduct of academic experts operating in positions\nof power (Poster, 1982: 119). History, therefore,\nmight be seen as a fabricated intellectual activity.\nFurther, it is forever incomplete, the result of perpe-\ntual reconstructions of the past influenced by the pres-\nent. However, collective memory can hardly be\nposited as any more \u201ctruthful.\u201d It can be shot through\nwith myths and falsehoods forged in the mists of time.\nCollective memory, like history, is selective, for we\nforget as much as, if not more than, we remember.\nCollective memory is \u201cunconscious of its successive\ndeformations, vulnerable to manipulation and appro-\npriation, susceptible to being long dormant and peri-\nodically revived\u201d (Nora, 1989: 8).\nCollective memory also has the problem, in terms\nof the pursuit of historical truth, that it is by definition\njoined at the hip with collective identity, which is\ncharacterized less by \u201cscience\u201d than emotion. But for\nthe historian, the association with collective identity\nis perhaps less a problem than an opportunity\u2014that is,\nan opportunity for exciting analysis. With the frag-\nmentation of society and the commensurate rise of\npluralism, collective identities have changed. Partic-\nular niche identities\u2014often repressed identities linked\nto unfulfilled claims and lingering injustices\u2014have\nemerged (Olick et al., 2011b: 3). One thinks of sexual\nand ethnic minorities in this respect. By contrast,\nthere has been a parallel decline in unifying identities\nb a s e do nc o l l e c t i v ea s p i r a t i o n sa n di d e o l o g i e s .\nNationalism and social class spring to mind here.\nLieux de m \u00b4emoire, milieux de m \u00b4emoire ,\nand heritage\nThe weakening of staple unifying identities and the\nresulting dilution of large-scale, homogenous, univer-\nsal collective memory has spawned a reaction in the\nform of investment in what in the 1980s the French\nhistorian Pierre Nora called lieux de m \u00b4emoire (con-\nsciously constructed sites, or realms, of memory), as\nopposed to m i l i e u xd em \u00b4emoire (environments, or\ncontexts, of memory). Nora\u2019s project on memory,\nwhich drew on the work of the early 20th-century\nFrench sociologist Maurice Halbwacks (1992) and697 Black: Memory and amnesia in the archival practices of national library and information associations\nf o c u s e do nF r e n c hh i s t o r ya n dc u l t u r e ,p r o d u c e d\nseven edited volumes between 1984 and 1992,\ncomprising over 100 essays from French scholars.\nOnly three were translated into English, in the\n1990s. But before these English translations, Nora\u2019s\nwork and theories were brought to the attention of\nEnglish-speaking readers with the publication of an\nessay by him summarizing his ideas in the journal\nRepresentations (Nora, 1989).\nFor Nora, true milieux de m \u00b4emoire are organic, and\ntypically associated with local, premodern, archaic\u2014\nand certainly primitive\u2014s ocieties (Legg, 2005:\n481, 494). In this regard, Nora\u2019s propositions bear\na similarity to Ferdinand To \u00a8nnies\u2019 concepts of\nGemeinschaft (an organic and archetypally rural com-\nmunity) and Gesellschaft (an associational and arche-\ntypally industrial society) (Harris, 2001). Nora is\nnostalgic for what he sees as real collective memory,\nformilieux de m \u00b4emoire , he argues, are now rarely in\nevidence.\nThe opposite is true of lieux de m \u00b4emoire ,s a y s\nNora. Lieux de m \u00b4emoire are receptacles of memory,\nvehicles of commemoration or memorialization. They\ncan obviously be places (reflecting the direct transla-\ntion from the French), but are also events, concepts,\nperformances, or publications. These serve as mne-\nmonic devices (artifacts or activities that aid human\nmemory). Infused with symbolic meaning, lieux de\nm\u00b4emoire are sites where collective memory is crystal-\nlized as representational components of communal\nidentity that monumentalize the past (Frier, 2019:\n40; Legg, 2005: 496). What all lieux de m \u00b4emoire have\nin common is an ability to provoke an emotional\nresponse (Legg, 2005: 482). They are far removed,\ntherefore, from being harbors of true memory. They\nare pictured, in effect, as cenotaphs\u2014\u201cliterally empty\ngraves\u201d (Legg, 2005: 495).\nL i e u xd em \u00b4emoire are realms of memory that\n\u201ccommemorate and sanctif y\u201d the past (Schwartz,\n2016: 12). As such, they are not far removed from the\nconcept of an invented tradition. According to Hobs-\nbawm (1983: 1), an invented tradition is a set of prac-\ntices \u201cnormally governed by overtly and tacitly\naccepted rules and of a ritual or symbolic nature,\nwhich seek to inculcate certain values and norms of\nbehaviour by repetition, which automatically implies\ncontinuity with the past.\u201d Many traditions that appear\nto be old are in fact recent in origin and invented.\nFurther, they are not synonymous with customs,\nwhich can evolve, unlike traditions, which aim at\ninvariance (Hobsbawm, 1983: 2).\nAccording to Nora, lieux de m \u00b4emoire \u2014\u201cinvented\ntraditions,\u201d as some might term them\u2014have now\neclipsed milieux de m \u00b4emoire . As authentic collectivememory eroded, the need to \u201carchive and recollect\nconsciously\u201d\u2014that is, the urge to create lieux de\nm\u00b4emoire \u2014correspondingly grew (Legg, 2005: 489).\nThe tendency, Nora argued, has been for niche, local,\npre-existing, spontaneous memories to undergo\nhomogenization. What we c all collective memory,\nexplained Nora, is now, in fact,\nthe gigantic and breathtaking storehouse of a material\nstock of what it would be impossible for us to remember,\nan unlimited repertoire of what might need to be recal-\nled...an autonomous institution of museums, libraries,\ndespositories, centres of documentation, and data banks.\n(Nora, 1989: 13)\nIn other words, the practice of historical research and\nwriting, seen by some as a constructed and contrived\n\u201cscience,\u201d has become far more important than real\ncollective memory.\nNora\u2019s theories of memory have not been assessed\nwithout criticism. In virtually whatever setting one\nchooses, manifold different memories\u2014multiple\nmilieux de m \u00b4emoire \u2014have surely survived from the\ndistant past into the present (Legg, 2005: 494). For\nexample, memory can reside and survive in everyday\ngestures, habits, rituals, clothing, postures, bodily\npractices, and skills. In short, the body has the poten-\ntial to retain \u201creal\u201d memories (Legg, 2005: 494, 498).\nLike genes, culture is transmitted from one generation\nto the next. Continuing the theme of organic \u201cmemory\nfrom below,\u201d in the case of lieux de m \u00b4emoire it can be\nobserved that although the influence and impact of\nauthority is undeniable, not all acts and cultures of\ncommemoration by any means originate from author-\nity (Low and Oliver, 2012: 3). While it is true that\nincreasingly lieux de memoire are manufactured by\nauthority, from the state to corporations to various\ngroups of elites, it is also the case that many\u2014perhaps\nthe majority\u2014remain \u201cbottom-up\u201d in origin. Setti-\nmini (2021) has reported that studies on how people\nunderstand and define heritage have demonstrated\nthat \u201cnon-expert\u201d communities have the capacity,\nirrespective of the desir es of those manufacturing\nheritage \u201cfrom above,\u201d to develop specific ways in\nwhich to draw on the past to create the senses of place\nand tradition. In short, ordinary people do not neces-\nsarily buy into professional, political, and commercial\nheritage discourses. Thus, in the 1990s, the British\nhistorian Raphael Samuel (1994: 11) could be found\ncriticizing Nora for concentrating on official national\nmemory and thereby ignoring popular memory\nattached to alternative, periphery, minority, and local\n\u201cidentities of resistance.\u201d This makes logical sense\nwhen one considers that homogenizing lieux de698 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nmemoire would not be needed if free-acting had\nmostly been silenced. Clearly, not all memory can\nbe homogenized on authority\u2019s terms. Consider-\nation must be given to the power of counter-\nmemories, which challenge the core lieux de\nmemoire in circulation. Certainly, Nora\u2019s nostal-\ngia for milieux de m \u00b4emoire \u2014his perception that\nthey have evaporated\u2014gives a very negative\nimpression of the existence of a post- or late-\nmodern heterogeneous, pluralist society (Legg,\n2005: 493\u2013494, 497, 498).\nHowever, just as the creation of a definite division\nbetween history and collective memory is difficult to\ndefend, within the latter the stark separation of mili-\neux de m \u00b4emoire from lieux de m \u00b4emoire can be chal-\nlenged. For example, commemorative lieux de\nm\u00b4emoire and free-formed milieux de m \u00b4emoire might\nbe seen to have found joint expression in the burgeon-\ning heritage culture and industry (Hewison, 1987). In\nhis book Theatres of Memory , Samuel (1994)\nexplored the emergence of everyday retro-thinking\nand retro-creativity, such as the retrofitting and design\nof buildings signaling the importance of period living\nand working, retro-chic fashion, \u201cliving history\u201d\ninstallations like outdoor museums, heritage walks\nand tours, and local museums bursting at the seams\nwith interesting \u201cold things\u201d but organized with no\nthematic plan in mind. Lowenthal (1996: ix) observed\nthat we have become possessed by the past: \u201cAll at\nonce, heritage is everywhere,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe whole\nworld is busy lauding\u2014or lamenting\u2014some past, be\nit fact or fiction.\nAccording to critics of heritage\u2014the \u201cheritage\nbaiters,\u201d as Samuel (1994: 259) called them\u2014history\nhas become popular not in terms of widening the\nscope and appeal of the subject to groups previously\nhidden or excluded from it, but in a less noble way, in\nthat under the spell of heritage, history becomes sani-\ntized and simplified for commercial or \u201cpolitical\u201d rea-\nsons. The heritage mentality\u2014some might say\n\u201csentimentality\u201d\u2014has been generated by the accel-\neration of history, the increased speed and complexity\nof life, encouraging people to look to the past for more\nstable, less anxious times. Holders of power have\nbeen able to tap into this mentality in order to\n\u201cmarket\u201d heritage versions of history that are condu-\ncive to authority or vested interests, with the main-\nstream manifestations of heritage often being\n\u201cnationalist, top-down, c ommercial and tourism-\nfocused,\u201d constituting a hegemonic discourse\n(Robertson, 2016: 1). Heritage has moved from the\nprivate sphere (most obviously expressed in the popu-\nlarization of genealogy) to the public realm, where the\nmeaning of heritage conforms to a definition thatcenters on material artifacts, landscapes, mythologies,\nmemories, and traditions, which are fashioned into\ncultural, political, and economic resources for the\npresent (Howard and Graham, 2008: 3). As such, it\nis argued that heritage undermines the true past,\ndebasing it for greedy and grasping ends (Lowenthal,\n1996: x).\nHowever, there is no doubting the fact that a great\ndeal of heritage activity has been of the bottom-up\nkind\u2014what Harvey (2008: 20) refers to as \u201csmall\nheritages\u201d\u2014arising autonomously in the form of\nself-actualizing local history and heritage groups that\nexploit not only \u201cthe archive,\u201d but also memory\n(e.g. Balfron Heritage Group, 2023; Barford Heritage\nGroup, 2014; Ravensdale, 1982 ). Ordinary citizens\nconducting heritage activities autonomously brings\nthem into contact with ancestors, serves as a commu-\nnal glue, clarifies identity, and roots them in custom;\nit engenders a shared legacy in terms of family and\ncommunity, race and nation (Lowenthal, 1996: x, 2).\nIn this respect, milieux de m \u00b4emoire and lieux de\nm\u00b4emoire are fused together.\nThe intersection of memory theory\nand the history and collective memory\nof national library and information\nassociations\nAlthough Nora\u2019s focus was on French national\nhistory, his thinking, subject to qualification, can be\napplied to virtually any community, imagined or real,\nincluding that of the library and information profes-\nsions and the national institutions that represent them\nand advocate on their behalf.\nDefying any proffered divide between history and\ncollective memory, the archives of a number of\nlibrary and information associations, as well as the\nauthentic collective memory swirling around them,\nhave been tapped to produce valuable lieux de\nm\u00b4emoire in the form of national-association histories\n(e.g. Deyoung, 2020; Munford, 1976; Thomison,\n1978). Being \u201ccommemorative and congratulatory,\u201d\nas well as largely descriptive and non-theoretical,\nsuch histories conform to the lieux de m \u00b4emoire for-\nm u l a t i o n .H o w e v e r ,t h e ym i g h ta l s ob es e e nt ob e\ninfused with milieux de m \u00b4emoire in that they originate\nfrom a cultural gene pool of inherited awareness of\npast professional activity, as evidenced by the over-\nwhelming presence of library and information profes-\nsionals in the production of library and information\nhistory (Carroll and Griffith, 2023).\nL i e u xd em \u00b4emoire have certainly become more\nprominent in the library and information world.\n\u201cLieux de m\u00b4 emoire,\u201d wrote Nora (1989: 12),699 Black: Memory and amnesia in the archival practices of national library and information associations\n\u201coriginate with the sense that there is no spontaneous\nmemory, that we must deliberately create archives,\nmaintain anniversaries, organize celebrations, pro-\nnounce eulogies and notarize bills because such activ-\nities no longer occur natura lly.\u201d Typically labeled\nas \u201cstorehouses of knowledge,\u201d library and infor-\nmation professionals are better positioned philoso-\nphically than most other expert occupations to\npromote record-keeping. Indeed, the archives of\nlibrary and information institutions (certainly\nlibrary institutions) are relatively abundant, espe-\ncially in relation to the time since the normative\nformation of the profession\u2014characterized by the\nappearance of traits like pr ofessional associations,\njournals, examinations, and registration\u2014in the\nsecond half of the 19th century. As will be dis-\ncussed, however, the performance of national asso-\nciations in the area of record-keeping seemingly\ndoes not match the culture of archiving evident in\ninstitutions like public, university, national, and\neven social libraries.\nNational associations are inveterate maintainers of\nanniversaries and pronouncers of eulogies. A good\nhistorical example of this is the various commemora-\ntions of the life and service of Edward Edwards, Brit-\nain\u2019s leading professional librarian of the Victorian\nage and chief witness to the 1849 parliamentary com-\nmittee that paved the way for the inaugural Public\nLibraries Act of 1850 (Munford, 1963). In 1885,\nEdwards died in poverty and isolation in Niton on the\nIsle of Wight. In 1902, Edwards\u2019 first biographer, the\nlibrary promoter and publisher Thomas Greenwood,\npaid his debts and, in the cemetery of Niton Church,\nerected a monument over his grave, the unveiling of\nwhich was attended by librarians and representatives\nof the Library Association (LA) (Greenwood, 1902).\nIn 1912, the Manchester Libraries Committee orga-\nnized a dinner in Manchester Town Hall to celebrate\nthe centenary of Edwards\u2019 birth, Edwards having been\nthe first librarian of Manchester Public Library, itself\nthe first free municipal library to open its doors in\nBritain in 1852 (Munford, 1976: 86). In 1950, to cele-\nbrate the centenary of the Public Libraries Act, which\nEdwards had done so much to bring about, a group\nfrom the LA attended a service of commemoration at\nNiton Church and afterwards laid a wreath on\nEdwards\u2019 grave, which the LA undertook to maintain\nthereafter (Munford, 1976: 265). This commemora-\ntive trend was reinvigorated in early 2023 when the\npublic library in Niton was renamed the Edward\nEdwards Community Library (Whitmore, 2023).\nSuch actions indisputably come under the panoply\noflieux de m \u00b4emoire , as does, ironically, Edwards\u2019\nown work on the (then) current state and history oflibraries internationally, as spelt out in great detail in\nhis exhaustive and aptly named book Memoirs of\nLibraries (1859), in which, in authentic lieux de\nm\u00b4emoire fashion, he excavated and publicized \u201cthe\narchive.\u201d\nMoving into the present as well as onto a global\nlevel, an anniversary lieu de m \u00b4emoire is also exercis-\ning the minds of professionals linked to IFLA, which\ncelebrates its centenary in 2027. IFLA\u2019s Library His-\ntory Special Interest Group is seeking to compile a\ncommemorative collection of essays celebrating\nIFLA\u2019s achievements over the decades, and critically\nexamine certain themes that have emerged during its\nhistory. A major tool for accomplishing this task will\nbe documents housed in IFLA\u2019s own archive (in itself\nalieu de m \u00b4emoire ), held in the Koninklijke Bib-\nliotheek (Royal Library of the Netherlands) in The\nHague (Lor, 2022).\nFurther lieux de m \u00b4emoire connected to the\ncentenary commemorations are planned in the form\nof oral-history testimonies elicited from IFLA offi-\ncers, past and present (IFLA Library History Special\nInterest Group, 2021). This oral-history project is in\nthe tradition of certain pr ojects run at a national\nlevel. In the UK, for example, a set of 23 oral-\nhistory interviews with leading librarians, many\nclosely involved with the LA, conducted in the\n1970s was released in a \u201cLibrarians Speaking\u201d\naudio-cassette series, the lead interviewer being the\nBritish public librarian David Gerard (1974\u20131976).\nIn 2001, the UK\u2019s Library History Group (now the\nLibrary and Information H istory Group, which oper-\nates under the auspices of the Chartered Institute of\nLibrary and Information Pro fessionals (CILIP)) ini-\ntiated an \u201cElectronic Memory Project.\u201d Interviews\nwere conducted with a number of librarians about\ntheir career history, after which transcripts of the\ninterviews were placed on the Group\u2019s website\n(Library and Information History Group, 2023).\nSimilar to the capture of audio career histories are\nthe autobiographies of library and information pro-\nfessionals, of which ther e is a number of examples\n(Harrison, 2000; Hertslet, 1904; New, 2002; Savage,\n1952; Shirley, 2012; MacDougall, 2017). Both oral-\nhistory recordings or transcripts and autobiogra-\nphies, purposefully created for the \u201carchive,\u201d are\nby definition l i e u xd em \u00b4emoire .B u t ,c r u c i a l l y ,t h e y\nalso represent evidence of milieux de m \u00b4emoire in that\nthe library and information professions are highly\nnetworked and, as such, elements of these\n\u201crecorded\u201d memories woul d inevitably have been\ncirculating before being formally documented\u2014\nanother example of the coupling of l i e u xd em \u00b4emoire\nandmilieux de m \u00b4emoire .700 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nThe archival practices of the world\u2019s\nnational library and information\nassociations\nThe actual and potential richness of memory practices\nin the library and information professions, whether\nrecorded in the \u201carchive\u201d or free-flowing through pro-\nfessional networks, means that national library and\ninformation associations would be foolish to ignore\nthe possible benefits that accompany either authentic\nhistorical accounts or heritage marketing projects.\nHowever, it would seem that few of IFLA\u2019s constitu-\nent organizations have the requisite holdings and tools\nto exploit these possibilities. This assessment is based\non the results of a study completed in 2008 by IFLA\u2019s\nLibrary History Section, the results of which were\npublished on the IFLA website in 2008 (Black,\n2008). It is highly unlikely, it should be added, that\nthe situation noted in 2008 would have changed\na great deal today.\nThe first stage of the study involved an analysis of\nthe websites of the world\u2019s national library and infor-\nmation associations in order to detect the presence of\narchives (with archives being defined as records that\nhave a value over the long term and are collected and\npreserved for historical re search and institutional\nmemory). Surprisingly, the subject of an association\u2019s\narchives had a presence on only two websites\u2014those\nof the Australian Library and Information Association\nand the American Library Association.\nThe second stage of the study was formed by the\ndistribution of a questionnaire to all national library\nassociations, defined for the purpose of the study as\nthe institution in a country with prime responsibility\nfor the professional accreditation and representation\nof library and information professionals (and, in addi-\ntion, to the Special Libraries Association, USA). The\narchives of IFLA itself did not form part of the inves-\ntigation. The questionnaire received 10 responses,\nwith these being from the Icelandic Library and\nInformation Science Association; Association of\nLibrary and Information Professionals of the Czech\nRepublic; Special Libraries Association (USA);\nCILIP (UK); Malta Library and Information Associ-\nation; Indonesian Library Association; Polish Librar-\nians\u2019 Association; Swiss Libraries and Librarians\u2019\nOrganization; American Library Association; and\nAustralian Library and Information Association. The\ndisappointing lower-than-expected engagement with\nthe study was possibly due to the questionnaire having\nbeen provided in English only. However, consider-\nation must also be given to the possibility that the\ngood management of internally generated archives\nis far from being a priority for many associations.All of the associations reported that they held\narchives relating to their past, dating from the early\nhistory of their organization. The holdings included\nthe papers of various internal bodies; reports, news-\nletters, and correspondence; annual reports; news\nreleases; financial records; and personal papers as\nwell as membership lists and professional disserta-\ntions. Some associations considered public-domain\norgans such as association magazines, journals, and\nyearbooks to form part of their archive (which is per-\nhaps a debatable categorization). Some associations\nheld archives relating to the history of other\norganizations.\nThe responsibility for archiving the records of\nspecial interest groups, branches, chapters, and divi-\nsions attached to the associations was not seen to be\nthat of the associations, although the written archival\npolicies of some associations advised on how such\nrecords could be deposited in local public\u2014for exam-\nple, state or university\u2014archives. Six of the associa-\ntions retained their archives in-house. The other four\nassociations out-housed most of their archives (with\ncurrent records and semi-current records being kept,\nnaturally, in-house). The associations that out-housed\nmaterial were the Icelandic Library and Information\nScience Association (deposited with the National and\nUniversity Library of Iceland, Reykjavik); CILIP\n(deposited with University College London (UCL));\nAmerican Library Association (deposited with the\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign); and\nAustralian Library and Information Association\n(deposited with the National Library of Australia and\nstate archival repositories). Seven associations\nreported the existence of finding aids and lists for\ntheir archival collections. At least two associations\ndenied access to the public and for another association\nthe conditions of access were unclear from the reply\ngiven. Four associations stated categorically that they\nhad a written archives policy.\nCase study: CILIP\nOne of the associations mentioned in the report\nwith a good record of archival management was\nCILIP. CILIP was inaugurated in 2002 through the\namalgamation of the LA, established in 1877, and\nthe Institute of Information Scientists, established\nin 1958 (Munford, 1976; Ward and White, 2021).\nUpon the formation of CILIP, the archives of the\nLA were deposited with UCL\u2014specifically, with\nits Special Collections Department, which is home\nto a large collection of archives, manuscripts, and\nrare books. This initial de posit of LA documents in\n2002 was supplemented in the following year by701 Black: Memory and amnesia in the archival practices of national library and information associations\nthe deposit of the archives of the Institute of Infor-\nmation Scientists.\nUCL\u2019s Special Collections Department is one of the\nUK\u2019s foremost university collections of manuscripts,\narchives, rare books, and other printed materials. Some\ncollections (or parts of them) have been digitized,\nincluding the papers of George Orwell and Jeremy Ben-\ntham. The Department also holds UCL\u2019s institutional\narchive (including the records of the UK\u2019s first library\nschool, established in 1919), as well as printed items\nconnected with UCL\u2019s history. Following the initial\nlarge deposits of the LA and Institute of Information\nScientists records with UCL in 2002 and 2003, respec-\ntively, access to the collection was for a number of\nyears available at a satellite records repository approx-\nimately a mile north of the UCL campus. Since then,\nfurther out-housing has taken place and, in recent years,\nthe CILIP collection has been accommodated at the\nUK\u2019s National Archives in Kew, south-west London,\nalthough readers are required to order documents\nthrough UCL and consult them there. This arrangement\noffers a high level of physical security for the collection\nbut, unlike a great many other documents housed in the\nNational Archives, access to it is obviously not instant.\nAccess is also compromised by the absence of a\ndetailed descriptive catalogue of the collection, of the\ntype found at the National Archives. The CILIP\nArchive, as set out on the UCL Special Collections\nwebsite, is descriptively extremely sparse. It contains\n13 broad categories of document and makes no men-\ntion of the records of the Institute of Information\nScientists. The categories are as follows:\n/C15Tedder bequest and other materials\n/C15LA publications and conference papers\n/C15Career Development Group papers\n/C15LA Council minutes, Committee papers and\nother Board papers\n/C15LA Charter, by-laws, library license\n/C15Discipline and subject study field of\nlibrarianship\n/C15Newspaper cuttings and library scrap books\n/C15LA policy documents\n/C15Awards\n/C1519th and 20th century pamphlet collection\n/C1519th and 20th century pamphlet collection,\nrelating to librarianship, literacy and social\nreform\n/C15Public libraries in the UK and overseas\n/C15Miscellaneous papers (University College Lon-\ndon, 2023)\nA much more detailed description of the CILIP\nArchive is on the National Archives (2023) website,covering documents created between 1894 and 1999.\nUnlike the UCL listing, this listing does refer to the\npapers of the Institute of Information Scientists. The\nCILIP Archive is relatively large, occupying 102.7\nlinear meters of shelving a t the National Archives\n(five boxes of documents housed in this shelving con-\ntain the records of the Institute of Information Scien-\ntists). Online, the collection is barely catalogued.\nHowever, a more detailed paper listing for the CILIP\nArchive\u2014referring to the records of the LA and the\nInstitute of Information Scientists\u2014is available to\nreaders in the Special Collections Reading Room or,\nas in my case recently, on special request at a distance\nas a scanned document.\nIt is important to point out that the CILIP Archive\ncontains few records for the period after its formation\nin 2002. Since then, it appears that the Special Collec-\ntions Department at UCL has received only five archi-\nval deposits from CILIP, comprising the papers of: the\nIIS, in 2003 (as noted above); the Multimedia Infor-\nmation and Technology Group, in 2004; the Career\nDevelopment Group and the Library Assistants Asso-\nciation, in 2008; and the A ssociation of Assistant\nLibrarians. It is worth noting here that CILIP, like the\nLA before it, does not officially take responsibility for\nthe records of its special interest groups. Thus, the\nabsorption into the CILIP Archive of the records of the\nMultimedia Information and Technology Group and\nthe Career Development Group would appear to be\naccidental. A footnote to these seemingly unofficial\ndeposits is that in around 2005 CILIP\u2019s Library and\nInformation History Group arranged for its records to\nbe organized and catalogued by volunteer students at\none of the UK\u2019s schools of archive studies, as a pilot\nstudy for transferring the records of other special inter-\nest groups to the CILIP collection. Unfortunately, the\npapers were lost in transit.\nAs is required by statute, CILIP maintains financial\nrecords for a certain period, and these, together with\nother records of governance covering recent years, are\navailable on the Chartered Institute of Library and\nInformation Professionals, 2024 website (located\nunder \u201cGovernance\u201d at the foot of the page) Chartered\nInstitute of Library and Inf ormation Professionals,\n2024. These records include annual trustees\u2019 reports,\nannual financial statements, and board minutes. It\nwould appear that paper versions (and probably elec-\ntronic versions) of these core records of governance\nrelating to the period prior to the statutory period of\ncuration are secured in-house, along with other\npapers, awaiting future deposit at UCL and subse-\nquent transfer to the National Archives. It is not clear,\nhowever, how these might be accessed before that\ntransfer occurs.702 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nAs for the future, much depends on CILIP\u2019s current\nprogram of organizational restructuring and reloca-\ntion. As of late 2023, the individual with a remit for\nthe area of records and archives management had left\nCILIP and the organization was awaiting the appoint-\nment of a new post-holder. There are also plans to\nappoint a consultant archiv ist, whose job it would\nbe to prepare a fresh deposit of records for UCL, as\nwell as update CILIP\u2019s Records and Information\nManagement Policy. Having spent decades at its pre-\nmises in Ridgmount Street, Bloomsbury, in 2023\nCILIP relocated to a space in the British Library. As\npart of the relocation project, CILIP has moved the\npaper records it currently holds to a secure off-site\nstorage facility (not the National Archives), where it\nis being triaged in advance of a fresh deposit with\nUCL, hopefully in the first half of 2024. Encoura-\ngingly, the Chief Executive Officer of CILIP has\nstated that the organization has been very careful not\nto lose material that effectively bridges the gap\nbetween the original deposit at UCL and the material\nthat had been held at Ridgmount Street and is now\nheld in independent storage. The Chief Executive\nOfficer was keen to point out that 2023 marked the\n125th anniversary of CILIP receiving its Royal\nCharter, and as part of the planned celebrations, the\nopportunity arose to draw extensively on CILIP\u2019s\norganizational history as contained in its archive.\nCILIP is also investigating, together with a commer-\ncial partner, the prospect of digitizing parts of its\ncollection (Nick Poole, Chief Executive Officer,\nCILIP, emails to author, 9 January 2023, 27 February\n2023, 14 December 2023). However, it is disappoint-\ning to see that none of these matters appear in\nCILIP\u2019s \u201cFive-Year Strategy and Action Plan\u201d\n(Chartered Institute of Library and Information\nProfessionals, 2023).\nThe Special Collections Department at UCL has\nstated that it is ready to receive a fresh deposit of\nrecords from CILIP as and when it becomes available,\nand would work with CILIP to determine the most\nappropriate form for the documents to be depos-\nited\u2014the choice being, essentially, between physical\nand electronic versions. Although the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic interrupted the Department\u2019s retrospective cat-\naloguing program, a detailed cataloguing of the entire\nCILIP Archive is still very much something that is in\nthe Department\u2019s plans. It is lucky to have a number\nof volunteers, but they only work on \u201ccatalogue\nenhancement\u201d projects. Full cataloguing has to be\ndone by either paid staff or students on placement\nfrom UCL\u2019s Archives and Records Management\ncourse (to meet the course requirements, work on a\ncollection must involve organization as well aslisting). The Department does not expect financial\nassistance from a deposit ing institution to manage\na collection in its care, but it sometimes works with\ndonors to secure funding to improve access to collec-\ntions through cataloguing or digitization (Rebecca\nSims, Head of Special Collections, UCL, email to\nauthor, 24 February 2023).\nClearly, it would not be expected that over the past\ntwo decades CILIP should have made highly frequent\ndeposits of records with its archival partner. However,\nit would not be too critical an assessment to observe\nthat a period of 16 years since the last (minor) deposit\nand of over 20 years since the initial major deposit\nconstitutes an unfortunate oversight in the organiza-\ntion\u2019s discharging of its archiving responsibilities. For-\ntunately, the plans announced for the future\nmanagement of the CILIP Archive offer a good exam-\nple of an institution that is determined to \u201cremember.\u201d\nYet it also demonstrates that the potential for corporate\namnesia in terms of an organization\u2019s history is never\nfar away. Consequently, as a way of promoting\nimprovements, a large-scale study\u2014better resourced\nthan that conducted in 2005\u20132006\u2014is required in order\nto assess the archival collections and policies of the\nworld\u2019s library and information associations, and to\nestablish, in short, the balance that exists between\nmemory and amnesia in such organizations, and, by\ninference, in the professions they represent.\nConclusion\nGiven all the talk in recent decades about the\n\u201clearning organization\u201d (Marquardt, 2011)\u2014about\nhow organizations that learn are successful organiza-\ntions\u2014it is bewildering that so many organizations,\nand not simply the type discussed in this article, do\nnot seem to appreciate the importance of archive\nretention as a component of organizational learning,\nexcept, perhaps, as a tool for heritage marketing and\nnostalgic reflection. The fear is, indeed, that the\narchival practices of many of the world\u2019s library and\ninformation associations sit at that end of the archival-\nretention spectrum where neglect and even mindless\ndisposal, as opposed to good curation, are deeply\nembedded in the corporate culture. The neglect and\ndisposal of archives would surely qualify as a form of\n\u201ccultural vandalism,\u201d but, on reflection, that might\nnot be a strong enough term to employ in this context.\nPerhaps the term \u201ccultural lobotomization\u201d is more\nappropriate. Lobotomies, after all, can result in an\nimpairment of memory and, at worst, its amputation.\nLet us hope that the world\u2019s national library and infor-\nmation associations have not been involved in703 Black: Memory and amnesia in the archival practices of national library and information associations\nconducting too many cultural lobotomies with regard\nto their archival responsibilities.\nAcknowledgments\nI wish once again to thank the library and information\nassociations that participated in the survey of archival hold-\nings and practices undertaken by IFLA\u2019s Library History\nSection in 2005\u20132006.

Discussions with the archivists of three other\nprofessional associations about their beginnings, services, and funding provide the framework. While there\nare firm legal guidelines for keeping association records, there are no firm guidelines that specifically describe\nhow to archive association records for historical purposes. Association records\u2014including correspondence,\nvotes, and addresses that are not held in formal publications\u2014can reveal how and when decisions were made.\nMaking these records available in archives is invaluable to historians. The authors\u2019 views and opinions are based\non what they have learned during the last several years of the active engagement of the Association for\nInformation Science and Technology\u2019s History Committee (HC) and curator, and the hope is that this\narticle will be useful for other associations as they curate their own archives.\nKeywords\nArchives and records centers, libraries, information providers, history, library and information science, library\nassociations, management, administration\nIntroduction\nProfessional associations and learned societies have\nexisted since antiquity. Italy organized gatherings of\ncraftsmen or scuole (Pullan, 1981) and the Germans\nhad the Hanse , the association of trade guilds, from the\nmiddle of the 12th century to the middle of the 17th\ncentury. These guilds represented and defended com-\nmon economic interests, especially regarding trade.\nDuring the 1600s, the Enlightenment period saw the\ngrowth of associations dedicated to the sciences. In\nGreat Britain, for instance, the Royal Society of Lon-\ndon ( c.1660) and the Philosophical Society of Edin-\nburgh ( c.1738) flourished, and, across the Atlantic,\nBenjamin Franklin established the Junto Club in\n1727. A number of these societies produced proceed-\nings and journals, some of which are still extant (Gib-\nson, 1982; Perkin, 1989). Expanding the scope of this\narticle beyond the western tradition (specifically, Eur-\nope and North America) would reveal rich variations\nabout the nature of professional alliances, but it is lim-\nited to its historical geographical roots.Over the last few centuries, attempts have been\nmade in almost every occupation to form professional\nassociations, with the concomitant establishment of\nprofessional journals (Darity, 2008). Abbot (1988:\n3) writes that professions began to grow in the\n1900s with the \u201cmerging of apothecaries with sur-\ngeons and physicians, the rise of the lower branch\nof the legal profession ...and the growth of university\nprofessionals schools.\u201d Wylie (1994) describes the\ncharacteristics of a profession as including a well-\ndefined knowledge base; a standardized graduate\ndegree; a system of testing and certification by the\nstate; and oversight by a state body to enforce sanc-\ntions. Haralambos and Holborn (2002) expand on the\nsociological definition of professions to include a\ncode of ethics and professional norms; dedication to\nCorresponding author:\nJenny Bossaller, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211,\nUSA.\nEmail: bossallerj@missouri.eduInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions\n\u00aaThe Author(s) 2024\nArticle reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nDOI: 10.1177/03400352241230668\njournals.sagepub.com/home/iflIFL A\n2024, Vol. 50(4) 706\u2013713\nserving the public interest and being socially respon-\nsible; a characterizable knowledge base; a specialized\nand standardized education system that includes\npostgraduate studies; a technical and research basis;\nprovision of unique services to the community; devel-\noped professional membership associations; and\nautonomy and decision-making among members.\nAlthough it is not explicitly stated, part of the social\nresponsibility of a profession includes care for its own\nhistory, including making available the archival doc-\numents about its origin, development, and activities to\nmembers of the profession and the community.\nWithin library and information science, among the\nearliest professional associations were the American\nLibrary Association (ALA), founded in 1876, and\nEngland\u2019s Library Association, founded the following\nyear. Abbot (1988: 217) describes the growth of librar-\nianship as a profession that \u201carrived in several waves.\nThe public libraries of the latter nineteenth century\nwere followed by the academic and special libraries\naround the turn of the century.\u201d Librarianship grew\nas a result of Melvil Dewey\u2019s push to adopt technical\nand scientific management in the late 1800s and early\n1900s. At the same time in Europe, the documentation\nand bibliography movements, founded by Paul Otlet\nand Henri LaFontaine, were gaining traction.\nModern professional and scientific associations\nrest on the foundations of t he generally accepted\nbelief that joint work is a condition sine qua non not\nonly for the progress of the association but also for\nthe development of the profession, the scientific\ndiscipline, and science in general.\nManaging associations and their history\nAssociations are usually non-profit, member-driven\norganizations that produce many records in the course\nof their work, and there are laws governing their\nrecord-keeping. Many have annual conferences, and\norganizing these is a time-consuming task. Associa-\ntion management companies were created to take on\norganizational tasks and provide stability between\ntransitions in leadership. Association management\ncompanies have their own professional identity and\ngatekeeping mechanisms. According to the AMC\nInstitute, association management companies offer\nservices such as\nmembership, marketing and policy developments to legal\nand risk management ...staffing, office space, equipment,\ncontracts, technologies and member services ...strategic\nplanning ...public affairs and lobbying; education and\nprofessional development; statistical research; meetings\nmanagement; and marketing and communications ser-\nvices. (AMC Institute, 2023: para. 7\u20139)The American Society of Association Executives, as\nof fall 2023, is developing a certificate in association\nmanagement with six courses focused on roles and\ntasks, including association management, leadership,\noperations management, ethics, and working with\nvolunteers and boards (American Society of Associ-\nation Executives, 2023). Record-keeping is within the\nprofessional expertise of association management\ncompanies, but historical services fall distinctly out-\nside of their list of services.\nWe are unaware of a description of best practices\nthat specifically address preserving association his-\ntory, and the archivists of associations who we talked\nto also said that they were unaware of any such guide-\nlines. This leads to a fundamental question: Why does\nan association\u2019s history matter? Seeking external vali-\ndation, we sought the wisdom of the neural network\nChatGPT, which quickly produced 10 bullet points\nthat confirmed our thinking:\n/C15The preservation of legacy and tradition;\n/C15A source of inspiration;\n/C15Learning from past mistakes;\n/C15Documentation of progress;\n/C15Demonstration of credibility;\n/C15Member engagement and connection;\n/C15Informed decision-making;\n/C15Public relations and marketing;\n/C15Legal and governance necessities;\n/C15Archival value.\nThis issue of the IFLA Journal traces some of the\nhistories of the work of associations within the infor-\nmation profession, and several of the threads are pres-\nent in this and our own work. We also recognize that\npreserving history is a chore, so enshrining its worth\nand then making it part of the day-to-day business of\nwork is essential.\nThe International Council on Archives (2012) has\nproduced a \u201cManual for association management\u201d for\narchivist associations. It could very well be applicable\nand useful for other types of associations as well; we\nhoped that it might offer more pointed advice on\nretaining association history due to the historical bent\nof the Council\u2019s members. It does outline the pur-\nposes of professional associations: education, public\nawareness, advocacy, and communication, for\ninstance. It explains that much of the work of an asso-\nciation is done at annual meetings, which must be\nmanaged; it includes \u201cadvice on setting up a records\nmanagement program and developing an association\nretention schedule\u201d (International Council on\nArchives, 2012: 3). The authors write that \u201c[r]ecords\ndocumenting non-committee meetings supporting the707 Bossaller and Aparac-Jelu \u02c7sic\u00b4: Reflections on preserving association records\norganization of a conference\u201d (164) should be\nretained for two years aft er the conference, then\nshould be destroyed, but the \u201cfinal version of\nAssociation conference policies\u201d (165) should be\npermanently retained. Training materials should be\npermanently retained but records of a course should\nbe destroyed after two years. Photographs should be\nretained indefinitely. Records marked for permanent\nretainment should be sent for archival processing\nafter they are no longer nee ded in-house. This indi-\ncates that the association\u2019s management team should\nhave a firm grasp of what should be retained, and\nthen regularly schedule items to be transferred from\nthe office to the archives. Many associations of var-\nious sizes have archives, which enable historians to\npiece together stories of the work and members of\nthe association. The following section provides an\noverview of interviews with the archivists of three\nassociations.\nAmerican Library Association\nThe ALA was established in 1876 in Philadelphia.\nAfter some time, its archives were gathered together\nand housed in a warehouse in Chicago. In 1973, they\nwere transferred to the University of Illinois in antic-\nipation of the association\u2019s 100th anniversary so that\nmore historical work could be completed by its mem-\nbers. At that point, the association entered into a\nthree-year agreement with the university and hired a\nhalf-time archivist to begin processing the materials.\nToday, the ALA Archives house nearly 4000 cubic\nfeet of materials and over a terabyte of digital materials\nthat are accessible through over 1500 finding aids. The\nALA headquarters regularly transfers files to the\nArchives. However, there is little provision for its\nroundtable or satellite organizations. For instance,\nREFORMA: The National Association to Promote\nLibrary and Information Services to Latinos and the\nSpanish Speaking was established in 1971 as an affili-\nate of the ALA, but its archives are housed at California\nState University, Los Angeles. Round table records are\noften passed between their chairs rather than being\nhoused centrally by staff, which illustrates one of the\npitfalls that a dispersed, member-driven organization\nmight experience regarding its history. Cara Bertram,\nan ALA archivist, reported that the association cur-\nrently has one full-time and one part-time archivist.\nThere is a large backlog of files that need to be pro-\ncessed, especially for the ALA\u2019s divisions.\nIn addition to its physical archives, the ALA has an\nInstitution Repository (ALAIR), which contains over\n19,000 items and an image database with over 5300\nimages. The ALA Web Archive, which captures theentirety of the website annually, is run by the Internet\nArchive. The archivists also maintain a dark archive\nof born-digital materials that are unsuitable for imme-\ndiate dissemination. The archives serve ALA staff,\nresearchers, and members of the public who are inter-\nested in the ALA or librarianship in general.\nIn 2023, the ALA had 49,705 members and a staff\nof 212 (American Library Association, n.d.). Note\nthat Cara Bertram, the ALA archivist, has also con-\ntributed to this issue, so please refer to her article for\nmore details on the ALA\u2019s archives.\nSociety of American Archivists\nThe Society of American Archivists (SAA) was\nestablished in 1936 and its first annual meeting was\nheld in Washington, DC in 1937 (Doylen, n.d.).\nArchival material was originally \u201cpreserved by the\nofficers and chairmen of the committees,\u201d was to be\n\u201cturned over by them to the secretary when their terms\nexpire[d],\u201d and then would be \u201cturned over to a\ndepository selected for it for permanent preservation\u201d\n(SAA Constitution, 1936: Section 21; quoted in Doy-\nlen, n.d.). Many past presidents and committee chairs,\nhowever, failed to \u201cturn over their files and those who\ndid were \u2018most dilatory in applying [to their own\nrecords] the principles of preservation and arrange-\nment which they propound[ed]\u2019 as professional\narchivists\u201d (SAA Constitution, 1936: Section 21;\nquoted in Doylen, n.d.). The SAA\u2019s Council first\nchose the Colorado State Archives as the official\ndepository in 1963, then moved the records to the Uni-\nversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1978, which it\nbelieved would encourage officers to transfer their\ninactive files. This circuitous route to a permanent\nhome is meant to illustrate the problem that even archi-\nvists have with their own professional organization.\nToday, Derek Webb serves as one of the SAA\u2019s\narchivists. He and one other archivist are employed\nby the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and they\nreceive no financial support from the SAA. Webb\nreported that when they receive materials from the\nSAA or from individuals, the materials enter their\nregular backlogging queue. Students are sometimes\nhired for discrete projects, including oral history tran-\nscriptions. The SAA also maintains a website that\nincludes some historical materials, such as a brief\nhistory of the association; a timeline with short\nembedded articles; a collection of oral histories that\nwas created for the association\u2019s 75th anniversary;\nand transcripts of all of the presidential addresses.\nIn 2023, the SAA had over 5000 individual and\ninstitutional members, 11 employees (Society of708 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nAmerican Archivists, 2023), and a revenue of\n$2,758,657 (Society of American Archivists, 2022).\nA study in contrast: the archives of the American\nMedical Association\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) is a very\nlarge and influential profe ssional association with\n1300 employees, 271,660 members, and a revenue\nof nearly $500 million in 2022. We chose to speak\nwith two AMA archivists, Jorie Braunold and Kelsey\nWalsh, because the association is outside of the infor-\nmation fields, we thought that the AMA might offer a\ndifferent perspective. The AMA\u2019s archivists, Jorie\nBraunold and Kelsey Walsh, agreed to an interview.\nThe provided us with an overview of the AMA\narchives\u2019 history, purposes, and processes.\nThe AMA first discussed preserving its history in the\nlate 1800s but did not establish an archive as a division\nof its extensive library until 1961. The digital availability\nof materials led to the closure of the library in 2000. The\narchivists said that the ear ly years followed a general\ntrend in the development of the archival profession, with\narchivists issuing regular ca lls for materials throughout\nthe 1960s and 1970s to develop the AMA\u2019s historical\ncollection. In 1994, the arch ives were established as\na distinct division and paired with records manage-\nment, which resulted in pre- and post-1994 collec-\ntions. Today, the archives are housed under the\ncorporate services of the association.\nBraunold described the framework for records man-\nagement and the transfer of materials to the archives as\nbeing based on the AMA\u2019s statement of scope: it col-\nlects all documents related to the official business of the\nAMA and employees of the association, but does not\ncollect outside materials. Its processes, likewise, are\ninternally focused. The AMA began receiving digital\nmaterials in 2005, and those are filed in the previously\nestablished organizational structure. Today, SharePoint\nis used for the transfer of materials to the digital repo-\nsitory. Until 2017, the AMA employed three archivists,\nbut today one is shared with another division. Given the\nsize of its staff and their role within the organization,\nthere is not the capacity to make its materials openly\navailable to the public. While there is not much back-\nlogged material, the processing is suboptimal, and there\nare only a few finding aids an d high-level collection\ndescriptions. The archivists also opined that, to their\nknowledge, most associations do not invest heavily in\ntheir historical archives.\nLooking for information: IFLA, a case study\nHow do researchers use association records? We\nemail-interviewed Steve Witt, editor-in-chief of theIFLA Journal , who contributed reflections that\nillustrate some of the problems he has experienced\nwhen writing about information associations. While\nthis represents only one person\u2019s experience, it is\ninstructive in producing some recommendations for\nassociation archives from the researcher\u2019s standpoint.\nWitt explained that his research intersects with\nIFLA\u2019s early years and the networks of activity that\ninformed its founding. When he began his research,\nhe was not aware that IFLA\u2019s archives were open for\nresearchers, and he relied heavily on archival collec-\ntions of the ALA and the Rockefeller and Carnegie\nfoundations. He continually ran into problems in\naccessing records of library associations (outside of\nthe ALA). He found that some archives, including\nthose of the UK\u2019s Library Association and IFLA, did\nhave adequate finding aids. In addition, he pointed out\nthat the archival practices of some organizations omit\nimportant correspondence from volunteers in the\norganization, so those records are spread across vari-\nous institutional archives around the world. Doing\nresearch on an international organization like IFLA\nthus becomes both expensive and time-consuming.\nTechnology, organization, and the increased avail-\nability of finding aids, however, could make this work\neasier. Witt pointed out that it is essential to have\nfinding aids that describe organizations and the con-\ntents of their collections. This is especially true if one\nseeks to document the history of an organization\nbeyond listing events, leadership changes, and top-\nlevel activities. Furthermore, he explained that while\nmany historians love to do nothing more than read\nfiles in archives and gain the deep understanding that\ncomes from looking at records within their original\ncontext, digitization has many advantages. It greatly\nincreases access to files, especially if the researcher\nalready knows what they are looking for. The digiti-\nzation of the League of Nations Archives, for exam-\nple, represents a high-quality project that both\nincreases access and enables browsing of the archives\ndigitally.\nWitt pointed out that associations often have a\nforward-looking focus regarding their activities.\nHowever, it is important that they also understand that\ntheir histories are important for understanding their\nlong-term impact. Maintai ning and developing the\nhistorical record also enables an association\u2019s mem-\nbers to understand organizational changes, and to dis-\ncern the social and cultural dynamics that shaped its\nevolution. For example, Witt remarked that it might\nbe difficult to research how organizations like the\nAssociation for Information Science and Technology\n(ASIS&T) were impacted by Cold War research and\ndevelopment activities that preferenced information709 Bossaller and Aparac-Jelu \u02c7sic\u00b4: Reflections on preserving association records\ntechnologies with value to the military\u2013industrial\ncomplex. Were there any internal debates on the\nsubject? Did the organization engage in other\naspects of Cold War activities? In contrast, the\narchival model developed by the ALA has allowed\nresearchers to interrogate its history while also giving\nthe ALA the ability to promote its values, history,\nand accomplishments. Problems researchers encoun-\nter when working on projects like that described by\nWitt demonstrate how lapses in the collective archi-\nval record impede historical research.\nOrganization of Association Archives\nThe ALA, SAA, and AMA archives are three\ndifferent models that are the product of the organiza-\ntions\u2019 size and financial health, purpose of the\narchives, and value that the associations place on their\narchival materials and history. The ALA, for instance,\ninvests in one archivist and a student (although others\nmight be involved in discrete projects). It has an\noffice that is accessible to the public and serves any-\none interested in the history of the association. It has a\nrobust digital collection and an institutional reposi-\ntory, and a regular process for transferring materials\nfrom headquarters, and accepts donations from\nmembers. The AMA, on the other hand, is a very large\nassociation but its archives serve the organization as\nan arm of records management\u2014they are internally\nfocused. The SAA is a small association with archives\nsimilar to those of ASIS&T; the collection is housed\nwithin a university\u2019s archives with no dedicated\nemployee and no receipt of financial support from the\norganization. Witt\u2019s description of his travails using\narchives demonstrates how archival arrangement and\navailability promote or impede historical work.\nAssociation for Information Science\nand Technology: challenges and pitfalls\nA brief history of ASIS&T\nInformation science is a broad field. ASIS&T is now\nan international organization that is dominated by\nacademics. Its roots, however, are found in the\nAmerican Documentation Institute, which was\nfounded by Watson Davis, who selected scientific,\nindustry, and governmental organizations to make\nup its membership until the 1950s. Davis\u2019 vision,\nwhich he described in his 1962 address to the\ninstitute, was to miniaturize (microfilm) and index all\nscientific publications. He was not the first to envision\nopen scientific knowledge, however. He was building\non the work of Otlet and La Fontaine, who established\nthe International Federation for Information andDocumentation in Brussels in 1895. The American\nDocumentation Institute became a member of the\nInternational Institute for Bibliography after World\nWar II and, as the technologies of documentation\nprogressed, the institute grew and changed.\nThe American Documentation Institute was\nrenamed the American Society for Information Sci-\nence (ASIS) in 1968, and its membership included a\nswath of professionals who were invested in informa-\ntion storage and retrieval, including \u201clibrarians,\nauthors, publishers, mathematicians, equipment tech-\nnologists, communication theorists, linguists, and\nusers of messages\u201d (Schultz, 1976: 50). ASIS retained\na relationship with the Special Libraries Association\nand the American Chemical Society, and its member-\nship grew, but a merger between the Special Libraries\nAssociation and ASIS failed in the 1970s. As ASIS\napproached its 50th anniversary in 1988, its member-\nship was shrinking and it was financially stressed,\neven in the face of an explosion of new information\ntechnologies and advances in telecommunications\nand document retrieval (Garfield, 2000).\nIn 1999, Michael Buckland, then ASIS\u2019s immediate\npast president, described two traditions that had\nevolved within the information professions and were\nalso causing a rift in education for the information pro-\nfessions: the \u201cdocument\u201d tradition of archives and\nlibrarianship versus the \u201ccomputational\u201d tradition of\ninformation retrieval. History can reveal this rift to be\na false dichotomy, however, by looking to the early\nyears of the International Federation for Information\nand Documentation. In 2000, members voted to rename\nand rebrand ASIS, adding \u201c&T\u201d for \u201cand Technology.\u201d\nInternationalization, too, crept in very gradually. ASIS\nadded a Northern European Chapter in 1974 and a\nEuropean Chapter in 1993. The Asia-Pacific Chapter\nwas established in 2018, the Africa Chapter in 2020,\nand the Middle East Chapter in 2021. Internationaliza-\ntion brings prestige and financial stability, and\nincreases opportunities to expand scholarly and profes-\nsional connections, but it is also reflective of changes in\nscholarly communication, business, and education, and\npressure from governments to expand international\nscholarship as a means of increasing prestige.\nWhy history matters\nASIS&T has evolved from an invitation-only group of\nexperts in the USA focused on bibliography and docu-\nmentation to an international association dominated by\nresearchers affiliated with universities. The rich legacy\nand tradition found in the American Documentation\nInstitute and International Federation for Information\nand Documentation can provide new members with a710 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nsense of pride and inspiration; it is not merely academic\nnavel-gazing. The organization\u2019s history demonstrates\nh o wi t sm e m b e r sh a v em a d ead i f f e r e n c ei nt h ew o r l d\nthrough the evolution of technologies that are used\nacross industries. Its history also demonstrates its cred-\nibility to outsiders. The vast scope of the work repre-\nsented by ASIS&T\u2019s members and the outsiders who\ncontribute to its resources demonstrates its reach across\nsectors while providing the association with public rela-\ntions and marketing opportunities. Moreover, under-\nstanding its history can illuminate the common\nground between the \u201cdocument\u201d and \u201ccomputational\u201d\ntraditions described by Buckland in 1999 in the focus of\nthe International Federation for Information and Doc-\numentation\u2019s early years on creating hypertext as the\nbasis for digital libraries. Information science is broad.\nAn overview of ASIS&T\u2019s archive and historical\nprograms\nASIS established a relationship with the University\nof Michigan for the deposit of its materials in 1988\n(University of Michigan Library, 2023). Today, the\nUniversity of Michigan archive holds 185 linear feet\nof materials in 188 boxes, and includes print as well as\nphotographic, audio, and video materials. It includes\nmaterials from all the association\u2019s annual meetings,\npublications, membershi pr o s t e r sa n da w a r d s ,a n d\nholds many administrative files. The archive contains\ndocumentation from the Chapters and Special Interest\nGroups, and many scattered documents related to 239\naffiliated organizations and subjects. The collection\nwas processed and a finding aid was created in\n2004\u20132005. There are no digitized materials; it con-\ntains no born-digital files; and there are no plans to\ntransfer born-digital materials.\nThere have been several successful projects that\ndemonstrate how members of the Special Interest\nGroup on the History and Foundation of Information\nScience, the History Committee, the curator, and indi-\nviduals have worked to capture ASIS&T\u2019s history.\nPerhaps one of the most ambitious projects was begun\nin 1996 by Robert Williams, who started to document\nthe foundations of the profession and ASIS&T in the\n\u201cPioneers of Information Science\u201d project. The proj-\nect includes brief biographies and a list of archival\nholdings for US and Canadian scientists and contri-\nbutors in the field. The project has recently been\ntransferred to a wiki, which it is hoped will lead to\nbroader international representation of leaders in the\nfield, as well as documentation of the historical devel-\nopment of some of its major concepts, both of which\nwill be useful resources and inspiration for members\nand non-members alike.Another important collection is that of oral history\ninterviews with distinguished scholars and practi-\ntioners in the field, which were completed by\nASIS&T members. Seventy-four known interviews\nare currently scattered across various websites, uni-\nversity collections and repositories, the Science His-\ntory Institute, and YouTube. ASIS&T holds some that\nare not currently available. During the last few years,\nan attempt has been made to gather and register the\noral history interviews in a database, and current plans\npoint toward uploading them to ASIS&T\u2019s YouTube\nchannel and linking to them from a wiki.\nOther recent efforts have included opening access\nto nearly all past American Documentation Institute,\nASIS, and ASIS&T publications, including the\nAnnual Review of Information Science and Technol-\nogy(although some, such as ASIS&T\u2019s journal, are\nnot open); compiling a bibliography of ASIS&T pub-\nlications, which is available on its website; and com-\npleting several retrospective projects and celebrations\nat annual meetings.\nIn 2013, ASIS&T\u2019s 75th Anniversary Task Force\nassessed that \u201cresources were widely scattered across\nrepositories, poorly organized, needed significant pre-\nservation work, and perhaps most importantly, were\ndifficult to identify and access through standard\nresearch and documentation practices\u201d (LaBarre\net. al., 2013: 1).\nThe task force made significant progress with the\noral history project and sought to improve access to\nthe archives at the University of Michigan and digi-\ntized photographs. It also sought to \u201cencourage the\ndeposit of records/archives of ASIST leaders\u201d\n(LaBarre et. al., 2013: 1).\nThe 80th anniversary project was completed by\nKathryn LaBarre in 2018. That same year, ASIS&T\ncreated a curator position, which was charged with\nmonitoring \u201cthe discovery, preservation, and accessi-\nbility of resources relating to the history of ASIS&T\u201d\n(Association for Information Science and Technology,\n2023), and recommending policies and best practices\nfor knowledge management. The mandate for the His-\ntory Committee (HC) was to \u201cadvance the identifica-\ntion, collection, digitization, preservation, and\naccessibility of materials and resources relating to the\nhistorical development of the theory and practice of\ninformation science and technology, as well as docu-\nmenting the Association\u2019s activities and achievements\u201d\n(Association for Information Science and Technology,\n2023). The committee also held the Bob Williams His-\ntory Fund, which promotes work on the history of the\nfield, and a separate ASIS&T Heritage Fund, which\nsupports incidental expenses related to preserving the711 Bossaller and Aparac-Jelu \u02c7sic\u00b4: Reflections on preserving association records\nassociation\u2019s heritage resources. The oral history col-\nlection has been funded by various sources.\nDespite progress, in 2023, the ASIS&T leadership\ndecided to sunset the HC and discontinue the curator\nposition. The work of the committee has fallen to the\nHistory and Foundation of Information Science Special\nInterest Group, although the latter does not receive\nactive support from the association\u2019s management team.\nThe Special Interest Groups are self-driven and thus less\nintegrated in supporting the mission of the association.\nConclusion\nHistorical work explains how we have arrived at where\nwe are today, but it depends on people who will\nactively preserve and organize the multitude of papers\nand documents that are produced during work pro-\ncesses. In a scholarly or professional association, these\nmundane documents might include items such as the\nmembership rosters of various committees, financial\nreports, the results of votes, and internal and external\ncommunications. These documents provide evidence\nthat will one day be useful to tell stories and dispel\nmyths. The records of annual meetings and monumen-\ntal decisions are always saved, but the documents that\ndemonstrate how those decisions evolved might be bur-\nied in the quotidian material marked for disposal.\nIf the paper documentation of these mundane\ndecisions is easily lost, today\u2019s born-digital records\nare even more so. What will happen to our hard drives\nupon retirement? Digital archiving is an item of dis-\ncussion within ASIS&T\u2019s community, yet many of,\nyet many of our personal records will never make it to\nan archive where they will be available for future\nhistorians. On retirement or death, a university\u2019s\ninformation technology team wipes hard drives; other\nrecords are corrupted or lost. ASIS&T\u2019s management,\nlikewise, will face similar problems if its records are\nnot transferred to a trusted repository. Remote work\nbrings a dire need for documentation and preservation\nfor our future historical assets.\nIn early 2024, ASIS&T will permanently close its\nphysical office. Since the COVID-19 pandemic in\n2020, staff have worked remotely, and the office lease\nwill expire. The executive director issued a call for\nproposals for an archival education program to pro-\ncess the remaining physical records before they are\ntransferred to the University of Michigan. This offers\na valuable experiential educational opportunity, but\nno program has yet answered the call, which might\nbe because many library and information science\nprograms are also online.\nThe physical holdings are only one piece of the\npuzzle, however. For historical purposes, digital filesalso need to be properly captured, processed, and\nintegrated into a filing structure in a common envi-\nronment. With the dissolution of the HC and the cura-\ntor position, the responsibilities of historical\npreservation have been relegated to the History and\nFoundation of Information Science Special Interest\nGroup, whose influence is significantly weaker.\nBased on the interviews with the archivists from other\nassociations, we believe that the best step forward\nwould be to provide financial support to the Univer-\nsity of Michigan archives. While hiring a full-time\narchivist might not be feasible at this moment in time,\nthis is a crucial step in increasing access to historical\nmaterials and continuing to develop policies regard-\ning the transfer of materials. This includes accepting\nmembers\u2019 files, digitizing materials of interest, and\ncreating an institutional repository.\nBlack (2008) notes that archives are a crucial\ncomponent for associatio n management. Historical\nrecords can be used for marketing a profession and\nassociation, and researchers can use records from\nassociations\u2019 anniversaries and important past profes-\nsional events and landmarks to enhance professional\nidentity. Almost 20 years after Black\u2019s warnings, why\nare we still reflecting on how our professional asso-\nciations treat their historical assets? There is still a\nneed to standardize storage and preservation; system-\natically organize materials; increase accessibility; and\nensure the formulation and implementation of an\narchives policy to assure that collections are available\nfor future use (Black, 2008: 4). To this we add the\nneed to proactively scrape website and born-digital\nmaterials and then reconcile those with print archives,\nin a single repository when possible. This is a com-\nplicated environment that requires the investment of\ntime, thought, and money.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nFunding\nThe authors received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nJenny Bossaller https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5732-897X\nReferences\nAbbott A (1988) The System of Professions: an essay on the\ndivision of expert labor .

IFLA\u2019s Library History Special Interest Group has embarked on various\nprojects to prepare for the event, including the compilation of an edited volume of scholarly chapters on IFLA\u2019s\nhistory. This article originated as a background paper for members of the Library History Special Interest Group\nand others who may be contemplating conducting research on IFLA with a view to the centenary in 2027. An\noverview is given of published sources for the historiography of IFLA. These include publications about IFLA\npublished by IFLA and its structures, and by other parties. IFLA\u2019s own publications include guidelines and\nstandards; policy statements; reports on the work of its professional units and strategic advisory committees;\nthe IFLA Publications Series; and report series such as the IFLA World Reports and Trend Reports. Much of this\nmaterial is published on IFLA\u2019s websites, both current and arc hived. It provides valuable evidence of IFLA\u2019s activities.\nIn this article, the emphasis is on material about IFLA published by IFLA itself and by other parties. The literature\nabout IFLA includes historical accounts published as articles, books, book chapters and theses. Many contain useful\nbibliographies. With a view to identifying topics and them es for the historiography of IFLA, the subject matter of\nsome 294 items about IFLA published from 2000 to 2022 inclusive is analysed. Brief attention is paid to possible\nthemes emerging from the literature that may be useful in developing research on IFLA.\nKeywords\nIFLA, historiography, published sources, bibliography, research themes\nIntroduction\nOn 30 September 1927, during a conference of the (Brit-\nish) Library Association in Edinburgh, a decision was\nmade to establish what was in itially called the Interna-\ntional Library and Bibliograp hical Committee. Although\nIFLA regards 1927 as the year of its foundation, it was\nnot until 1929 when the constitution proposed by the\nCommittee and the name International Federation of\nLibrary Associations were a dopted (Wilhite, 2012). In\n1976, IFLA changed its name to the International Fed-\neration of Library Associations and Institutions, but\nretained the acronym IFLA (pronounced \u2018if-lah\u2019), which\nh a db yt h e nb e c o m ear e c o g n i s e d\u2018 b r a n d \u2019 .\nThis article is intended as a background for scholars\nwho may be contemplating research on IFLA with a\nview to its centenary in 2027. It is intended as a contri-\nbution to preparations for that centenary by the IFLA\nLibrary History Special Interest Group. It outlines the\nmajor categories of published source material; presents\nan analysis of topics and themes in the published liter-\nature during the period 2000\u20132022; and suggests some\nthemes that may be worth exploring.Categories of published sources\nVarious categories of published materials can be\ndistinguished and are discussed below. The primary\ndistinction to be made is between publications pro-\nduced or published byIFLA and those about IFLA.\nThis article deals with publications about IFLA\n(some of which will have been produced or pub-\nlished by IFLA).\nIFLA corporate publications: conference reports,\nminutes and papers\nAn excellent point of departure in accessing both\nthe published and unpublished materials in this cate-\ngory is the chronology of IFLA, 85 Years IFLA:\nA History and Chronology of Sessions, 1927 \u20132012 ,\npainstakingly compiled by Jeffrey M Wilhite (2012)\nCorresponding author:\nPeter Johan Lor, Department of Information Science, University\nof Pretoria, Pretoria, Gauteng 0028, South Africa.\nEmail: PeterJLor@gmail.comInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions\n\u00aaThe Author(s) 2024\nArticle reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nDOI: 10.1177/03400352241236731\njournals.sagepub.com/home/iflIFL A\n2024, Vol. 50(4) 714\u2013723\nand covering the 85-year period from the founding of\nIFLA in 1927 to 2012. In addition to a substantial\n\u2018Introductory history\u2019 (Part 1, 23\u201392) covering this\nperiod, in Part 2 Wilhite provides a year-by-year\naccount of important events and stages in IFLA\u2019s\ndevelopment. The terms used to refer to IFLA\u2019s con-\nferences evolved over the years, and Wilhite\u2019s year-\nby-year account enables the researcher to follow these\nchanges, as well as the dates on which major commit-\ntees, professional units and initiatives were started.\nWilhite\u2019s (2012) main sources were the proceed-\nings of IFLA \u2018sessions\u2019 as published in the Actes du\nComit \u00b4e international des bibliothe `ques, later known\nas the Actes du Conseil g \u00b4en\u00b4eral/Proceedings of the\nGeneral Counci l (1927\u20131968), and their successor\nseries. Listing the publications in the series chronolo-\ngically with their dates of coverage in his Appendix 2,\nWilhite titles them \u2018Core IFLA research sources\u2019. In\nthe early years, the proceedings were mainly in\nFrench and, as a result, they are generally referred\nto as the Actes .T h e Actes were detailed and quite\nsubstantial reports, with accounts of the papers pre-\nsented, discussions, committee meetings and IFLA\nactivities. Technically, whilst mainly printed for dis-\ntribution to the IFLA membership and stakeholders,\nthese are published sources, as they were also offered\nfor sale to a more general audience. The titles used for\nthese proceedings reflected the naming of the meet-\nings, being referred to first as \u2018sessions\u2019 (1927\u20131952).\nThe major part of Wilhite\u2019s (2012) book (Part 2)\noffers a \u2018Chronology of sessions\u2019 for the period 1927\nto 2012. \u2018Sessions\u2019 refers to the meetings of what was\ninitially called the International Library and Bibliogra-\nphical Committee \u2013 annual meetings of representatives\nof the Federation\u2019s member associations (the words\n\u2018and Bibliographical\u2019 were dropped in 1928). Larger\ninternational meetings were to take place every five\nyears. The first was the First International Congress\nof Libraries and Bibliography, held in Italy in 1929,\nat which time IFLA\u2019s constitution and name \u2013 Interna-\ntional Federation of Library Associations \u2013 were\nadopted. These meetings were difficult to organise. The\nsecond international congress was held in Madrid in\n1935. The third, planned for Germany, was abandoned\nwhen the Second World War broke out. After the war,\nthe scope of the \u2018sessions\u2019 gradually expanded to much\nlarger annual conferences. The term \u2018conference\u2019 only\nemerged in 1980. What old-timers knew as the \u2018IFLA\nconference\u2019 became the IFLA World Library and Infor-\nmation Congress in 2003.\nThese developments were reflected in successive\nname changes, which are listed by Wilhite (2012:\n347). Wilhite devotes several pages to each session,\ncovering the venue (or venues \u2013 on several occasionsthey were held in more than one city) and dates of the\nmeeting; its theme; the number of participants; the\nnumber of open sessions; the workshops and other\nevents; the president and secretary general; and reports,\nannouncements and major decisions. There is also\ninformation about IFLA generally, such as the compo-\nsition of IFLA\u2019s governance bodies and administrative\npersonnel; the number, types and activities of profes-\nsional units; membership numbers; and significant\nIFLA publications in the relevant year. There are useful\nappendices, a bibliography and a detailed name index.\nThe Actes were succeeded by the IFLA Annual\n(1969\u20131995). In the early years the proceedings were\nmainly in French and as a result they are generally\nreferred to as the Actes. The full series, from 1928 to\n1968, is now freely available in the Hathi Trust Digital\nLibrary. Wilhite (2012) also lists a number of other\nsources, including the IFLA Repertoire (1931\u20131968);\ntheUNESCO Bulletin for Libraries (1947\u20131978); the\n\u2018IFLA communications\u2019 section, which appeared in the\njournal Libri (1953\u20131974); IFLA News (1962\u20131974);\ntheIFLA Directory (1971\u20132003);1IFLA Journal\n(1975\u2013), which replaced IFLA News ;a n dt h e UNESCO\nJournal of Information Science, Librarianship, and\nArchives Administration (1979\u20131983), which was the\nsuccessor of the UNESCO Bulletin for Libraries .O v e r\ntime, as IFLA grew and became more complex, the\ndegree of detail in these sources tended to diminish.\nThe IFLA annual reports can be accessed by search-\ning on IFLA\u2019s website, although the search function is\nnot very intuitive.2This link confusingly also brings up\nthe annual reports of IFLA sections, in no particular\norder. This brings us to the next, overlapping, category.\nIFLA publications arising from its professional\nactivities\nOver its almost 100 years, IFLA has published a vast\namount of information in addition to the resources\nreferred to above. These include standards and guide-\nlines, manifestos and statements of principles, technical\nreports, reports on research projects, reports on confer-\nences and workshops, and major report series such as\nthe IFLA World Reports and the more recent Trend\nReports.3In recent years, these have increasingly been\npublished online. To gain an impression of the variety\nof materials, one should examine the \u2018Type\u2019 options in\nthe search box on the IFLA\u2019s \u2018Resources\u2019 web page.4\nThese publications are not necessarily about IFLA\nitself, but reflect what it does and the significance of\nits activities. One should also mention the publications\nrelating to IFLA\u2019s annual World Library and Informa-\ntion Congress, including prospectuses, promotional\nnewsletters and the congress programme.5715 Lor: Published sources and themes for the historiography of IFLA\nIFLA has several publications series. The best\nknown are the IFLA Journal , IFLA Publications Series,\nIFLA Series on Bibliographic Control and IFLA Pro-\nfessional Reports. The IFLA Journal has been pub-\nlished quarterly since 1975 and a brief history marked\nits 40th anniversary (Mansfield, 2014). It is by no\nmeans confined to material about IFLA or arising from\nIFLA congresses, but includes news items about IFLA.\nIt is published in print and online and is available online\non the Sage Journals website (from 1975) and open\naccess via the IFLA site (from 1993).6\nThe IFLA Publications Series is a monograph series\n(ISSN 0344-6891) or \u2018greenbacks\u2019 published by De\nGruyter.7Two or three issues appear every year, with\nmany of them emanating from workshops and confer-\nences about professional matters. At the time of writing,\nthe most recent one was Number 183.\nA significant proportion of the publications about\nIFLA\u2019s activities are produced by IFLA\u2019s professional\nunits (sections, special interest groups, advisory commit-\ntees and divisions). They issue publications about their\nactivities, such as annual reports, reports on project out-\ncomes, professional and technical reports and guidelines\nfor best practice, and newsletters. This also applies to the\nformer \u2018Core Activities\u2019, some of which are now advi-\nsory committees.8Each of the professional units has a\npage on IFLA\u2019s website. Their publications are listed\nthere, mostly with clickable links where one can down-\nload them. A good example is the web page of the\nCataloguing Section, which over decades has been very\nactive in various projects and especially in developing\nand publishing international standards and guidelines for\ncataloguing.9On its site, there is an extensive list of its\npublications. The Cataloguing Section also has\na \u2018Section Archive\u2019, which lists older publications\nand unpublished materials such as annual reports, strate-\ngic plans and meeting reports.10The Section\u2019s Metadata\nNewsletter can be accessed via its web page as well.11\nSpecial mention should be made of the many man-\nifestos, declarations, statements, position statements,\nguidelines and standards of various kinds. They make\nimportant contributions to the dissemination of pro-\nfessional best practice and to advocacy for the place\nof libraries in the international arena. Although it is\nnot their primary purpose, these documents constitute\nevidence of IFLA\u2019s activities. Often, they are pre-\nfaced by an introduction describing the processes\nthrough which they were produced.\nIFLA\u2019s institutional repository, the IFLA Library,\nshould not be overlooked. It was launched in 2013 and\nis growing steadily, as congress papers and other\nresources are added to it continuously. It can be\nsearched and browsed, and access to the materials is\ninstantaneous.12IFLA publications about itself\nIn common with other organisations of its nature, IFLA\nhas produced many publications introducing and pro-\nmoting itself, and describ ing its activities. Among\nother publications, the annual reports, referred to\nabove, serve this purpose. On the IFLA website there\nis a page about IFLA\u2019s history, giving references and\nclickable links to PDF files. This site also includes\npublications other than those of IFLA itself.13Individ-\nual professional units have also published brochures\naimed at recruiting members. Many of these have been\nephemeral, but more recently they have been published\non the website and can be found by searching, for\nexample, for \u2018brochures\u2019 using the search function\nmentioned above. Indeed, today, the IFLA website is\nthe single most important source of information about\nIFLA, and a search there is indispensable in any his-\ntorical research. This leads us to the next category.\nBibliographic sources\nA serious search should include the use of biblio-\ngraphic databases such as LISA: Library and Infor-\nmation Science Abstracts, now part of the ProQuest\nstable. LISA has been seen as offering better interna-\ntional coverage. EBSCO\u2019s Library, Information Sci-\nence and Technology Abstracts is a free open-access\ndatabase for library and information science. A search\non the term \u2018IFLA\u2019 immediately pulls up almost 8000\nreferences in at least seven languages, many of them\nabout the Library Reference Model, a high-level con-\nceptual model for bibliographic control data that is\ncurrently receiving much attention. A huge number\nof items can be found very rapidly, but in no particular\norder, using Google Scholar. The lack of order pro-\nmotes serendipity. One finds useful items, both older\nand very recent, for which one is not specifically\nlooking, with the advantage that an electronic copy\ncan often be accessed at the same time.\nSeveral published histories of IFLA include useful\nbibliographies. The history of IFLA from 1927 to\n1940 was the subject of a Master\u2019s dissertation sub-\nmitted to Loughborough University of Technology by\nJohanna L de Vries (1976). Her bibliography includes\nshort contemporary articles from British library jour-\nnals (mainly the Library Association Record ) and the\nDutch library journal Bibliotheekleven ,a n ds o m e\nitems in French and German. Some of the older works\ncited by De Vries provide contemporary accounts of\nmeetings of the International Library Committee\n(e.g. Theissen, 1928) and of the World Congress of\nLibraries and Bibliography (e.g. Leendertz, 1936).\nMany of these were intended as reports by conference\ndelegates to the library associations they had716 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nrepresented. It would be interesting to compare them\nwith the \u2018official\u2019 accounts of these events. Two \u2018term\npapers\u2019 ( Hausarbeiten ) submitted to the Bibliothekar-\nLehrinstitut des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, the\nlibrary school of the West German federal state of\nNordrhein-Westfalen, also deal with the history of\nIFLA (Haselbach, 1967; Heinzle, 1977).\nAn important source for the history of IFLA\u2019s first\n50 years is the celebratory volume IFLA\u2019s First Fifty\nYears: Achievements and Challenges in International\nLibrarianship (Koops and Wieder, 1977), published\nas IFLA Publication No. 10 and reprinted in 2011 as\nan e-book by De Gruyter. It includes a substantial\nchronological overview of IFLA\u2019s development\n(Wieder, 1977), with a long list of references. Wieder\nmakes heavy use of IFLA\u2019s Actes and its various suc-\ncessors, but also cites journal articles in various lan-\nguages about IFLA\u2019s development; these were\npredominantly published after the Second World\nWar. A selection of extracts from this chapter, with\nphotographs of all the IFLA presidents, was published\n25 years later, but did not update the 1977 chapter\n(Wieder and Campbell, 2002). There is a substantial\nwell-referenced chapter on the \u2018prehistory\u2019 of IFLA,\nproviding a useful chronology of 11 international\nlibrary and bibliographic conferences that preceded\nthe foundation of IFLA (Rudomino, 1977), and a\ndetailed account of American (and Canadian) involve-\nment in the birth and early years of IFLA. This includes\nan enlightening report on the moral crisis that resulted\nfrom the German invitation to hold the 3rd Interna-\ntional Congress in Germany in 1940 (Mohrhardt,\n1977). The remaining chapters in this volume are\nshorter. Some offer the personal reminisces of key fig-\nures such as Arthur Breycha-Vauthier, Sir Frank Fran-\ncis and Herman Liebaers, all of which provide some\ninsight into the \u2018gentlemen\u2019s club\u2019 that ran IFLA in its\nearlier years. Others discuss IFLA\u2019s relationship with\nthe socialist countries of Eastern Europe (Vladimirov,\n1977) and developing countries (e.g. Jordan, 1977),\nand reflect on IFLA\u2019s future. In the introduction to\nKoops and Wieder\u2019s (1977) volume, the editors refer\nto a special issue of IFLA Journal entitled \u2018IFLA and\ncontemporary library problems\u2019, also to be compiled\nfor the 50th anniversary. It was to consist of articles\ntaking the then newly introduced divisional structure of\nIFLA as its point of departure.\nA bibliography on IFLA was compiled for the Fed-\neration\u2019s General Council (i.e. conference) in Washing-\nton in 1974, edited by Edward P Cambio at the Library\nof Congress. It contains a general introduction to IFLA,\nwhich is followed by a multilingual bibliography of\ngeneral items about IFLA, with an emphasis on the\nInternational Conference on Cataloguing Principles(Paris) and other meetings. The section \u2018About IFLA\u2019\nhas a chronological list of sessions (conferences) with\npublications emanating from them. It includes publica-\ntions relating to the International Office for Universal\nBibliographic Control and I nternational Office for\nInternational Lending, an d works about individual\nsections (Cambio, 1974). In 1977, an updated second\nedition of The International Federation of Library\nAssociations and Institutions: A Selected List of Refer-\nences was published by Verlag Dokumentation as IFLA\nPublication No. 11 (Cambio, 1977). This formed part of\nthe 50th-anniversary celebrations. At 52 pages, it is a\ngreatly expanded version of its 17-page predecessor,\nwith comprehensive coverage of the international\noffices for Universal Bibliographic Control and Univer-\nsal Availability of Publications, the International\nAssociation of Metropolitan City Libraries, IFLA\u2019s\n21 sections and two working groups.\nIn an article written in the context of IFLA\u2019s 60th\nanniversary, Klaus Plo \u00a8tz (1987), while acknowled-\nging some \u2018meritorious publications\u2019, draws attention\nto the need for a \u2018comprehensive description\u2019 of the\ndevelopment of IFLA, and discusses some develop-\nment stages of the Federation by focusing on five key\nyears: 1927, 1947, 1967, 1977 and 1987. However, he\nlists only 11 sources.\nFor IFLA\u2019s 75th anniversary, a much less ambi-\ntious but nevertheless useful brochure was produced\n(Henry and Davis, 2002). It includes a brief history of\nIFLA (six pages), bringing earlier accounts up to date,\nwhich is followed by sections on IFLA\u2019s organisation\nand structure, and its activities. The latter section pro-\nvides a useful brief description of each of IFLA\u2019s\nCore Activities \u2013 Advancement of Librarianship (in\nthe Third World) Programme (ALP); Committee on\nCopyright and Other Legal Matters (CLM); Freedom\nof Access to Information and Freedom of Expression\n(FAIFE); Preservation and Access (PAC); Universal\nAvailability of Publications (UAP) Universal Biblio-\ngraphic Control (UBC; later Universal Bibliographic\nC o n t r o la n dI n t e r n a t i o n a lM A R C ) ;a n dU n i v e r s a l\nDataflow and Telecommunications (UDT) \u2013 which\nplayed a significant role at the time. In the meantime,\nmost of these have been terminated or have morphed\ninto different entities. There is a rather-too-brief sec-\ntion on IFLA\u2019s publications, covering journals and\nseries, followed by a list of the major publications\nof the Core Activities.\nWilhite (2012) includes a bibliography with\napproximately 140 references listed in alphabetical\norder by author. Most of them are to IFLA publica-\ntions. However, while listing journals and books in\nwhich he found information about IFLA, he does not\ncite specific journal articles or book chapters. The717 Lor: Published sources and themes for the historiography of IFLA\nInternational Library Review published an annual\nsurvey under the title \u2018The year\u2019s work in interna-\ntional librarianship\u2019 (e.g. Aman, 1972). Festschriften,\nautobiographical works and general studies on inter-\nnational library and information work contain mate-\nrial ranging from reminiscences to scholarly articles\nrelevant to IFLA\u2019s history (e.g. Carroll, 1986; Knuth,\n1994; Liebaers, 1980; Wormann, 1968). As men-\ntioned earlier, a bibliography of publications on\nIFLA\u2019s history can be found on IFLA\u2019s website.\nMaterials are grouped in some broad categories. It is\nespecially useful in providing references to the more\nsubstantial publications that have appeared when\nIFLA sections celebrated special anniversaries (e.g.\nMcCallum, 2003; Rovelstad, 1977; Van Swigchem,\n1977). Substantial bibliographies can also be found in\nrelevant books and articles. For example, the book by\nAlex Byrne (2007) on IFLA and freedom of informa-\ntion has an impressive bibliography, which is, of\ncourse, not limited to works about IFLA.\nVarious encyclopaedia entries have appeared about\nIFLA \u2013 for example, those in the various editions of\ntheEncyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences\n(Shimmon et al., 2010; Wijnstroom, 1974). IFLA is\nthe main subject of Rayward\u2019s (1994) entry on inter-\nnational library associations in the Encyclopedia of\nLibrary History , and IFLA also features in similar\narticles in other encyclopaedias (Rayward, 1980,\n1986, 1993). It is worth looking at the entries in suc-\ncessive editions since they have different authors and\ndifferent emphases. For the earlier history, the Hand-\nbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft , a \u2018handbook\u2019 in the\nGerman encyclopaedic tradition, should be men-\ntioned. A second edition of this work appeared after\nthe Second World War with two articles on interna-\ntional librarianship. The second of these (Breycha-\nVauthier, 1961) is especially informative.\nPeripheral sources\nThere is a great deal of material in which IFLA fea-\ntures only peripherally. What the researcher finds rel-\nevant depends on the topic of interest and how much\nmaterial can be found on it. In some cases, a casual\nmention of IFLA may provide evidence of IFLA\u2019s\ninvolvement in an event or process, or of the presence\nof IFLA in a given country. Any Google search for\nIFLA or IFLA personalities turns up an almost unma-\nnageable number of additional peripheral material.\nTopics or themes in the published\nliterature\nThis section offers an analysis of the more recent\nliterature published about IFLA. It is based on ananalysis of literature collected by Lor while working\non a book about international and comparative librar-\nianship (Lor, 2019). During the approximately 14\nyears of this project, starting in 2005 and continuing\nafter the publication of the book, databases and Goo-\ngle have been scanned, the contents pages of the most\nlikely library and information science journals have\nbeen regularly checked, and references in bibliogra-\nphies have been followed up. The references are\nadded to a Zotero database, which currently contains\nover 9300 references. Just over 2000 of these were\ncited in the book. Since it was initially intended to\ninclude a chapter on IFLA, everything about IFLA\nthat was found was added to the database. Later, as\nthe focus of the book shifted and the chapter on IFLA\nbecame a paragraph, items were added more selec-\ntively. This changed when IFLA\u2019s centenary was\napproaching and the history of IFLA became the\nfocus of this author\u2019s research. Currently, more com-\nprehensive coverage of IFLA is aimed for, and efforts\nhave been made to fill any lacunae, inter alia by using\nthe \u2018snowball method\u2019. This work is ongoing. For the\nearlier years, many items have proved difficult to\naccess and require further work. For this reason, this\nanalysis is limited to the period 2000\u20132022 inclusive.\nEven in this later period, coverage is not complete \u2013\nnew items keep turning up serendipitously and the\ncoverage of non-English-language material is\ninadequate.\nWhen the analysis was carried out, a search using the\nterm \u2018IFLA\u2019 in the author\u2019s Zotero database yielded\n1337 hits. However, many of these are not relevant.\nThey occur simply because these items were published\nin the IFLA Journal and other IFLA publications. This\nanalysis is limited to works about IFLA. Works pub-\nlished by IFLA are included only if they are about\nIFLA. The Actes du Comit \u00b4e international des bibliothe `-\nques and related series as listed by Wilhite (2012: 347)\nin his Appendix 2 have not been included.\nBoolean searching is possible in Zotero using a\nwide range of fields, but it is somewhat cumbersome\nwhen used for multiple items. Therefore, all the hits\nwere examined for relevance, leaving 543 items.\nRestricting the search to the period 2000\u20132022 left\n294 items. For the purposes of this analysis, it is pro-\nposed that this corpus is adequate.\nTypes of publications\nThe types of publications are set out in Table 1.\nVideos, infographics and items consisting predomi-\nnantly of the texts of manifestos, statements, standards,\nand so on, were excluded. Web pages, blog posts and\nemail messages were only included if they constituted718 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nreasonably substantial sources of information. Even\nwith this limitation, it became clear that web-based\ndocuments constitute a significant and growing type\nof publication. The ongoing preservation of IFLA\u2019s\nwebsites will be critical for future historians.\nAnalysis of topics\nThe items that are added to the database are allocated\nalpha-numeric codes, which were developed in the\nearly stages of the research for the book \u2013 for example:\nQ: IFLA\nQ1: Origins and development\nQ2: Goals and values\nQ3: Membership and structure\nQ4: Activities and contribution\nThe classification was extended as the database\ngrew, but although it was useful in identifying mate-\nrial about IFLA, the a-priori classes proved inap-\npropriate for the topical analysis. In a preliminary\nstudy reported elsewhere (Lor, 2022), a set of 16 topic\ntags was used. The tags were developed inductively \u2013\nthat is, on the basis of \u2018li terary warrant\u2019 and not\ndeductively using predetermined categories. For the\npresent study, this set of tags was refined and\nextended to 25. All the items were then allocated tags\nin a fresh round. This was done for the full data set of\n543 items, starting in 1927.\nThree levels of topic tags were used. The same set\nof topics was used for all three levels, the difference\nbeing in the degree to which the tagged materials dealt\nwith the topics. Primary tags were allocated to items\nthat dealt exclusively or mainly with IFLA. Only one\nprimary tag was allocated per item. No more than one\nsecondary tag was allocated to items that did not deal\nmainly or exclusively with IFLA but in which useful\ninformation about IFLA was presented. Each item\nwas given either a primary or a secondary tag. In\naddition, one or two supplementary tags could be\nallocated to cover additional topics in items to whichprimary or secondary tags had been allocated. The\nallocation of the topic tags is set out in Table 2. The\ntags are ranked by the frequency of the primary tags.\nSome notes on these categories are in order:\n/C15\u2018Cooperation\u2019 covers cooperative relations\namong libraries and of libraries with other bod-\nies, not IFLA\u2019s cooperation with other bodies,\nwhich is covered under \u2018Relations\u2019, \u2018FID\u2019 and\n\u2018UNESCO\u2019.\n/C15\u2018Conferences/congresses\u2019 includes many\nreports on specific conferences by participants,\nincluding first-timers and grant recipients.\n/C15\u2018Core Activities\u2019 includes not only the original\nseven Core Activities (ALP, CLM, FAIFE,\nPAC, UAP, UBC and UDT) but also later stra-\ntegic programmes and committees, such as the\nIFLA-Conference of Directors of National\nLibraries Alliance for Bibliographic Standards,\nBuilding Strong Library Associations and the\nCommittee on Standards.\n/C15IFLA\u2019s relations with FID, now defunct, were\nan important issue until FID\u2019s demise in 2001\u2013\n2002.\n/C15\u2018Management\u2019 covers IFLA\u2019s organisational\nstructure, processes and management issues.\n/C15\u2018Political issues\u2019 covers the impact of interna-\ntional politics on IFLA. During the Cold War\nperiod, this was a significant topic. After the\nCold War, it became less prominent, but we\nmay expect it to reappear.\n/C15\u2018Publications\u2019 only covers items about the pub-\nlications, such as their history, analysis and\nevaluation.\n/C15\u2018Relations with allied bodies, funders, spon-\nsors, etc.\u2019 includes items dealing with IFLA\u2019s\nrelations with other \u2018peak bodies\u2019, such as the\nInternational Publishers Association, the Inter-\nnational Board on Books for Young People and\nthe International Council on Archives.\n/C15\u2018Statements, manifestos, guidelines\u2019 does not\ninclude these publications as such, but only items\nabout them \u2013 for example, how they were devel-\noped, disseminated and received by the profes-\nsion. The same applies to \u2018Standards\u2019. The\nborderline between statements and standards is\nnot always clear. The \u2018Standards\u2019 tag was applied\nto the more technical and quantitative items.\n/C15\u2018Sustainable Development Goals and Millen-\nnium Development Goals\u2019 refers to IFLA\u2019s\ninvolvement in these Goals.\nClustered at the foot of Table 2 are topics that\noccurred seldom or not at all during the periodTable 1.

These tags have been retained in the table\nwith a view to potential future comparisons with those\nearlier periods. The earlier preliminary study (Lor,\n2022) does not offer a breakdown by period.\nThemes\nTo gain a more coherent view of the field, it is helpful\nto consolidate the topics listed in Table 2 into a\nsmaller number of broader themes based on the con-\ntent of the tagged items. Some broad themes emerge\nreadily; others are more difficult to delimit:\n1.Advocacy for libraries and the profession:\nexternal communication to protect profes-\nsional turf and increase influence.\nTopics: Advocacy, Cooperation, FID, League of\nNations, Relations, Sustainable Development\nGoals and Millennium Development Goals,UNESCO, World Summit on the Information\nSociety (87 tags).\n2.Professional services aimed at actual or poten-\ntial library users anywhere.\nTopics: Development, Relief (22 tags).\n3.Professional development of members and the\nprofession generally.\nTopics: Conferences, Regional offices, Sec-\ntions (68 tags).\n4.Multipurpose communication and initiatives :\nthese serve Themes 1, 2 and 3 to a greater or\nlesser extent and cannot be incorporated in\nthose themes.\nTopics: Core Activities, Publications, Stan-\ndards, Statements (117 tags).\n5.Organisational needs : self-understanding,\nmaintenance, growth, survival.\nTopics: Bibliography, Biography, Countries,\nGeneral, History, Management, Politics (67\ntags).Table 2.

Since some 122 items were allocated more than one tag, the total\nnumber of tags allocated is 362.720 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nIt is interesting to compare these themes with fra-\nmeworks for the study of organisations \u2013 for example,\nthose of Schein (2011) and Holmes (2019). In the\nstudy referred to earlier (Lor, 2022), a comment by\nSchein served as a point of departure for a framework.\nHe wrote that all organisations \u2018have to deal with two\nfundamental sets of issues \u2013 external adaptation and\ninternal integration\u2019 (S chein, 2011: 314). On this\nbasis, we might distinguish two broad areas: (a)\nIFLA\u2019s external environment and how it responds to\nit and (b) how IFLA conceptualises and organises\nitself. An alternative schema can be derived from the\ntheory of \u2018organisational logics\u2019 in \u2018hybrid organisa-\ntions\u2019, as discussed by Holmes (2019). Professional\nassociations can be regarded as \u2018hybrid organisations\u2019\nbecause they must meet the needs of diverse stake-\nholders. This implies diverse \u2018institutional logics that\nset out the orientation of teams and acceptable beha-\nviour patterns\u2019 (Holmes, 2019: 77). The logics can be\nsummarised as follows:\n1. The membership logic is concerned with\nresponding to the needs of the association\u2019s\nmembers, speaking on their behalf, executing\ntheir will, and dealing with them as a diverse\ncollective.\n2. The professional logic is concerned with stra-\ntegies to preserve the association\u2019s control\nover a professional field, and the improvement\nof the occupational prestige and status of its\nmembers. This includes the \u2018learned society\nfunction\u2019 of creating and curating professional\nknowledge and establishing standards.\n3. The public logic is concerned with the benefit,\ninformation, engagement and protection of the\npublic, including the clients served by the\nassociation\u2019s members.\n4. The organisational logic is concerned with the\nrunning of the organisation, dealing with risk\nand managing risk, and managing the demands\nof employees and volunteers (adapted from\nHolmes, 2019: 78).\nThis provides an explanatory framework for the list\nof themes developed above. Different organisations\nwill give different weight to the four logics. IFLA is\nan international non-governmental organisation that\nneeds to reconcile the requirements of a very diverse,\ngeographically distributed membership; seeks to pro-\nmote excellent professional practice in the interests of\nlibrary users and potential users worldwide; and needs\nto survive as a viable organisation. Its international\nrole adds a level of complexity to the four logics\nproposed by Holmes.Conceptual frameworks\nBy far the majority of the items examined for this\narticle were straightforward, bland and uncritical nar-\nrative accounts. The historical contributions were\nmainly descriptions of events and developments in a\nroughly chronological order, or narratives rich in\nanecdote. In the literat ure published during 2000\u2013\n2022, only 15 items were of interest in terms of meth-\nodology . The authors of these contributions had\napplied various forms of literature, content, rhetorical\nand bibliometric analysis; explicit comparative meth-\nods; and formal programme impact assessments.\nThere were also 12 items of a critical and evaluative\nnature, including some dealing with the recent man-\nagement problems at IFLA headquarters, critical and\nevaluative assessments of IFLA standards and guide-\nlines, critical views of IFLA conferences, and cri-\ntiques of IFLA\u2019s stance on human rights and social\njustice. In only two cases were explicit ideological\nstances (Marxist and post-colonial) evident. The\npublished literature on IF LA is largely devoid of\nmethodological rigour. Explicit research paradigms\nare hardly ever mentioned. Neither is there any\nevidence of the use of conceptual frameworks from\nother social science disciplines.\nHistorical research should not be undertaken in a\ntheoretical void. A suitable theoretical framework adds\nvalue, especially in the case of more ambitious\ncontributions. A great deal has been written on the\ntheory of organisations, international organisations,\nnon-governmental organisations and international\nnon-governmental organisations in the context of inter-\nnational relations, development theory, the relationship\nbetween civil society and other political-economic\nactors, globalisation, neo-liberal capitalism, gender\nstudies, and so on. At the very least, we should not\nforget the wider context of library and information his-\ntory as, for example, in the work of Black (e.g. Black,\n1998; Black and Mak, 2019) and Rayward (e.g. 1996,\n2014). This varied literature is sure to suggest useful\ntheoretical frameworks for the historiography of IFLA.\nConclusion\nThere is no lack of material awaiting IFLA\u2019s histor-\nians. The approaching IFLA centenary presents an\nopportune time for historians to delve into IFLA\u2019s\nhistory, on which a scholarly monograph is being\nplanned. A call for chapter proposals, which at the\ntime of writing is being developed, will show that\nmany interesting and challenging themes have already\nbeen identified. It is hoped that this article will help\ngenerate interest and prompt IFLA members to par-\nticipate in the centennial projects of IFLA\u2019s Library721 Lor: Published sources and themes for the historiography of IFLA\nHistory Special Interest Group, and contribute to the\nhistoriography of IFLA.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks former Acting Secretary General of\nIFLA, Helen Mandl, for permitting and facilitating use of\nthe IFLA Archives, and gratefully acknowledges the expert\nassistance provided by Louis Tak\u00b4 acs and Anne Korhonen\nin using the Archives.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author\u2019s expenses to travel to Dublin and The Hague in\nJuly and August 2022 were funded from the research fund\nof the Department of Information Science, University of\nPretoria.\nORCID iD\nPeter Johan Lor https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6307-9068\nNotes\nhttps://www.ifla.org/g/library-history/projects/\n1.

Established\nin 1973, the American Library Association Archives holds over a terabyte of digital content and nearly 4000\ncubic feet of official records, personal papers, and publications created by or relating to the association, its\nmembers, and the history of librarianship. On the strength of its collection and affiliation with the University\nArchives, the American Library Association Archives serves as a major research center on the history of the\nassociation and American librarianship. This article reflects on the history of the American Library Association\nArchives, the investment made by the American Library Association to preserve its heritage, and the growth of\nthe program. It also discusses the current state of the collection and what has made the program successful.\nKeywords\nArchives, library history, library associations, American Library Association\nIntroduction\nFrom 4\u20136 October 1876, 103 librarians gathered at the\nHistorical Society of Pennsylvania during the USA\u2019s\nCentennial Exposition for a Convention of Librarians.\nThis was the first convention of professional librar-\nians in the USA since 1853, primarily organized by a\nthen relatively unknown librarian, Melvil Dewey,\nand supported and attended by leaders of the field\u2014\nJustin Winsor, William F Poole, Reuben Guild, Henry\nA Holmes, and Lloyd P Smith. The conference was\nviewed as a success and, by the final session, a reso-\nlution was passed to establish the American Library\nAssociation (ALA; Thomison, 1978: 5\u201310). While a\nprevious attempt at forming an enduring library asso-\nciation in 1853 failed, this time it was successful and\nwas the start of what has become the oldest and largest\nlibrary association in the world.\nPreserving ALA\u2019s nearly 150-year history is the job\nof the ALA Archives at the University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign (UIUC). In 1973, ALA and\nthe University of Illinois ent ered a three-year agreement\nfor the University Archives to manage ALA\u2019s records.\nThrough the establishment of the ALA Archives, ALA\nmade a commitment to preserve its history and invested\nin its heritage. Fifty years later, the partnership between\nALA and the university remains strong.The state of primary sources on library history\nappears to be questionable, with the ALA Archives\nstanding as an example of a robust archival program\nfocused on librarianship. The collection is as com-\nplex as ALA\u2019s membership make-up, touching a\nwide range of libraries and librarians from across\nthe USA, and thereby making it an invaluable\nresource for library historians. The ALA Archives\u2019\nfounding is typical of that of many, culminating\nfrom the pressures of an anniversary celebration and\nlack of space to store the collection properly. How-\never, it is worth examining the history of the estab-\nlishment of the ALA Archiv es. Its origins reflect\nmany of the concerns library historians have about\nthe stewardship of library primary sources. Never-\ntheless, its founding and ALA\u2019s continued support\nof the archival program has created a unique collec-\ntion and situation that can be emulated by peer\norganizations.\nCorresponding author:\nCara Bertram, American Library Association Archives, University\nof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1707 S.

There is not\nmuch in the way of a formal survey or study on avail-\nable finding aids, collections, or archival practices\namongst library associations and institutions. How-\never, several articles, primarily focused on US library\nhistory, paint a less than optimistic picture of the state\nof primary sources.\nMany library historians despair over the lack of\ncare taken by librarians in the preservation of their\nown history. In the foreword to A History of the Amer-\nican Library Association, 1876\u20131972 , Edward G Hol-\nley (1978: ix\u2013x) complained that librarians did not\ncare for their history, and that the author of the book,\nDennis Thomison, had to rely heavily on published\nsources in his research be cause there were no avail-\nable primary sources available at the time. In the\nsame vein, Marion Casey, in her essay in the\nNational Catalog of Sources for the History of\nLibrarianship ,n o t e s :\nLibrarians, who ferret out and treasure records from the\npast, have actually been quite remiss about saving their\nown personal papers and the archives of their own insti-\ntutions. Searchers must dig quite deep in some circum-\nstances to find anything at all. (Casey, 1982: 6)\nIn another article, the library historian Wayne\nWiegand (1990: 106\u2013107) praises the bibliographic\ncontrol of American library history, however, he\nlaments that, \u201c[i]n general, the library profession in\nthe United States has not done a good job of retaining\nimportant records for historical scrutiny.\u201d The archi-\nvist Richard Cox (1998: 58) also accuses American\nlibrarians for having \u201clittle respect for the records and\nartifacts of their own past,\u201d and states that \u201clibrarians\nhave demonstrated a lack of awareness of the reasons\nwhy records need to be maintained.\u201d While these are\nnot systematic studies of library-history primary\nsources, the authors draw on their own experiences\nas practiced historians and information professionals.\nTheir frustrations are notable in their observations of\nhow librarians have preserved their own history.\nJohn Mark Tucker\u2019s (2000) overview of source\nmaterials on library history is not as bleak. Tucker\n(2000: 200\u2013203) praises the advancement of technol-\nogy for locating documents on library history, the rise\nin the oral histories of librarians, and the microfilming\nof institutional records from the Library of Congress\nand Harvard University Library, along with the com-\npilation of directories and online databases of primarysources. These approaches have opened access to pri-\nmary sources and documented library history in pro-\nmising ways. He also praises the work done by Holley\nin his scholarship and transcription utilizing the 1876\nALA scrapbook in Raking the Historic Coals: The\nALA Scrapbook of 1876 (1967). However, he does\nbring up concerns that no other librarian has taken\nup similar projects or research, and there is a lack of\ninterest from the community about its history. He\nlaments about the \u201cahistorical mindset of our\nservice-intensive profession,\u201d citing an incident when\na library disposed of photographs of its own events\nand publicity prior to 1980 due to them taking up\nspace (Tucker, 2000: 204\u2013205). As Tucker acknowl-\nedges that advancements have been made in discover-\ning and providing access to primary source items, he\nalso acknowledges what he finds to be a troubling\nmindset amongst librarians with regard to their own\nhistory, echoing previous library historians.\nA more recent article by Dominique Daniel (2021)\nexamines digital resources on library history. Daniel\ndetails her experience as a library-history researcher\nduring the COVID-19 global pandemic, utilizing\nremote reference services and digital collections. She\nutilized well-known resources such as OCLC\u2019s Archi-\nveGrid and the Digital Public Library of America,\nalong with browsing the Internet. She remarks that\n\u201cthere are many primary sources on the history of\nlibraries online, but not as many as one would hope\nand it can be challenging to find them\u201d (Daniel, 2021:\n231). Daniel (2021: 233\u2013234) observes that source\nmaterials are fragmented, it is difficult to find digital\ncollections that are focused on library history, and\nthere is a lack of research guides on the topic.\nMost of the literature is anecdotal, drawing on the\nexperiences of library historians, but there have been\na couple of attempts at a more systematic approach to\nanalyzing library primary sources. Cox (1991) exam-\nined the citations used in scholarly articles in the\nJournal of Library History from 1985\u20131987, finding\nthat the manuscripts of library leaders were more\nheavily used than library institutional records. He\nfound similar trends in library-history dissertations\nin the same period. His analysis of the National Cat-\nalog of Sources for the History of Librarianship\n(1982) notes that public libraries represent the second\nmost numerous sources, trailing far behind personal\npapers, but that they only represent a small fraction of\nactual institutions within the USA (Cox, 1991: 581).\nHe concludes that \u201clibrar y archives are generally\nunderdeveloped and a rarity on the national scene,\u201d\nand that, compared to other kinds of libraries, there is\na higher chance for academic libraries to have725 Bertram: Preserving the history of the American Library Association\narchival records due to there being a university\narchivist on staff (Cox, 1991: 584).\nIn 2005, Alistair Black (2008) sent out a survey to\nall national library associations that were a part of\nIFLA, along with the Special Libraries Association\nin the USA, to collect information on their archives.\nThe survey received 10 responses, with six associa-\ntions indicating that they kept their archives in house\nand four that they deposited their archives with out-\nside institutions. Of the respondents, seven indicated\nthat there were finding aids for their collections,\nalthough one was only in draft form, and another did\nnot make their collections publicly available (Black,\n2008: 3). While Black\u2019s report does not give the spe-\ncific number of surveys distributed, and he notes that\nthe survey was only in English, he expresses disap-\npointment that the number of responses was lower\nthan he expected. He argues that \u201cthis reflects the low\npriority given by associations to their archives and, it\nfollows, to their heritage\u201d (Black, 2008: 4).\nIt is difficult to get a grasp on the current state of\npreservation of the history of librarianship and library\nassociations. Much of the literature and many of the\nstudies on the state of primary source materials go\nback 20 to 30 years. The landscape of library associ-\nation history may not be as bleak as the literature\nsuggests, at least not within the USA. Discovery tools\nlike ArchiveGrid can cast a wide net and locate the\narchives of library associations, although Archive-\nGrid primarily focuses on institutions within the\nUSA and repositories must opt in to have their finding\naids indexed.\nRegardless, the anecdotes of library historians are\nnot optimistic and, even if these observations are not\naccurate with regard to the number of primary sources\navailable for research, the perception that librarians\ndo not care for their history is damaging. This percep-\ntion can become a barrier to access, discouraging\nresearchers from seeking out materials or leading\nthem to approach their research with less optimism\nfor what is out there. It may also be an indication that,\nwhatever association and institutional archives are\nbeing maintained, they are not highly visible online\nor through published guides.\nAn exception to the woes of library historians is the\nALA Archives. In many of the cited articles, the ALA\nArchives is an exception to the rule, with a large\nlibrary-focused collection, strong presence, and\neducation-driven mission.\nEstablishing the ALA Archives\nWhile the ALA Archives was established at the\nUniversity of Illinois in 1973, the origins of the ALAheadquarters as a repository can be traced back to\n1910 with the acceptance of the papers of Seth Hast-\nings Grant (Winger and Miksa, 1971: 3\u20134). However,\nserious discussion regarding the management and pre-\nservation of ALA\u2019s records started in the 1940s. A\nfinal report issued by the Committee on American\nLibrary Association Archival and Library Materials\n(1949: 1) established that \u201cALA as a part of its\nresponsibility to its membership should house the\narchives of the Association and of its Divisions,\nBoards, Round tables, and ALA Committees.\u201d The\nreport named the headquarters library as the deposi-\ntory for the records, with responsibility for the selec-\ntion and arrangement of archival materials belonging\nto the individual ALA units. Analysis of the recom-\nmendations was positive and, at least intellectually,\nALA was heading in the right direction for preserving\nits history. Despite this strong foundation of guide-\nlines, one consultant observed that \u201cno positive action\nhas ever been taken to implement them\u201d (Munden,\n1968: 1).\nIn 1953, two problems were identified regarding\nthe management of ALA\u2019s historical records. The first\nwas the housing of the archives and the second was\nthe organization of the records. In discussions, it was\nnoted that the instructions for organizing the records\nin the 1949 report were unclear to staff, and that there\nwas a need for a trained archivist to work with the\nALA divisions. The issue of space was also discussed,\nwith several different locations within the headquar-\nters suggested for housing the archives (Geer, 1953:\n2\u20133). Whatever action was taken following the meet-\ning is not recorded, but a few years later, in 1956, the\nheadquarters librarian Helen Geer wrote to the exec-\nutive director David Clift in despair about the state of\nthe archives: \u201cthey are stored in a room which is very\ndamp during the summer months and very hot in the\nwinter months. I know that the paper will deteriorate\nunder these conditions.\u201d1\nTen years after Geer\u2019s lament, her successor, Ruth\nWhite, wrote to the ALA associate executive director\nAlphonse Trezza about the continued disorderliness\nof the historical materials. White recommended that\nan archivist and a secretary be hired to collect and\norganize the archives. She also commented on how\nthe archives were dispersed in different parts of the\nbuilding and in a nearby warehouse.2While Trezza\u2019s\nresponse to White\u2019s letter was not saved, in the fol-\nlowing year, ALA started looking for a professional\narchivist to undertake a survey of the archives.\nIn 1968, Kenneth Munden, an archivist at the\nNational Archives, produced a report on the archives\nand recommendations on how to proceed. Amongst\nhis recommendations was the need for the ALA726 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nArchives to become a separate department within the\norganization or, if it was tied in with the library, to be\nrenamed \u201cLibrary and Archives,\u201d so that the archives\nwould not become an afterthought (Munden, 1968: 8).\nHowever, progress in establishing the ALA Archives\nwas slow, even with ALA\u2019s centennial anniversary\nquickly approaching in 1976. The report of the Spe-\ncial Committee on American Library Association\nCentennial Anniversary (1969: 1) to the Executive\nBoard expressed disappointment that no archivist\nhad been hired, and concern that there could be no\npublication celebrating ALA\u2019s history for its centen-\nnial. Space at headquarters and financial limitations\ncontinued to hinder efforts for the realization of\norganized association archives.\nA second report on the archives was produced in\nlate 1969 by Philip Mooney, a curator from the\nGeorge Arents Research Library at Syracuse Univer-\nsity. It did not break new ground following Munden\u2019s\nearlier report, with one exception\u2014Mooney said that\nSyracuse could acquire ALA\u2019s archives. It was an\nattractive proposal, as ALA had concluded that\nmanaging its own archives would not be feasible\n(Warncke, 1970: 1). But the potential arrangement\nwith Syracuse did not satisfy ALA\u2019s needs. The loca-\ntion was deemed too far from its headquarters in\nChicago. Other concerns included transferring own-\nership of the records to Syracuse and if adequate\naccess to the records could be provided (Warncke,\n1970: 1\u20132).\nALA hoped instead to find a repository closer by.\nThe suggestions included the Newberry Library in\nChicago; the University of Illinois, which had cam-\npuses in Chicago and Urbana-Champaign; and the\nLibrary of Congress, which was in the vicinity of\nALA\u2019s Washington office (Warncke, 1970: 1). The\nlibrary historian Edward Holley wrote about the mer-\nits of the Urbana-Champaign campus of the Univer-\nsity of Illinois:\nThe idea of transferring the archives to the University of\nIllinois strikes me as a good one, but I think the Urbana\ncampus would be preferrable to Chicago, the main rea-\nson being that Urbana has so many other materials that\nwould be important to a researcher working on the\narchives ...I refer to annual reports of libraries, library\nperiodicals, and even such materials as the University\nArchives. A number of Illinois staff members have been\nheavily involved with ALA and most of their papers are\nwell organized.3\nIn 1971, Robert Talmadge, a member of the ALA\nExecutive Board and a librarian at UIUC, connected\nwith University of Illinois archivist Maynard Brich-\nford regarding the possible acquisition of the ALAarchives.4Later that year, Brichford carried out\nanother survey of the archives and proposed transfer-\nring the archives to UIUC. Like Holley, Brichford\nemphasized the strong archival program he had estab-\nlished; library and archival holdings in the areas of\nlibrarianship and library history; the university\u2019s pro-\nminent library school; and the participation of its staff\nand faculty in ALA.5ALA and Brichford entered dis-\ncussions over access policies and shaping an agree-\nment that satisfied both parties. ALA and the\nUniversity of Illinois ent ered a three-year contract\nto house the records at the Urbana-Champaign cam-\npus. On 31 October 1973, ALA announced the trans-\nfer of its archives from its Chicago headquarters to\nUrbana-Champaign.\nThe establishment of organized archives was a long\nprocess, and the lack of progress was summed up well\nin the minutes of the 1970 spring meeting of the ALA\nExecutive Board:\nFunds were denied previously for staff to arrange the\narchives. There was little disposition then to consider\nthe arrangement of the archives as an essential need,\npossibly because there might be funds\u2014and there would\nbe time\u2014in another year. (American Library Associa-\ntion Executive Board, 1970: 86)\nThe lack of prioritization of the archives echoes the\nworries that many library historians have expressed\u2014\nthat library associations and institutions do not care\nfor their history. There was an awareness of the need\nto preserve ALA\u2019s history, but the issue stagnated\nuntil the internal and external pressures of its centen-\nnial finally pushed ALA into action. Still, it took years\nto find an archival repository that satisfied its needs.\nFollowing Brichford\u2019s initial proposal in 1971, it\nwould be another two years before ALA began trans-\nferring its records to UIUC.\nHowever, the slow approach to selecting a final\nrepository was not necessarily a bad thing. An orga-\nnization needs to know that its records will be well\ntaken care of; that the hosting repository can fulfill its\nneeds; and that the conditions satisfy both parties,\nwhether it be having the archives on deposit or\nthrough a donation. Willam Maher (1994: 9) notes\nthat while the lead time to the final agreement\nbetween UIUC and ALA seemed like a long time,\nin hindsight, it produced a sound contract with clear\nrelationships and responsibilities.\nProgrammatic growth\nSince the original deposit agreement in 1973, ALA\nhas continued to renew the contract for the last\n50 years. While the contract has changed during that727 Bertram: Preserving the history of the American Library Association\ntime frame, the core elements of the original\nagreement are still in effe ct today and, from this\nfoundation, the archival program has seen significant\ngrowth.\nRather than donating the archives to UIUC as a\ngift, ALA has retained ownership of its materials. In\nmost deed-of-gift agreements, ownership of copyright\nis transferred to the receiving institution. However, a\ndeposit agreement allows ALA to retain its intellec-\ntual property while the repository maintains and pro-\nvides access to the collection. Ownership has meant\nthat ALA has stayed strongly involved with its\narchives. ALA units utiliz e the collection and the\nexpertise of archives staff as a resource; there is\ncollaboration between the ALA Archives and head-\nquarters for events, celebrations, and the acquisition\nof archival materials; and the ALA Library headquar-\nters staff and archives st aff maintain consistent\ncommunication.\nALA provides annual financial support for the\narchives, the majority of which goes to personnel.\nAt the time of the initial agreement, ALA could not\nafford to hire a full-time archivist. However, the Grad-\nuate School of Library Science (now the iSchool) pro-\nvided an ample source of graduate students seeking\nhands-on experience in archives under the supervision\nof the university archivist or assistant university archi-\nvist. In 2004, ALA provided funding for a half-time\nacademic professional to serve as the archivist with\ngraduate assistant support. In 2020, funding increased\nto maintain a full-time professional archivist with grad-\nuate assistant support. With a professional position,\nthere is now continuity and strong collection knowl-\nedge, which is often lacking when relying primarily\non graduate assistants as they are typically enrolled\nfor only two years. Additional costs are related to\nsupplemental digital programs, supplies, and travel\nfor personnel.\nWhile ALA was prepared to pay for storage at the\nuniversity, complications with the campus legal coun-\nsel prevented payment for the space. This meant that\nthe University Archives had to accommodate the\nALA records in its then current allocation of storage,\nthus making the argument for the research value of the\nALA Archives at UIUC, and its compliment to exist-\ning collections, even more essential (Maher, 1994: 9).\nDespite the lack of funding for the physical space, the\nUniversity Archives has worked to improve the stor-\nage, access, and preservation of the collection, as is\ndone with their other materials. Initial storage of the\narchives was in the basement of a campus building\nwith reference services operating out of the University\nArchives. Then, in 2007, the collection and services\nwere moved into office spaces and climate-controlledstacks at the Archives Research Center, which is an\nadditional service point and storage location for the\nUniversity Archives. The heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning, fire suppression system, and insulation of\nthe stacks were updated in 2016. Currently, the ALA\nArchives is slated to move into the renovated Archives\nand Special Collections building at the center of cam-\npus. This project is estimated to be completed in 2026.\nThe deposit agreement also had another, possibly\nunintended, effect\u2014of creating a distinct program\nseparate from the University Archives collection.\nWhile still under the supervision of the University\nArchives, the program has forged its own identity.\nThe extent of ALA\u2019s records was large enough that\nBrichford developed a classification system separate\nfrom that of the University Archives. The original\npaper finding aids and microfilmed guides are now\nin an individual searchable database, branded specif-\nically for the ALA Archives. The archives also main-\ntains its own website and social media presence,\ndisplays exhibits, hosts events and tours, and has a\ndedicated professional archivist and its own patron\nbase. The growth of the program has provided better\npreservation of the materials, subject expertise from\nstaff, and higher visibility, and thus access, to the\ncollection.\nCollection and digital resources\nIn accordance with the collection\u2019s policy, the ALA\nArchives collects, preserves, and provides access to\ninactive records of enduring value from ALA units\n(defined as offices, divisions, round tables, commit-\ntees, etc.); members\u2019 papers as they relate to ALA\nactivities and librarianship; and manuscripts and\nrecords on the history of libraries and librarians\n(American Library Association Archives, 2022). The\ncollection spans from a scrapbook on ALA\u2019s short-\nlived predecessor, the 1853 Librarians Convention, to\ndigital-born documents produced by ALA members\ntoday. The core of the collection was transferred from\nALA headquarters, primarily consisting of files from\nALA\u2019s offices, divisions, and governance. These files\ndocument the history of ALA\u2019s administrative func-\ntions and policies, events and conferences, advocacy,\nliteracy and library campaigns, awards and scholar-\nship programs, and public service. There is also a\ngrowing collection of papers from ALA presidents,\nstaff, leadership, and members, collected through pri-\nvate donations.\nAlongside the physical materials, the ALA\nArchives maintains a robust and multifaceted digital\narchives program, most of which is open access or\navailable on request. This includes:728 IFLA Journal 50(4)\n/C15The University of Illinois Digital Library,\nwhich displays digitized physical records and\nborn-digital collections.\n/C15The ALA Institutional Repository, an online\nrepository that preserves and provides access\nto the intellectual work of ALA, including pub-\nlications, minutes and agendas, oral histories,\nreports, White Papers, speeches, and presenta-\ntions. As of 2023, it held over 19,300 open-\naccess items.\n/C15An image database of over 5400 digitized items\nscanned from the physical archival collection\nand comprising primarily photographs, along\nwith postcards, posters, and illustrations.\n/C15The ALA Web Archive, a collection in Archive-It\nof the annual captures of ALA\u2019s websites going\nback to 2013.\n/C15The University of Illinois Library\u2019s Medusa\ndigital preservation repository, an offline stor-\nage system for the preservation of digital mate-\nrials which provides storage space for digitized\nand born-digital items that are unsuitable for\nimmediate open access.\nThe ALA Archives also holds materials on related\nlibrary associations and organizations, either created\nand collected by ALA or deposited at the archives by\nsaid associations. This includes records on IFLA, the\nArt Libraries Society of North America, Association\nfor Library and Information Science Education, and\nNational Associations of Librarians of Color. These\ncomplimentary records strengthen the core collec-\ntion by expanding into specialized areas of librar-\nianship and emphasizing the work of organizations\nfor under-represented librarians. Moreover, these\nrecords demonstrate the interconnectedness of ALA\non the national and international stage, document-\ning past and ongoing relationships. Many library\norganizations can also trace their origins to ALA\nor its members.\nThe IFLA records within the collection are a good\nexample of ALA\u2019s interconnectedness. Within the\npapers of the ALA International Relations Office, a\nresearcher can trace the beginnings of IFLA in files on\ninternational library cooperation from the mid to late\n1920s. There are meeting minutes and reports that\ncover the preparation and discussions within ALA for\nthe 1927 conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, where\nIFLA was founded, and ALA\u2019s early participation.\nThe ALA International Relations Office and Interna-\ntional Relations Committee\u2019s files document ALA\u2019s\ncontinued participation, containing materials on con-\nferences as early as 1929, and maintain a collection of\nIFLA publications. But more can be found throughoutthe ALA Archives. Participation in IFLA by ALA\npresidents, executive directors, and members is well\ndocumented within its papers, including past IFLA\npresident Robert Wedgeworth. Photographs of IFLA\nconferences and events can be found in the files of\nthe magazine, American Libraries , from 1977 to\n2004. There are also over six cubic feet of files\nfrom IFLA\u2019s Cataloguing Section. These records\nshow the strong participation of ALA and its mem-\nbers in IFLA, and strengthen the archives\u2019 histori-\ncal holdings on international librarianship.\nA weakness of the collection is the early years of\nALA, particularly from 1876 through 1910. Before\nALA had long-term headquarters, it was said that the\nassociation was in Dewey\u2019s desk drawer or wherever\nthe ALA secretary hung up their hat. The reality is\nthat the association originally operated out of\nDewey\u2019s offices in Boston, then a few short-term\nlocations until it moved to Chicago in 1909\n(Massman, 1969: 475). Without a consistent location\nto accumulate and store records, they likely ended up\nwith individuals or were lost (Winger and Miksa,\n1971: 3\u20134). Even when ALA had permanent head-\nquarters, disorganizati on and environmental condi-\ntions meant that some early records were lost or\nthrown away. While archiv al sources from this time\nare sparse, the published conference proceedings,\nprograms, reports, and photographs held by the ALA\nArchives help to bridge this gap.\nAnother gap in the collection is documentation of\nALA round tables. These units are driven by member-\nship and reflect the values, concerns, and activism of\nthe profession. However, the materials produced by\nthe round tables often remain with ALA members and\nare not transferred as regularly as records accumu-\nlated at headquarters. Because of this, the archival\nrecord on round tables sometimes does not reflect the\ndepth of their history.\nDespite the gaps in the archival record, the ALA\nArchives continues to be a destination for researchers\nwho are interested in library history. The collection\ntouches a wide range of topics in American librarian-\nship and has expanded in the last 50 years. At the time\nof the publication of the first Guide to the American\nLibrary Association Archives in 1979, the ALA\nArchives consisted of 678 cubic feet of processed\narchival materials and intellectual control over 437\nrecord series (Brichford, 1979: 3). In 2023, the col-\nlection had expanded to over 1500 searchable find-\ning aids, most with box- and folder-level inventories,\nand 3900 cubic feet of physical materials, as well as\nover a terabyte of digital content. The quality of the\nstewardship of the collection and its growth, includ-\ning processing new materials and writing finding729 Bertram: Preserving the history of the American Library Association\naids, can only be maintained through the continued\nsupport of ALA.\nConsiderations\nThe care of the archives of an active library associa-\ntion is an ongoing investment, not a one-off project.\nWhile the thought of archives often congers up\nimages of dusty old files and boxes from the past,\narchives are also about the future. Active organiza-\ntions will continue to produce documentation,\nwhether it be physical or digital records, and those\nmust be taken into consideration through records\nmanagement and retention schedules.\nALA\u2019s archives started out as many archives do\u2014\ndisorganized and put off to deal with another year.\nWhen ALA finally prioritized its historical records,\nit created a sustainable archival program in partner-\nship with UIUC. What has made the ALA Archives a\nsuccessful venture is a combination of factors.\nFirst is the partnership between ALA and UIUC.\nStrong cooperation, communication, and education-\ndriven missions have created a fruitful collaboration\nthat has endured for over 50 years. Beyond negotiat-\ning a satisfactory deposit agreement, the university\nlibrary and University Archives also had collections\nthat built on the thematic strengths of the ALA\u2019s\nrecords, which has made the ALA Archives an attrac-\ntive place for library historians and scholars. This also\nhelped the University Archives in building a justifi-\ncation for taking in ALA\u2019s archives. Finding an insti-\ntution that works well with a library association or\norganization in communica tion style, mission, and\ncollection strengths can create a partnership that ben-\nefits both parties.\nSecond is the financial investment of ALA in the\ncontinued support of the archives. As an active library\nassociation, its records have continued to grow, and\nthey must be continuously managed, making ALA\u2019s\nsupport essential to the ALA Archives\u2019 success as a\nprogram. Even with the proliferation of digital\nrecords that do not take up physical space, these too\nmust be organized, preserved, and made available as\nappropriate. The preservation of digital records is\nalso not immune to costs, as their storage can be\nexpensive. While most organizations cannot fund\nan archival program at the level of ALA, even small\nfinancial contributions can help to secure the time\nand labor of an archivist or graduate student for ini-\ntial arrangement and description. This also acknowl-\nedges the effort and resources that go into caring for\na collection.\nThird is the visibility of, and access to, the collec-\ntion. The ALA Archives maintains its own website,distinguishing itself as a distinct archival program\nwith a database of finding aids, research guides, blog\nposts, and other information about the archives. While\nlinks to the archives are buried in the ALA and uni-\nversity library sites, it is relatively easy to find the\nwebsite. It also maintains responsive reference ser-\nvices and provides both on-site and remote services.\nAt minimum, an organization should have a web page\nthat provides information about its archives, where it\nis located, how it can be accessed, and links to any\nfinding aids or inventories.\nAnd finally, fourth is the continued depositing of\nphysical records and focus on digital records.\nArchives staff work closely with ALA units to pro-\nvide guidance on the retention of materials. This has\nresulted in the growth of the collection and continued\ndocumentation of ALA\u2019s history. ALA has also\nworked on preserving its digital records, developing\na digital repository with the archives, investing in a\nweb archive, and working with the archives on other\nstrategies for digital collections. As stated above,\norganizations need to look to the future as they con-\ntinue to produce records, both physical and digital,\nand work in cooperation with archivists on preserva-\ntion strategies.\nConclusion\nLibrary associations, organizations, and institutions\nmust be leaders in the preservation of their own his-\ntories, not just for use in celebrations and publicity,\nbut also as a tool of transparency. Librarians and\narchivists advocate for open and free access to infor-\nmation for the public and, with this ideal, they must\npractice it within their own organizations. For the\ngrowth, development, and morale of library organiza-\ntions, they must be active in preserving their histories\nand make them available for celebration, analysis,\nand criticism.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nFunding\nThe author received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nCara Bertram https://orcid.org/0009-0002-8353-6507\nNotes\n1.

It notes the disappearance of these\nprograms and their approach to a coherent, cooperative global information system. It argues that this was a\nresult of geopolitical developments, organizational changes within UNESCO and its related organizations, and\nthe rapid evolution of huge competitive commercial enterprises. These have been responsible for both\ndeveloping and exploiting the transformative digita l technologies that are now associated with owning\nincreasingly complex information systems and services, and selling access to them in what has become a\nglobal, borderless marketplace for information as a commodity.\nKeywords\nUNISIST, NATIS, IFLA, FID, information commodification\nIntroduction\nAs World War II drew to a close, there was an increas-\ning awareness, in contradistinction to the period at the\nend of World War I, of the need not only to mobilize\ninformation as a key component of post-war planning to\nsupport the new world order that was emerging from the\nchaotic conditions of the war, but also to manage an\nenormous range of international tensions and conflicts\nthat were emerging at the time. This article focuses on\ntwo separate but related trends of development that cul-\nminated in two major conferences: the Intergovernmen-\ntal Conference for the Establishment of a World Science\nInformation System (UNISIST) in Paris in 1971 and the\nIntergovernmental Conference on the Planning of\nNational Documentation, Library and Archive Infra-\nstructures (NATIS) in Paris in 1974. The events, often\nthemselves international conferences, that led to these\nsummative meetings were centered on the newly cre-\nated UNESCO working during a period of several\ndecades with three major international associations con-\ncerned with information: IFLA, the InternationalFederation for Documentation (FID) and the Interna-\ntional Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). It was as\nif something like a world information order, based on\nthe coordinated work of international associations, was\nat last to be achieved (Otlet 1907, 1909). But even as\nthese important international meetings took place and\nhad some impact, they were overtaken by a constantly\naccelerating impetus for change in the information orga-\nnizations, systems, and services of which, for a time,\nthey were a part. For a timeline of the conferences and\norganisations mentioned in this text (see Figure 1).\nAllied interwar and post-war\ndocumentation activities\nThe successes and failures of the initiatives taken on\nboth sides in times of war have depended in part on\nCorresponding author:\nW Boyd Rayward, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 501 E\nDaniel St, Champaign, Illlinois 61820, USA.\nEmail: wrayward@illinois.eduInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions\n\u00aaThe Author(s) 2024\nArticle reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nDOI: 10.1177/03400352241242123\njournals.sagepub.com/home/iflIFL A\n2024, Vol. 50(4) 732\u2013754\nthe effectiveness of the systems that have been set up\nto gather, process, evaluate, and deploy\u2014as well as\nrestrict access to\u2014information. These systems are\nneeded, for example, for the research related to weap-\nons development and manufacture, and the technical\nand social infrastructure necessary to support this\nresearch (inventions, materials, processes, machines,\nfactories, workforces); for gauging enemy capabilities\nand movements; for assessing and attempting to influ-\nence the social conditions of the belligerent nations\nand the countries they occupy; and for managing pub-\nlic opinion and the physical, social, and cultural wel-\nfare of the civilian populations involved. Information\nthat is operationally critical is usually referred to as\n\u201cintelligence.\u201d At a more general level are issues of\ndissemination of information, including \u201cintelligence,\u201d\nto allies within the constraints of perceptions of\nnational security and the interests of political alliances.\nOne of the important aftermaths of war has been what\nto do with this information and the systems and ser-\nvices that emerged to manage it.\nAs World War II drew to a close, there was an\nincreasing awareness, in contradistinction to the\nperiod at the end of World War I, of the need to\nmobilize information as a key component of post-\nwar planning in order to shape the new sociopolitical\nconditions that were emerging from the chaotic con-\nditions of the war. How was the enormous range of\ninternational tensions and conflicts that characterized\nthe apparent return of peace to be managed\u2014the des-\ncent of the Iron Curtain that divided Europe into a\ncommunist East and a democratic West and repre-\nsented the beginning of the Cold War, the outbreak\nof widespread anti-colonial independence revolu-\ntions, the Korean War, the nuclear arms race, and so\non. Against this background, the \u201cinformation\u201d dis-\ncussions and the activities they entailed were ani-\nm a t e di np a r tb yab e l i e f ,w h i c ha t t a i n e daw i d e\ncurrency, that what was needed was the creation of\na new global information order.\nFor the Allies during World War II, the information\n\u201cproblem\u201d was of two kinds. The first, an \u201cinternal\u201d\nmatter, was related to the research and other informa-\ntion that they themselves generated and needed\nto manage; the second, an \u201cexternal\u201d matter, was\nthe need to capture as much Axis research and\nintelligence-related information as possible. In the\nfirst case, close cooperative research and develop-\nment arrangements were quickly developed between\nthe Allies. These involved setting up liaison offices in\nLondon and Washington, for example; arranging the\nfrequent visits of scientists, engineers, and high-level\nmilitary and civilian personnel between the two coun-\ntries, despite the dangers this inevitably involved; andthe creation of regular, detailed reporting services\nabout the information that was being generated and\ncollected. The extent of the exchanges of information\nwas remarkable. Farkas-Conn (1990: 103) quotes\nsome of the figures: through September 1945, nearly\n60,000 separate reports, letters, and samples were sent\nto the USA from the UK and Canada, while the flow in\nthe other direction was over 82,000 such documents.\nWith regard to the second \u201cexternal\u201d matter, the\nwar erected almost impenetrable barriers to the nor-\nmal pre-war flow of information between the general\npublishing and scientific and scholarly research com-\nmunities of Japan, the European Axis countries, and\nthe Allies. As a result, the Allies put in place programs\nto try to capture as much of this enemy information\nas possible (Moholy, 1946; Muddiman, 2005; Peiss,\n2007, 2020; Richards, 1981, 1989, 1994). One\naspect of this was the ever-fascinating examples of\nintelligence-gathering by individual spies and espio-\nnage networks, and the dramas of code-breaking,\nabout which so much has been written and shown\non cinema and television screens. But to this must\nbe added the need to acquire the more formal research\nand other materials that were the Axis equivalent of\nwhat the Allies were themselves producing to further\ntheir war efforts. Peiss (2020) meticulously relates the\nextraordinary story of the programs, personalities, and\nbewilderingly complicated organizational arrange-\nments that resulted from these initiatives. Important\nin this respect were the various branches of the US\nOffice of Strategic Services, such as its Interdepart-\nmental Committee for the Acquisition of Foreign\nPublications (IDC). It had posted agents, librarians,\nand others to most of the major neutral cities, such as\nLisbon, Stockholm, and Cairo. They sought out news-\npapers, periodicals, and whatever other documents\nthey could find that could provide information that\nwould be useful for the war effort.\nIn the eight-month period from November 1942 to June\n1943, the IDC microfilmed nearly 28,000 published\nitems and collected over 23,000 original publications;\nin the same period it distributed nearly three-quarters of\na million items to a variety of war agencies.\nThis material was often microfilmed \u201con the spot and\nsent to Washington for processing and distribution\u201d\n(Peiss, 2007: 378).\nAs the war was coming to its close, a sense of\nurgency arose in the need to capture enemy informa-\ntion that might still be found in Germany and else-\nwhere (e.g. see Farkas-Conn, 1990; Peiss, 2020;\nRichards, 1981, 1989, 1994). To give an immediate\nimpression of the sense of how powerful the impetus733 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\nfor this had become, it is enough to cite the relevant\ntitles of the chapters in the books by Farkas-Conn and\nPeiss on this period: \u201cThe war years, then information\nturmoil\u201d (Farkas-Conn, 1990: 99\u2013122); \u201cThe wild\nscramble for documents\u201d and \u201cAcquisitions on a\ngrand scale\u201d (Peiss, 2020: 68\u2013121). It was understood\nthat German scientists had been instructed to destroy\nthe records of their work. A Combined Intelligences\nSubcommittee was given the task of combing Ger-\nmany in search of these documents\u2014a task that was\nl a t e ra s s i g n e dt ot h eF i e l dI n f o r m a t i o nA g e n c yT e c h -\nnical. Rather than being destroyed, much of the\nmaterial had been hidden and was later found by the\nteams of Allied military personnel in \u201cdry cisterns,\nsalt mines, attics and the la boratories of industrial\nconcerns\u201d (Farkas-Conn, 1990: 103). It was esti-\nmated, for example, that \u201c200 tons of documents were\ndelivered to the Air Documents Research Centre in\nL o n d o na n ds e n ti n1 9 4 6t oW r i g h t sF i e l di nO h i o\nwhere they were translated, indexed and dis-\nseminated.\u201d To this, it was claimed, were added\nanother 50 tons, and 600,000 documents had\nbeen screened at Wrights A irfield by 1947 (Valjes,\n2004: 90).\nAnd the situation with respect to libraries and\nbooks was just as difficult. As World War II gathered\npace before Pearl Harbor, the US library community\nwitnessed the potential drying up of important\nEuropean library resources with alarm. \u201cA micropho-\ntographic expeditionary force\u201d was even proposed to\ncopy materials still available in Europe. While this did\nnot eventuate, Peiss (2020: 30) notes that the fear of\nlosing important Allied manuscripts and books to\nbombing during the course of the war led to coopera-\ntive copying with various British organizations: \u201cby\nJanuary 1941, six camera operators were rapidly\ncopying books and manuscripts in a bomb-proof loca-\ntion, and by 1944 they had shot five million frames of\nmicrofilm.\u201d\nIn 1945, following the acquisition role the Library\nof Congress had played in the wartime IDC, it estab-\nlished a Post War Mission to Europe not only to find\nmaterial related to the German Army and the Nazi\nParty, but also to buy up stocks of more current mate-\nrials that had been held by German book dealers\nagainst the anticipated post-war needs of American\nlibraries to fill the gaps that the war inevitably created\nin their collections (Downs, 1949: 157-165; Peiss,\n2020: 93\u2013121). In addition to these materials, the\nLibrary of Congress made available for distribution\nin the USA large quantities of duplicate foreign pub-\nlications received from various US military bodies,\nwhich brought in Italian, French, Swiss, Dutch,\nBelgian, German, and Austrian titles (Downs, 1949:159). Reuben Peiss, who had played a heroic role in\nthe acquisition of foreign materials during the war\n(Peiss, 2020), writing in 1947, suggested that the\nLibrary of Congress Mission had been responsible for\ncollecting and sending to the USA more than a million\nvolumes (Peiss, 1947: 116); two million items is the\nestimate reported by Kathy Peiss (2020: 118).\nAs World War II seemed to be drawing to a close,\nplans were being established for what to do with all of\nthis information after the war. In 1944, President\nRoosevelt raised with Vannevar Bush the issue\nof how\n[t]he information, the tec hniques, and the research\nexperience developed by t he Office of Scientific\nResearch and Development and by the thousands of\nscientists in the universities and in private industry,\nshould be used in the days of peace ahead for the\nimprovement of the national health, the creation of new\nenterprises bringing new jobs, and the betterment of the\nnational standard of living. (Bush, 1945: 3)\nIn his landmark report to the president, Science\u2014the\nendless frontier , Bush (1945), who was head of the\nUS Office of Scientific Research and Development,\nwhich was slated for closure at the end of the war,\nargued that the captured German research material\nwould be of use to American industry, and that the\nvast amounts of research materials created by his own\noffice and all the other branches of government,\nnational security issues having been satisfied, should\nbe rapidly declassified after the war:\nMost of the information needed by industry and in\neducation can be released without disclosing its\nembodiments in actual military material and devices.\nBasically there is no reason to believe that scientists of\nother countries will not in time rediscover everything we\nnow know which is held in secrecy. A broad dissemina-\ntion of scientific information upon which further\nadvances can readily be made furnishes a sounder foun-\ndation for our national security than a policy of restric-\ntion. (Bush, 1945: 28\u201329)\nWhile the ultimate impact of Bush\u2019s report has since\nbeen questioned (e.g. Geiger, 1997), the result of the\npolicy adumbrated by President Roosevelt was an\ninflux of large quantities of documents from the\nOffice of Strategic Services (OSS) and other agencies\nthat had been accumulating such materials, having\nrecognized that they were ready for declassification\n(Farkas-Conn, 1990: 108; Valjes, 2004: 90). Dealing\nwith all of these materials was to create serious pro-\ncessing problems for the agencies involved. Process-\ning had to be done rapidly so that the information734 IFLA Journal 50(4)\ncould be used before it became out of date. This gave\na powerful impetus to experiments with innovative\napproaches to information handling in that much of\nthis material was no longer in the conventional form\nof printed books or journals. It was what was to\nbecome known as \u201cgrey literature\u201d\u2014idiosyncrati-\ncally, sometimes imperfectly produced typescripts in\nlimited numbers of copies of memoranda and research\nreports not intended for general publication, a form of\nliterature that, since then, has become an increasingly\nimportant aspect of the information landscape (see\nEgan, 1954; GL 2022 Program and Conference\nBureau, 2022; Scho \u00a8pfel and Farace, 2009; Valjes,\n2004).\n\u201cInformation\u201d had now become an ongoing\nproblem. In the USA, for example, research and\ndevelopment agencies after the war were continu-\nously generating huge amounts of information that,\nin the context of national security and the needs of\ncivilian peacetime availability, had to be processed,\nevaluated for security reasons, and publiclydisseminated. The agencies involved often have com-\nplicated administrative histories, such as the Atomic\nEnergy Commission (founded in 1946) and the giant\nDepartment of Defense (emerging through the period\n1947\u20131949), the National Science Foundation (1950)\nand, after Sputnik in 1957, the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration(1958), among others.\nWhat was true in the USA was equally true in the\nUK, France, and the USSR. World War II had turned\non an information spigot that no one could now afford\nto turn off. The interesting situation had arisen that\ninformation, in its various manifestations, was rela-\ntively suddenly itself an important object of research,\ndevelopment, and innovation, especially in mechan-\nization if its potential value for research and develop-\nment more generally were to be realized. All sorts of\nnon-conventional systems began very quickly to be\ninvented and experimented with in the struggle to\nbring this inundation of documents under control\nand ready for distribution.

One level involved a finite, relatively short-\nterm task of disposal, of the incorporation of physical\nmasses of existing documents into national systems\nand structures such as libraries or research and docu-\nmentation centers, and the organizational and admin-\nistrative developments that flowed on nationally from\nthis. At another level was the creation of international\nsystems and structures that were necessary for the\nmanagement of scientific and other literature in the\nvistas of the years ahead. How might international\nsteps be taken to mobilize information in the interests\nof world peace and to increase the welfare and pros-\nperity of all countries throughout the world?\nIn determining how this was to be thought through\nand to assess what was needed, an important player\nwas the Royal Society of London. One of the main\nprogenitors of a completely new international organi-\nzation for the management of science after World\nWar I in the form of the International Research Coun-\ncil (later ICSU and now the International Council for\nScience) was the Royal Society of London (Green-\naway 1996). It called a huge imperial science confer-\nence, which met for not quite a month between June\nand July 1946. As the president of the Royal Society\nobserved in his opening address before the King and\nQueen:\nDuring the war, the Society has been a focal point for\ndiscussion of matters of mutual interest by scientific\nrepresentatives of the Dominions, many of whom acted\nas liaison officers in London. It became evident that\nmany problems needed closer consideration and these\nincluded the fuller use of Science for the benefit of\nmankind, the improvement of scientific communica-\ntions and other questions relating to the organization\nof science within the Empire, and finally the machinery\nof international co-operation. Arising from these meet-\nings it was resolved that it would be a wise procedure tocall together, soon after the war, representatives of a\nwide range of the sciences from the various parts of the\nEmpire, in order to facilitate an exchange of views on\nscientific matters of mutual concern. (Royal Society,\n1948b: 15)\nAmong the wide-ranging general and sometimes quite\nspecific (such as the village pond in the rural economy\nof India) subjects that the conference would take up\nwas that of the dissemination of scientific informa-\ntion. In his survey paper, Robert S Hutton, Professor\nof Metallurgy and a founding member of the UK\nAssociation of Library and Information Bureaux\n(later the Association for Information Management\nor Aslib), stressed the need for a comprehensive cov-\nerage of the increasing volume of literature in the pure\nand applied sciences. In one paragraph, he referred to\nthe \u201c[v]ast scale of scientific literature\u201d and, in the\nnext, to the \u201cgigantic scale of the literature\u201d and the\nproblem this posed for its distribution throughout\nthe Empire. He also raised the problem of classifica-\ntion, especially the use of the Universal Decimal Clas-\nsification (UDC), \u201cfor it is indispensable that the\nindexes and abstracts should be subdivided so that\nanyone wishing to secure a bibliography of some sub-\nject matter ...can do so in the most efficient manner\npossible\u201d (Royal Society, 1948b: 687). This led him\nto suggest the importance of either a general agency to\ncollect centrally all the literature that was needed\nfor subsequent processing or the creation of a\n\u201ccooperative scheme by which suitable abstracting\nbodies will work together along carefully prepared\nlines so as to cover the whole field of scientific liter-\nature, to classify and interchange it by some logical\nsystem\u201d (Royal Society, 1948b: 693).\nThe upshot of all this was that, instead of\nrecommending another very broadly based meeting\non all aspects of the scientific research being carried\nout or needed in the various countries of the British\nEmpire, the conference recommended that the Royal\nSociety convene a conference that would be wholly\nfocused on\nthe libraries, societies, and institutions responsible for\nthe publishing, abstracting and information services, in\norder to examine the possibility of the improvement in\nexisting methods of collection, indexing and distribution\nof scientific literature, and for the extension of existing\nabstract services. (Royal Society, 1948a: 13)\nThe recommendation retained an Empire focus on\ninvitations being sent to \u201cthe Dominions, India and\nthe Colonies,\u201d but it was suggested that, in addition,\nobservers might be invited from the USA (Royal\nSociety, 1948a: 14).736 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nUNESCO\nOne of the organizations falling under the umbrella of\nthe new United Nations Organization that came into\nbeing officially in 1946 was UNESCO. In its consti-\ntution, UNESCO\u2019s preamble declares: \u201cThat since\nwars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds\nof men that the defence of peace must be con-\nstructed.\u201d Among its objectives, it seeks \u201cthe full and\nequal opportunities for education for all\u201d; pursues\n\u201cobjective truth\u201d and the \u201cfree exchange of ideas and\nknowledge\u201d; and aims \u201cto increase the means of com-\nmunication between peoples.\u201d The ultimate goal is\n\u201cinternational peace and the common welfare of man-\nkind\u201d (UNESCO, 1945). At the very outset, in the part\nof its constitution concerned with purposes and func-\ntions, was enshrined its fundamental commitment to\nmaintaining, increasing, and diffusing knowledge by,\namong other things, the creation of conventions to\nprotect the world\u2019s intellectual heritage of books,\nworks of art, and monuments. It foreshadows the\ndevelopment of cooperation among nations in all\nforms of intellectual activity by the international\nexchange of personnel and of information in all of its\nmany formats.\nIn a sense, its fundamental tenets were put to an\ninitial practical test\u2014a test that had been so proble-\nmatic in 1919. Despite all sorts of international Allied\npolitical and administrative complexities at the end of\nthe war, there was to be little in the way of a punitive\napproach intellectually to the defeated nations. Unlike\nthe situation at the end of World War I, for example,\nthere was no attempt to create a new organization for\nthe international management of science and scien-\ntific communication that would exclude the enemy\nnations (Cock, 1983; Greenaway, 1996). This is per-\nhaps not surprising in that the first director of\nUNESCO, Julian Huxley, and the first director of\nUNESCO\u2019s Science Section, Joseph Needham (one\nof those responsible for science being included in the\nremit of the new organization, with early discussion\nhaving focused on education and culture), were inter-\nnationally prominent scientists.\nUNESCO, ICSU, and abstracting\nAfter World War I, it took from 1919 to 1937 for a\nformal relationship to be established between the Lea-\ngue of Nations International Institute for Intellectual\nCooperation (the forerunner of UNESCO) and ICSU\n(Nature , 1937; Renoliet, 1999). After World War II,\nhowever, such a relationship was created almost\ninstantly when a formal agreement between UNESCO\nand ICSU was drawn up in 1946. It had echoes of the\n1937 agreement between ICSU and the InternationalInstitute for Intellectual Cooperation in that UNESCO\nagreed to recognize the scientific unions as the basis\nfor the international organization of science as repre-\nsented and coordinated by ICSU, while ICSU recog-\nnized UNESCO as the \u201cprincipal agent of United\nNations Organisation in the field of international sci-\nentific relations\u201d (Greenaway, 1996: 75). All of this\nwas possible because Ar ticle X1 of the UNESCO\nconstitution provided for UNESCO to \u201cmake suitable\narrangements for consultation and cooperation with\nnon-governmental intern ational organizations ...\nand ...invite them to underta ke specific tasks\u201d\n(UNESCO, 1945, Constitution ). ICSU was an early\nbeneficiary of this provision. UNESCO offered rooms\nfor an ICSU liaison officer in its headquarters in Paris\nand a substantial annual grant-in-aid (Stratton, 1950).\nOne of the first tasks that ISCU and UNESCO took\nup was to collaborate in organizing an international\nconference in 1949 on abstracting in science. The\nexistence of abstract and indexing journals of various\nkinds has had a long history (Manzer, 1977). During\nthe interwar period, a number of these journals in the\nanglophone world\u2014such as Chemical Abstracts ,Bio-\nlogical Abstracts ,Physics Abstracts , and the range of\nAbstracts issued by the Commonwealth Agricultural\nBureaux\u2014continued to develop, though sometimes\nwith great difficulty financially and in receiving\naccess to the material they needed to cover. To some\nextent, all of them had become international in\ntheir disciplinary reach, but perhaps erratic in their\ncoverage. They were based in and issued by national\nscientific organizations. Within their ranks were\nduplication and overlap, subject lacunae, language\nbarriers, and idiosyncratic production and publishing\nsystems. Moreover, they constituted only half, as it\nwere, of pre-World War I services. Many German\nbibliographic services had ceased publication in the\npost-World War I period as a result of the punitive\napproach taken at the time to German science\n(Schroeder-Gudehus, 197 3: 99; see also Richards,\n1994: 74\u201375). Donker Duyvis (1948a), Secretary\nGeneral of FID in reporting on the difficulties that\nFID was facing in attempting to create a comprehen-\nsive directory of extant abstracting services for dis-\ncussion at the 1949 conference on abstracting,\nremarked that \u201cthe circumstances of the war have\nentirely overthrown the situation in the field of\nabstracting.\u201d1\nAgainst this post-war background of lack of\ncoordination internationally and general disarray in\nthe field of science abstracting, UNESCO\u2019s attention\nhad been drawn in 1946 to a proposal by the British\nMedical Association to create an abstracting service\nthat would substantially overlap the proposals for an737 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\nambitious international abstracting service, Excerpta\nMedica, then being planned in Amsterdam ( The\nLancet , 1947). Today, this has morphed into Embase,\na complex, commercial, bi bliographically based\ninformation service.2But, in 1946, all of the problems\nrelated to abstracts that were to be identified in the\nRoyal Society\u2019s conference of 1948 were apparent in\nthese competing projects. Both would be strongly\nduplicative of each other\u2019s coverage, and both would\ncompete with and overlap the coverage and activities\nof other established abstract journals. UNESCO was\nable \u201cafter long negotiations,\u201d commented Edward\nCarter, Head of the Library Section of Unesco in the\nreport he presented to the IFLA meeting in 1948, to\nset up an \u201cinterim co-ordinating committee for\nmedical and biological abstracting\u201d that brought\ntogether the important players in this area, including\neventually the World Health Organization (which\nwas then being organized, its formal existence being\nratified in 1948), in a forum where issues such as\nduplication, gaps, exchange of abstracts, and standardi-\nzation of methods could be discussed. The apparent\nsuccess of this venture led to the decision by UNESCO\nin collaboration with ICSU to call an international\nmeeting to discuss similar problems of abstracting\nacross the entire domain of the sciences (Carter,\n1948: 55\u201356).\nRoyal Society Scientific Information\nConference, 1948\nThe Royal Society Scientific Information Conference\nwas convened in London in June and July 1948 to\nfollow up on the recommendations of the Empire Sci-\nence Conference. This had, as mentioned above, sug-\ngested that official invitations be restricted to the\ncountries of the Empire and to the USA. In fact, invi-\ntations were extended not only to the USA but also to\nthe newly established UNESCO. Other arrangements\nwere made that, in effect, would allow anyone who\nwas interested to attend as an observer (Royal Soci-\nety, 1948a: 13\u201314). The conference was an extraordi-\nnarily comprehensive and forward-looking, although\nrather intimidating, affair. In addition to the many\npapers submitted, there was a small exhibition that\nattempted to provide illustrative materials for most\nof the subjects covered by the conference. Perhaps\nthe most interesting section for attendees was on\n\u201cMechanical indexing and sorting.\u201d This included\npunched-card machines, coding systems for these\nmachines, microfilm readers, a Recordak system that\nread UDC numbers backwards and eventually ended\nin a microfilm process, and a cinestat photomatic\ntabulator. Some of the machines were reproduced asplates in an appendix to the report on the conference\nproceedings (Royal Society, 1948a: 225\u2013232).\nThe introductory and extremely succinct \u201cEditors\u2019\npreliminary notes\u201d set up the background for the\nconference in stating, in a brief paragraph for each,\nwhat the information system problems facing the\nworld were and what was needed to solve them:\nabsolute loss of knowledg e in the sense of potentially\nrelevant papers that were ne ver retrieved; a partial\nloss of knowledge resulting from delays in publica-\ntion and abstracting, and inefficiencies in distribu-\ntion such as a paper arriving as many as three years\nlate; inconvenience because of the time required to\nsearch the literature; increasing costs; and the loss of\nthe scientific clerical and technical personnel neces-\nsary to produce the literature. What was needed to\naddress these issues was cheapness, quality, rapidity,\nease of reference, and availability (Royal Society,\n1948a: 237\u2013238).\nThe report on the various discussions and the\npapers that were submitted dealt often in great detail\nwith all the emerging issues related to information\nneeds, information uses, and institutional relation-\nships of the time. The section \u201cEvidence taken,\u201d for\nexample, for the discussion about mechanization,\ntouched on a number of inventions that were becom-\ning noteworthy. The use of different kinds of punched\ncards and coding systems for the cards, such as Calvin\nMooers\u2019 system (its name, Zatacoding, was not men-\ntioned), were described. There was a cursory refer-\nence to one of the first computers: \u201cThe UNIVAC\nmachine (Eckert and Mauchly, Philadelphia) stores\ninformation electronically and on magnetic tapes\u201d\u2014\nthere is no sense in this remark of the future of com-\nputing for the transformation of information storage\nand retrieval. Ralph Shaw described his Rapid Selec-\ntor, which attempted to operationalize an idea of\nVannevar Bush for microfilm selection by machine.\nA separate section was devoted to chemical indexing\nand the problems of chemical notation. New repro-\ngraphic techniques, especially microfilm, appeared in\nthe discussions of several of the papers and section\nreports. Among the final recommendations was that a\nfull-scale experiment in \u201cmechanical methods of\nindexing and selection\u201d might be considered in a sci-\nentific library (Royal Society, 1948a: 161). There was\nalso much commentary on how the services of\nlibraries might be improved, especially the need for\nupgrading the status of special librarians and informa-\ntion officers (Royal Society, 1948a: 158\u2013163, 202).\nThe UDC had had a long and rather difficult history\nsince its initial formula tion in 1895\u20131896 (see\nRayward, 1975: 85\u201396).3Its use both in the organiza-\ntion of bibliographical entries in abstracting and738 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nindexing journals and in catalogs was discussed at\nvarious points during the conference. It was noted that\nit was \u201cthe only [system] worked out in detail for the\nwhole of science and was now at a stage to be ready\nfor \u2018machine coding\u2019\u201d (Royal Society, 1948a: 160). It\nwas also singled out for a slightly backhanded\ncomment:\nThe Conference has concluded that, although the\napplication of the Universal Decimal Classification\n(UDC), particularly in the field of applied science, has\ndefinite limitations, there are manifest possible advan-\ntages to be gained through extension of its use, and it is\nhoped that all who can use the UDC will do so. (Royal\nSociety, 1948a: 203)\nBut it epitomized the discussions within the confer-\nence on the problems and the needs for classification\nin information organization and access that had to be\nworked out in the years to come. JD Bernal, the pio-\nneering crystallographer and Fellow of the Royal\nSociety, who played a major role in the conference,\nsuggested in this respect that \u201c[a] special scientific\nbody to carry out a long-term investigation into the\ntheory and practice of classification without pre-\ncommitment to any particular system, should be set\nup\u201d (Royal Society, 1948a: 190; see also Muddiman,\n2003). This provided the impetus for the creation of\nthe Classification Research Group in England, which\nover many years was to elaborate a theory of faceted\nclassification and compile a number of new kinds of\nsubject classifications (see Justice, 2004; McIlwaine\nand Broughton, 2000).\nAmong the recommendations that were perhaps to\nhave the most impact subsequently were those on\nabstracts. Even the \u201cEditors\u2019 preliminary notes\u201d\nstressed the importance of the conference\u2019s work in\nanalyzing the problems associated with the publica-\ntion of abstracts, and the necessity that they be con-\ntinuously cumulated along with related indexing\nservices in such a way as to facilitate retrospective\nsearching of the literature (Royal Society, 1948a:\n235). The conference recommended that the Royal\nSociety create a \u201cStanding Committee of abstracting\norganisations\u201d to examine such issues as the need for\nstandardization in citation practices and indexing\nmethods; the compilation of a comprehensive list of\nabstracting journals; and the identification of lacunae\nwhere services were needed (Royal Society, 1948a:\n139). These were among the subjects to be taken up\nthe following year at the UNESCO/ICSU conference\non abstracting. A one-page statement\u2014\u201cPresentation\nof abstracts\u201d\u2014in the report of the section on scientific\npublishing was especially important. It was to becomethe basis for a standard for the preparation of abstracts\nin much later discussions about abstracts in the con-\ntext of indexing and abstracting journals, as well as in\nterms of emerging institutional information services\n(Royal Society, 1948a: 200).\nUNESCO, so new at the time, was rarely referred\nto throughout the conference. UNESCO, however,\nhad a high-powered representation: Professor Joseph\nNeedham, head of its Science Section, prominent bio-\nchemist, and China expert; Edward Carter, head of the\nLibraries Section, architect, and librarian; AJ Moeller,\nhead of the Bibliographic Section; and JB Reid, a\nprogram specialist in scien tific information (Royal\nSociety, 1948a: 30). Carter was to acknowledge the\nimportance of the Royal Society\u2019s \u201cDocumentation\nConference\u201d (1951: 258) (as he called it) in shaping\nUNESCO\u2019s own programs. The potential bibliogra-\nphical or documentation role of UNESCO (the terms\nwere sometimes used indistinguishably), however,\nwas already the subject of at least one major exposi-\ntion. Describing documentation activities in the UK,\nAFC Pollard provided a complicated schematic plan\nof international and national developments in docu-\nmentation, which placed UNESCO and the Interna-\ntional Organization for Standardization (ISO) at the\napex of his chart, the latter organization having come\nformally into being in 1948. The chart showed them\nworking through FID, IFLA, and ISO Committee 46:\nDocumentation. He mentioned that FID\u2019s relation-\nships with UNESCO were being finalized at this time\n(Royal Society, 1948a: 370\u2013375). Pollard had been\npresident of the International Institute of Bibliography\nin Brussels and active in its reorganization into what\nbecame FID, and was also one of the founders and\npresident of the British Society for International\nBibliography, an affiliate of the Brussels body that\nhad merged with Aslib in January 1948. He died not\nlong after the conference concluded ( Journal of\nDocumentation , 1948; Muddiman, 2005: 415).\nFID and UNESCO\nOne of Huxley\u2019s early appointments of personnel to\nset up the UNESCO Secretariat, as mentioned above,\nwas Edward Carter as head of the Library Section.\nCarter became a major force in reviving, with\nUNESCO financial support, both FID and IFLA. He\nworked tirelessly in trying to bring the two organiza-\ntions, ultimately unsuccessfully, into harmony with\neach other. This was a constant theme of his reports\nto the meetings of IFLA and FID for over a decade. At\none stage in the early 1950s, it was proposed that a\npermanent liaison comm ittee between them and\nUNESCO be set up, though this idea lapsed. As an739 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\nexample of his attitude, he also suggested that when\nthe UNESCO International Advisory Committee on\nBibliography was created as an outcome of the 1950\nConference on the Improvement of Bibliographical\nServices, the Committee might be considered \u201cin\ntheory ...a sub-commission of IFLA and FID and the\nother international organizations for librarianship\u201d\n(Carter, 1954: 4).\nAt the first full meeting of FID after War World\nWar II in Paris in 1946, Carter introduced an agree-\nment between UNESCO and FID that paralleled that\nof UNESCO with ICSU:\n[UNESCO] recognises the Federation International de\nDocumentation as the principal international organisa-\ntion of nation documentation bodies and councils\nthrough which their opinion can be consulted on all\nrelevant matters of Unesco\u2019s program with regard to\ndocumentation: and that conversely FID recognises\nUnesco as the principal agency of the United Nations\nin the field of documentation. (UNESCO and Federation\nof Documentation, 1947: 46)\nFurther paragraphs dealt with, among other things,\nmutual commitment to the development and improve-\nment of documentation services throughout the world,\nmutual consultation, and reciprocal representation at\neach other\u2019s meetings. Article VIII, dealing with finan-\ncial and other material support, provided for UNESCO\nto offer financial support for international projects being\ncarried out by FID, including conferences and assistance\nin the form of \u201coffice space, secretarial services, arrange-\nments for meetings documentation etc.\u201d (UNESCO\nand International Federation for Documentation, 1947:\n47), although the offer of these specific services was\nquickly withdrawn. Among the projects it was suggested\nthat FID might undertake with UNESCO su pport\nwere: the compilation of a directory of national doc-\numentation services; a subject list of periodicals; the\ncreation of what was calle d the Repertorium Tech-\nnicum, a survey of technical fields where the litera-\nture was difficult to find and for which there were\ninadequate lists; and, finally, the development of the\nUDC, with a view to establishing its concordance\nwith the Dewey System ([F\u00b4 ed\u00b4eration International\nde Documentation], 1948: 2).\nThe overall structure and activities of FID had been\ndetermined at the point of its revival in 1946. Its sta-\ntutes were revised in 1948. They emphasized that its\nmembership and financial base were anchored in\nnational committees or associations for documenta-\ntion. An important addition to this base was that of\nthe American Documentation Institute in 1947. The\nInstitute had been set up in 1937, and the history of itsevolution into the American Society for Information\nScience has been told in detail by Farkas-Conn\n(1990). At the prompting of the Rockefeller Founda-\ntion, it had been represented unofficially at the first\npost-war meeting of FID in Paris in 1946 by Charles\nDavid, director of the University of Pennsylvania\nLibrary. In 1947, the American Documentation Insti-\ntute became the official US member of FID, its rep-\nresentation being managed through an international\nrelations committee chaired by David. He became\nstrongly supportive of the Institute\u2019s membership, in\npart influenced by what he considered the deep com-\nmitment of UNESCO to working with and through\nFID. He suggested in his \u201cReport from Europe\u201d of\n1948 that in cooperation with UNESCO, the FID pro-\ngram, developed with UNESCO support, consisted of\nsuch matters as: the compilation of an international\ndirectory for documentation and reprographic ser-\nvices; the standardization of methods and apparatuses\nof document reproduction, filing systems, and nomen-\nclature; the coordination of abstracting services; and\nthe study of classification, especially the UDC. Like\nCarter, David (1948) raised the question of the simi-\nlarities between the work of FID and IFLA, and the\npossibilities of achieving cooperation between them.\nAs one of its first projects with FID, UNESCO\ncommissioned a major survey of existing abstracting\nservices. This was intended to provide basic informa-\ntion to be drawn on in the deliberation at the confer-\nence on abstracting. Donker Duyvis, FID\u2019s general\nsecretary, described the process involved and the dif-\nficulties that FID faced in ultimately presenting what\nwas accepted as an incomplete, provisional listing\n(1948). He also submitted to the UNESCO Organiz-\ning Committee, in the name of the FID General Secre-\ntariat, a long general report discussing what literature,\nmostly pre-war, was available on the general prob-\nlems presented by abstracting journals, especially the\noverlap between journals that were related to the same\nor similar subjects and the scatter of information\nbetween journals that led to relevant information\nb e i n gh a r dt of i n do rs i m p l ym i s s e dc o m p l e t e l y\n([Duyvis], 1948b).\nUNESCO/ICSU Conference on Science\nAbstracting, 1949\nPierre Auger, head of UNESCO\u2019s Natural Sciences\nSection, pointed out that the need for such a confer-\nence had been recognized as early as the first General\nConference of UNESCO in 1946: \u201cThe idea would be\nfor every research worker to be able to read abstracts\nof all articles of interest to him, almost immediately\nthey appear, irrespective of the country or language of740 IFLA Journal 50(4)\npublication\u201d (International Conference on Abstract-\ning, 1951: 7). Much of the conference discussion and\nseveral of the final recommendations drew on data in\nthe FID survey that had been commissioned by\nUNESCO. They also followed up many of the recom-\nmendations of the Royal Society Scientific Informa-\ntion Conference. The problems of scientific\npublishing in general, and of compiling and incorpor-\nating abstracts into scientific papers and then disse-\nminating the abstracts to the abstracting services,\nwere canvassed in great detail in the conference\u2019s\nsections. Problems such as the importance of\nnational coverage, difficulties of indexing and clas-\nsification, costs, language, terminology, and coordi-\nnation between abstracting services were explored.\nThere were long discussions about the use of micro-\nfilm both in publishing and e xchanging abstracts, as\nwell as distributing the original articles for which\nabstracts were compiled.\nThe potential use of machines, of which discus-\nsions about the possibilities of microfilm were a part,\nwas clearly exciting. Developments in the UK,\nFrance, and the USA were canvassed more enthusias-\ntically and comprehensively than in the Royal Society\nScientific Information Conference. A separate note on\n\u201cNew devices for documentation and their effect on\nabstracting\u201d contained selections from a letter from\nJW Perry of the Massachusetts Institute of Technol-\nogy on mechanized documentation centers. John Von\nNeuman at Princeton replied (technically and perhaps\nunintelligibly to most) to a query from the Secretariat\nof the conference about \u201cthe large electronic com-\nputer he is building and the possibilities it offers for\nthe recording and rapid selection of information\u201d\n(International Conference on Abstracting, 1951:\n163\u2013164). The conclusion was essentially that the\nmachines being developed \u201cwere too rare a luxury\u201d;\n\u201conly a very small number of abstracting services and\ndocumentation centres can consider buying them\u201d;\ntheir potential was great but remained as yet unrea-\nlized; a code for handling masses of information was\nneeded along with the standardization of equipment;\nand UNESCO had a role to play in bringing people\ninterested in these matters together, perhaps by orga-\nnizing a small conference on the subject (International\nConference on Abstracting, 1951: 105\u2013108).\nA major practical recommendation dealt with the\nproblem of abstracting in the literature of physics. It\nwas suggested\n[that c]onsideration be g iven to the possibility of\npublishing, under the auspices of a single internationally\ncontrolled organization, a single international general\nabstracting journal for physics, both pure and applied,and for such branches of engineering as it may be pos-\nsible to include; that a committee, composed of\nrepresentatives of the interested international scientific\nunions and of the organizations responsible for the exist-\ning general abstracting services in this field, including\nthe Institution of Electrical Engineers and the American\nPhysical Society, be convened for the purpose of carry-\ning out this recommendation; that this committee give\nattention to the proposals that the abstracts presented in\nthe journal should be mixed. (International Conference\non Abstracting, 1951: 116)\nA postscript was added to the conference\u2019s final\nreport, outlining subsequent developments to June\n1953. Notable among these was the creation of a per-\nmanent International Advisory Committee on Docu-\nmentation in the Natural Sciences to advise the\ndirector general regarding the relevant programs of\nUNESCO and to keep such a committee in contact\nwith the parallel Advisory Committee on a Biblio-\ngraphy located in the Libraries Division of\nUNESCO, which was \u201cconcerned with generalised\nchannels and techniques of documentation\u201d (Interna-\ntional Conference on Abstracting, 1951: 193). These\ncommittees represented a division of interest and activ-\nity within UNESCO that was to play out over a period\nof 20 years until the formation of the UNESCO Gen-\neral Information Programme/Programme G\u00b4 en\u00b4eral\nd\u2019Information.\nICSU Abstracting Board\nICSU, prompted by the Union of Pure and Applied\nPhysics, began a process that sought to implement the\nrecommendation that a single physics abstract journal\nbe prepared. An ICSU Commission was created to\nstudy the matter. It met in 1949 in Paris at the same\ntime as UNESCO was itself following up the proposal\nin a \u201cMeeting of users of document abstracts in\nPhysics.\u201d The idea of creating a single journal proved\nimpossible to carry out. It would have required the\namalgamation of Physic Abstracts , part of the long-\nstanding British Science Abstracts that dated from the\nearly part of the 20th century, with the physics section\nof the French Bulletin Analytique , published by the\nrelatively newly active French Centre national de la\nrecherche scientifique. Moreover, the revival of the\nGerman service, Physikalische Berichte , was under-\nway and could be expected to complicate both lin-\nguistic and cooperation problems. The decision was\nto keep the two existing abstracting services separate\nbut to ensure that all leading physics journals publish\nauthor abstracts according to the Royal Society\u2019s\nguidelines, which had been slightly emended in Eng-\nlish for the English-speaking nations and in French for741 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\nthe European nations, irrespective of the original lan-\nguage of an article (International Conference on\nAbstracting, 1951: 170\u2013171, 194). In order to speed\nup the compilation, editing, and printing of the\nabstract journals themselves, the editors of the jour-\nnals to be abstracted were encouraged to send page\nproofs or at least clippings of abstracts to the offices\nof the abstracting journals or ICSU in Paris for\ndistribution.\nThe complicated negotiations that were involved in\ncoordinating the abstracting of the physics literature\nled to the realization that \u201cthe Bureau of ICSU accepts\nan International Abstracting Service as a normal per-\nmanent activity of the council\u201d (Boutry 1959: 1508).\nThis, in turn, led to the decision in 1951 that ICSU\ncreate a Board for the International Abstracting Ser-\nvice. This became the ICSU Abstracting Board, which\nwas set up initially with funding from UNESCO and\nICSU. It began to operate in 1952 with just two mem-\nbers\u2014 Science Abstracts and the physics section of the\nCentre national de la recherche scientifique\u2019s Bulletin\nAnalytique . Membership was sought the following\nyear by the revived Physikalische Berichte ,a n d\nalmost at the moment of the formal creation of the\nAbstracting Board, the International Union of Pure\nand Applied Chemistry had suggested that the coor-\ndination of the abstracting of chemical literature\nshould become part of the new organization. It took\nuntil 1954 for the Abstracting Board to intimate \u201cthat\nit felt ready to extend the scope of its activities,\u201d\n(Boutrty, 1959:1513) and Chemical Abstracts and the\nBulletin Analytique related to chemistry joined the\nboard as members, followed soon after by the Che-\nmisches Zentralblatt . The foundation and early work\nof the ICSU Abstracting Board has been described in\ngreat detail by its first secretary, GA Boutry (1959).\nAll of the journals that included articles reporting\noriginal research agreed to provide abstracts in the stan-\ndard form set out by the Royal Society and as emended\nby UNESCO in English or French. The Board received\npage proofs of the issues of various journals or, in some\ncases, clippings of authors\u2019 summaries or abstracts.\nThese were then distributed to the relevant abstract\njournals either in print form, when they had been pro-\nvided in multiple copies, or as microfilm, when only\none copy had been received. The chemical literature,\nbecause it was so much larger in quantity, complexity,\nand diversity, presented particular problems, and the\nBoard had to devise novel procedures to handle it.\nA particularly important extension of the Board\u2019s\nactivities in 1954 was its outreach to the Academy of\nSciences of the Soviet Union to negotiate an exchange\nof Russian and American journals. This began in 1955\nwith the Board microfilming the Russian material forfurther distribution. Eventually, the American Insti-\ntute of Physics, in consultation with various European\ncounterparts, undertook to prepare a full cover-to-\ncover English translation of some of the Russian\njournals. In 1984, the ICSU Abstracting Board transi-\ntioned into independence as the International Council\nfor Scientific and Technical Information.\nIFLA and UNESCO\nIFLA came to post-war life a year later than FID\u2014that\nis, in 1947 at a conference in Oslo where 52 delegates\nfrom 18 countries convened to begin the process of\nrebuilding the organization. The Rockefeller Founda-\ntion had given financial aid for the resumption of its\nwork (Sevensma, 1947: 25). The president, Marcel\nGodet, in a long farewell address on his much-\ndelayed retirement from the position, having movingly\ndescribed the losses and destruction inflicted on\nlibraries and librarians during World War II, stressed\nthe need to try to restore what had been lost by seeking\nthe widest possible forms of international coopera-\ntion\u2014especially, working with UNESCO and FID. The\nworld of today, he said, was born of the war. The past\nwould never return and it would be foolish to wait\n\u201c[w]ith folded arms\u201d for the ship to sink. It was in this\ncontext, he believed, that libraries and librarians had to\nfind their \u201cmodest\u201d role as \u201crefuges of tranquillity,\nfountains of science and homes of culture\u201d (Godet,\n1947: 16) in combatting the threats to civilization.\nThe meeting went on to elect a new president\u2014the\nNorwegian, William Munthe\u2014and a new executive\nboard, and to deal with the reports that had come in\nfrom the various subcommittees. The committee deal-\ning with popular libraries suggested that IFLA needed\nto become more deeply involved with these libraries,\nand the meeting resolved that IFLA and UNESCO\nshould encourage the establishment and strengthening\nof systems of public libraries throughout the world. Of\nparticular importance were reports from the Subcom-\nmittee on the Unification of Cataloguing Rules, espe-\ncially a report prepared by Andrew Osborn, Head of\nCataloging at Harvard University, on the work that\nhad been going on in the USA. Among other issues\nexplored were professional education, currency-\nrelated problems in the acquisition of materials, and\nthe continuing work on photocopying and micropho-\ntography by representatives of FID, UNESCO, and\nthe infant ISO. While this last did not come into being\nofficially until 1947, it essentially took up the work of\nthe pre-war organization for standards (International\nOrganization for Standardization, 1997: 15). Pierre\nBourgeois, whose career covered both librarianship\nand documentation, and who was to follow Munthe742 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nas president of IFLA, presented a long report from the\nISO Secretariat on the library-related standards that\nwere being discussed or had been developed by its\npre-war organization: paper formats, paper quality,\nthe size of catalog cards and cards used for abstracts\nby publishers, microfilm, abbreviations of the titles of\nperiodicals, and so on.\nThe presence of two persons provided a special\nfocus for the meeting. Fritz Donker Duyvis presented\na report on the activities of the recently resuscitated\nFID and stressed the need for the cooperation of IFLA\nwith both FID and the ISO. He also read the report\nfrom Aslib\u2019s Edith Ditmas on the development of\nspecial libraries and documentation centers in the\nUK. How libraries and documentation centers were\nsimilar and different and the implications of this were\nunresolved problems carried over from the pre-war\nera. IFLA, for example, had been invited by the Union\nfranc\u00b8aise des organismes de documentation to take\npart in the 1937 World Congress of Universal Docu-\nmentation, among whose sponsors were FID and the\nLeague of Nations International Institute for Intellec-\ntual Cooperation. Tietse Pieter Sevensma, then\u2014and\nstill\u2014secretary general of IFLA, had responded to the\ninvitation by observing that libraries were viewed so\ndifferently by those organizing the Congress that \u201cI\ndon\u2019t quite see how our Federation could participate\nin a Congress of which the programme shows so little\ninterest and understanding of our professional work.\u201d\nHe suggested that it would be interesting to know\nwhat was meant by documentation and where \u201cthe\nwork of libraries ended and the work of documenta-\ntion began\u201d (De Vries, 1976: 101\u2013102). This sense\nof a division between the two was to be perpetuated\nbeyond World War II and perhaps, ultimately, by\nUNESCO itself as its work in the 1960s and 1970s\nbecame divided between issues essentially related to\nlibraries and those related to the organization of doc-\numentation conceived of as scientific and technical\ninformation. Jacques Tocatlian (2000: 11) refers to\nthis issue as late as 2000.\nEdward Carter, representing UNESCO, outlined its\nprogram for libraries and for cooperating with IFLA.\nHe presented what is now a standard format for a\nformal agreement between UNESCO and IFLA along\nthe lines first worked out with ICSU and FID, in\nwhich each organization, recognizing the other\u2019s cen-\ntrality in its respective roles, agreed to cooperate. As\nin the case of FID, UNESCO promised financial sup-\nport for IFLA, and for some years it received an\nannual subvention from UNESCO (Projet de Conven-\ntion, 1947: 46\u201348).\nInvited to hold its 1948 meeting in the USA, for\nfinancial reasons this had to be held in London where,in association with UNESCO, IFLA also conducted\nan international summer school on public libraries,\nwith 50 librarians from different countries in\nattendance (Comit\u00b4 e international des biblioth` eques,\n1948: 12). At pretty much the same time as this\nUNESCO/IFLA library event was taking place, FID\nwas cooperating with UNESCO on planning the 1949\nConference on Science Abstracting. Once again,\ncooperation with FID was an important issue, which\ncame up at different times throughout the 1948 IFLA\nmeeting.\nPerhaps the outstanding document at the meeting\nwas a lengthy report by Carter on the work of the\nLibraries Division of UNESCO. An overriding theme\nwas that of stimulating the setting up and work\nof public libraries, in connection with which he\nannounced the drawing up, in conjunction with the\nIFLA Public Libraries Committee, of the \u201cIFLA\u2013\nUNESCO Public Library Manifesto,\u201d the regular revi-\nsion and publication of which has been a feature of\nIFLA\u2019s work ever since (IFLA and UNESCO, 2022).\nAnother important announcement was the planning,\nin conjunction with the Library of Congress, of a\nsurvey of bibliographical services throughout the\nworld. The 1947 UNESCO General Conference had\nauthorized funds for \u201ca survey of bibliographical ser-\nvices jointly with the Library of Congress of the\nUnited States and to seek the active cooperation of\nother national libraries in the development of the\nsurvey\u201d (Kasiske, 1967: 5). Carter stressed that IFLA\nand FID were \u201cintimately concerned as the agencies\nthrough which any project which is evolved can be\ncarried out. (1948: 57)\u201d The International Council of\nArchives (created in 1948 on the basis of an existing\ncommittee of the League of Nations) was also to be\ninvolved. A preliminary survey by Catherine Oliver\nMurra on the nature and distribution of bibliographi-\ncal services supporting fundamental education\nthroughout the world was distributed in 1947.\nUNESCO Conference on the\nImprovement of Bibliographic\nServices, 1950\nThe UNESCO Conference on the Improvement of\nBibliographic Services met in Paris from 7\u201310\nNovember 1950. The final report of the UNESCO/\nLibrary of Congress survey, Bibliographical services,\ntheir present state and possibilities of improvement ,\nprovided the basis for discussion at the conference.\nCarter, discussing the imminent publication of the\nreport at the International Conference on Science\nAbstracting, hoped it might \u201cprovide the general\nscheme into which all types of biographical services743 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\nwould fit\u201d (International Conference on Abstracting,\n1951: 25).\nThis far-reaching report by Verner Clapp of the\nLibrary of Congress canvassed the current state of\nbibliographical services throughout the world; the\nroles of various levels of national, international, and\nspecial bibliography in contributing to the existing\nstate of affairs; and how the overall situation interna-\ntionally might be improved (UNESCO/Library of\nCongress Bibliographical Survey, 1950a). An appen-\ndix by Murra (1950) on the development of the con-\ncept of national bibliography accompanied the report.\nNational bibliographical working groups in 41 coun-\ntries then considered the report and formulated\nresponses in terms of what was desirable from their\nvarious points of view for the improvement of biblio-\ngraphical services. Their suggestions were quickly\nsynthesized in the UNESCO Secretariat into a further\nreport for distribution to the conference (UNESCO/\nLibrary of Congress Bibliographical Survey, 1950b).\nThis conference in Paris in 1950 was, in fact, a\nreplacement and rebadging of the third International\nCongress on Librarianship and Bibliography that had\nbeen planned by IFLA and FID to be held in the USA\nin 1950 but had to be abandoned for financial reasons.\nThe conference was important. The membership was\nwide and its recommendati ons were influential in\nfuture planning. Jesse Shera (1950: 145), one of the\nUS representatives at the conference, was of the opin-\nion that, in the four days of the conference, \u201ca general\nunderstanding about the objectives of bibliographic\norganization was achieved and the groundwork was\nlaid for effective and permanent action.\u201d\nThe conference recommendations at the national\nlevel focused on the requirement that, among other\nthings, each nation should publish complete current\nnational bibliographies and should have a permanent\nplanning body to promote and coordinate bibliogra-\nphical and information services. This body should\nserve as a point of contact for international organiza-\ntions. Luther Evans (1954: 96\u201399), director general of\nUNESCO at the time and a former librarian at the US\nLibrary of Congress, observed that the acceptance of\nsuch national roles and responsibilities, as encouraged\nby UNESCO, was the most effective means available\nto UNESCO to contribute to the improvement of bib-\nliographic organization. How effective the initiative\nprovided by the conference and its documents were is\nattested to by the number of countries that actually\nbegan to issue complete national bibliographies soon\nafterwards. Seven (with a possible eight), all begin-\nning between 1950 and 1952, are listed in what is an\nextremely comprehensive follow-up survey on theimprovement of bibliographic organization by Clapp\nand Murra (1954: 97), the authors of the original con-\nference working documents.\nCarter reported that, as early as 1951, through the\nUnited Nations Programme of Technical Assistance\nfor developing countries, UNESCO was helping to\ncreate a number of documentation centers in these\ncountries. For him, these centers were \u201cperhaps the\nmost positive and practical effort which is being made\nto stimulate bibliographic work not only in separate\ncountries but in whole regions\u201d (Carter, 1951: 259).\nBy the mid 1960s, UNESCO was supporting national\nscientific or documentation centers in 21 countries. It\nwas even proposed that these centers might form a\nworldwide network, eventually to become the basis\nfor a \u201cworld Centre for scientific information\u201d\n(Kasiske, 1967: 13\u201315).\nAt the international level, it was agreed that a\npermanent international committee for the coordina-\ntion and promotion of bibliographic developments\nshould be created. Following the discussions of a pro-\nvisional committee, UNESCO formally set up the\nInternational Advisory Committee on Bibliography in\n1953. Carter (1954: 2) described it as \u201ca child of the\n1950 conference\u201d and \u201cat the centre of UNESCO\u2019s\ninterest in bibliography as a whole.\u201d It was, in his\nview, an expression of UNESCO\u2019s commitment to\nIFLA and FID, as mentioned above, not only by per-\nmanent formal representation from each of these\norganizations, but also because most of the members\nof the Advisory Committee were active members or\noffice-holders of the two organizations. It was to have\noversight of UNESCO\u2019s activities related to national\nbibliographic centers. Under its mandate, regional\nmeetings on national libraries and the planning of\nlibrary services were arranged over more than a 10-\nyear period. The Advisory Committee had the respon-\nsibility for arranging for the preparation of annual\nreports nationally and internationally on bibliographi-\ncal developments throughout the world. These reports\nwere published regularly and a number of cumula-\ntions were undertaken until 1984.\nFinally, in 1954, the Advisory Committee funded a\nstudy on standardization in documentation, represent-\ning a summation of decades of work by ISO relevant\nto both IFLA and FID. Published in 1954, this docu-\nment led to further discussion over a number of years\nand to proposals for letting contracts related to biblio-\ngraphic standardization. A recommendation was\nmade in 1958 that such a contract be awarded to IFLA\nto continue the work of its group studying the coordi-\nnation of cataloguing rules. This, in turn, led to the\nplanning of the International Conference on744 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nCataloguing Principle s, jointly sponsored by\nUNESCO and the US Council on Library Resources\nin 1961. All of this activity involved the idea that the\ncreation of similar, if not fully standardized, infra-\nstructures was necessary as the basis of a generalized\ninternational system for bibliographical control.\nInternational Conference on Scientific\nInformation, 1958\nIn 1958, the US National Science Foundation, the\nNational Academy of Sciences, and the American\nDocumentation Institute sponsored the International\nConference on Scientific Information. The last gen-\neral conference of this kind had been that of the Royal\nSociety 10 year earlier. The conference was one of the\nmany soul-searching responses in the USA to the\nlaunch of Sputnik in 1957 by the USSR as part of its\nspace program\u2014a defining moment in US\u2013USSR riv-\nalry in the Cold War (e.g. see Geiger, 1997; Lapidus,\n1970; Wooster, 1987).\nThe conference was preceded by the distribution of\na series of preprint papers prepared to stringent\nrequirements, which were to be used as the basis for\nthe conference\u2019s deliberations. These papers were\nintended to be as succinct as possible; the information\nin them was not to have been previously published;\nand, the conference being aimed at specialists, they\nwere to contain only information that would be rele-\nvant to the participants. The conference, similar in\norganizational thoroughness and scope to that of the\nRoyal Society, and supported by the US equivalent\nof the Royal Society, presented a remarkable collec-\ntive survey of such issues as scientists\u2019 needs for\ninformation; the effectiveness of abstracting and\nindexing services; new or ganization opportunities\nfor information storage and searching; issues related\nto the design of new systems; and the relative\nresponsibilities of governm ents, professional societ-\nies, universities, and industry for information\nresearch and service improvements.\nIn summing up the position of indexing and\nabstracting services in the 1930s, Clapp (1950:\n197) had written: \u201cThere was ...no attempt at\ncomprehensive organization of bibliographical\nservices; and among the bibliographical services\nthemselves there was no such organization, no\ninterrelation, no coordination, but, on the con-\ntrary, duplication, overlapping, gaps, uncontrolled\nmultiplication.\u201d4Now, more than 50 years later,\nthe International Conference on Scientific Infor-\nmation unexpectedly and unwittingly echoed\nthese conclusions:As it stands now, major abstracting services in the\nsubject fields use different classification systems, differ-\nent indexing systems, differe nt abbreviation lists for\njournals, different translation assistance. Certainly this\nis an area for cooperative effort, and such is already in\nprogress\u2014in the field of physics and chemistry under\nthe ICSU Abstracting Board. (National Research\nCouncil, 1959: 1552)\nWhile new technologies, especially computers, were\nthe subject of many papers and much discussion at the\nconference, it recognized the current limitations to the\nuse and effectiveness of these new computer-based\nsystems and methods, along with the imperfections\nof the current processes used in evaluating them. But\nits conclusion about the fu ture was clear: all new\ninformation-handling developments must be related \u201cto\nthe most modern techniques for programming digital\ncomputers.\u201d (International Research Council , 1959:\n1560) There was general skepticism about the possi-\nbilities of finding solutions at a global level. What\nwas needed was increased experimentation at a local\nlevel (National Research Council, 1959: 1560).\nEven so, there was a renewed sense that interna-\ntional cooperation was necessary to deal with the con-\ntinuing\u2014and fundamental\u2014problem of\norganisation, including integration of services both\nnationally and internationally and negotiation between\norganisations and countries as to what shall be done and\nin what manner to meet the needs of different kinds of\nscientists and institutions more carefully and precisely\nthan hitherto. (National Research Council, 1959: 1561)\nA comment such as this suggests how valuable the\nemergence of UNESCO\u2019s UNISIST and NATIS\nprograms might be.\nUNISIST and NATIS\nWhat seems to be a natural culmination of all of the\nlong series of conferences, recommendations, propos-\nals, reports, and other activities outlined in this article,\nand of the work of various intergovernmental and\nnon-governmental organizations struggling separately\nor collaboratively for a period of over 30 years with a\nrange of information-related issues, was two separate\nprograms centered in UNESCO. They represent the\nultimate expression of the bifurcation of UNESCO\nactivity between scientific information and bibliogra-\nphical organization in libraries, as mentioned above.\nThe setting up by UNESCO of the International Advi-\nsory Committee on Documentation in the National\nSciences in 1953 following the 1949 International\nConference on Science Abstracting points to one745 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\nprogram. The setting up, coincidentally in 1953, of\nthe International Advisory Committee on Bibliogra-\nphy following the UNESCO/Library of Congress\nInternational Conference for the Improvement of Bib-\nliographical Services in 1950, points to the other. One\nprogram, UNSIST, was developed by UNESCO\njointly with ICSU and grew out of a major intergo-\nvernmental conference in 1971. The other, NATIS,\nalso jointly organized and supported by UNESCO but\nin cooperation with IFLA and FID, grew out of an\nintergovernmental conference in 1974. Taking a step\nback from individual preoccupations with libraries,\nbibliography, and scientific information, one might\nbe forgiven for thinking that the two programs cov-\nered so many of the desiderata that had been formu-\nlated and repetitively debated for decades about the\norganization of information internationally, espe-\ncially scientific and technical information, that, taken\ntogether, they finally presented the rationale and\nframework for a coordinated, even integrated, inter-\nnational information order.\nUNISIST\nUNISIT (a non-acronym) came into formal existence\nby way of the Intergovernmental Conference for the\nEstablishment of a World Science Information Sys-\ntem in Paris in 1971. The idea had originated, it has\nbeen suggested, in an informal comment made by the\npresident of ICSU to the UNESCO director general,\nRen\u00b4e Mahue, that something needed to be done about\nthe \u201cmessy situation\u201d that had resulted from the pro-\nliferation around the world of incompatible technical\nand scientific information services (Tocatlian, 2000:\n4). In 1966, the General Assembly of ICSU created\na special committee to study the feasibility of estab-\nlishing a world science information system in colla-\nboration with UNESCO and other international\norganizations and specialists (UNESCO, 1971: 22\u2013\n23). With support from UNESCO, a substantial fea-\nsibility study was undertaken over a 10-year period\nwith input from various working groups. In submit-\nting a summary of the study to the director general of\nUNESCO and the president of ICSU, Harrison\nBrown, convenor of the UNISIST Central Committee,\ninformed them that there was unanimous agreement\nthat a world science information system, considered as a\nflexible network evolving from an extension of volun-\ntary cooperation of existing and future services, is fea-\nsible. Further, from the point of view of the needs of\nscientific and technological communities, such a flex-\nible network is both desirable and necessary. (Interna-\ntional Council for Science, 1971: ix)The conference\u2019s discussions revolved around a num-\nber of fundamental issues that were thought to form\nnecessary aspects of a UNISIST program, such as\nimproving the tools of system interconnection;\nstrengthening the functions and improving the perfor-\nmance of the individual components of the informa-\ntion transfer chain, including libraries, information\nanalysis centers, and abstracting, indexing, and trans-\nlating services; increasing the number of personnel\nessential to the planning and operation of future\ninformation networks; encouraging governments to\nprovide the optimal economic and political environ-\nments for the development of systems interconnect-\nability and cooperation; providing assistance to\ndeveloping countries to create basic information\ninfrastructures; and developing pilot projects in coop-\neration with other United Nations agencies (UNESCO\n1971 UNISIST; UNESCO 1971 Synopsis; UNESCO\n1979, UNISIST II).\nAs the conference progressed, and later during\nUNISIST\u2019s life as an established frame of reference\nfor the international management of scientific infor-\nmation, there were some differences of orientation\nand of expectations among the participants. Tocatlian,\nfor example, commented on international tensions in\nthe development of UNISIST:\nIt was during the Cold War. I think\u2014this is personal\u2014\nthe Soviets thought they could acquire some important\ninternational technical inf ormation through the UNI-\nSIST. So they were very favorable, but they were lean-\ning towards a system rather than a program. The\nUNISIST became a loose program to stimulate interna-\ntional cooperation, leading towards better access to sci-\nentific and technical information. Arutiunov [the USSR\nmember of the UNISIST Feasibility Committee] and the\nEastern Block wanted a system ...The Soviets also\nwanted technology rather than science. They insisted\non technology. Then, later, as the UNISIST was in exis-\ntence as a program, the developing countries began\nwanting technology as well. They considered science\nelitist, for the industrialized countries only. So there was\na little bit of tension. (Tocatlian, 2000: 5\u20136)\nIn fact, UNISIST was often seen not as a general\nprogram but as \u201cthe set of internationally developed\nmethods, norms, standards, principles, and techniques\ngoverning the processing and transfer of information\u201d\n(Rose, 1989: 232).\nNevertheless, unanimous agreement had been\nreached by conference representatives from a very\nbroad international scientific community that the idea\nof creating a world science information system was\npossible, if the idea of a \u201csystem\u201d were not too strictly\ninterpreted. As it developed, UNISIST became an746 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nactive and popular program, especially focused on the\nneeds of developing countries. The first UNISIST\nconference was followed by a second in 1979 where\nthis focus was explicit (UNESCO, 1979).\nReflecting on the importance of the UNISIST\nprogram within UNESCO itself and its continuing\npositive international reverberations, Adam Wysocki,\nwho had responsibility for the program in the\nUNESCO Secretariat and was later to become direc-\ntor of the UNESCO General Information Programme,\nnoted that the secretary general of the United Nations\nhimself had acknowledged the important role of\nUNISIST for the whole family of United Nations\norganizations:\nThere is within the United Nations system one informa-\ntion programme of a general nature designed to provide\na conceptual framework for the establishment of\nnational and international scientific and technological\ninformation systems and services to facilitate access\nto the world information resources and to create the\nnecessary conditions for systems interconnection and\ncompatibility. This is Unesco\u2019s UNISIST. (Wysocki,\n1978: 300)\nNATIS, IFLA, and Universal Bibliographic\nControl\nThe Intergovernmental Conference on the Planning\nof National Documentation, Library and Archive\nInfrastructures (NATIS), which was held in Paris in\nSeptember 1974, arose in part from a desire within the\nUNESCO Secretariat to find a parallel organizational\nprogram for libraries and related agencies to the\nUNISIST program (Toca tlian, 2000: 11). Concep-\ntually, the formation of the NATIS program ulti-\nmately owed a great deal to IFLA\u2019s program for\nUniversal Bibliographic Control (UBC). This had a\nlong development. It is important for the background\nto the NATIS conference.\nUBC dealt with the problem of the unification of\ncataloguing rules and, eventually, the creation of stan-\ndards for the machine transfer of bibliographic data\nshaped by those rules. At the first post-war meeting of\nIFLA in Oslo in 1947, as has been mentioned, Andrew\nOsborn reported to the Sub-Committee on the Unifi-\ncation of Cataloguing Rules on developments in the\nUSA. He suggested that there was now a sense that the\nsituation of cataloguing had become fluid in a way\nthat might allow IFLA considerable influence in the\nmovement toward the unification of international cat-\naloguing practices (Comit\u00b4 e international des bib-\nlioth`eques, 1947: 28). UNESCO gave IFLA a push\nin this direction in 1954 when it provided financial\nsupport for IFLA\u2019s Committee on CataloguingPrinciples to carry out a study on the standardization\nof cataloguing rules. This was thought, in general, to\nbe a good idea but the Committee was cautious, insist-\ning that such a study should deal with the comparison\nof principles and practices in different countries rather\nthan working toward anything that might be consid-\nered too extensive or wide-ranging. In 1954, it set up a\nlarge working party to deal with the main entries for\nanonymous works and works with corporate author-\nship, and to come up with a subsequent list of prio-\nrities for study (Conseil de la FIAB, 1955: 85\u201387). In\nfact, the Committee\u2019s work expanded quickly to take\nin other issues (Conseil de la FIAB, 1957: 37\u201339).\nTwo events mark high points in the movement\nthat led from IFLA\u2019s early work in its Committee (and\nlater Working Party) on Cataloging to its far-reaching\nprogram for UBC. The first was the Conference on\nCataloguing Principles held in Paris in 1961; the sec-\nond was the International Meeting of Cataloguing\nExperts in Copenhagen in 1969.\nThe Council on Library Resources in Washington,\nDC provided IFLA with what was for the time a large\ngrant to meet most of the costs of organizing the\nConference on Cataloguing Principles. This included\nsetting up and staffing an office, and providing travel\nand living support for about 100 participants for the\n10 days that the conference was expected to last.\nArthur Chaplin (1963: 44), executive secretary of the\nconference (its organizi ng secretary was Dorothy\nAnderson), suggested that there were three elements\nin this extensive organizational process that ensured\nthe successful outcome of the conference: first,\nenough time was given to the preparation and discus-\nsion of the working papers; second, there was enough\ntime to gather and collate comments on these papers;\nand third, enough time was also allowed for extensive\n\u201cdirect discussions with various interested parties.\u201d\nThe result of the conference was less a set of princi-\nples than a set of guidelines that would ensure\nincreased consistency in the creation of national cat-\naloguing codes. The principles covered, for example,\nthe desirable functions and structure of catalogs, the\ndifferent kinds of entries that they had to accommo-\ndate, and the choice and form of headings for those\nentries (IFLA, 1961). That they had been generally\nagreed to almost unanimously was considered to be a\nremarkable achievement. C Sumner Spalding, for\nexample, who was an official representative of the\nLibrary of Congress at the conference and was to edit\nthe 1967 Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, which\nreflected the principles, wrote: \u201cIt would be hard to\nimagine a more completely successful international\nconference than the one held in Paris in 1961.\u201d It\nwas extraordinary that \u201cvoting representatives747 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\nfrom twelve international organizations and from\nfifty-three countries, with varying cataloging\ntraditions\u201d could arrive at near unanimity on \u201ca final\nagreement not only on cata loguing principles but\non basic rules for cataloguing\u201d (quoted in Miksa,\n2021: 125).\nThe principles were used in the years that followed\nin the creation of new cataloguing codes and the revi-\nsion of existing codes, but their use revealed a range\nof limitations and inadequacies that needed attention.\nMoreover, two developments in the USA had impor-\ntant international compl icating implications for\nachieving improvements in and extensions of the\nprinciples, and the possibilities of international bib-\nliographic control. In 1965, the Library of Congress\nintroduced its National Program for Acquisitions and\nCataloging, also referred to as the Shared Cataloguing\nProgram. The Library was authorized and funded to\nacquire from around the world materials of value, and\nto compile and distribute to participating libraries bib-\nliographic data for these materials, with the data being\nbased where possible on what appeared in the relevant\nnational bibliographies. Within a year, 68 libraries\nwere participating and receiving the Library of\nCongress cataloguing data through this program\n(Ishimoto, 1973: 127). IFLA became very interested\nin how this program might be extended internationally.\nThe second development, which was ultimately to\ntransform all aspects of library organization, manage-\nment, and services, was the development, only then in\nits infancy, of electronic data processing in libraries.\nThis can be said to have really got underway in 1963\nwhen a feasibility study at the Library of Congress\nrecommended that \u201ca group be established to design\nand implement the procedures to automate the catalo-\nging, searching, indexing, and document retrieval\nfunctions\u201d of the Library (Avram, 1975:6). Following\na relatively brief period of experimentation, in March\n1969, the machine-readable cataloging (MARC) sys-\ntem of the Library of Congress was launched, cover-\ning all English-language monographs cataloged by\nthe Library, including titles acquired through the\nNational Program for Acquisition and Cataloguing\u201d\n(Avram, 1975: 9). Libraries both in the USA and\nabroad began increasingly to subscribe to MARC\ntapes to support their own library cataloguing and to\nthemselves become involved in the ongoing evolution\nof the MARC formats as fundamental \u201cstandards for\nthe representation and communication of biblio-\ngraphic and related information in machine-readable\nform\u201d (MARC 21 Formats, 2023).\nOnce again, the Council on Library Resources in\nWashington, DC, recognizing the importance of these\nand other developments, was willing to providea grant to support the work of a preparatory\ncommittee of library experts\u2014and the subsequent\nformal meeting of an enlarged body of experts\u2014\u201cto\nreview progress in cataloguing since the Paris Con-\nference of 1961\u201d (IFLA, 1969: 106). This was very\nmuch a working meeting, with participation limited to\ncataloguing experts from various countries drawing\non a number of working papers that had been distrib-\nuted for comment. It was here that a commitment was\nmade to the idea of creating internationally accepted\ncodes to standardize the bibliographic description of\nvarious formats of publications\u2014International Stan-\ndard Bibliographical Descriptions. These Descrip-\ntions were to provide \u201ca framework designed to\nestablish international consistency in the content,\norder, and punctuation of descriptive metadata.\u201d As\nwas the case for the Paris principles, they \u201cwere cre-\nated to guide subsequent national [catalog] code revi-\nsion, bringing international descriptive cataloging\npractices further in line and facilitating international\nrecord sharing\u201d (Dobreski, 2021: 229; see also IFLA,\n1969: 111\u2013112). Among the final resolutions of the\nmeeting was a statement of general policy that was to\nguide further development:\nEfforts should be directed towards creating a system for\nthe international exchange of information by which the\nstandard bibliographical description of each publication\nwould be established and distributed by a national\nagency in the country of origin of the publication. The\nmeans for distribution in such a system would be\nthrough the medium of cards or machine readable\nrecords. The effectiveness of the system will be depen-\ndent upon the maximum standardisation of the form and\ncontent of the bibliographical description. (IFLA, 1969:\n115\u2013116)\nIt was also decided that a permanent body\u2014an\ninternational secretariat\u2014was now required to be a\nfocus of support and coordination for the develop-\nments that were foreshadowed at the meeting.\nThe 1961 and 1969 meetings and the agreements\nthat came from them created a kind of librarians\u2019\nphilosopher\u2019s stone\u2014a set of principles and some of\nthe detail needed to flesh them out for establishing the\ninternational standardization of the major elements\nneeded to create and exchange bibliographical records\nin an increasingly computer-based network environ-\nment. They also affirmed the idea that national\nlibraries, especially those where the national biblio-\ngraphical service was located, were the logical agen-\ncies to drive forward the work of standardization at\na national level.\nAs the IFLA program elaborated at the Interna-\ntional Meeting of Cataloguing Experts began to748 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nachieve identity and scale, it lacked only a name,\naccording to Dorothy Anderson, the figure who was\nthe most active in creating, rationalizing, and manag-\ning it. In 1971, Herman Liebaers, the then president of\nIFLA, named it rather grandiosely \u201cUniversal Biblio-\ngraphical Control\u201d (Anderson, 2000: 209). With a\ngrant from the US Council on Library Resources and\nthe provision of accommodation by the British\nLibrary, an IFLA Cataloguing Secretariat was set up\nunder the leadership of Anderson. Its name was\nchanged to the UBC Office following the UNESCO\nNATIS conference in 1974. It began to publish the\nInternational Standard Bibliographical Descriptions\nin 1971 as among its first tasks and to tackle other\nissues involved in the search for international biblio-\ngraphic standardization, including the international\nadoption and modification of the MARC formats ini-\ntially developed at the Library of Congress. Its\nextraordinary range of achievements under the dyna-\nmism and experience of Anderson has been widely\nacknowledged (e.g. Anderson and Myall, 1998;\nDowning, 1983).\nNATIS\nThe 1974 NATIS conference was explicitly organized\nin cooperation with IFLA, FID, and the International\nCouncil of Archives, but it had the IFLA program for\nUBC at its base. It was seen as the culmination within\nUNESCO of a number of regional meetings held\nbetween 1966 and 1974 (NATIS, 1974:2) 1974: 1\u2013\n2). Among the conference\u2019s conclusions was the\nobservation that\nachieving NATIS involves formulation of a national\ninformation policy based on the analysis of users\u2019 needs,\ndetermination of priorities among those needs, and the\nconsequent allocation of available resources, supported\nby appropriate legislation, financing, qualified man-\npower and modern information technology (NATIS\n1974:2).\nMany of the conference\u2019s recommendations and\nobservations reflected the IFLA UBC program, and\nit was noted:\nThere was wholehearted support of Universal Biblio-\ngraphic Control, a programme put forward by the Inter-\nnational Federation of Library Associations, which aims\nto achieve the universal availability, in an internation-\nally accepted interchange form, of basic bibliographic\ndata on all publications, and it was considered that\nUnesco should study ways by which it can assist in ful-\nfilling the UBC programme. (NATIS, 1974: 2)Anderson, who had written the IFLA document on\nUBC for the conference, which was later published\nunder her name, observed that the UBC program was\naccepted because it \u201c[s]eemed relevant to all libraries\nno matter their stage of development and easily coor-\ndinated with national programs.\u201d She saw the out-\ncome of the conference as indicating that the concept\nof UBC \u201cwill be promoted by UNESCO, in cooper-\nation with IFLA as a major policy objective to create\na worldwide system for the control and exchange of\ninformation\u201d (Anderson, 1994: 369).\nInsofar as the international objectives of the pro-\ngram could only be met by effective national policies\nand programs, the NATIS meeting recommended a\nfollow-up conference on the improvement of national\nbibliographic control be held in 1977. Here, it was\nhoped that agreement might be reached on a whole\nrange of technical issues related to the creation and\nsharing of bibliographic records, and to the standardi-\nzation of the activities of national bibliographic agen-\ncies in relation to the compilation and publication of\nnational bibliographies (International Congress on\nNational Bibliographies, 1978). The working paper\nfor this meeting was prepared by Anderson and the\nstaff at the UBC Office in London. It reaffirmed the\nimportance of the UBC program within the NATIS\nframework as the basis for a worldwide system for the\ncontrol and exchange of information.\nUNISIST, NATIS, the General\nInformation Programme, and\nInformation for All\nThus, on the face of it, the programs emerging from\nthe two UNESCO-supported intergovernmental con-\nferences in 1971 and 1974 might be considered to\nhave created the possibility of a complementarity that\nwould underpin the framework of a new world infor-\nmation order. As mentioned above, in 1971, it was\nunderstood with regard to UNISIST that \u201ca world\nscience information system ...is feasible. Further,\nfrom the point of view of the needs of scientific and\ntechnological communities, such a flexible network is\nboth desirable and necessary\u201d (International Council\nfor Science, 1971: ix). The two men responsible for it\nin the UNESCO Secretariat, Wysocki and Tocatlian\n(1971), echoed this in the title of their article \u201cA world\ninformation system: Necessary and feasible,\u201d while,\nthrough NATIS, it was understood that a \u201cworldwide\nsystem for the control and exchange of bibliographic\ninformation was possible\u201d (Anderson, 1974: 369).\nFor Tocatlian, assessing the relative strengths of\nthe UNSIST and NATIS programs from within the\nUNESCO Secretariat, there were administrative749 Rayward: The attempt to create a post-World War II international information order\ntensions that lay behind the NATIS conference and its\noutcomes. He noted that, originally, relatively small\nprovision had been made within the Secretariat for\nUNISIST, but it had very quickly gained much posi-\ntive attention both internationally and within the\nUNESCO General Conference, the main governing\nbody of UNESCO. By contrast, UNESCO\u2019s large\nDepartment of Documentation, Libraries and\nArchives did not have a general comprehensive pro-\ngram with the reach, international strength of interest,\nand commitment within UNESCO itself that\nUNISIST had quickly achieved. This was so even\nthough the department had been in existence for a\ngreat many years at the time of the NATIS meeting\nand was closely supported by, and collaborated with,\nthe three then relatively strong non-governmental\norganizations\u2014IFLA, FID, and the International\nCouncil of Archives (ICA). He believed that there\nwas an element of organizational rivalry lying behind\nthe development of the NATIS program and that,\ndespite what was positive about it, it had an important\ndrawback in that \u201cit exacerbated the fight between\nlibrarians and information scientists. It was a nega-\ntive, and as such, a waste of time and energy\u201d (Toca-\ntlian, 2000: 11).\nNevertheless, for both the UNISIST and NATIS\nprograms there was an early period of considerable\nactivity, especially in terms of regional meetings,\nworkshops, contracts for experts to compile manuals\nto codify standards and provide curricula for educa-\ntional workshops, and so on. Each program developed\na strong focus on the needs of developing countries\nand involving them in its work. Both were responsible\nover the years of their existence for an extensive bib-\nliography of an operational and discursive literature\naimed at their different audiences.\nIn 1977, the UNESCO General Conference, how-\never, took a major decision that altered the nature of\nits commitment to its information programs. It recom-\nmended that they be rationalized into a single\nprogram\u2014the General Information Programme/Pro-\ngramme G\u00b4 en\u00b4eral d\u2019Information. Wysocki, appointed\nas director, outlined in detail at the 1977 International\nCongress on National Bibliographies the deliberations\nand recommendations that had led to its creation. He\nindicated that, within the UNESCO Secretariat, the\norganizational arrangements for the new program\nwould include most of the activities of the former\nDivision of Scientific and Technological Documenta-\ntion and Information, where UNISIST was situated,\nand the Division of Documentation, Libraries and\nArchives, which was responsible for the NATIS\nprogram (International Congress on National Biblio-\ngraphies, 1978: Annex D). The two advisorycommittees for these programs were to be replaced\nby a single Intergovernmental Council for the Gen-\neral Information Progra mme. It was understood that\nthe creation of the General Information Programme\ninvolved the complex and difficult task of the con-\nsolidation of the existing programs. It was also\nrecognized, however, that UNESCO\u2019s programmatic\nemphasis needed to focus more directly on the infor-\nmation needs of developing countries, and to respond\nmore effectively to the emergence and increasing\nsophistication of the digital or online world. Even so,\nthe UNESCO General Conference, at the moment of\ncreating the General Information Programme, did call\nfor continuity in the work of both UNISIST and NATIS\n(Wysocki, 1978: 302).\nEventually, although their activities and publica-\ntions continued for a period as the new unified program\nwas being formulated, debated, voted on, and imple-\nmented, both the UNISIST and NATIS programs even-\ntually lost their identity within UNESCO. In 2001, the\nGeneral Information Programme morphed into the\nInformation for All Programme. A search on its web-\nsite under both UNISIST and NATIS reveals no\nresults. But even so, this ongoing program, squarely\nsituated in the digital world and with a strong orienta-\ntion to developing countries, describes itself as \u201ca\nunique UNESCO intergovernmental programme that\nsupports Member States in fostering equitable societies\nthrough promoting universal access to information and\nknowledge for sustainable development\u201d (UNESCO,\n2023). So perhaps some aspects of the philosophy and\nprograms of UNISIST and NATIS may be thought to\ncontinue to influence UNESCO\u2019s information pro-\ngrams as they have evolved over subsequent decades.\nCaveats and conclusion\nIn this article, I have been dealing with what might be\nconsidered a very limited range of organizations and\ndevelopments. Not considered are the post-World\nWar II lives of individual \u201ctraditional\u201d indexing and\nabstracting services that were provided by various\ndisciplinary organizations, some with long histories\nthat go back to the 19th century, such as, for example,\nChemical Abstracts ,Physics Abstracts ,Biological\nAbstracts , and even Nuclear Science Abstracts\n(Clapp, 1950; Cooper, 1982; Manzer, 1977). All have\nundergone major\u2014sometimes pioneering\u2014technical\ndevelopments as they have transitioned from what\nwere once \u201csimple\u201d print-based journals to complex\nonline bibliographic and data-based services. Nor do I\ntrace the emergence of what one might call global\n\u201caccumulator sites\u201d and the complex services their\nsearch engines now offer to subscribers, such as the750 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nWorld of Science and Clarivate, or BASE, the Biele-\nfeld Academic Search Engine, which its home page\nclaims has access to 346,529,602 documents,5or the\nlibrary-based OCLC Inc. (2023), which, as\nof September 2023, indicated that it contained\n548,338,915 bibliographic records recording\n3,357,676,790 library hol dings from around the\nworld. Nor do I touch on the information activities\nof other intergovernmental organizations apart from\nUNESCO, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-\nzation, the International Atomic Energy Agency,\nEuratom, the European Union, and the large family\nof United Nations-related organizations. All were\u2014\nand are\u2014concerned, sometimes incidentally, some-\ntimes centrally, with creating information systems\nand services that now form a crowded, multifarious,\nconfusing patterning of international information\ninterests and activities.\nIn the final analysis, one has to acknowledge that\nthe long march of bibliographic events from the end\nof World War II to what seemed like the opening of a\nnew information world order based on UNESCO\u2019s\nUNISIST and NATIS programs inevitably kept stea-\ndily moving on beyond them. Since the late 1960s and\nthe 1970s, there seems to have been a constantly\naccelerating impetus for change in information sys-\ntems and services from the trajectory I have traced\nfrom the end of World War II. A revolution has gath-\nered force around them (Lancaster and Neway, 1982).\nThere has been an epistemic break from the past. It is\nreflected in the dynamism of international political\narrangements, in rapidly transformative digital com-\nmunications technologies, and in the massive com-\nmercial formations that are associated with their\nownership and exploitation. Information has become\na commercial resource that is subject to the vast and\nconstantly moving interplay of geopolitical and cor-\nporate economic interests as never before. It is now\ncaught up in a kind of never-ending international\ninstitutional shape-shifting. All the major information\nservices have been restructured, and sometimes rein-\nvented, to become complex electronic portals into\ndigital worlds in which new kinds of organizational\nrelationships of members, clients, and competitors\ninteract in a global, borderless marketplace.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nFunding\nThe author received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iD\nWB o y dR a y w a r d https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2313-\n7937\nNotes\n1.

It took an interest in promoting\ninternational bibliographic projects and library c ooperation. This article focuses on the International\nCommittee on Intellectual Cooperation\u2019s Subcommittee for Science and Bibliography, established in 1923,\nand situates it in the context of the League\u2019s evolv ing and complex administrative and communication\ninfrastructure for intellectual cooperation, to which the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation\nwas added in 1926. A general overview is given of the Subcommittee\u2019s membership, its relationship with the\nInternational Institute of Bibliography of Paul Otlet and Henri Lafontaine, and its activities as reflected in its\nagendas, minutes and reports. Its membership comprised eminent scientists and scholars, with directors of\nsome major libraries serving as associate members, some of whom later played leading roles in IFLA.\nKeywords\nLibrary history 1922\u20131930, international bibliographic control, League of Nations, International Committee on\nIntellectual Cooperation, International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, Subcommittee for Science and\nBibliography\nIntroduction\nThe role of UNESCO in the development of IFLA has\nbeen generally acknowledged (Gabel, 2008; IFLA,\n2022). When IFLA was revived after the Second\nWorld War, UNESCO, recognising the Federation\u2019s\npotential for supporting its mission of striving for\npeace through international understanding, provided\nboth guidance and financial support. This enabled\nIFLA to become a more professionally run organisa-\ntion and to play a more significant international role,\ncollaborating with various international bodies (Lor,\n2012). The relationship evolved over time, but IFLA\ncontinues to collaborate in various UNESCO projects,\nsuch as Memory of the World and the World Book\nCapital Network. The two organisations jointly spon-\nsor important statements and guidelines, such as the\nIFLA\u2013UNESCO Public Library Manifesto (IFLA,\n2021). At IFLA\u2019s annual World Library andInformation Congress, one of the open sessions is\nusually devoted to the UNESCO programmes that are\nrelevant to libraries and information.\nIt is not so well known that IFLA had a significant\nrelationship with UNESCO\u2019s predecessor, the Inter-\nnational Committee on Intellectual Cooperation\n(ICIC; in French, Commission internationale de\ncoop\u00b4 eration intellectuelle ), and that committee\u2019s\nexecutive agency, the International Institute of\nIntellectual Cooperation (in French, Institut interna-\ntional de coop\u00b4 eration intellectuelle). As IFLA\u2019s cen-\ntenary (1927\u20132027) approaches and its history is\nre-examined, this relationship also deserves scholarly\nCorresponding author:\nPeter Johan Lor, Department of Information Science, University\nof Pretoria, Pretoria, Gauteng 0028, South Africa.\nEmail: PeterJLor@gmail.comInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions\n\u00aaThe Author(s) 2024\nArticle reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nDOI: 10.1177/03400352241236718\njournals.sagepub.com/home/iflIFL A\n2024, Vol. 50(4) 755\u2013768\nattention. The ICIC was a novel intergovernmental\norganisation with a complex structure, which evolved\nconsiderably during its relatively short lifetime. It is\nnot easy to determine in which ICIC units or entities\nactivities relating to libraries and bibliography were\ntaking place. As a preliminary to a study of the rela-\ntionship between IFLA and the ICIC, this article\nfocuses on the composition, scope and activities of\nthe first unit within the ICIC that played a significant\nrole in respect of libraries and bibliography \u2013 namely,\nthe ICIC\u2019s Subcommittee for Science and Bibliogra-\nphy (in French, Sous-commission des sciences et de\nbibliographie).\nTo avoid confusion, the abbreviation ICIC is used\nto refer to the International Committee on Intellectual\nCooperation, whilst the International Institute of\nIntellectual Cooperation is referred to as \u2018the Insti-\ntute\u2019 or \u2018Paris Institute\u2019 and the Subcommittee for\nScience and Bibliography as \u2018the Subcommittee\u2019. The\nmain sources for this article were documents in the\nonline League of Nations Secretariat archives (United\nNations Archives Geneva), with some from the online\narchives of the Institute, now held at the UNESCO\nheadquarters in Paris.\nLeague of Nations\nThe League of Nations (in French, Soci\u00b4 et\u00b4ed e s\nNations) was founded in 1920 as an outcome of the\nParis Peace Conference. Its Covenant was signed on\n28 June 1919 and entered into force on 10 January\n1920. Its main purpose was to maintain world peace.\nBecause it failed in this \u2013 as a result of various geo-\npolitical factors \u2013 it was for a time a somewhat\nneglected historical topic (Pedersen, 2007). However,\nit is today the subject of a growing literature (e.g.\nDykmann, 2015; Gram-Skjoldager and Ikonomou,\n2019; Grandjean, 2016). According to some scholars,\nthis predecessor of the United Nations was in fact an\ninnovative institution, which broke new ground by\ncreating a large-scale inter national administration,\nand showed increasing maturity and professionalisa-\ntion (Kahlert, 2019).\nThe main components of the League of Nations\nwere the Assembly, consisting of representatives of\nall the member nations; the Council, an executive\nbody with permanent and non-permanent members;\nand the Permanent Secretariat, the administrative unit\nwith permanent staff headed by the Secretary General\nbased in Geneva. Its various support services included\nthe League\u2019s Library. Within the Secretariat, there\nwere 11 Sections, each dealing with a portfolio of\nmatters of concern to the League. One of these was\nthe Intellectual Cooperation Section (also knownas the International Bureaux and Intellectual\nCooperation Section), the main objective of which\nwas to promote international understanding and peace\nby encouraging international intellectual cooperation.\nThis Section served as the administrative secretariat\nof the ICIC and as the channel of communication with\nthe Institute (United Nations Archives Geneva,\n2022b). They are described below.\nInternational Committee on Intellectual\nCooperation (ICIC)\nIn 1922, the ICIC was added as an advisory organ of\nthe League of Nations in respect of science, arts and\neducation. The ICIC and the Institute (discussed\nbelow) were described as together forming part of\nan Intellectual Cooperation Organisation, which was\nunder consideration by the Assembly of the League of\nNations in 1920. Until the late 1930s, however, there\nis little evidence of this organisation\u2019s existence as a\nsignificant entity. The ICIC was at first thought of as\n\u2018a temporary and consultative organ\u2019 (\u2018un organe tem-\nporaire et consultatif\u2019) with very limited resources,\nbut it was made permanent a few years later (Com-\nmission internationale de coop\u00b4 eration intellectuelle,\n1929).1\nInitially, the ICIC was a committee of 12 members.\nIt included intellectual giants such as Henri Bergson,\nMarie Curie, Albert Einstein and Paul Val\u00b4 erie\n(Brzezin \u00b4ski, 2017). In 1934, the ICIC reformulated\nfor itself the following definition of \u2018intellectual\ncooperation\u2019:\nThe object of intellectual co-operation is international\ncollaboration with a view to promoting the progress of\ngeneral civilisation and human knowledge, and notably\nthe development and diffusion of science, letters and\narts. Its purpose is to create an atmosphere favourable\nto the pacific solution of international problems. Its\nscope is that of the League of Nations. (League of\nNations, 1934: 38)\nThe \u2018field of action of intellectual co-operation\u2019\nincluded promoting and facilitating the exchange of\nideas, personal contacts among intellectual workers,\ncooperation between relevant institutions, and \u2018the\nspread of a knowledge of the literary, artistic and\nscientific efforts of different nations\u2019 (League of\nNations, 1934: 38) Thus, much like UNESCO after\nthe Second World War, it also concerned itself with\ninternational collaboration in respect of bibliography\nand libraries. Like its parent body, the ICIC has seen a\nresurgence of scholarly interest (e.g. Brzezin \u00b4ski,\n2017; Grandjean, 2016; Laqua, 2011; Pemberton,\n2012; Saikawa, 2009). A comprehensive overview756 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nof the historiography of the ICIC is provided in the\nPhD thesis by Grandjean (2018: 16\u201327). However,\nthere do not appear to be any works dealing in depth\nwith its involvement in libraries and bibliography.\nInternational Institute of Intellectual\nCooperation (the Institute)\nOver time, the structure of the League of Nations chan-\nged and grew increasingly complex. Initially, the ICIC\nhad limited funding and lacked a permanent, adequately\nstaffed office to support its work. In response, the\nFrench government came forward with a solution, offer-\ning to fund and host a permanent support structure,\nnamed the International Institute of Intellectual Cooper-\nation. The proposal was accepted in 1924, against some\ninitial opposition from the United Kingdom and its\ndominions, which had been unenthusiastic about the\nLeague\u2019s involvement in intellectual cooperation in the\nfirst place (Schroeder-Gudehus, 2018). Scholars have\nargued that the French were intent on raising the profile\nof France in the international intellectual sphere (Brze-\nzin\u00b4ski, 2017). The Institute was to serve as an executive\norgan for the ICIC. Its functions were set out in Article 2\nof its \u2018Rules of Procedure\u2019:\nThe principal object of the Institute shall be to prepare\nthe work to be discussed by the Committee on Intellec-\ntual Co-operation, to ensure in all countries the carrying\nout of the decisions and recommendations of that Com-\nmittee and, under the Direction of that Committee and of\nits Executive Committee, to promote, through interna-\ntional co-operation, the organisation of intellectual work\nthroughout the world, and generally, to develop interna-\ntional co-operation in literature, art and science. (League\nof Nations, 1934: 44\u201345)\nThe Institute was inaugurated in January 1926 and\nwas installed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris.\nIt was funded by France, not by the League of\nNations. This gave it a degree of autonomy, enabling\nit to maintain relations with member states indepen-\ndently of the Secretariat. It was also an instrument of\nFrench soft diplomacy, a counterweight to anglo-\nphone influence (Brzezin \u00b4ski, 2017; Grandjean,\n2014, 2022). In terms of a decision taken in 1925 by\nthe ICIC, all the successive chairmen of the Paris\nInstitute\u2019s Governing Body, were French. The source\nI cited attributes the decision to the ICIC alone and\ndoes not mention reference to, or ratification by, the\nCouncil of the League of Nations (1934: 46).\nIn association with the Intellectual Cooperation\nand International Bureaux Section of the ICIC Secre-\ntariat, the Institute was responsible for preparing the\nmeetings of the ICIC and those of its subcommitteesand expert committees, and for carrying out their\ndecisions. The advent of the Institute added a further\nlayer of complexity to the archival record. Developing\nrapidly, it affected the distribution of responsibilities\nand the \u2018workflow\u2019 (\u2018rythme de travail\u2019) of the ICIC.\nIt also led to a greater degree of dispersion of the\ndocuments that reflect its day-to-day activities, and\na greater degree of bureaucratisation (Grandjean,\n2018: 118). This is reflected in the organisation\u2019s\nactivities relating to bibliography and libraries.\nUsing the methodology of social network analysis,\nGrandjean (2022) has examined the relationship\nbetween Geneva and Paris as \u2018the two hubs of interna-\ntionalism\u2019 during the interwar period, and has traced the\nshifting balance of power between the ICIC in Geneva\nand the Institute in Paris. From its inception in 1926\nuntil 1930, the Institute grew into an ambitious bureau-\ncracy. Among other things, it took over liaison with the\nICIC\u2019s national committees for intellectual cooperation.\nHowever, growing disquiet about its effectiveness came\nto a head in 1930, when a drastic reorganisation was\nundertaken. This \u2018reform\u2019 tried to put together the ICIC\nand the Paris Institute under a common direction as\ncomponents of a homogeneous whole called the\nIntellectual Cooperation Organisation. But the pen-\ndulum swung back. In the second half of the 1930s, a\nmovement arose to dissoci ate the Intellectual Coop-\neration Organisation from an increasingly ineffec-\ntive League of Nations. According to Grandjean\n(2022: 88-90), some scholars see this move as an\nattempt to ensure the Organisation\u2019s own survival.\nIn December 1938, a new international act (Acte\ninternationale co ncernant la coop\u00b4 eration intellec-\ntuelle) was adopted, which gave the Intellectual\nCooperation Organisation roughly the same status\nas the League itself, effectively sidelining the\nGeneva-based ICIC.\nHowever, before enough state parties could ratify\nthe Act, the Second World War broke out, and the\nOrganisation closed in June 1940. It was briefly resus-\ncitated in 1945 and its assets, including its archives,\nwere transferred to UNESCO in 1946. These organi-\nsational changes affected the fortunes of the League\nof Nations entities involved with libraries, and this is\nreflected in the archival fonds.\nOrganisational structure and internal\ncommunication\nBefore proceeding, it is necessary to clarify the\nterminology and organisational structure relevant to the\nentities concerned with library matters. It is hardly\nencouraging that Hans Aufricht (1951: 92), in his\nauthoritative Guide to League of Nations Publications ,757 Lor: Librarianship and bibliography in the international arena\nstates that \u2018the rather complex committee structure of\nthe League almost defies classification\u2019.\nIn the first year of its existence, the ICIC, being itself\na committee that only met once a year, established four\nsubcommittees to study the various fields of its activities\nand make recommendations for its consideration. Each\nof the subcommittees was composed of three members\nof the ICIC itself (the \u2018plenary committee\u2019) together\nwith additional expert members, referred to as assistant\nthen, later, \u2018associate members\u2019 ( membres adjoints ).\nOne of the subcommittees was the Subcommittee for\nScience and Bibliography. In 1925, following the estab-\nlishment of the Paris Institute, working procedures\nchanged, and expert committees were appointed to\ninvestigate specialised or technical issues. Initially, they\nreported to the ICIC through the appropriate subcom-\nmittees. Most expert committees were short-lived, being\ndisbanded after reporting on their work, but a few\nbecame permanent. All of the committees, including the\nexpert committees, were appointed by the ICIC and\nultimately had to report to it (Pham, 1964: 78\u201383).\nCommunication from the expert committees to the\nICIC via its subcommittees was found to be time-\nconsuming and, in 1930, as part of the drastic reor-\nganisation referred to e arlier, the subcommittees\nwere disbanded and their members were reallo-\ncated to relevant expert committees.\nIn 1930, the League of Nations Secretariat in Geneva\nhad 11 administrative Sections, each dealing with a\nportfolio. One of these was the International Bureaux\nSection, also known later as the Section of International\nBureaux and Intellectual Cooperation. Intellectual coop-\neration eventually became its main concern. It served as\nthe link between the League of Nations and the ICIC\nand three international institutes \u2013 the International\nInstitute for the Unification of Public Law, the Interna-\ntional Educational Cinematographic Institute (both in\nRome) and the Paris Institute, which, as we have seen,\nserved as the executive organ of the ICIC. As shown in\nGrandjean\u2019s (2017) diagram, in 1930, the Institute had\nseven Sections of its own. One of these was responsible\nfor \u2018Scientific Relations\u2019. Later documents additionally\nmention a Section of Exact and Natural Sciences and a\nSection of Historical and Social Sciences. All three of\nthese were involved in the work of the Subcommittee,\nbeing responsible for administrative support (managing\nmembership, meetings, agendas, minutes, reports, etc.)\nand professional support (co nducting research, which\nmainly involved gathering information through ques-\ntionnaire surveys sent to member states or national\ncommittees) as requested by the subcommittees and\nexpert committees. In practice, this meant that the\nInstitute could exercise considerable influence. After\n1925, communication between the expert committees,subcommittees and plenary meetings of the ICIC\nflowed through the Paris Institute. A schematic repre-\nsentation of the flow of information through the levels\nof the ICIC system is given in Figure 1.\nLeague of Nations archives\nThe files that were consulted comprised a great\nvariety of communications flowing between and\nwithin the Sections and committees, including hand-\nwritten, typed, mimeographed and printed notes,\nmemos, letters, telegrams, circulars and programmes.\nThere were numerous confidential notes about the\nselection and appointment of committee members,\nwhich involved careful manoeuvring to balance\nexpertise and national representation. There was\nmuch documentation relating to meeting arrange-\nments and expenditure; agendas, notes and minutes\nin various degrees of detail; and reports to higher\nentities and feedback from them. Often, the bulk of\na file was made up of a series of drafts with comments\nand corrections, chronologically preceding the final\ndocument.Figure 1. Schematic representation of document flow\nthrough Paris Institute and the ICIC entities.758 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nTo the extent that these flowed through the Geneva\nSecretariat, all these items were filed by its central\nRegistry. However, certain Sections established files\nindependently. Grandjean (2018) has provided a brief\nbut clear exposition of the structure and functioning of\nthese archives. The custodian of the League of\nNations archives is the library of the United Nations\noffice in Geneva (Blukacz-Louisfert, 2014). A project\nto digitise all of the League\u2019s archives was completed\nby United Nations Archives Geneva in 2022, and the\narchives are available on an online platform as part of\nthe \u2018Total Digital Access to the League of Nations\nArchive\u2019 project (United Nations Archives Geneva,\n2022d). The structure, time series and complexities\nof the League of Nations Secretariat and Section\nfonds are explained in the \u2018Context Area\u2019 and \u2018Con-\ntent and Structure Area\u2019 notes to the League of\nNations Secretariat fonds (United Nations Archives\nGeneva, 2022c). There are also finding aids, and it\nis possible to chat online or correspond with helpful\narchivists.\nThe Paris Institute set up its own archives service in\n1928. These archives were evacuated to Gu\u00b4 erande in\nBrittany in June 1940, but returned to Paris in July of\nthe same year. During the German Occupation, some\nmaterial was lost. After the Second World War, the\nproperty of the Paris Institute, including its archives,\nwas transferred to UNESCO (UNESCO, 1990: 1:10).\nThe Institute\u2019s archives have been digitised and can\nbe accessed online using the UNESCO Archives\nAtoM (Access to Memory) Catalogue, where useful\narchivists\u2019 notes are also provided (UNESCO, 2016).\nFor the inexperienced researcher, particular chal-\nlenges arise from the evolving structure of the League\nof Nations. It was difficult for Registry clerks to keep\nup with the changes to the names of entities, since the\nauthors of the documents they filed paid scant regard\nto consistency of word order, near synonyms such as\n\u2018committee\u2019 and \u2018commission\u2019, or the use of preposi-\ntions (as in \u2018committee of\u2019, \u2018committee for\u2019 or \u2018com-\nmittee on\u2019). The bilingual nature of the League of\nNations (French and English) led to much confusion,\nas names of entities were translated from one lan-\nguage to another, and then back again.\nEntities concerned with libraries\nand bibliography\nOnline searches in the archives of the League\n(Geneva) and the Institute (Paris) for material relating\nto IFLA and other manifestations of international\nlibrarianship yielded documents relating to a confus-\ning variety of entities concerned with documentation,\ninformation, bibliography and libraries.The word \u2018documentation\u2019 occurs frequently in the\nsense of collections of documents supporting the work\nof various ICIC entities. It also co-occurs with \u2018bib-\nliography\u2019. The evolving and overlapping meanings\nof the terms \u2018bibliography\u2019 and \u2018documentation\u2019 dur-\ning this period deserve an in-depth study, which is\nbeyond the scope of this article, but some aspects are\ntouched on below in relation to the Subcommittee and\nits uneasy relationship with the International Institute\nof Bibliography (IIB, also known as the Brussels\nInstitute). In 1932, the IIB changed its name to the\nInternational Institute for Documentation, reflecting\nthe evolution of the concept. Lists or directories of\ndocumentation centres are referred to in various files.\nFor example, the Carnegie Endowment for Interna-\ntional Peace gave the ICIC a grant to publish a list\nof international documen tation centres in political\nscience that had been compiled by the Section of\nUniversity Relations (Picht, 1930). However, there\nappears not to have been any ICIC entity tasked with\nthe general promotion or international coordination of\ndocumentation as distinct from bibliography. From\nthe activities of the ICIC\u2019s Subcommittee for science\nand Bibliography (discussed below), it is evident that,\nfor its purposes, the scope of the term \u2018bibliography\u2019\ncovered documentation as well.\nThe League\u2019s Information Section, the largest\nSection of the Secretariat, was concerned with the\ndissemination of information about the League, basi-\ncally serving as its press office (United Nations\nArchives Geneva, 2022a). There was much corre-\nspondence concerning the League of Nations\u2019 own\nlibrary. Apart from this, there are many files relating\nto libraries and bibliography as part of the ICIC\u2019s and\nParis Institute\u2019s international work, which are not rel-\nevant to the present study.\nThere are two lists of the committees established\nby the League of Nations. The first occurs in a mem-\norandum (League of Nations, 1934) drawn up by the\nLeague\u2019s Secretary General at the request of the\nCouncil, which \u2013 no doubt perturbed by their prolif-\neration \u2013 had asked him to draw up rules for the\nappointment, composition and renewal of term of the\nLeague\u2019s committees. This document does not men-\ntion any of the committees of interest to us. The sec-\nond list of committees was published in September\n1945, after the Second World War, with a view to\ndecisions on what was to be done with the approxi-\nmately 40 surviving committees of the League of\nNations. However, neither the dozens of subcommit-\ntees nor any of the committees that would have no\npost-war purpose were included in this inventory\n(League of Nations, 1945: 6, 71). Fourteen commit-\ntees were listed under the ICIC, including the759 Lor: Librarianship and bibliography in the international arena\nCommittee of Expert Librarians, which will be dealt\nwith in work currently in progress. No committees\nother than administrative entities were listed under\nthe Institute.\nSearches in the Geneva fonds yielded information\nabout at least 20 entities of potential interest. The\nrelationships among thes e entities are difficult to\nunravel since, in most cases, multiple names were\nused to refer to the same committee, both sequentially\nand simultaneously. An \u2018International Library and\nBibliographical Committee\u2019 is also encountered, but\nthis was the name used to refer to IFLA from 1927\nuntil its constitution was adopted in 1929. League of\nNations Registry clerks continued for some time to\nuse this name for IFLA, which after 1929 was more\ngenerally referred to as the International Library\nCommittee. This leaves the following ICIC entities\nthat are of interest to this study:\n/C15The Subcommittee for Science and\nBibliography;\n/C15The Committee of Library Experts, one of the\nICIC\u2019s many expert committees, was often\nreferred to as the Expert Committee of Librar-\nians, or Expert Library Committee. It is\nreferred to below as the \u201cExpert Committee\u201d;\n/C15The Meeting of Directors of National Libraries.\nThis article focuses on the first of these. The latter\ntwo were closely intertwi ned and deserve separate\ntreatment.\nSubcommittee for Science\nand Bibliography2\nThe Subcommittee for Science and Bibliography\n(mostly referred to as the Bibliographic Sub-\nCommission or the Sub-Committee for Bibliography)\nwas created in the first year of the ICIC\u2019s existence. In\nAugust 1922, a resolution proposed by Jules Destr\u00b4 ee\nwas adopted to create \u2018a Sub-Committee to consider\nthe best Method for preserving Knowledge accumu-\nlated in the Past and securing its rapid Dissemination\nin the Future\u2019 (Commission internationale de\ncoop\u00b4 eration intellectuelle, 1922). The resolution of\nthe League\u2019s Council stated:\n[The Council] approves of the programme of\ninvestigation proposed by the Committee [ICIC] to\nfacilitate international co-operation as regards bibliogra-\nphy, to examine the question of a legally recognised\ninternational depot for publications, etc. The execution\nof this scheme has been entrusted to a Sub-Committee,\nwhich will have the power to co-opt not more than 5\nexperts or specialists. (Soci\u00b4 et\u00b4e des Nations, 1922)It was the first of the ICIC\u2019s initial three subcommit-\ntees and the one with the most precisely stated pur-\npose \u2013 that of \u2018improving periodical bibliography\u2019\n(Grandjean, 2018: 199) or, in today\u2019s terminology,\nbibliographic control of periodicals. There was a sep-\narate subcommittee dealing with intellectual property.\nMembership\nThe Subcommittee\u2019s first meeting was held in Paris\non 20 and 21 December 1922. As a subcommittee of\nthe ICIC itself (the \u2018plenary committee\u2019), it consisted\nof three members of the ICIC and a number of librar-\nians, who were described as membres adjoints (asso-\nciate members). A sense of the expertise and gravitas\nof the membership can be gained from the names of\nthe members who attended its initial meeting:\n/C15Henri Bergson, the influential French philoso-\npher and academician who won the Nobel Prize\nfor Literature in 1927, was the first chairman of\nthe Subcommittee (1922\u20131925).\n/C15Madame Sk\u0142odowska-Curie, the Polish-French\nphysicist, was a double Nobel Prizewinner and\nthe first woman to win that prize. She was a\nparticularly dedicated and thoughtful member\nof the ICIC from its inception in 1922 to 1934\n(Pycior, 1996).\n/C15Jules Destr\u00b4 ee (1863\u20131936) was a Belgian\nlawyer, cultural critic and socialist politician,\nand the former Belgian Minister of Arts and\nSciences.\nOther eminent scientific and scholarly figures who\nserved on the Subcommittee in later years were\nKristina Bonnevie (a Norwegian biologist and femin-\nist), F Stuart Chapin (an American sociologist), Sir\nJagadish Chandra Bose (an Indian physicist, botanist\nand polymath), Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (a Nobel\nPrizewinning Dutch physicist), Gilbert Murray (the\nAustralian-born British classical scholar and public\nintellectual) and Otto Jespersen (a Danish linguist).3\nThese scientists and scholars were painstakingly\nselected to ensure that the various disciplines and the\nLeague\u2019s member nations were equitably represented.\nNot all the members pulled their weight \u2013 Einstein\nwas notably lax in this regard (Pycior, 1996) \u2013 but\nthey were not mere figureheads. Committee minutes\nand reports show them participating actively and\nsometimes forcefully. The status of intellectual work\nand international access to scientific information were\nclearly important to them.\nThe Subcommittee also included several librarians\nas associate members. At the first meeting, these were:760 IFLA Journal 50(4)\n/C15Marcel Godet, director of the National Library\nof Switzerland from 1909 to 1945, who played\na leading role in international library matters\nand later served as the third president of IFLA\nfrom 1936 to 1945 (Sub-Commission on Bib-\nliography, 1922).\n/C15Dr Charles Theodore Hagbert Wright, secretary\nand librarian of the London Library, an inde-\npendent subscription library founded in 1845.\nHe was a public intellectual and political fig-\nure, and his library held significant scholarly\nresources.\n/C15Dr W Dawson Johnston, director of the\nAmerican Library in Paris and later the\nEuropean representative of the Library of\nCongress. The USA had not joined the League\nof Nations but a good number of Americans\nwere nevertheless involved in the League\u2019s\nactivities. At the time, attendance at meetings\nin Europe meant that senior American librar-\nians such as Herbert Putnam, the Librarian of\nCongress, would have had to undertake a trans-\natlantic voyage in winter and spend three or\nfour weeks away from their institution. There-\nfore, they often chose to delegate their atten-\ndance to an American already in Europe\n(American National Committee on Intellectual\nCo-operation, 1931).\n/C15Waldo G Leland of the History Department of\nthe Carnegie Institution, who had been sent by\nthat institution to find and duplicate American\nhistory materials in European repositories. The\nconnection to Carnegie may partly explain his\npresence at this meeting.\nAlthough he turned out to be the Subcommittee\u2019s\nlongest-serving librarian member, Godet did not head\none of Europe\u2019s best-known research libraries, and his\nthree fellow librarians were relatively lightweight\ncompared to those who followed. Meetings of the\nSubcommittee were frequently attended by other per-\nsons invited for their special expertise \u2013 for example,\nin 1924, five editors of major indexing and abstracting\njournals. On various occasions, Paul Otlet and Henri\nLafontaine were invited to state the case for their IIB.\nTowards the end of the Subcommittee\u2019s life, associate\nmembers from other fields were appointed to serve on\nit. Later minutes and reports do not always specify in\nwhat capacity those present participated.\nFrom 1927 onwards, the librarians on the\nSubcommittee were almost exclusively heads of major\nnational and research libraries, such as Dr AE Cowley,\nBodley\u2019s Librarian, Oxford; Pierre-Ren\u00b4 eR o l a n d -\nMarcel, director of the Biblioth` eque nationale, Paris;and, after Germany joined the League in 1926, Dr\nHugo Andres Kru \u00a8ss (1927), the internationally influen-\ntial general director of the Prussian State Library. It\nwas Kru \u00a8ss who, at the end of the American Library\nAssociation conference of 1926, formulated the pro-\nposal to establish an international library body, which\nultimately led to the founding of IFLA. The presence of\nGodet and Kru \u00a8ss in the Subcommittee foreshadowed\nthe close relations that developed between ICIC enti-\nties and IFLA.\nAt its meeting in 1928, Madame Curie presided\nover a reshuffled Subcommittee. The other eminent\nscientists and scholars in attendance were Bonnevie,\nBose, Chapin and Jespersen (all mentioned above),\nand three newer members: \u00b4Emile Borel (1871\u2013\n1956), a renowned French mathematician and former\nMinister of the Navy; Albert Thibaudet (1874\u20131936),\na French essayist and critic, and Professor of French\nLiterature at the University of Geneva; and Constan-\ntin Ionesco-Miha \u02d8es\u00b8ti (1883\u20131962), the Romanian\nphysician and pathologist. Turnover of the member-\nship had resulted in three members from France and\none each from Britain/India, Denmark, Norway,\nRomania and the USA. The librarian membres\nadjoints present were still Cowley, Godet, Kru \u00a8ss and\nRoland-Marcel (Subcommittee on Science and Bib-\nliography of the League of Nations, 1928).\nNo representative of the IIB\nIt may come as a surprise that two prominent figures\nin international scholarly bibliography and documen-\ntation \u2013 Paul Otlet and Henri Lafontaine \u2013 were not\ninvited to be members. As founders of the Interna-\ntional Institute for Documentation (later renamed the\nInternational Institute for Bibliography (IIB)) and the\nUnion of International Associations, they must have\nfelt entitled to membership. The omission was the\nresult of strained relations between the Union of Inter-\nnational Associations and IIB, on the one hand, and\nthe League of Nations and ICIC, on the other. Rela-\ntions had soured during the debates about the nature\nof the League and where its headquarters should be\nlocated. These debates were followed by disagree-\nments about the ICIC and its relationship to the Union\nof International Associations, described in detail by\nGrandjean (2018) and Schroeder-Gudehus (2018).\nStrained relations are evident from reports of the\nSubcommittee\u2019s meetings held in Brussels in 1923\nand 1927. At the third session of the Subcommittee\u2019s\nmeeting in 1923, Otlet and Lafontaine attended by\ninvitation. Having hosted the Subcommittee members\nthe previous day at the IIB and the Palais Mondial for\na demonstration of their work, Otlet asked quite761 Lor: Librarianship and bibliography in the international arena\npointedly in what capacity he and Lafontaine were\nattending. He stressed the pre-eminent international\nposition of the IIB and the Union of International\nAssociations, and that the League of Nations had been\nrequested to recognise it. He stated \u2013 not very diplo-\nmatically \u2013 that the IIB and the Union of International\nAssociations \u2018could not lend their aid to newly estab-\nlished bodies which did not possess some connection\nwith it\u2019 (International Committee on Intellectual\nCooperation, 1923b). During the sixth and final ses-\nsion of the Subcommittee\u2019s meeting in Brussels, there\nwas a long discussion about universal bibliography\nand the role of the IIB in it.4Otlet, who had submitted\na written declaration, spoke again, complaining about\nthe \u2018unpleasant\u2019 (\u2018f\u02c6 acheuse\u2019) procedure of the ICIC\nand the Subcommittee, and stressing the achieve-\nments of the IIB. At the end of the session, the Sub-\ncommittee adopted a somewhat conciliatory\nresolution: the IIB \u2018should be chosen as the sole inter-\nnational repository for the alphabetical \u201cBibliography\nTitles\u201d [ sic] arranged according to the names of\nauthors\u2019 and the ICIC \u2018should decide to investigate\nthe manner in which the organisation of this work\nmay be completed under the auspices of the League\nof Nations in conjunction with the appropriate\nnational and international associations and institu-\ntions\u2019 (International Committee on Intellectual Coop-\neration, 1923a).\nIn the documentation of subsequent meetings, a\npattern is evident: vagu ep r o m i s e sw e r em a d et o\nOtlet by the ICIC and its Subcommittee, but were\nfollowed up tardily and rel uctantly. A draft agree-\nment with the IIB was approved by the Subcommit-\ntee in 1924 after much discussion (International\nCommittee on Intellectual Cooperation, 1924). This\nwas again discussed in 1925. In 1926, a long discus-\nsion was minuted concerning an agreement where\nthe IIB was to have compiled a supplement to the\nIndex bibliographique . Insufficient progress had\nbeen made, and it was unclear whether the relation-\nship could be continued. After much debate, it was\nreluctantly decided not to terminate the agreement.\nInstead, a wait-and-see attitude was adopted (Sub-\nCommittee on Bibliography, 1926).\nThere are several reasons for the reluctance of the\nICIC and the Subcommittee to engage with Otlet and\nLafontaine. Their approach was perceived as exces-\nsively idealistic and ambitious, and likely to incur\ngreat expenditure. There was fear on the part of the\nICIC of being \u2018annexed\u2019 by the Union of International\nAssociations. In the background was the earlier riv-\nalry between Brussels and Geneva about the location\nof the League\u2019s headquarters, and even a suspicion\nthat the two free-thinking, secular Belgians might befreemasons (Schroeder-Gudehus, 2018). Other fac-\ntors, such as the incompatibility of their personalities\n(Laqua, 2014) and orientations (Rayward, 1981), are\nalso thought to have played a role.\nThe attitude of most of the Subcommittee\u2019s\nmembers to the IIB contrasts with the interest they\ntook in the nascent IFLA. Developments at interna-\ntional congresses of librarians in Washington in 1926\nand Edinburgh in 1927, and at the International\nCongress of Libraries and Bibliography in Rome in\n1929 (during which IFLA adopted its new name and\nconstitution), were followed with interest. On 13 July\n1929, the secretary of the ICIC wrote a congratulatory\nletter to Dr Isak Collijn, IFLA\u2019s first president,\nexpressing the wish for close collaboration with IFLA\nand inviting him to attend a following session in\nGeneva to discuss how IFLA and the ICIC could\ncollaborate (Oprescu, 1929).\nThe Subcommittee\u2019s agenda\nAs the Subcommittee\u2019s initial name indicates, it was\nconcerned with the bibliographic control of scientific\nliterature and, more generally, with international\ncooperation in what we would today call \u2018scholarly\ncommunication\u2019. A particular issue that had been\nreferred to it when it was established was the exten-\nsion of the 1886 Brussels Convention on the interna-\ntional exchange of publications. Until the late 1920s,\nthe Subcommittee was the League of Nations\u2019 pri-\nmary forum for bibliographic and library matters.\nAt its first five meetings, the Subcommittee mainly\ndiscussed ambitious and complex international\nschemes for facilitating access to scientific and scho-\nlarly literature. It is known that Madame Curie\u2019s inter-\nnational renown did not translate into generous\nfinancial support for her research (Pycior, 1996).\nUsed to battling continual financial constraints her-\nself, she was very concerned to provide support to\nintellectual workers. She proposed creating a univer-\nsal library containing all the world\u2019s scientific period-\nicals, to be collected using a system of international\nlegal deposit. The mind boggles at the amount of\nnegotiation that would be required to persuade all the\nmember governments to amend their legal deposit\nlegislation to provide for international legal deposit.\nHowever, we must bear in mind that her suggestion\nwas made in the more idealistic early days of the\nICIC, when expectations of international solidarity\nwere higher.\nMadame Curie also proposed an international\nsystem of \u2018dockets\u2019 (bibliographic entries) to be\nsubmitted \u2018to a centre for general collation\u2019 (Biblio-\ngraphic Sub-Commission, 1922). By this, she meant762 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nthat the editors of scientific periodicals should add to\neach article a slip or card bearing an abstract of it.\nThese entries would be submitted to a central agency\nso as to create an international bibliographical index\n(Pycior, 1996). This would indeed have been helpful\nbut, in hindsight, arriving at a common standard and\nformat for the entries, and persuading journal editors\nto contribute them, seems a formidable endeavour.\nThese were ideas ahead of their time \u2013 four decades\nahead of computerised cataloguing, the MARC\n(machine-readable catal oguing) formats, and the\nschemes of IFLA and UNESCO for Universal Biblio-\ngraphic Control and Universal Availability of Publi-\ncations. Indeed, a century later, Madame Curie\u2019s\nwishes have been only partially fulfilled with the aid\nof the Internet and large-scale web-based content. It\nwas also ironic, and a bitter pill for Otlet and Lafon-\ntaine, that these ideas were being proposed in disre-\ngard of the R\u00b4epertoire bibliographique universel they\nhad launched almost three decades earlier. In January\n1923, Otlet complained bitterly:\nHow ironic! Here we have a commission responsible for\npromoting cooperation, which starts off by brushing\naside a group of active collaborators, and as a prelude\nto its work, commits an act of non-cooperation.5\n(Author\u2019s translation)\nDuring its eight years, the Subcommittee\u2019s agenda\ngradually evolved. Whilst issues relating to \u2018analyti-\ncal bibliography\u2019 \u2013 that is, abstracts, reviews and ana-\nlytical summaries \u2013 continued to feature on every\nagenda, less attention was paid to grand universal\nschemes and more to more concrete, \u2018bite-sized\u2019 proj-\nects. Thus, the editors of a number of abstracting and\nindexing services in physics and physical chemistry\nwere invited to the Subcommittee\u2019s fifth meeting in\n1924 to discuss the \u2018coordination of work on analyti-\ncal bibliography\u2019, where concern was expressed about\nthe duplication of effort and it was felt that it was\nnecessary to coordinate their work (International\nCommittee on Intellectual Cooperation, 1924). Even-\ntually, committees of experts investigated the coordi-\nnation of the bibliography of other sets of disciplines,\nincluding economic sciences, classical antiquity and\nbiological sciences \u2013 with limited success. At the\nsame time, the Subcommittee\u2019s agendas grew with\nthe addition of topics of a practical nature, such as\nthe quality of paper and ink (the poor quality after the\nFirst World War being thought to endanger the pre-\nservation of scientific literature); how to deal with\nworks published in less-spoken languages (especially\nin newly independent countries such as Poland and\nCzechoslovakia); the international lending of booksand manuscripts; tables of constants; the standardisa-\ntion of periodical formats (a hobby horse of Madame\nCurie, who was nothing if not persistent); and\n\u2018microphotography\u2019.\nHowever, the Subcommittee did not lose sight of the\nmore ambitious, universalist goal of making the world\u2019s\nscientific and scholarly literature readily available, so\nobviating the need for researchers to travel to distant\nlibraries, or at least enab ling them to undertake their\ntravels better informed as to where to go. A world cat-\nalogue of bibliographies and a guide to national services\nto provide information on interlibrary lending and pub-\nlication exchanges were specific projects that were\nintended to meet the needs of scholars and scientists\nworking across national borders.\nOne such project, of particular interest here, arose\nfrom discussions about the organisation of scientific\ninformation at the national level, with an emphasis on\ninternational interlibrary lending and publication\nexchanges. In 1925, it was decided to study ways and\nmeans to publish national union catalogues of period-\nicals (Sous-commission de bibliographie, 1925). In\nthe following year, the Subcommittee discussed the\n\u2018international coordination of libraries for documen-\ntation\u2019 (\u2018coordination internationale des biblioth` eques\npour la documentation\u2019). Such coordination would\ncomprise two stages:\nIn the first place the most powerful libraries would be\nrequired to inform the Institute what resources were in\ntheir possession concerning a given subject and, as sub-\nsidiary information, on resources of the less important\nlibraries affiliated in practice to them. Secondly, an\nendeavour should be made to draw up definite biblio-\ngraphies for the use of persons undertaking research\nwork who asked for them. (Sub-Committee on Biblio-\ngraphy, 1926; punctuation added)\nIt was decided that the four library experts on the\nSubcommittee would meet in Paris in the following\nyear to discuss the issue. By 1927, the project appears\nto have morphed. A \u2018meeting of experts to coordinate\nthe work of libraries\u2019 (\u2018reunion des experts pour coor-\ndonner les travaux des biblioth` eques\u2019) was held. It\nmade recommendations for the functioning of an\n\u2018International Service for the Coordination of\nLibraries\u2019 (\u2018Service international de coordination des\nbiblioth` eques\u2019) to be set up at the Paris Institute\n(Godet, 1928). In the process, these meetings gave\nbirth to the Committee of Library Experts.\nAs mentioned earlier, a significantly renewed Sub-\ncommittee took over in 1928. From that year on, the\nword \u2018Science\u2019 was added to its name in all its doc-\numents. The ICIC was concerned with much more763 Lor: Librarianship and bibliography in the international arena\nthan science and bibliography, as shown in the docu-\nmentation of its plenary meetings in 1928 and 1929.\nHere, the topics on the agenda included collaboration\nwith the International Labour Office\u2019s Advisory\nCommittee on Intellectual Workers; the instruction\nof youth on the aims of the League of Nations; revi-\nsion of the statutes of the International Educational\nCinematographic Institute; national committees on\nintellectual cooperation; and exchanges of teachers\nand secondary school children (Commission interna-\nt i o n a l ed ec o o p \u00b4 eration intellectuelle, 1928, 1929;\nInstitut international de coop\u00b4 eration intellectuelle,\n1928). In 1930, a new topic was added: the Commit-\ntee of Enquiry into the work and organisation of the\nICIC, which dominated the discussion that year\n(Soci\u00b4 et\u00b4e des Nations, 1930) and led to the \u2018reform\u2019\nmentioned earlier.\nWhile less prominent on the ICIC\u2019s later agendas,\ntopics relating to science and bibliography continued\nto receive the Subcommittee\u2019s attention. In addition\nto a proposed new item on \u2018Material resources neces-\nsary to sustain scientific research\u2019 (Commission inter-\nnationale de coop\u00b4 eration intellectuelle, 1928), work\ncontinued on matters that had already been on the\nagenda for some time \u2013 for example:\n/C15Coordination of scientific and scholarly\nbibliography, with an emphasis on current\nabstracting (with limited progress reported);\n/C15Exchange of publications (revision of the 1886\nBrussels Convention \u2013 a matter taken up at the\ngovernmental level);\n/C15Relations with the IIB;\n/C15Standardisation of linguistic terms;\n/C15Conservation of printed works and manuscripts;\n/C15Publication of a guide to national information\ncentres for interlibrary lending;\n/C15Information sharing among large libraries\nabout purchases of foreign books.\nImpact of organisational changes\nFrom 1925, the Paris Institute\u2019s Section of Scientific\nRelations was responsible for administrative support\n(membership, meetings, minutes, reports, etc.) and\nconducting research (mainly questionnaire surveys)\nrequested by the Subcommittee and, later, by its Com-\nmittee of Library Experts. The Subcommittee\u2019s doc-\numents show that the advent of the Institute \u2013 and\nconcomitant increasing use of expert committees \u2013\nhad a significant impact on its work. From 1925, we\nsee questions on the Subcommittee\u2019s agenda, such as\nthe quality of paper and ink, being referred to the\nInstitute for investigation (Sub-Committee onBibliography, 1925). The minutes of the eighth meet-\ning (1926) provide evidence that a lack of clarity\nabout the transfer of certain responsibilities from the\nSubcommittee to the Institute had given rise to some\ntension between them. That this was seen to be a\nsensitive issue is evident from the editing of the draft\nminutes (Sub-Committee on Bibliography, 1926).\nA general pattern of communication developed.\nThe Subcommittee\u2019s agendas and minutes, as well\nas those of any expert committees reporting to it, were\nprepared by the Institute\u2019s Section of Scientific Rela-\ntions. Questions arising in the Subcommittee were\nreferred (via that Section) to expert committees for\ninvestigation and recommendations. The Subcommit-\ntee and expert committees requested the Section to\nconduct investigations (often by means of postal\nquestionnaires distributed to member states). The\nexpert committees advised on the research procedure,\ncommented on the results and reported back (via the\nInstitute\u2019s Section) to th e Subcommittee, which in\nturn reported to the ICIC, also via that Section. Until\nit was disbanded as part of the \u2018reform\u2019 of 1930, the\nSubcommittee served as the conduit for communica-\ntion between the ICIC and committees of natural\nscientists and historical and social scientists, and\nexpert committees \u2013 some of which were short-lived\nand others, like the Committee of Library Experts,\nmore permanent. The Subcommittee\u2019s agendas and\nminutes reflect an increasing reliance on its expert\ncommittees, with its agendas being dominated by dis-\ncussions of reports from them. Presumably, this was\nalso the case in the ICIC\u2019s other subcommittees. It is\ntherefore not surprising that, in 1930, the degree of\nduplication that occurred led to a decision to \u2018termi-\nnate\u2019 (\u2018supprimer\u2019) all the subcommittees (League of\nNations Council, 1930). After the Subcommittee had\nbeen abolished, the bulk of its work was continued by\nthe Committee of Library Experts.6\nConclusion\nJudged by concrete, practical outcomes, the results of\nthe Subcommittee\u2019s work are modest, especially\nwhen considered against the backdrop of the idealistic\nand ambitious proposals made at its first meeting. The\ncreation of a universal library through international\nlegal deposit and a system of international biblio-\ngraphic control of journal literature through the vol-\nuntary submission by journal editors of bibliographic\ndata (Madame Curie\u2019s \u2018dockets\u2019) both appear hope-\nlessly unrealistic \u2013 politically as well as technologi-\ncally. A century later, more advanced technology\nhas helped us only to inch closer to the realisation\nof universal bibliographic control and universal764 IFLA Journal 50(4)\navailability of publications. Technologic barriers have\nbeen eased, but the geopolitical factors that ultimately\nsank the League of Nations have in our times\nmorphed into equally intractable political-economic\nconstraints that continue to inhibit the free movement\nof scientific and scholarly information.\nIt is wise to tackle wicked problems by breaking\nthem up into smaller pieces. However, scaling down\nthe Subcommittee\u2019s initial ambitions and concentrat-\ning on a few fields such as physics, physical chemis-\ntry, biological sciences or economics achieved limited\nsuccess. In 1929, the last full year before the Subcom-\nmittee was terminated, the ICIC was able to report to\nthe League\u2019s Council that sufficient improvement had\noccurred in the biological sciences but, in the other\nfields, meetings and negotiations continued. There\nwas limited progress on projects of smaller scope.\nWork on an international code for periodical abbre-\nviations continued, as did work on the exchange of\npublications. A new supplement to the Index biblio-\ngraphicus was being planned. The project for the\nexchange among major libraries of information on\npurchases of foreign books was still under way, await-\ning more precise specifications (Commission interna-\ntionale de coop\u00b4 eration intellectuelle, 1929).\nProgress continued at a snail\u2019s pace. As is the case\ntoday, those working on these projects did so along-\nside other responsibilities. In the 1920s, their ques-\ntions and responses had to be sent by post or, in urgent\ncases, telegram. Sche duling meetings was time-\nconsuming; the meetings themselves involved\nexpensive and time-consuming travel by train and\nsteamship. But the main obstacle was not technology\nor logistics; it was the complexity arising from the\nnumber of stakeholders in many countries and speak-\ning different languages \u2013 government agencies, uni-\nversities, research institutes, professional bodies,\npublishers, editors, scientists and scholars \u2013 all with\ndifferent aims, interests, traditions and standards. His-\ntories and personalities played a part, as seen in the\nunfortunate case of relations with the IIB.\nOn the positive side, until the late 1920s, the\nSubcommittee served as the main forum for library\nand bibliographic cooperation. Professional friend-\nships developed across national and disciplinary bor-\nders. Library leaders sat around the same table as\nsome of the finest scientists and scholars of the time\n\u2013 leaders in their fields who understood that libraries\nand bibliography were critical to science and scholar-\nship, and who could communicate this to their peers\nand their governments. A nucleus of well-connected\nlibrary leaders was formed: Godet, Kru \u00a8ss, Collijn and\nothers were able to continue the work of internationalcollaboration in the Committee of Library Experts\nand in IFLA.\nThe weakness of the League of Nations is reflected\nin the ICIC and its subcommittees. Today, it is recog-\nnised that the League left a valuable legacy, not only\nby creating a new kind of international organisation,\nbut also in terms of its guiding themes and ethos. In its\nmodest way, the Subcommittee for Science and Bib-\nliography contributed to keeping the flame of inter-\nnationalism burning.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks Alex Renault and Jacques Oberson at\nthe United Nations Archives Geneva for their assistance.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nPeter Johan Lor https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6307-9068\nNotes\n1.

It is mostly known as the Subcom-\nmittee for Bibliograp hy. Subcommittees were\nsometimes called \u2018sub-commissions\u2019 ( sous-commis-\nsions ). In the archives and literature of the League of\nNations, the terms \u2018committee\u2019 and \u2018commission\u2019 were\nused quasi-interchangeably, as were the French comit \u00b4e\nand commission . In English, \u2018committee\u2019 was more\ncommon; in French, commission , the latter then indicat-\ning an entity at a higher level than a comit \u00b4e.\n3. Where not otherwise stated, information about the mem-\nbers was obtained on the World Wide Web, mainly from\nWikipedia.\n4. The sessions of the Subcommittee comprised a series of\nmeetings over two or three consecutive days.\n5. \u2018Oh! Ironie!

This insight provid es opportunities for further research and a broader\nunderstanding of the contribution of this sector to both education and librarianship internationally.\nKeywords\nSchool libraries, teacher librarians, library and information science, children\u2019s services, user populations, school\nmedia centres, school libraries, information providers\nThis article discusses a preliminary analysis of the\npublications contained in the Knowledge Bank of\nAustralian and New Zealand School Libraries\n(KBANZSL).1KBANZSL was developed in 2020\u2013\n2022 by academics from the School of Information\nand Communication Studies at Charles Sturt Univer-\nsity and launched in 2023. The team of Mary Carroll,\nKasey Garrison, Simon Wakeling and Kay Oddone,\nassisted by information technology specialist Jo Kay\nand research assistant Dr Susan Reynolds, has cross-\ndisciplinary expertise in education, history, librarian-\nship, information systems and teacher librarianship.\nThe overall aim of KBANZSL is to ensure that thepublished non-journal output on school libraries and\nteacher librarianship is recorded for future use. This\nhas become an issue of some urgency, as the profes-\nsion and education for it continue to be under pressure\nin Australia today. Retaining a record such as this has\nthe potential to inform future policy through the pre-\nservation of a longitudinal body of knowledge, which\ncurrently does not exist.

It is worth noting that KBANZSL is not a full-text\nrepository and only records a few seminal individual\njournal articles, as the development team felt that\njournals are comprehensively indexed elsewhere.\nKBANZSL does include bibliographic records and/or\nlocation links for books, relevant organisations,\nreports and web pages in one searchable location.\nBy gathering this information in one location, the\ndevelopment team aims to provide an opportunity for\npractitioners, researchers and policymakers to\ndevelop a longitudinal and holistic understanding of\nschool libraries in Australia and New Zealand over\ntime, and to ensure both current and historical per-\nspectives are represented. The expected benefits of\nthis research will be as a record of significant litera-\nture in the discipline, which will potentially provide\nusers with the capacity to find and access critical\ninformation, retain the publishing memory of a disci-\npline, and support ongoing research that allows users\nto evaluate the past, present and future of school\nlibraries in Australia and New Zealand.\nThis article focuses on the publication output of\nAustralia and explores the KBANZSL corpus for evi-\ndence of the development of this sector through its\npublished output. While the current article looks only\nat Australia, opportunities to discuss the New Zealand\nlandscape and comparisons between the two countries\nare expected in future analysis. The KBANZSL proj-\nect was inspired by the recommendations of the 2010\nAustralian Senate enquiry into school libraries and\nteacher librarians and its resultant report, School\nlibraries and teacher-librarians in 21st century Aus-\ntralia (House of Representatives Education and\nEmployment Committee, 2011). The 2010 Senate\nenquiry into school libraries and teacher librarians\nwas conducted in response to calls by professional\nassociations, practitioners and academics for an\ninvestigation into the impact of the changing educa-\ntional, technological and policy environments in\nwhich school libraries operated and concomitant con-\ncerns about the future of school libraries and the staff-\ning of these libraries by formally qualified teacher\nlibrarians. The enquiry was also set against the back-\ndrop of the global financial crisis and federal govern-\nment stimulus initiatives, which included a large-scale\ninfrastructure and refurbishment programme \u2013 Build-\ning the Education Revolution (BER) \u2013 worth AU$16.2\nbillion to modernise schools over three years.A substantial AU$14.2 billion of this was allocated\nto the Primary Schools for the 21st Century (2010)\ncomponent, which was targeted with funding new and\nrefurbished halls, libraries and classrooms (Australia\nHouse of Representatives Education and Employment\nCommittee, 2011: 15). The result was the building of\n2650 new primary school libraries in both government\nand non-government schools (see Table 1). While\nfunds were made available for infrastructure, the staff-\ning of these new facilities and education for school\nlibrarians did not keep pace.\nThere were also growing concerns in the profession\nabout the removal of measurable benchmarks for\nexisting service delivery in school libraries, declining\ngovernment services to support school library staff,\nand a decline in teacher-librarianship education. For\nexample, in the 1980s, all Australian state education\ndepartments had established centralised school library\nadvisory and support services to assist those working\nin libraries in the areas of library management and\ncurriculum (Ryan, 2017: 18). In the following\ndecades, these state education department units were\ngradually closing, had closed, or were devolving into\nregional or local support units. By the early 2010s, all\nsuch services had ceased to exist, yet the government\nhad facilitated 2650 new school libraries through the\nBER funding.\nA number of critical factors informed the 2010\nSenate enquiry. These included:\n/C15A need for greater understanding of the rela-\ntionship between school libraries and educa-\ntional equity;\n/C15The links between school libraries, qualified\nstaff and improved educational outcomes;\n/C15The role of skilled and suitably qualified\nteacher librarians in promoting literacy andTable 1.

This supports the\nfindings of Australian and international research in\nthis area.\nMoreover, it remarked:\nIt is also clear, at least anecdotally, that teacher librar-\nians can play a vital role in educating future global\ncitizens, who need to be not only technically savvy but\nalso responsible cyber citizens, able to discern the value\nand merit of the overwhelming amount of information\nthat they encounter online.\nHowever, the anecdotal nature of many of the\nsubmissions led the Committee to suggest\nthat there is a fundamental need to collate some hard\ndata to ascertain how many teacher librarians there are\nin Australia\u2019s primary and secondary schools; to identify\nwhere the gaps are; and to start to extrapolate the links\nbetween library programs, literacy (especially digital\nliteracy, which is as important as regular literacy and\nnumeracy skills), and student achievement. (House of\nRepresentatives Education and Employment Commit-\ntee, 2011: 118)\nThese concluding comments suggested that while\nthere was a great deal of passion and interest around\nschool libraries and teacher librarianship, there was\nvery little hard data or evidence. The report made 11\nrecommendations, including the following:\nRecommendation 5\nThe Committee recommends that the Commonwealth\nGovernment initiate an Austra lian-based lon gitudinal\nstudy into the links between library programs, literacy\n(including digital literacy) and student achievement,including their impact on improving outcomes for socio-\neconomically disadvantaged students.\n...\nRecommendation 8\nThe Committee recommends that the Commonwealth\nGovernment commission a thorough workforce gap\nanalysis of teacher librarians across Australian\nschools.\nRecommendation 9\nThe Committee recommends that the Minister for\nSchool Education, Early Childhood and Youth,\nthrough the Ministerial Cou ncil for Education, Early\nChildhood Development and Youth Affairs, establish\na national dialogue, including with tertiary providers,\non the role of teacher librarians today in schools and\ninto the future. The dialogue should include an exam-\nination of the adequacy of the pathways into the pro-\nfession and ongoing training requirements. (House of\nRepresentatives Education and Employment Commit-\ntee, 2011: xix)\nDespite the recommendations and work of the\nenquiry, the \u2018fundamental need to collate some hard\ndata to ascertain how many teacher librarians there\nare in Australia\u2019s primar y and secondary schools\n[and] to identify where the gaps are\u2019, as well as the\ncollation of other data, has never been addressed and\nis still not consistently collected across Australia. This\nhas left an ongoing gap in knowledge about this sector\nand limited the capacity for informed decision-\nmaking and policy initiatives. However, as the\nKBANZSL corpus record indicates, there has been\nboth sporadic and localised data-gathering over time.\nIt may be possible to retrospectively gather from the\nextant evidence enough data to build a longitudinal\nbody of evidence around the key concerns of the\nCommittee, including student achievement, outcomes\nand the workforce. This project did not have the\ncapacity or funding to undertake such evidence-\nbuilding. However, it has provided an opportunity to\ninvestigate some broader trends and insights in the\nexisting corpus, and ensure that previous knowledge\nremains visible.\nConstruction of KBANZSL\nKBANZSL was constructed using a number of over-\narching nodes, which were scoped to ensure clarity\nand consistency in their use. This scoping work was\npart of the development phase of the project. The\nnodes are shown in the first column of Table 2. The\nsecond column provides the scope of the node and the\nthird an example of a document that may fall within771 Carroll et al.: School libraries in Australia\nthe node. These nodes allow for easy identification\nand aggregation of significant publication types \u2013 for\nexample, landmark documents or those dealing with\nprofessional practice.\nKBANZSL searches can be filtered and sorted\nby publication decade, file type, location, school\nlevel, school sector or resource descriptor \u2013 for\nexample, \u2018report\u2019, \u2018architectural plans\u2019 or \u2018policy\ndocuments\u2019. These further filters allow for more\ngranular searching and filtering, and are useful inhistorical perspectives on the publications. For\nan example of these more granular filters, see\nFigure 1, which shows \u2018Jurisdiction by school\nsector\u2019 and the further subtopics under this main\nfilter.\nFigure 2 provides an overview of all the top-level\nnodes, fields and filters within KBANZSL.\nKBANZSL also allows filtering and sorting using\nstandard bibliographic fields such as author, title and\npublication date.2Table 2.

This analysis was primarily conducted in\nExcel, using the full-coded data set that underpins\nKBANZSL. Standard Excel functions were used to\ngenerate descriptive statistics across a number of\ndimensions, including de cade, node, location and\ncombinations thereof. This stage of the analysisincluded cross references to these various dimen-\nsions, such as node frequency by decade both as\na numerical output and as a percentage of the cor-\npus, the number and percentage of the total corpus\nin each decade, and the numerical output and per-\ncentage of each geographic location included in the\n\u2018Jurisdiction by location\u2019 filter. As it is not a full-\ntext resource, we also use d the \u2018Title\u2019 field across\nKBANZSL to look at the title word frequency\nacross decades. As will be discussed, this allowed\nthe team to explore a number of aspects of the\ncorpus, including publication output by decade,\npublication types across time and significant con-\ntributors to this publish ed output. A step in this\nanalysis included the identification of seminal or\nwatershed publications through a review of the lit-\nerature, as shown in Table 3. Table 3 is arranged\nchronologically. The publications listed were iden-\ntified in the literature as b eing influential in shap-\ning the Australian profess ion and school libraries.\nThey also serve to provide touchpoints for some of\nthe further analysis in this article. These significant\npublications were used for further contextual anal-\nysis of the corpus and have the potential to inform\ncontemporary research into school libraries by pro-\nviding a deeper understanding of the forces shaping\nthe sector.\nFor example, we can see evidence of an increase in\npublishing activity around school libraries reflected in\nthe publication outputs in KBANZSL in the late\n1960s and the 1970s. This appears to align with the\nfederal government interventions associated with the\nStates Grants (Secondary Schools Libraries) Act 1968\n(Department of Education and Science, 1969), which\ninjected AU$27 million between 1969 and 1971 to\nbuild school libraries. This initiative, unlike BER in\nFigure 2. Top-level nodes, filters and fields.Figure 1. Example of subfields under the main filter of\n\u2018Jurisdiction by school sector\u2019.\n773 Carroll et al.: School libraries in Australia\nthe early 2000s, also included substantial funding\nfor education for teacher librarianship, and saw the\nestablishment of many programs of study in tertiary\ninstitutions. Of all the publications recorded in\nKBANZSL, 42 %occur between 1960 and 1989 (see\nFigure 3), with 1970\u20131979 accounting for 19 %of that\ntotal. We also see an increase in publishing output in\nthe period of BER and the Senate enquiry (2010\u2013\n2019), at 18 %of the total publishing output recorded\nin KBANZSL.\nGovernment publications\nThe growth of tertiary education programs for\nschool libraries in the 1970s and 1980s was a result\nof Australian federal government funding and saw an\nincrease in the number of academics teaching andresearching in this area. Prior to 1960, only one ter-\ntiary institution delivered education for school or\nteacher librarianship. By 1978, that number had\nincreased to nine (Reid-Smith, 1978: 4). Over the\ndecades, this number fluctuated as former teacher-\ntraining colleges amalgamated or were incorporated\ninto other institutions \u2013 often universities. In the\n1990s, there began a slow decline in the number of\nthese programs as their existence as small teaching\nunits in large and increasingly competitive universi-\nties put them under pressure. Today, only one pro-\ng r a m ,a tC h a r l e sS t u r tU niversity in New South\nWales, delivers teacher librarianship education in\nAustralia (and New Zealand).\nMore generally, in the 1970s\u20131980s, there was a\nmajor shift in the tertiary education sector in Australia,\nwith an increase in degree-conferring institutions, theTable 3.

This evidence sug-\ngests that the growth in research publications could be\nrelated to the growth in the associated academic com-\nmunity, although it may involve other factors, such as\nincreased credentialism and the emphasis on research\noutput for academics over time.\nAnother key event in the 1960\u20131970 period was\nthe introduction of federal funding for independent\nand Catholic schools in Australia, initially in the\nform of infrastructure grants through the States\nGrants Act 1968 and later a stable and systematic\nfunding model for these sectors, provided for the\nfirst time to support non-government schools(Employment, Workplace Relations and Education\nReferences Committee, 2004). In particular, access\nto these funds allowed the Catholic school sector to\nprovide extended educational opportunities and ser-\nvices, including school libraries and qualified\nlibrary staff, to their students. An increase in publi-\ncations from the Catholic school sector occurs post\n1970 following the Schools Commission\u2019s estab-\nlishment of government funding to the Catholic\nschool sector. This sector also continued to deliver\ncentral support services in a number of states for a\nlonger period than its government counterparts, and\nthere is evidence of the continued activities of these\nservices in the publication outputs.\nIf we look at the number of publications initiated by\ngovernments or government agencies (such as educa-\ntion departments or state libraries) by decade (as shown\nin Table 5), there appears to be an obvious peak for\nfederal government publications in the 1970s, with the\nnumber of state publications peaking in the following\ndecade. It is notable that while publication numbers in\n2010\u20132019 are second only to the 1970s, the number of\ngovernment agency publications is not similar. The\nexplanation may be found when reviewing these pub-\nlications and authors, as there also seems to be evidence\nof a rise in the publications initiated by various profes-\nsional library associations as government-initiated pub-\nlications decline. Many of these association documents\nare various forms of advocacy, such as submissions to\ngovernments on various issues related to the sector.\nPublication patterns and nodes\nAs part of this initial analysis of the KBANZSL cor-\npus, the thematic nodes used to organise and identify\nthe publications were examined. These nodes, as indi-\ncated in Figure 4, are:Figure 3. Number of KBANZSL resources by decade.\nTable 4.

The resources in the corpus could be\nassigned multiple nodes. It should be noted that the\ndecision was made to exclude the decades prior to\n1960 as there are too few publications to provide\nmeaningful evidence, and the \u2018historical perspectives\u2019\nnode was excluded as many documents have been\nassigned this node if of historical interest, even if their\nfocus is not historical. Of the remaining nodes, pub-\nlications with a focus on professional practice have\nconsistently had the largest output in each decade in\nKBANZSL (see Figure 4).

The\ncorpus title keywords were organised by decade and\nthen manually coded to identify significant (and/or\nreoccurring) professional words or phrases (and their\nsynonyms) in each decade. The terms listed in the first\ncolumn of Table 6 were identified in the corpus titles\nto be of professional significance. Once the terms had\nbeen identified, a search was conducted using theFigure 5. Corpus node frequency by decade by publications (excluding historical perspectives).\nFigure 6. Node frequency by decade by percent (excluding historical perspectives).\n777 Carroll et al.: School libraries in Australia\nadvanced title search in KBANZSL and the results\nwere sorted by publication date to identify their first\nuse in a title (see Table 6). Some consideration was\ngiven to contextual information in the title keywords.\nIn the initial coding, for example, a distinction was\nmade between \u2018reading\u2019 and \u2018literacy\u2019, with the latter\nreserved for works associated with the development\nof functional literacy skills and the former applied to\nthose publications associated with the concept of\nreading more generally, such as titles associated with\nreading promotion or reading programs. Some evalua-\ntion of the publications, once retrieved, was required\nto make these distinctions. Manual intervention and\njudgement were also needed to ensure that titles\nreflected the researcher\u2019s intention for the word or\nphrase. For example, the word \u2018literacy\u2019 was also used\nin works dealing with \u2018information literacy\u2019 and\n\u2018management\u2019 was used in works related to \u2018subject\nmanagement\u2019 and \u2018classification\u2019.\nFrom Table 6, we can see that \u2018education\u2019, \u2018school\nlibraries\u2019 and \u2018reading\u2019 first appear in 1912 in two\nworks by the librarian E Morris Miller (1912a,\n1912b), Libraries and Education and School\nLibraries and Reading . The phrase \u2018teacher-librarian\u2019\nfirst makes an appearance in 1951 in a work by Eli-\nzabeth Hill \u2013 \u2018Training of teacher-librarians in Aus-\ntralia: A report based mainly on information gathered\nat the one-day conference of school and teachers\u2019\ncollege librarians, held as an additional session of the\nconference of the Library Association of Australia in\nMelbourne\u2019. School library management first appears\nin the form of a 1978 guide produced for the Com-\nmonwealth Schools Commission, The SchoolLibrary: A Guide to Selection, Purchase and Manage-\nment of Resources (Bartle, 1978). It will be no sur-\nprise that the 1980s saw the first appearance of\ntechnology-based topics, including \u2018computer\u2019 and\n\u2018online\u2019. Information literacy does not make an\nappearance until 1999 in The Information Literate\nSchool Community 2: Issues of Leadership (Henri and\nBonnano, 1999). We can see from the initial coding\nthat these words and phrases are retained and recur in\nuse in subsequent decades.\nConclusion\nThis article has discussed the preliminary findings of\nan analysis of the KBANZSL corpus. This analysis\nprovides some initial evidence about the role of gov-\nernment interventions in professional activity. The\nevidence appears to suggest, not surprisingly, that the\ninterest and funding of governments in the sector is\nreflected in the number of publications and the pub-\nlication of various reports and projects. As the profes-\nsion increasingly came under pressure in the early\n2000, the number of publications with an emphasis\non advocacy, marketing and \u2018survival\u2019 increased. As\ngovernments become increasingly removed from the\nschool library agenda, professional bodies such as the\nAustralian Library and Information Association\nappear to become more active, not only in advocacy\nbut also in filling the vacuum left by the closure of\ngovernment-supported services. Change and the\nadaptability of the sector in adopting new ideas and\nemerging trends is also evident in the literature from\nthe earliest publications, and new ideas, concepts\nand technologies are reflected in the titles of works\nacross the decades . KBANZSL also reveals a much\nlonger history for school libraries in Australia and\nNew Zealand than convention has allowed, with\nliterature dating back to 1912. This may come as a\nsurprise to many both within and outside the sector.\nHowever, this professional genealogy is important in\nmaintaining the status of the profession in an increas-\ningly challenging environment. Such a historical per-\nspective provides evidence of an enduring\nprofessional foundation and set of values. Future\nresearch may include a deeper analysis of the corpus\nand a comparative analysis with the New Zealand\npublishing output. Such a comparative approach can\nidentify both the local pressures that shape the\nsector and the broader international agenda that influ-\nences education and librarianship in Australia and\nNew Zealand. As the corpus grows, some of these\nfindings may, of course, change as new works are\nrecorded and further older work is identified forTable 6.

Among the\nmany achievements of the ISRDS between 1968 and the beginning of the new century, this article focuses\nparticularly on the Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici (National Collective Archive of Periodicals), an\nonline public access catalogue specifica lly devoted to periodicals. Now that its founder and director, Paolo Bisogno,\nhas passed away and the ISRDS no longer exists, and even the headquarters have been converted to commercial\na n dp r i v a t eu s e ,i ti st i m et oa s kw h a ts h o u l db ed o n e ,w h at actions should be taken and what research should be\ncontinued in order to safeguard an important part of European documentation history.\nKeywords\nDocumentation, research and development, Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici, Paolo Bisogno, Italy\nResearch and development\nFor over 30 years, the Istituto di Studi sulla Ricerca e\nDocumentazione Scientifica (ISRDS; Institute for the\nStudy of Scientific Research and Documentation) was\nthe driving force behind important choices \u2013 techno-\nlogical, cultural and political \u2013 that affected not only\ndocumentation, but also the entire nation (Castellucci,\n2007). Founded in 1968 and directed by Paolo\nBisogno until his untimely death in 1999, the ISRDS\nwas part of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche\n(CNR; National Research Council), the leading public\nresearch organization in Italy, which celebrated\n100 years of activity in 2023.\nIt is difficult to keep track of the countless initia-\ntives carried out both collectively and by individual\nresearchers (in some years, the ISRDS counted more\nthan 50 people). Among the numerous activities,\nsome of the most important should be mentioned.\nWith regard to the more technologically advanced\nsector of documentation, the pioneering efforts of the\nISRDS in the promotion and dissemination of data-\nbases should be emphasized (Lazzari, 1982). Over the\nyears, many conferences and congresses, as well as\ncourses, were organized mainly for public research\ninstitutions at different levels; they were devoted to\ndifferent topics \u2013 from simple computer literacy to the\nadvanced use of information retrieval theories and\ntechniques, and what we now call information literacy(Fontanin, 2022). Relevant in this regard are the\ninitiatives that have borne fruit over time \u2013 for\ninstance, the collaboration with computer science\ndepartments that decisively favoured the strengthen-\ning of the digital libraries sector in Italy (Agosti,\n1986). The ISRDS\u2019s authority in the field was such\nthat, together with prestigious research institutions in\nthe technical and scientific field \u2013 in particular, the\nIstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (National Insti-\ntute for Nuclear Physics) and Ente Nazionale per\nl\u2019Energia Alternativa (now National Agency for New\nTechnologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic\nDevelopment) \u2013 it was among the co-founders of the\nfirst telematic network of Italian research institutes,\nGruppo per l\u2019Armonizzazione delle Reti di Ricerca\n(GARR; Group for the Harmonization of Research\nNetworks), at the beginning of the 1990s (Carosella,\n2010). The meaning concealed in the acronym GARR\nshould be emphasized \u2013 it could be interpreted as a\nmisspelling of gare (\u2018station\u2019 in French), as is often\nthe case in information technology vocabulary. At\nthat time, different disciplinary areas, both scientific\nand humanities, were willing to take the information\nCorresponding author:\nPaola Castellucci, Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, Sapienza\nUniversity of Rome, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Rome, Italy.\nEmail: paola.castellucci@uniroma1.itInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions\n\u00aaThe Author(s) 2024\nArticle reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nDOI: 10.1177/03400352241252925\njournals.sagepub.com/home/iflIFL A\n2024, Vol. 50(4) 780\u2013786\ntechnology train to build a network serving a new and\nwide territory.\nIn turn, contacts with highly innovative scientific\nand technical subject areas would bring the ISRDS to\nthe centre of national economic development policies.\nAs early as the late 1960s, fostering information tech-\nnology meant promoting Italy\u2019s increasingly solid\nposition among the top industrialized countries of the\nW e s t .I tw a sp r e c i s e l yw i t ht h i si nm i n dt h a tt h e\nISRDS and specifically its director, Paolo Bisogno,\nwere assigned prestigious tasks at both the national\nand international levels. The ISRDS was entrusted by\nthe Ministry of Scientific Research with the mandate\nof drawing up an annual report on the state of Italian\nresearch. At the international level, moreover,\nBisogno was for many years the Italian delegate\non the European Union Committee for Scientific\nResearch Funding (Castellucci, 2010).\nThe ISRDS therefore undertook tasks that were\nspecific both to the discipline of documentation and,\nin a broader sense, to research and development (R &\nD; Basili and Reale, 2003). This could be summed up\nin a sort of syllogism: there is no development if there\nis no research; there is no research if there is no doc-\numentation (Bisogno and Di Palma, 1974). Hence, the\ntwo keywords that appeared in the name of the\nISRDS \u2013 Documentation and Research \u2013 were in a\nrelationship of absolute interdependence. In fact, the\nacronym that identified the Institute contains the let-\nters \u2018R\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019, which, if in literal terms referred to\nResearch and Documenta tion, could also allude to\nR & D. And again, it is perhaps no coincidence that\nall the covers of Bisogno\u2019s books dedicated to both\ndocumentation and research policy were taken from\nworks by Maurits Cornelis Escher, representing inter-\ntwined and intersecting staircases, and interdependent\nconstructions (Bisogno, 1979). We could say that\nR & D and Research and Documentation are like\ndouble helixes (of the DNA of social well-being).\nWith regard to traditional lines of research in the\ndisciplinary area of documentation, it should be\nemphasized that it was the ISRDS that undertook\nthe translation of the Universal Decimal Classifica-\ntion (UDC) from French into Italian. The translation\nlasted many years. At the heart of this work was an\nexpert researcher, Maria Pia Carosella, who was bilin-\ngual and recently passed away, aged in her nineties.\nThe author of a manual that put librarianship and\ndocumentation in dialogue (Carosella and Valenti,\n1982), Carosella was a refined scholar who was atten-\ntive to both technological innovations and the most\nadvanced critical approaches, and particularly to\ninformation and communications technology and\ngender identity.In 1983, the ISRDS founded the learned\nAssociazione Italiana pe r la Documentazione Avan-\nzata (Italian Association for Advanced Documenta-\ntion). The adjective that q ualifies \u2018Documentation\u2019\nshould be highlighted \u2013 \u2018Advanced\u2019, meaning polit-\nically progressive and technologically innovative.\nThe Association has ceased its activities but its\njournal, AIDAinformazioni , is still active (Folino\nand Pasceri, 2017).\nThere have been countless collaborations between\nISRDS and IFLA, as well as with the International\nFederation for Information and Documentation and\nUNESCO (Paci, 1996). Documentation has always\npursued the idea of scientific research as an expression\nof teamwork \u2013 as a collaborative action. The creation\nof one of the first Italian online information retrieval\ntools \u2013 the Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici\n(ACNP; National Collective Archive of Periodicals) \u2013\nshould also be understood in this sense, as the result of\ncooperative work between libraries. The ACNP is now\nconsidered, to all intents and purposes, a reliable online\ncatalogue for the location of periodicals.1Originally,\nhowever, it did not start out as an online public access\ncatalogue but rather as the Italian version of Ulrich\u2019s\nPeriodicals Directory, which was established before\nthe Second World War at New York Public Library\nand initially distributed in print.\nSince the beginning of the 1970s, the ACNP has\nprovided a list of the periodicals available in libraries\nthroughout Italy. Only later was the ACNP enriched\nwith further fields, including the time span of sub-\nscriptions for each journal in each library. With these\nimportant improvements, the ACNP ultimately\nbecame an online catalogue, preceding even the most\nimportant Italian online public access catalogue, the\nServizio Bibliotecario Nazionale (National Librarian\nService; Vinay, 1986). The National Librarian Ser-\nvice was launched online only in 1997; its significant\ndelay was mainly due to the late implementation of\nthe Internet in Italy. The public telematics network\nRete italiana commutazione di pacchetti (ITAPAC)\n(meaning \u2018Italian packets of data transmission\u2019) was\nimplemented in an experimental form in 1984, and\nhas only been operating since 1986 in a stable manner.\nLet us consider the name Archivio Collettivo\nNazionale dei Periodici. The choice of the term\n\u2018archive\u2019 \u2013 not specific but authoritative \u2013 was a wise\none. In the Italy of the 1970s, words such as \u2018direc-\ntory\u2019 and \u2018database\u2019 were not immediately recogniz-\nable. This was not only because they were English\nwords, but above all because the use of information\ntechnology was limited to only very highly specia-\nlized sectors. The ISRDS was one of the few users,\nbut it is in the spirit of documentation not to benefit781 Castellucci: Research and documentation in Italy at the dawn of the digital age\nexclusively from elitist knowledge \u2013 hence the need\nto find a name that would be intelligible. The word\n\u2018archive\u2019, in a broad sense, was the preferred choice\nto convey the new concept.\nIt is always difficult to find suitable names to\nrepresent completely new realities. What is needed is\na creative act \u2013 a name that allows one to imagine, to\npicture, what nobody has ever seen in reality. The first\nopen access repository in history would also make the\nsame terminological choice (Castellucci, 2017). In\n1991, when Paul Ginsparg created arXiv, the misspell-\ning of \u2018archive\u2019 was chosen as a name that would evoke\nthe ancient and trustworthy institution of memory and\ncitizenship. However, when the rapid spread of the\nWorld Wide Web made online services such as public\naccess catalogues, directories and search engines more\nfamiliar in Italy, the original word \u2018archive\u2019 could have\nled to misunderstandings: it could, for instance, have\nalluded to a digital library with full-text documents.\nThis endeavour was necessary given the poor tech-\nnological context and significant cultural resistance at\nthe time. Bisogno was aware that it was necessary to\nstart with concrete results in order to gain consensus.\nAs Suzanne Briet had already stated in 1951, rather\nthan chasing dreams or building on clouds (which is\nhow Briet referred to Paul Otlet\u2019s Universal Biblio-\ngraphic Repertory), it was better to propose a detailed\nnational catalogue. In pursuit of these objectives and\nwith a solid disciplinary tradition behind it, the ACNP\nwas thus born. It was started in collaboration with a\nsmall number of university and research libraries in\nRome and gradually extended to other areas and the\nwhole of Italy. The continuous work of updating data\ntook place in synergy with the Centro Nazionale Uni-\nversitario di Calcolo Elettronico (National University\nCentre for Electronic Computing) in Pisa, one of the\nmain driving forces behind information technology in\nItaly. Data was recorded on tapes and archived in the\nCentre\u2019s server (Castellucci, 2022).\nThe implementation of the ACNP required consid-\nerable human and scientific skills. First of all, coop-\neration was needed to coordinate the numerous\nresearch groups and libraries, and to make scientific\nand technical training interact with humanistic cul-\nture. Tradition had to cope with global perspectives,\nand pure and applied research shared a common lan-\nguage. Merely by referring to the example of the\nACNP, we can see how documentation in Italy has\npromoted an advanced vision of the library world,\nwith full awareness of the scientific, cultural, political\nand social context. A large part of its success was due\nto the ISRDS, directed with great vision by Bisogno.\nThanks to his frequent travels and research periods in\nthe USA (e.g. at the Mass achusetts Institute ofTechnology in the late 1960s), Bisogno was able to\nexperience the new world already active overseas,\nwhich was certainly more advanced both technologi-\ncally and epistemologically. Like the founding fathers\nof documentation, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine,\nBisogno, with his legal training and political vocation,\nplaced it at the centre of the research ecosystem, with\nthe aim of supporting social welfare. As the author\nofTeoria della documentazione (Documentation\nTheory ; Bisogno, 1980) and Introduzione alla politica\ndella scienza (Introduction to the Politics of Science ;\nBisogno, 1979), and co-author of Ricerca scientifica e\nbisogni umani (Scientific Research and Human\nNeeds ; Bisogno and Forti, 1978), Bisogno promoted\nboth technological innovation and social justice. Per-\nhaps it is no coincidence that in 1968 \u2013 the very year\nBisogno founded the ISRDS \u2013 a seminal book was\ntranslated into Italian: Culture and Society 1780\u2013\n1950 , by Raymond Williams. This book, written over\n10 years before the Italian translation, offered an\naccurate interpretation of the spirit of the times: tech-\nnology was culture and, at the same time, politics, and\nits purpose was widespread welfare (Williams, 1968).\nIt is not by chance, then, that the ISRDS was\nparticularly interested in \u2018problem-oriented\u2019 online\ndatabases (e.g. on cancer research, AIDS or environ-\nmental protection). The research approach that was\nalways followed by the IRSDS moved far beyond\ntraditional librarianship interests. The ISRDS consid-\nered the library as the hub for the dissemination of\nknowledge and awareness, as Ranganathan (2006)\nstated with unparalleled prescience in the 1970s. If\nwe now find no ideological fences between the world\nand the world of libraries, during the period of the\nISRDS, many of the documentation research projects\nin Italy might appear unorthodox, even for the field\nof library and information science. For some years\nnow, so-called \u2018critical librarianship\u2019 has been gain-\ning ground in Italy (Guerrini, 2023). However, docu-\nmentation has always been \u2018critical\u2019 (Castellucci,\n2013). Documentation has always set itself the ambi-\ntious goal of not only cataloguing the world, but also\nregenerating it (Wright, 2014). This is why documen-\ntation has always strived to design future worlds: cit-\nies of peace, as imagined by politicians (Guarasci,\n2017); ideal cities, as outlined by philosophers (Tega,\n2017); and cities that are technologically as efficient\nas machines, as thought of by urban planners (Monte\nand Ludovici, 2022). In the disciplinary tradition of\ndocumentation, the world has always been at the cen-\ntre. And at the centre of the world is the Mundaneum \u2013\nthat is, libraries, archives and museums. As in\nEscher\u2019s drawings, which were so loved by Bisogno,782 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nthe whole belongs to the part and the particular\nencompasses the context.\nReconstructing documentation (R & D)\nEven at the dawn of the digital age, in the advanced\nworld of the ISRDS there was a Mac on every table,\ncomputer courses, connection to databases, and a\nstrongly interdisciplinary approach to research. In the\n1980s, documentation was acting as a spur to move\n\u2018horses at a gallop\u2019, to quote Suzanne Briet again\n(Castellucci and Mori, 2022:). Even now, in 2024,\ndocumentation is a small and \u2018advanced\u2019 disciplinary\narea. There are only two university courses entitled\n\u2018Documentation\u2019. It is e xtremely important to\nempower this disciplinary area and, to this aim, the\nfirst thing to do is reappropriate its own history, reaf-\nfirming the values that determined the foundation of\nthe discipline of documentation: R & D and social\nequity in an advanced world.\nReconstructing the history of documentation in\nItaly is not, however, an easy task, not least because\nof material factors. As was the case with the Munda-\nneum, something similar happened to the ISRDS,\nbecause of dispersion, dissemination and dissipation.\nNot only did Bisogno die prematurely in 1999 and not\nonly was the Institute closed apparently because of\nproblems of economic sustainability (or perhaps\nbecause there was no longer a director capable of\nholding together so many threads, so many lines of\nresearch). We also have to consider that even the\nbuilding that housed it no longer exists: it was torn\ndown (something that is rare in Italy and especially in\nRome). It is therefore very difficult to reconstruct\nboth the library catalogue and the archive.\nThe ISRDS headquarters were located in Via\nCesare de Lollis in Rome. The street bordered one\nof the sides of Sapienza University and was only a\nfew metres away from the CNR headquarters. In\nitself, the spatial location offered not only favourable\nconditions from a purely logistical point of view; if\nanything, it made the existing network of relations\nmaterially evident. A virtuous triangle, a magnetic\nfield, had been created between the ISRDS, the CNR\nand Sapienza University, where Bisogno was teaching\ndocumentation at the Scuola Speciale per Archivisti e\nBibliotecari (Special School for Archivists and\nLibrarians). The ISRDS was therefore located within\na series of cultural and material concentric circles.\nOn the same street, a few metres away, was the\nCasa dello Student (the accommodation for out-of-\ntowners, assigned mainly to low-income students\nmostly from the south), the Ufficio per il Diritto allo\nStudio (Office for the Right to Education) and thestudent refectory. Going down Via de Lollis, there\nis one of Rome\u2019s most beautiful basilicas, San Lor-\nenzo, which gives its name to the district, and behind\nthe basilica is the Monumental Cemetery of Verano.\nThe ISRDS\u2013CNR\u2013University triangle was thus inserted\nin the San Lorenzo district and took its feelings and sap\nfrom that place. It was the only neighbourhood in Rome\nthat was bombed during the Second World War, perhaps\nby mistake, the real target probably being the nearby\nrailway station, Termini. San Lorenzo was always, and\nstill is, a working-class and student district, a place of\ndemonstrations and even clashes, especially during the\n1970s, and it has been ravaged by terrorism. It is a\ndistrict with drug and crime problems, but also a place\nwhere there are many trade-union headquarters, free\nradio stations, cultural, artistic and political clubs, craft\nshops, workshops, artists\u2019 studios, small food industries,\nbookshops and libraries, tailors, repair shops, carpenters\nand even stonemasons, due to the proximity of the cem-\netery; there are also small traditional diners, pizzerias,\npastry shops, bars and cinemas \u2013 places of encounter, of\nexchange and of mutual enrichment. A mural (by the\nartists Napal, Brus, Brek e Ade), which was recently\npainted in front of the former ISRDS building, honours\nthe years of struggle and hope, marches and sharing\nbetween students and workers.\nThe mingling of research and development, R & D,\nwas thus evident in the materiality of the locations:\nthe ISRDS, the CNR and Sapienza University (the\nuniversity with the largest number of students in Eur-\nope, which is top of the Italian quality rankings) were\nall within the San Lorenzo district, with its strong\nproletarian identity. Even the building that housed the\nISRDS was divided as follows: the first five floors\nhoused the Ispettorato del Lavoro (Employment\nInspectorate Office) and the other three the ISRDS.\nThis was not by coincidence. Back then, work and\nresearch were sharing spaces and ideals, and both\nwere aiming at R & D, riding in the same (social) lift.\nEven in the early 1990s, it was an everyday experi-\nence: some entered that door in Via de Lollis to do\nresearch in the field of documentation in the IRSDS;\nothers entered it to follow the progress of their docu-\nmentation to obtain a work permit at the Ispettorato\ndel Lavoro. Long queues of workers \u2013 mainly Polish,\nRomanians, Albanians, Africans and Filipinos, who\nhad landed in Rome amidst the storms of a rapidly\nchanging world \u2013 and a few researchers of documen-\ntation entered the same door. It allegorically appeared\nthe impossibility of separating the world and the\nMundaneum, documents and documentation, R & D.\nThat world seems to have disappeared now.\nBisogno passed away prematurely in 1999; the ISRDS\nceased its activities in 2003; and even the building783 Castellucci: Research and documentation in Italy at the dawn of the digital age\nwhere it was based was torn down a few years ago. In\nits place, a luxury hotel was opened in 2021. Travel-\nlers from all over the world select that hotel using\nbooking sites. They may arrive at Termini train sta-\ntion or Fiumicino Leonardo da Vinci airport, reser-\nving a taxi through an app. They will certainly not\nimagine that many years before there was in its place\nthe ISRDS, one of the first \u2018wired\u2019 buildings in Italy.\nIn that very place, researchers used online databases,\nBoolean operators and online public access catalo-\ngues (Basili and Pettenati, 1994). And this was hap-\npening at the very beginning of the Internet age, 20,\n30 years before Google. It is difficult to escape an\nelegy or even a jeremiad. The \u2018ghost building\u2019 on\nwhich this sort of \u2018overlook hotel\u2019 has been built\n\u2018overlooks\u2019 Sapienza University, the CNR, San Lor-\nenzo and the Verano cemetery. But there is no longer\nany dialogue between the building and the neighbour-\nhood, between research and development. It is time\nnow for some more R & D instead of gentrification\nand privatization. To this end, it is extremely impor-\ntant to tell this story. We need historical and critical\nawareness (Bryant et al., 2013); we need critical\nlibrarianship; we need more and more R & D; and\nwe certainly still need documentation (Capaccioni\nand Ranfa, 2023). In telling the story of documenta-\ntion in Italy, it will be necessary to identify some key\nmoments that are worthy of further investigation. The\nlines of research proper to documentation have been\nexpressed in Italy since the first IFLA conference in\n1929 in Rome (Guerrini and Speciale, 2012). Among\nothers, both Paul Otlet and Suzanne Briet presented a\npaper. The Italian reaction was not lacking in critical\nnotes (Petrucciani, 2013). Then, the development of\nthe discipline within the CNR will have to be consid-\nered too. An in-depth study will require the history of\nthe ISRDS, as far as it can be guessed at. And again, it\nwill be necessary to analyse the spread of the teaching\nof documentation in Italian universities.\nOnly two university courses are explicitly titled\n\u2018Documentation\u2019 in Italy \u2013 one at Sapienza University\nof Rome and one at the University of Calabria \u2013 in\nboth cases in continuity with the magisterium of Paolo\nBisogno (Guarasci, 2023). Documentation is part of\nthe \u2018Historical Disciplines\u2019 and therefore labelled\nMSTO/08 (with MSTO standing for Materie Stor-\niche). The disciplinary area currently includes 89\nscholars in Italian universities. Many of them \u2013 and\nespecially those involved in contemporary history\nresearch \u2013 have continued the dictate of documenta-\ntion, albeit under other names. This is the case, for\nexample, with many among those who teach digital\nhumanities or who deal with information literacy or\ndigital libraries (Tammaro, 2005). Unlike otherEuropean countries \u2013 particularly Spain \u2013 in Italy the\nname \u2018documentation\u2019 was soon betrayed, welcoming\ntitling of the discipline in English (S\u00b4 anchez-Molero,\n2021). Conversely, keeping the name \u2018documenta-\ntion\u2019 could be a way to emphasize continuity with the\nEuropean disciplinary tradition (Lor, 2019; Rayward,\n2008). This is not chauvinism; it is just respect for our\nhistory. The Societ` a Italiana di Scienze Bibliografiche\ne Biblioteconomiche (Italian Society of Bibliographic\nand Library Science) has undertaken research along\nthese lines, with the aim of sketching a more accurate\npicture of the history of learned societies in the dis-\nciplinary area both in Italy and in Spain (Carpallo\nBautista and Mart\u00b4 \u0131nez Cardama, 2021).\nOther possible action and research lies ahead: it\nwill certainly be crucial to recover (or at least virtu-\nally reconstruct) the archives of the ISRDS and also\nthe private archive of its director, Paolo Bisogno. The\nrecovery of the catalogue of the rich and multidisci-\nplinary ISRDS Library could also give rise to many\ninteresting results. This is, as is evident, a historical\nresearch approach, not on ly to give recognition to\ndocumentation, but also to offer a historical back-\nground to digital humanities in all its different\nresearch approaches.\nWe can conclude by saying that the whole area of\ndocumentation must be rebuilt, starting precisely with\nhistorical research. We have to, metaphorically, put the\nbuilding that hosted the ISRDS back up \u2013 that is, rebuild\nthe cohesion between research and development,\nbetween research and documentation, and between doc-\numentation and R & D, just as it was in the beginning,\nwhen Paolo Bisogno, in the late 1970s at the dawn of the\ndigital age, wrote about documentation theory and, con-\ntextually, about research policy and human needs. At\ntimes, research and development have to coexist in the\ndisciplinary area of documentation.\nAcknowledgements\nWith warmest thanks to my tutor and PhD student Matilde\nFontanin.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of\nthis article.\nFunding\nThe author received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nPaola Castellucci https://orcid.org /0000-0002-5191-\n5345784 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nNote\n1.

It describes the historical\ncontext and the \ufb01rst\ufb01ndings, underlining the equal status of all formats of documents as substitutes of lived\nexperience, from material objects to oral history sources. The study was prompted by a research visit to\nBletchley Park Museum in 2021. The story of this library, in the middle of wartime secrets, constitutes a\ncase of library history and a pretext to re \ufb02ect on the identity of the professions of librarians and other infor-\nmation workers, and their position in the larger history of computing and information science.\nKeywords\nBletchley Park library, oral history, librarians, libraries in the Second World War, library history, history of\ninformation science, documentation\nIntroduction\nThe purpose of this article is twofold. The main, tan-gible goal is to tell the story of the reading library\nfor staff at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire (UK),between 1940 and 1946, when the estate was acentre for intelligence activities. The second goal is\nto re\ufb02ect on the role that librarians and other informa-\ntion workers play in preserving, collecting and man-\naging documents in multiple formats. Documents can\nbe used to narrate history, drawing the listener into\nthe stories of real people, thereby making historymore accessible and more actual. The Bletchley Park\nMuseum is an example of this approach.\nThe investigation was sparked by a visit to the\nmuseum during a research stay at the University ofOxford in 2021. A \u2018Library \u2019sign on a door and an\ninterpretation panel in the room raised the question of\nwhether there actually was a library at Bletchley Park.\nThe concrete facts that this article narrates\nregard the story of a library in wartime, in anenvironment bound by secrecy. The results were\ufb01rst shared at an IFLA satellite conference orga-\nnised by the Library History Special InterestGroup, where they were presented as a case oflibrary history, and an opportunity to re \ufb02ect on\nthe identity of the professions of librarians andother information workers.\n1This article discusses the research question and\nthe circumstances in which it emerged, how the\nresearch was conducted, and the \ufb01ndings. But\n\ufb01rst, it presents the historical context, providing\ninformation on libraries in wartime and a descrip-tion of what Bletchley Park was like at the time\nand what it is like today.\nLibraries in wartime\nIn modern wars, books and libraries are all butneglected; on the contrary, they are tools forpropaganda, directed at civilians and soldiersalike. The expressions of authoritarian regimes,\nsuch as Mussolini \u2019s Italy and Hitler \u2019sG e r m a n y ,\nstories of censorship and book burnings were\nused to increase motivation among the Allied\ntroops. Campaigns to collect books for soldiers\n(e.g. Books for Victory in the USA in 1942 \u2013\n1943) and the initiatives coordinated by the Lord\nMayor of London \u2019s service libraries and books\nfund had the side-effect of involving citizens in\nCorresponding author:\nMatilde Fontanin, University Library, University of T rieste,Biblioteca della sede di Gorizia, Via B.

The armed forces considered books\nas commodities to raise troops \u2019morale and serve\nas a pastime to alleviate anxiety and boredom,books were \u2018as popular as pin-up girls \u2019(Scutts,\n2014). For soldiers who were making plans forwhat jobs they would do after the war, books\nwere excellent tools to improve their education\nand learn new skills. From the First World War,in the US armed forces, \u2018camp libraries popped\nup everywhere at military bases \u2026all over\nEurope, stretching as far east as Siberia \u2019\n(Bennett, 2017) \u2013ac i r c u m s t a n c et h a tw a sm u c h\na d m i r e db yt h eL i b r a r yA s s o c i a t i o ni nB r i t a i n(Hung, 2008: 170).\nEnough literature has been devoted to these\ntopics to merit a separate piece of research (DeFranceschi, 2019; Manning, 2014; Monger, 2012;Ribeiro et al., 2019; Trautman, 1945), yet, to putthe library at Bletchley Park in perspective, a\nbrief overview is necessary. For the armed forces,\nbooks went under the heading of \u2018welfare \u2019;t h e y\nwere considered comforts, like cigarettes (Hung,\n2008: 169), therefore popular titles could be distrib-\nuted as well: \u2018\u201cunsuitable literature \u201dto the War\nOf\ufb01ce meant \u201cundesirable propaganda \u201d, not No\nOrchids for Miss Blandish \u2019(Hung, 2008: 174).\nBut the hierarchy of the Library Association at thetime believed that the purpose of books was educa-tional and informational, a way for students in\nuniform to keep up to date and for less educated sol-\ndiers to climb the social ladder (Hung, 2008). Thisled to litigation, as the Library Association was\nopposing to distributing to troops books that were\nconsidered trashy, vulgar or badly written (Hung,2008: 169). The Library Association lost,\nhowever, proving that it was out of touch with\nboth the seriousness of the international situationand the realities of military life. It was a demonstra-\ntion of paternalistic and cultural conservatism\n(Hung, 2008: 183).\nThere is no evidence that this litigation reached\nBletchley Park (after all, its secrecy disconnected\nthe site from the outside world), where the library\nwas \u2018recreational \u2019, like the club it stemmed from\n(described below). No information can be found\non the titles in the library, but since the staff at\nBletchley Park were generally well educated, evendeemed \u2018highbrow \u2019(McKay, 2011: 348), it seems\nless likely that low-quality literature was found onthe shelves. The presence of a library, however,con\ufb01rms that libraries were perceived as useful\neven in a warfare context. For its collections thelibrary took advantage of public book campaigns,although some funds were allocated as well.From the Bletchley Park estate to the\nBletchley Park Trust\nThe\ufb01lmThe Imitation Game (2014) made people\naround the world aware that, during the Second\nWorld War, an intelligence task force had operatedat Bletchley Park. The \ufb01lm was released in 2014,\nbut the veil of secrecy on the story of Bletchley Parkhad been lifted in 1974, with the publication ofFrederick W. Winterbotham \u2019s memoir The Ultra\nSecret (Winterbotham, 1974). The \ufb01lm, which was\nbased on Alan Turing: The Enigma (Hodges, 2014),\npopularised above all the \ufb01gure of the mathematician\nwho is considered to be the father of arti \ufb01cial intelli-\ngence.\n2Yet much more happened between 1939 and\n1946, when the Government Code and Cypher\nSchool moved its headquarters to this estate in\nBuckinghamshire in order to work on breaking thecodes of the enemy. \u2018Station X \u2019, as it was called,\nwas the centre of an intelligence network with many\noutstations, whose main task was to intercept and\nread the messages exchanged among the militaryforces of the Axis (Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan).\nAll messages converged there for decryption; not\njust the Enigma but also the Lorenz cipher machinewas broken into at Bletchley.\n3\nBletchley Park, 1938 to present\nIn May 1938, the then Chief of the Secret Intelligence\nService (SIS), Admiral Hugh Sinclair, purchased part\nof the vast Bletchley Park Victorian estate \u2018for the use\nof SIS and GCCS [Government Code and CypherSchool] should war break out \u2019(Bletchley Park Trust,\n2009: 2), aligning with numerous other London-based\ninstitutions and businesses in evacuating from urbanareas.\nThe location was ideal. Bletchley Park is almost equi-\ndistant (65 to 80 kilometres ) from Oxford, Cambridge\nand London, at a junction between academia and the\nsite of political power. It was conveniently connected\nvia rail, road and, above all, \u2018a major artery of [the] tele-\nphone network \u2019(Smith, 2015: 18). Milton Keynes, one\nof the New Towns, was only built in 1967; at the time ofthe Second World War, the area was countryside, pro-viding more safety against a ir attacks than the city of\nLondon. The estate offered plenty of accommodation:the mansion, some cottages and 60 acres of land,where new \u2018huts\u2019were soon built.\n4Much of the work\ntook place in these huts.\nThe Government Code and Cypher School moved\nto Bletchley Park in August 1939, under the lead ofAlistair Denniston, former de facto head of Room\n40, the Admiralty \u2019s cryptanalysis section. Due to the788 IFLA Journal 50(4)\ndownscaling of military expenditure after the\nArmistice,5at its foundation in 1919 the School\ncounted just 53 members of staff (Smith, 2015: 40).When it moved to Bletchley Park, this number hadrisen to around 200 (Smith, 2015: 61). New analystswere recruited from academia \u2013not only mathemati-\ncians, physicists and other scientists, but also linguists,anthropologists, historians and classicists. In otherwords, the work carried out at Bletchley Park was\nthe fruit of an interdisciplinary effort by the \u2018products\nof Britain \u2019s ancient universities \u2019, with the predomin-\nance of King \u2019s College, Cambridge (Smith, 2015:\n45), Alan Turing \u2019s alma mater.\nApart from academics, there was an ever-increasing\nneed for clerical staff. As the community grew, allkinds of positions opened up \u2013for cooks, drivers and\nmechanics, for example. All staff had signed the\nOf\ufb01cial Secrets Act on entering service \u2013a commitment\nnot to share details of their work with anyone, not eventheir families. The number of staff was growing quickly,especially after Winston Churchill issued in his \u2018Action\nThis Day \u2019the order that at Bletchley Park they be given\nanything they asked for.\n6As an example, Wrens\n(members of the Women \u2019s Royal Naval Service) were\nhired to operate the Bombe machines. At their peak, in\nthe winter of 1944 \u20131945, they numbered 2546.\nAs Bletchley Park was growing into an information\nfactory, effective organisational and managerial skillswere needed to deal with the vast amount of messages\nthat were received, decrypted, evaluated and sent oneach day, as well as the volume of information that\nh a dt ob e \ufb01led away. It was for this reason that, in\nFebruary 1942, Commande r Edward Travis replaced\nCommander Alistair Denniston as head of theGovernment Code and Cypher School at Bletchley\nPark (Smith, 2015: 34).\nTable 1 displays \ufb01gures collected from the digital\nexhibition at Bletchley Park Museum.

Interestingly,\nwomen made up almost 80% of the staff, although thispercentage was different in the top positions.\nFigure 1, offered by Christopher Smith (2015: 64),\nhighlights the trends in the number of staff and genderdistribution before and after the peak point inDecember 1944.\nThe mansion and its grounds were too small for\n9000 people. The \ufb01rst to arrive had stayed at the\nmansion and local inns.\n7Later, many were billeted\nin private houses and army staff lodged in temporarybarracks that were built in the countryside outsidethe boundaries of the Bletchley Park Estate.\n8Staff\nwere working round the clock, therefore a system oftransportation had to be organised to meet their needs.\nMaybe because of the large number of civilians, the\natmosphere at Bletchley Park was informal: there was\nno military saluting and, although nobody spoke about\ntheir work outside their unit, staff could chat withanybody else in the caf\u00e9, regardless of their rank\n(Thirsk, 2014).\nThe number of staff decreased rapidly after the end\nof the War (Figure 1) and, in 1946, the GovernmentCode and Cypher School became the Government\nCommunications Headquarters and relocated toBletchley Park \u2019s old outstation of Eastcote in North\nLondon (Smith, 2015: 158). Even after they returned\nto their everyday lives, they were, in the words of\nWinston Churchill, like \u2018the geese who laid the\ngolden egg and never cackled \u2019(Hill, 2004: 7): they\nkept the secret until the publication of The Ultra\nSecret (Winterbotham, 1974), almost 30 years after\nthe end of their service at Bletchley Park.\nOn its departure, the Government Code and Cypher\nSchool stripped the buildings and grounds of any evi-dence of the work that had been carried out there.\nLater, the mansion was put to various uses, until, in\n1991, it was at risk of demolition to make way for aprospective estate development. Before it was demol-ished, however, on 21 October 1991, the Bletchley\nArchaeological and Historical Society organised a\nfarewell party, where over 400 veterans told theirstories. The episode sparked a desire to try and save\nthe site and its memories. The Bletchley Park Trust\nwas founded on 13 February 1992, just after MiltonKeynes Borough Council had declared most of the\npark a conservation area. The site was \ufb01rst opened\nto visitors in 1993; the museum opened of \ufb01cially in\nJuly 1994. On 10 June 1999, a deal secured thefuture of Bletchley Park in the hands of the Trust,\nwith an initial 250-year lease (Bletchley Park Trust,2009).Today, Bletchley Park is a vibrant museum, offer-\ning an immersive experience thanks to the diversity\nof items on display (from printed documents and\nobjects of the time to Enigma machines, suitcases,clothes, and so on) and interactive installations thatenable learning by doing. The sensory experience\nturns the museum into a sort of time machine, where\nthe narration is set up not just for the historian. In aneffort to popularise the history of science, the\nmuseum has facilities that are aimed at families, in\naddition to dedicated learning paths, such as theTeddy Bear Track and other child-focused initiatives.\n9\nAs well as curating the exhibition, organising themuseum and popularising history and science, theTrust fosters research: the memories it has collected\nfrom veterans through its Oral History Project are\npart of the exhibition and comprise the Roll ofHonour. The symbolic importance of the site was con-\ufb01rmed when, on 1 \u20132 November 2023, it hosted the\nworld \u2019s\ufb01rst Arti \ufb01cial Intelligence Safety Summit.\nThe Oral History Project and Roll of\nHonour\nThe Oral History Project has been running since 2011.\nBy 2021, volunteers and staff had interviewed more\nthan 450 veterans and listed the details of thewartime service of over 13,000 veterans. An Oral\nHistory Of \ufb01cer runs the project, leading a team of\nvolunteers who collect veterans \u2019stories from across\nthe UK. The recorded interviews are then transcribed,rigorously checked and attached to individuals \u2019entries\nin the Roll of Honour.\nAt Bletchley Park, there was no uni \ufb01ed directory of\nstaff, who came from different sectors (the Army, theNavy, the Government Code and Cypher School and\nthe Foreign Of \ufb01ce, among others). Records were\nonly kept by the armed forces and are held today at\nthe National Archives in London. They are the\nsource of about half the names in the Roll ofHonour. As most of the records regarding civilians\nwere destroyed, \u2018the most informative source is the\nveterans themselves \u2019\n10or their families.\nThe main goal of the Roll of Honour is\nto list all those who worked in signals intelligence for the\nUnited Kingdom and Commonwealth countries during\nthe Second World War \u2026it does not list those who\nserved in SIS/MI6 (apart from the very small number\nwho were at Bletchley Park), SOE [Special Operations\nExecutive], MI5 or other intelligence activities separatefrom signals intelligence. (Bletchley Park, n.d.a)\n11790 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nThe Roll of Honour is both a catalogue and a digital\ncollection; it is a database of staff, offering direct\naccess to materials (audio interviews, transcripts,\nobituaries, etc.). It can be searched by surname;service, rank or grade; gender; building, section orlocation; keywords (including \ufb01rst names). The\nrecords can be \ufb01ltered by the presence of a transcript.\nTypical individual records are populated with asummary of service (start, end, position held), educa-\ntion (e.g. the university they attended, if any). Further\ninformation may include the name of their partner (incase the latter was at Bletchley Park as well), particu-\nlar individual skills (Hugh Alexander was a champion\nchess player, for example) and external references(e.g. to obituaries).\nWas there a reading library at Bletchley\nPark?\nAs hinted at earlier, the question \u2018Was there a reading\nlibrary at Bletchley Park? \u2019was prompted by a visit to\nBletchley Park Museum, but the Roll of Honour and\nOral History Project were crucial in conducting the\nensuing research. The literature on Bletchley Park is\nrich, but, understandably, little attention has been paidto the existence of a reading library, which wouldhave been used by Bletchley Park staff in their free\ntime. This research found evidence of such with the\nhelp of staff at Bletchley Park Trust, who answeredgeneral enquiries and redirected questions to the Head\nof Programmes and later the of \ufb01c e ri nc h a r g eo ft h e\nOral History Project. They both shared digitised mate-\nrials and evidence from the archival records, and\npointed to relevant interviews in the Roll of Honour.\nAs mentioned above, the exhibition is based on\ndocumentation and artefacts of the time, which are\nused to reconstruct a credible version of the\nBletchley Park mansion and huts. They include all\nsorts of materials: Enigma machines; lea \ufb02ets explain-\ning how to use gas masks or how to screen windows in\nthe event of an air attack; wartime ration books with\nfood coupons; posters reminding that \u2018The Enemy \u2019s\nListening \u2019; desks and typewriters, and the like.\nMany of the rooms in the mansion and huts are furn-ished to give the impression that staff have just left. InTuring \u2019so f\ufb01ce, a pair of white canvas running shoes is\non display in a cabinet.\n12Physical recreations of\nobjects of the time are there to be touched, alongwith interactive digital tools so that one can learnabout \u2018cribs \u2019or\u2018banburism \u2019(different strategies for\nthe process of codebreaking), and there are holograms,giving the impression of the presence of people in therooms. The use of documents as \u2018substitutes of lived\nexperience \u2019(Briet, 1951: 7, 2006: 31; Briet etal., 2022: 122) makes history come alive.Documents have the power to break down History\n(with capital \u2018H\u2019) into the stories of real\n\ufb02esh-and-blood people. The overall impression is\nreinforced by the results of the Oral History Project,\nwhich are showcased in the \u2018Veterans \u2019Stories \u2019exhib-\nition. The environment sparks curiosity.\nThe library at Bletchley Park\nThere is a room in the mansion with a \u2018Library \u2019sign on\nthe door and lots of books on the shelves. The researchquestion started there: did a library actually exist, toserve the individual needs of those who lived and\nworked at Bletchley Park? The room looks more like\nan intelligence of \ufb01ce, and the ensuing correspondence\nwith Bletchley Park Trust con \ufb01rmed that the books\non the shelves are fakes, recreated on the basis of photo-graphs taken in 1940, because when the GovernmentCode and Cypher School left Bletchley Park no originalfurniture or items were left behind.\n13\nThe\ufb01rst piece of information comes from the inter-\npretation panels in the room itself: the sign on the doorrefers to the library of the original owner of the Estate,\nSir Herbert Leon, built in 1906. After 1938, the room\nwas initially used by the German and Italian naval sub-sections, but it was too small. As soon as Hut 4 was\nbuilt, in autumn 1941, the German section was\nmoved out. Later in the war, the room would be occu-pied by the typing section.\nIn the room today, another panel reads:\nDid you know?\nDuring the war Bletchley Park operated a library entirely\nset up and run by a handful of dedicated staff.\n\u2018With several other librarians whom I knew, we helped\nto organise a recreational library open to anybody\nworking at Bletchley Park \u2026our library operated in a\nground \ufb02oor room in the mansion although I can \u2019t\nremember which one \u2019.\nJames Thirsk, Hut 6 Traf \ufb01c Analyst (SIXTA)\nJames Thirsk is the \ufb01rst and main witness of this\nstory. As a civilian, he had been a librarian in public\nlibraries. When the war broke out, he enlisted in the\nRoyal Artillery. Being a librarian in \ufb02uenced his\narmy career. In fact, he was offered certain tasksbecause he was presumed to be pro \ufb01cient in organis-\ning information \u2013a fact that also determined his\nadmission to the Intelligence Corps. He was 28when, in 1942, he arrived at Bletchley Park; he died\nin 2018 at the age of 104. His formidable memoryFontanin: A narrative on the codebreakers \u2019library at Bletchley Park 791\nallowed him to write a memoir (Thirsk, 2008) and give\ninterviews (Smith, 2015; Thirsk, 2014). According to\nthe Roll of Honour, James Thirsk was at Bletchley\nPark between May 1942 and 10 January 1944. Hewas later transferred to Shenley Camp, where heestablished another library. But what about the\nlibrary before his arrival and after his departure?\nAnd why did he de \ufb01ne it as \u2018recreational \u2019?\nFurther evidence shows that the library was but one\nof many activities offered by Bletchley ParkRecreational Club, which was originally housed inHut 2.\n14The latter had been constructed in 1939 spe-\nci\ufb01cally for the welfare of Bletchley Park staff and ini-\ntially served as a tea room, providing hot beverages,sandwiches and lunch vouchers.\nSince the staff at Bletchley Park had practically\nabandoned their lives on the outside and workedlong hours, the recreational club, which offeredmany leisure activities, was an immediate success: it\nhad 50 subscribing members by November 1940 and\n340 by January 1941, which, at that time, wasalmost half the total number of staff (McKay, 2011;\nevidence and data from Smith, 2015: 126 \u2013127). Yet,\nrunning the club was very time-consuming, especially\nconsidering that it added to staff \u2019s already heavy\nworkload. For example, collecting the fees was a chal-lenge. When both the \ufb01rst treasurer and secretary\nresigned, \u2018the wife of a staff member was recruited\non a voluntary basis \u2019(Smith, 2015: 127). The latter\nmay have been Mrs Diana Marchant, who, accordingto the Roll of Honour, was secretary of the BletchleyPark Recreational Club. But there was also Mrs\nMary Primrose Vivian, who ran the lending library\nin Hut 2 (Smith, 2015: 126). Mrs Vivian was thewelfare of \ufb01cer and wife of the deputy director of\nMI6, Colonel Valentine Vivian. She and herhusband lodged at the mansion. When SIS/MI6 leftBletchley Park in May 1942, the rooms they vacated\nwere occupied by the library and the club.\nThe library was most likely run by Mrs Vivian in\nHut 2 until April 1942. James Thirsk arrived in May\n1942 and was involved in the library when it was\nlocated in one of the ground- \ufb02oor rooms in the\nmansion. The question is: who came in after January\n1944, when Thirsk left for Shenley Road Camp?\nThere might have been someone else in between, yet\nthe next attested name is that of Mrs Edna Owen (Rose,1944). She might have been working jointly with James\nThirsk, who, after all, mentions \u2018several other librar-\nians\u2019. According to the Roll of Honour, Mrs Owen\nwas a Foreign Of \ufb01ce civilian and librarian of\nBletchley Park Recreational Club \u2013a piece of informa-\ntion that is con \ufb01rmed by an unpublished club lea \ufb02et\n(Rose, 1944), which also describes the whole rangeof club activities.\n15Subscription was 1 shilling per\nmonth or 10 shillings per year; the secretary and treas-urer was Mrs MA Rose, who could \u2018usually be found in\nthe Club Room from 9 to 5 each day \u2019(Rose, 1944),\nindicating that the club secretary \u2019s position at the time\nmay have been full-time.\nThe lea \ufb02et describes the library as follows:\nLibrary . Librarian, Mrs. OWEN. In the Outer Club\nRoom, open daily from 1.00 to 4.30. 1500 books.\n1200 permanent stock and 300 from the Times\nLibrary, some of which are changed every week. Onebook may be taken out for a fortnight at a time. Fines\n6d. [6 shillings] per week. The Librarian will be\npleased to take \u2018book lists \u2019and will make every endeav-\nour to procure readers \u2019requests. (Rose, 1944)\nThese opening hours correspond roughly to\nThirsk \u2019s (2008) recollection that the library was\nopen \u2018mainly at lunch times \u2019(25). He wrote that\nthey \u2018took turns manning the library \u2026helped by\nsome civilian women \u2019(25). Thirsk gives the impres-\nsion that he started the library from scratch when he\nsays that \u2018with several other librarians whom I\nknew, we helped to organize a recreational library\nopen to anybody working at Bletchley Park \u2019(25).\nHe recalls where the library stock came from: \u2018We\nobtained stocks of books from a central body inLondon, which encouraged the public to give theirunwanted books for the bene \ufb01t of the forces by drop-\nping them into a sack in any post of \ufb01ce\u2019(25). Yet there\nis no reason to rule out that the lea \ufb02et and Thirsk refer\nto the same library, run collaboratively, although the\nlea\ufb02et describes a structured service: precise informa-\ntion is given on the number of books, the duration of\nloans and the \ufb01nes incurred. Moreover, the librarian\nvolunteers to \u2018procure readers \u2019requests \u2019. The lea \ufb02et\nbears no date and the timeline is therefore dif \ufb01cult to\ncompare with Thirsk \u2019s experience, yet it de \ufb01nitely cir-\nculated between August and October 1944; in fact, the\nRoll of Honour states that Mrs Owen remained at\nBletchley Park until October 1944, and this individuallea\ufb02et was signed by its owner, Rosalind Latham, a\nWren, who arrived at Bletchley Park in August 1944and left in May 1945 (Bletchley Park, n.d.a). Itmight have been issued earlier, but it de \ufb01nitely circu-\nlated between August and October 1944.\nA1944 Review (Government Code and Cypher\nSchool, 1944) states that the library was not \u2018able to\nmeet the increased demand \u2019for a variety of reasons\n\u2013the main being that many readers failed to return\ntheir books on leaving Bletchley Park. Therefore, \u2018a\nsub-committee containing experts \u2019(Government\nCode and Cypher School, 1944) was put in direct792 IFLA Journal 50(4)\ncontrol of the library and recommended that the\nsystem of part-time librarians be changed and one\nregular librarian be put in charge. At the same time,\nmore books were purchased and new shelves installed(Government Code and Cypher School, 1945).\n16\nIt appears that this policy paid off, as the 1945\nReview (Government Code and Cypher School, 1945)\nstates that the library is \u2018in very good shape \u2019,b o t h\nthanks to \u2018a constant stream of new books \u2019and the\npayment of a deposit of 5 shillings by librarymembers to replace losses. The name of the new full-time librarian is not shared, but in the 1945 Review\n(Government Code and Cypher School, 1945) it ismentioned that the committee had to accept ( \u2018with\nregret \u2019) the resignation of a Mrs Spear. Unfortunately,\nshe is not listed in the Roll of Honour or any othersource consulted to date. After Mrs Spear \u2019s departure,\u2018despite the apparent impossibility of \ufb01nding a perman-\nent successor, the library \u2026continued to function \u2019\n(Government Code and Cypher School, 1945), indicat-ing that the emphasis was not on the services of a quali-\ufb01ed librarian but on lending services and access to\nitems in the collection.\nThe library would continue to operate until the\nGovernment Code and Cypher School \u2019s move to\nEastcote. On 16 March 1946, it was announced that\nthe Bletchley Park Recreational Club would be dis-\nsolved as from 1 April 1946, \u2018and all books should\nbe returned to the Librarian on or before that date.\nThe issue of library books will cease on Monday,\n25th March, 1946 \u2019. Moreover, \u2018refunds of library\ndeposits will not be made after 29th March and it is\npointed out that neither deposits nor books are trans-\nferable to any library which may be opened at\nTable 2.

In a nutshell, until the end, the library was\npart of the Bletchley Park Recreational Club, which\nwas dissolved at the end of the Bletchley Parkoperations.\nTable 2 summarises the evidence presented to this\npoint, including where the library was located, whoran it and how.\nLibraries were welcomed and needed. There was\nalso a library at Shenley Road Camp, as mentionedabove. In his memoir, Thirsk (2008) says that he \u2018and\nseveral fellow-librarians helped to run \u2019(80) it; it was\n\u2018well stocked with books \u2019(80); and \u2018in it were arm-\nchairs for those wishing to spend leisure hoursreading, studying or even sleeping \u2019(80). It was \u2018a\nhaven of peace \u2019(80) compared with the \u2018bleak and\nuncomfortable \u2019(80) barracks where they slept and\nwith the sergeants \u2019mess, where the noise of darts or\ntable-tennis players drowned out all conversation.\nCuriously, credit for the library is given to a colonel,\nwhose portrait is all but \ufb02attering, as this short anecdote\nproves:\nOne evening, Colonel \u2026called in at the camp library.\nSeeing a young Intelligence Corps corporal, he inquired\nwhat he was reading. \u2018The Way of all Flesh \u2019, Sir, replied\nthe corporal. The Colonel gave a knowing smile. \u2018But\nSir,\u2019said the youth, \u2018it is a famous classic novel, by\nSamuel Butler. \u2019\u2018Ah, my boy, \u2019said [the Colonel], \u2018you\ndon\u2019t need to make excuses, I was young myself\nonce! \u2019(Thirsk, 2008: 80)\nCross-referencing, or information\norganisation of librarians andcodebreakers\nApart from the reading library, the research high-\nlighted some parallels between the professions of the\nlibrarians and codebreakers. As alluded to above, itwas an asset for James Thirsk to be a librarian.\nBefore Bletchley Park, he had served in the Royal\nArtillery (Maritime Regiment) in Liverpool,\n17where\none day his captain, who had been told he was a librar-\nian, sent for him:\n\u2018Just the man, \u2019he said, \u2018to take charge of this card index\nof hundreds of soldiers manning the guns on merchant\nships all over the world. You can start work immedi-ately, \u2019he added, pointing to a trestle-table on which\nstood a large card index box and a \ufb01le of papers\nwaiting attention. (Thirsk, 2008: 14)\nLater, the same factor in \ufb02uenced his admission into\nintelligence (Thirsk, 2008: 15, 17, 20). This should not\ncome as a surprise, however, since organisinginformation, making it retrievable and creating con-\nnections are not just the goals of library and informa-\ntion professionals, but also crucial to\ncross-referencing, one of the stages of codebreaking.18\nAt Bletchley Park, Hollerith cards were used to indexdata such as keywords, names and location. These\nindexes were essential to interpreting messages. In\norder to break the Enigma code, every piece of infor-mation had to be stored and organised so that it was\nretrievable \u2013in other words, catalogued.\nCross-referencing changed the life of Irene Joan\nWatkins.\n19At Bletchley Park from the age of 20,\nshe had previously been reading German and French.\nHowever, she switched to Economic History after thewar because she had come to understand the power\nof indexes. As her husband, James Thirsk, explained\nin their interview (Thirsk, 2014), her group \u2019st a s k\nwas to read the messages and analyse and make note of\neverything, even the fact that some German sergeant\nmajor was having a wisdom tooth out and would be\nabsent for three days. This had to be noted downbecause he may turn up in another message somewhere\nelse. They had a vast card index. Joan later claimed that\nit was marvellous experience for her future historicalstudies as she always paid great attention to detail\nwhen reading. (Thirsk, 2014)\nConclusion\nThis article is the result of a visit to Bletchley Park\nMuseum, which led to a long journey through history\nand stories, especially among the veterans, exploringtheir experiences and feelings. It led to contact with\nBletchley Park Trust \u2019sO r a lH i s t o r yP r o j e c ta n du n c o v -\nered a series of sources of a different nature.\nWhat is evident is that, at the time, notwithstanding\nthe war, there wasa demand for books and a library\ndidexist at Bletchley Park, although it was considered\nrecreational, as entertaining as dancing, fencing or\nplaying chess. It was run on a voluntary basis as part\nof Bletchley Park Recreational Club, and it involved\ndifferent kinds of staff. The evidence retrieved todate does not allow for a reconstruction of the whole\nstory, but there is nothing pointing to a perception of\nthe external disputes between the armed forces andthe Library Association. James Thirsk, as mentioned,\nrecounted that the library space was quiet and wel-\ncoming, unlike other areas.\nThe research also shows that, in wartime, being a\nl i b r a r i a nc o u l db ea na s s e t \u2013as in the case of Thirsk.\nAt the time, information science was preparing for agiant leap forward, to large systems and mainframes.If now arti \ufb01cial intelligence needs to be nourished\nwith data, at the time large collections of organised794 IFLA Journal 50(4)\ndata were at the basis of the trial and error that enabled\nthe Allies to \ufb01ght Nazi power. Much of intelligence\nwork involves information organisation, an activityrelated to cataloguing, connecting pieces of informationto make them more \ufb01ndable. The intelligence of \ufb01cers,\nthen, were in effect information of \ufb01cers, managing\ninformation in order to ensure ef \ufb01cacy and effectiveness\nfor their parent organisation (Brunt, 2013).\nThis investigation is based on resources in different\nformats but of equal status. Each makes a contributionto reconstructing history and preserving memory.These resources are all \u2018substitutes of lived experi-\nence\u2019, as (Briet 1951, 2006 and Briet et al. 2022),\nfrom a totally different background, would writeonly six years after the dissolution of Bletchley\nPark. During a visit to the USA, she observed the\nopportunities afforded by computer science andre\ufb02ected on their impact on the new science of docu-\nmentation (Castellucci, 2022). A memoir may come in\nthe form of a recorded interview or of a written book,\nbut the format is not so relevant. In fact, after the oralsource has been \ufb01xed in any format, either analogic or\ndigital, it acquires the same duration in time and spaceas any other source (Portelli, 2017).\nThis article has presented the facts and recollections\nthat have been discovered to date on the readinglibrary at Bletchley Park. A visit to the NationalArchives in London and some further reading willallow the study to go deeper; these are plans for the\nfuture. For the time being, some answers to the\nresearch question have emerged, although partial andwith no pretence at completeness. At the same time,\nsome of the stories hint at further discussion on the\nidentity of the librarians and how their professionhas evolved along with the history of information\ntechnology, where Bletchley Park played a key role.\nMany stories happened at Bletchley Park duringWorld War II and literature on the topic is growing,\nyet the library is rarely mentioned.

This multifaceted heritage, comprising traditional and digital resources, stands as a valuable testimonyto the active role of the Library in the international cultural context. This article aims to provide a generaloverview of these resources and their potential historical signi \ufb01cance, focusing on the last century and pre-\nsenting some signi \ufb01cant episodes in the institution \u2019s history.\nKeywordsVatican Library, archival resources, history of libraries and library science, principles of library and informationscience\nAn institution of ancient origin, the Vatican Apostolic\nLibrary is an outstanding means for the Church to con-\ntribute to the development and dissemination ofculture, in support of the work of the Apostolic See.\nThrough its various sections, it is responsible for collect-\ning and preserving a vast patrimony of learning and artand of making it available to scholars in search of\ntruth. (Pope Francis, 2022)\nIt was with these words that Pope Francis, in his\nApostolic Constitution Praedicate Evangelium ,d e\ufb01ned\nhis library, which gathers and makes available toscholars from around the world the library collectionsof the Popes.\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library (Biblioteca\nApostolica Vaticana) is \u2018Vatican \u2019as it is located on\nthe Vatican Hill in the heart of Vatican City, and\n\u2018Apostolic \u2019as it was originally established as a per-\nsonal endowment of the Popes. This venerable institu-\ntion has a long history: evidence of papal library\ncollections can be traced back to the 4th century as a\nscrinium (Library) of books, but the institutional\nhistory of the Vatican Library began in the mid 15thcentury. A papal collection already existed \u2018pro\ncommuni doctorum virorum commodo \u2019(\u2018for the\ncommon use of men of science \u2019), as a ponti \ufb01cal brief\ntesti\ufb01es (Pope Nicholas V, 1451),\n1and Bignami\nOdier (1973), Manfredi (2010) and Vircillo Franklin(2002) narrate. Then, a bull reorganized it \u2018ad\ndecorem militantis Ecclesiae, \ufb01dei catholicae augmen-\ntum, eruditorum quoque ac litterarum studiis insisten-tium virorum commodum et honorem \u2019(\u2018to enhance\nthe glory of the Church, to increase the Catholic faith,for the bene \ufb01t and honour of those men devoted to\nthe pursuit of knowledge and letters \u2019; Pope Sixtus IV,\n1475),\n2with extended premises, dedicated funding\nand adequate staff. Thanks to these sensitive andenlightened pontiffs, the institution entered its \ufb01rst\nphase of modernity, opening its doors to scholars\nwith its own institutional identity, the necessary \ufb01nan-\ncial support and recognition of the role of a librarian\n(bibliothecarius ; the humanist Bartolomeo Platina was\nthe\ufb01rst to be appointed).\n3\nAt\ufb01rst located in the heart of the Apostolic Palace,\nthe Library was then moved to its current location\nunder Pope Sixtus V,4between 1587 and 1589, fol-\nlowing a design by the architect Domenico Fontana.\nCeresa (2012) details this historical phase of theLibrary; also, a painting by Pietro Facchetti, currently\nhanging on a wall in the Sistine Hall of the Library,\nportrays Sixtus V approving the project presented by\nCorresponding author:\nRaffaella Vincenti, Vatican Apostolic Library, 00120 Vatican City.Email: vincenti@vatlib.itOriginal Article\nInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions2024, Vol. 50(4) 798 \u2013809\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024Article reuse guidelines:sagepub.com/journals-permissionsDOI: 10.1177/03400352241271056\njournals.sagepub.com/home/i \ufb02\nDomenico Fontana in 1588. The building that still\nhouses the Library today was built on the dividing ter-\nraces that connected the Cortile del Belvedere to what\nis now known as the Library Courtyard. On the upper\ufb02oor, a large monumental hall ( vaso librario )w i t ht w o\naisles was constructed,\n5known as the Sistine Hall, meas-\nuring 70 metres long by 15 meters wide and lavishlydecorated. It is still used by the Library today, althoughthe current Reading Rooms are housed in spaces\narranged according to the more modern necessities at\nthe end of the 19th century. These Popes aimed to rep-licate the public libraries of antiquity \u2013places of intense\nscholarly activity, mainly focused on philological studyand learned discussions.\nSince its inception, the Library has fostered inclu-\nsivity by being open to scholars irrespective of theirgender, religion or political beliefs,\n6and over time it\nhas grown in reputation and importance as a centre oflearning and scholarship (Buonocore and Piazzoni,\n2011). While facing some challenges, it has managed\nto preserve its collections , cementing its position as\none of the most notable libraries in the world,\nwhose aim, according to the Praedicate Evangelium\nconstitution, is to be a cultural conduit for the\nmessage of the Church through its service to the\nRoman Pontiff and the Roman Curia.\nMore accurately, the Vatican Library is a \u2018library of\nlibraries \u2019(bibliotheca bibliothecarum ), as it has, since\nits inception, integrated the papal collections withthe various libraries acquired by the Popes over time\n(D\u2019Aiuto and Vian, 2011; Montuschi, 2014;\nPiazzoni and Jatta, 2010). This venerable institution,\nwhich works alongside the Holy See to ful \ufb01l its\nmission with a speci \ufb01c cultural and preservation\nmandate, houses a rich heritage of manuscripts,printed books and other printed materials, as well as\na valuable numismatic collection, archival documents,photographs and graphic items. Concurrently, a\ndiverse collection of documents of various types and\norigins bears witness to its evolution and the relation-ships developed by the Library over the course of itslong history. This documentation is primarily found\nin the Institutional Archive, a natural repository for\ndocuments generated by transactions and dailyevents. Other sources distributed across different loca-\ntions also contribute to the historical narrative of the\ninstitution. This heterogeneous yet interconnectedcollection of documents, comprising traditional and\ndigital resources, is neither fully known nor thor-\noughly explored for various reasons.\nThe objective of this article is to provide a general\noverview of this heritage and its potential historicalsigni\ufb01cance, focusing on the resources that document\nthe last century of institutional life and presentingsome signi \ufb01cant episodes in the institutional history\nas they emerge from these composite testimonies. It\nis worth emphasizing how this multifaceted heritage\nstands as a valuable testimony to the active role ofthe Library in the international cultural context as itconsistently engages in the quest for technological\nsolutions that best meet its organizational needs.\nT h ee v o l u t i o no fs u c ha na n c i e n ta n dc o m p l e x\ncultural institution, intertwined with the equallyintricate history of its lo cations, is condensed into\na variety of documents that narrate not only the\nhistory of the Library over time, but also the\ngrowth and richness of its network of connections.\nThese testimonies re \ufb02ect the Library \u2019sr o l ea sac u l -\ntural diplomacy entity and an institution of the\nChurch, and, above all, bear witness to the stories\nof the individuals who have contributed to itsdevelopment.\nThe Library \u2019s documentary resources are complex\nand distributed across various collections andarchives. The most signi \ufb01cant can be summarized as\nfollows:\n1. The Institutional Archive (historical and\ncurrent);\n2. Documents kept in the Manuscript Department;3. The Archives Section;\n4. The Photographic Archive;\n5. The Digital Photographic Archive;6. The Photographic Collection;7. The Archive of the Vatican School of Library\nScience;\n8. Other resources.\nThe Institutional Archive (historical and\ncurrent)\nIn the Library \u2019s Archive, under the direct custody of\nthe Prefecture, a collectio n that is partially unknown\noutside the Library gathers primary documents from\nthe 16th century onwards; it is being made known to\nthe public through the publication of the History ofthe Vatican Library book series.\n7The Historical\nSection consists of a main series of over 280 units,while the Current Section, began to be organizedsince the year 2000, contains documents related to\nthe related to the Library \u2019s more recent history.\nThe Archive includes incoming and outgoing corres-\npondence, consultation registers, lists of scholars, per-sonnel records, documents related to the establishment\nand development of various sections of the Library,\ndrafts of its statutes and regulations, copies of papaldocuments, purchase notes, and entry registers for\nmanuscripts, printed materials and other items.Vincenti: Navigating the Vatican Library repositories 799\nWhile the Current Section is not accessible for\nunderstandable reasons, the Historical Section is\nopen for consultation based on the criteria of the pon-\nti\ufb01cates that have applied since 1924 to the documents\nof the Vatican Apostolic Archive, which collects andpreserves documents of the Holy See. Currently, the\nchronological limit for consultation is set as the end\nof the ponti \ufb01cate of Pius XII (October 1958). In add-\nition, a discretionary criterion was established for\ngranting access to some speci \ufb01c documents.\nThe Current Section contains documents in a\nvariety of formats: alongside the preservation ofpaper documents, an automated system for internal\nuse, with restricted access, registers incoming corres-pondence only, but, in some cases, outgoing corres-\npondence as well. It includes brief synopses and a\nclassi \ufb01cation system: for each subject, a speci \ufb01c\nprotocol position is assigned in order to facilitate theretrieval of records. Institutional email correspondence\nis an important issue, which still needs to be systemat-\nically addressed; a signi \ufb01cant portion of the documen-\ntation is at risk of being lost without an effective\narchiving policy. The Library is considering appropri-\nate methods to select and preserve messages in accord-ance with current regulations.\nRequests for reproductions and rights are resources\nof particular interest: orders for images and permis-sions for private study or professional purposes havebeen consistently recorded in the system, in addition\nto being preserved in hard-copy format. This approach\nfacilitates the tracking of research on speci \ufb01c items\nwithin the collections and will enable future research-\ners to study the distribution of editorial content related\nto the Library \u2019s heritage.\nThe regulations and minutes of the Library\nCouncil, dating back to its establishment in the late19th century, are also kept in the Archive. They areac r u c i a l \u2018logbook \u2019that, on a regular and consistent\nbasis, faithfully records the institution \u2019s development\nover time. Other meaningful documentation com-prises the registers of ma nuscript readers dating\nfrom the second half of 16th century onwards; it\nis a relevant source of information about the schol-\narly activity that took place in the Library from itsinception.\n8\nDocuments kept in the Manuscript\nDepartment\nOther valuable resources, such as personnel informa-\ntion, catalogues, inventories, and reading and loan reg-\nisters, are mostly kept in the Institutional Archive, butsome of these documents are also located in the\nManuscript Department. For example, the Ruoli(\u2018Rolls \u2019) collection (432 items), which was acquired\nby the Library in 1896, covers the chronologicalperiod from Julius III (1550 \u20131555) to Pius IX\n(1846 \u20131878). It provides information about members\nof the papal family and the Apostolic Sacred\nPalaces, categorized into different groups, along with\ntheir corresponding remuneration and \u2018shares \u2019from\nthe papal annona . This source is crucial for tracing\nthe individuals who served the Popes over a span ofmore than three centuries. Notably, it provides evi-\ndence of bookbinders in the Vatican Library, con \ufb01rm-\ning that it was one of the \ufb01rst institutions to establish\nan in-house laboratory for the physical care and pres-ervation of volumes.\nOther resources kept in the Manuscript Department\nare useful for tracking the Library \u2019s acquisitions, prov-\nenance and scholarly use of the collections over time,such as the two earliest loan registers preserved in themain series of the Vatican Latini: Vat.lat.3964 and\nVat.lat.3966. They are accessible to readers and have\nalso been digitized; they are currently availableonline on the DVL (DigiVatLib) website.\n9\nThe Archives Section\nBuonocore (2010) outlines the creation and organiza-tion of the Archives Section of the Library, which wasestablished as a speci \ufb01c division of the institution\nduring the second half of the 1970s and is mostlyaccessible to readers. It is housed in a designated areaand collects archives from institutions (mostly churches\nor chapters of Roman churches), noble families (in the\nRoman context) and individual \ufb01gures. These collec-\ntions came to the Library at various times and\nthrough different means. Family archives, in most\ncases, were acquired along with the entire manuscriptand printed heritage of the respective family (and\nlater divided according to type among the Library \u2019s\ndepartments and sections and organized into speci \ufb01c\ncollections). From the perspective of the history of\nthe Library \u2019s collection development, the Archives\nSection is of signi \ufb01cant value and covers the history\nof the families or institutions from which these collec-tions originated.\nThe Photographic Archive\nThe Photographic Archive is a complex entity that isclosely related to the activities of the PhotographicLaboratory, which was formally established in the\nlate 1930s thanks to Pope Pius XI (1857 \u20131939).\nHowever, internal photographic activities have been\ndocumented since 1907, when a reproduction service\nwas started; specialized equipment subsequently began800 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nto be acquired in 1931. Ambrosi Sacconi (2010) dis-\ncusses the Photographic Archive, which preserves the\noriginals of photographs taken by the Laboratory and\nconstitutes a valuable documentary heritage.\nThese images are not simply tools; they are also\nresearch objects and play a signi \ufb01cant role in preserva-\ntion, illustrating the state of manuscripts at the time aphotograph was taken. In some cases, they show amanuscript before its deterioration or a restoration\nintervention. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Gait\u00e1n and Schuler (2022) high-\nlight the Library \u2019s work to use photographic technol-\nogy for the optimal preservation of its heritage,\nensuring that it is transmitted to future generations in\nthe best possible condition.\nAs part of this institutional care, shortly after the\nSecond World War, the Library chose to micro \ufb01lm\nits manuscripts and entrust them, for greater security,to an external entity that would contribute to theirlong-term preservation \u2013the Knights of Columbus\nVatican Film Library at Saint Louis University,Missouri, USA.\n10This huge reproduction endeavour,\nwhich lasted a decade, encompassed approximately\n70% of the manuscript holdings and served as an\nimportant precursor to various study and planningactivities that, in subsequent decades, led to the\ncurrent digitization project, which will be discussed\nlater.\nAmong other items, the current contents of the\nPhotographic Archive include approximately\n54,000 micro \ufb01lms of the Library \u2019s manuscripts,\nreproduced in their entirety; around 33,000\n35-millimetre colour slides and 10,000 in the 13 \u00d7\n18 cm format; approximately 35,000 large-formatblack-and-white negatives; and various micro \ufb01che\nreproductions of certain collections, such as the\nCicognara collection.\n11\nThe Digital Photographic Archive\nThe Photographic Laboratory currently usesstate-of-the-art digital-imaging equipment and main-\ntains the most rigorous preservation standards. TheDigital Photographic Archive collects the digital heri-\ntage of the Library and also images and video record-\nings of events related to the Library, which areregularly documented by the Photographic Laboratory \u2019s\nstaff.\nThe Digital Photographic Archive preserves the\nheritage resulting from the digitization projects ofthe collections \u2013predominantly manuscripts \u2013which\nthe Library has undertaken from the moment whentechnology made these activities possible \u2013namely,\nfrom the mid 1990s. The various digitization tests\nand projects undertaken over the years, culminatingin the current main project, have produced an enor-\nmous collection of digital images, which are carefully\npreserved to enable their transmission to future\ngenerations.\nProduction companies often create video projects\nabout the Library. Copies of these \ufb01lms are also pre-\nserved by the Library, as historical records of a spe-ci\ufb01c moment in the institution \u2019s life and, in\naccordance with copyright laws, they are occasionally\nused for internal promotional purposes.\nThe Photographic Collection\nThe Photographic Collection is housed in the Cabinetof Graphics, a speci \ufb01c section within the Department\nof Prints, which collects photographs from the 19th\nand 20th centuries, organized into albums, as well\nas loose photographs, sorted by format. These items\ndocument the history of the papacy from the ponti \ufb01-\ncate of Pope Pius IX (1792 \u20131878) to that of Pope\nJohn Paul II (1920 \u20132005). In particular, they\nprovide testimony of the celebrations, travels and epi-sodes in the lives of these pontiffs and various loca-tions within the Vatican (see Philips, 2012; Voltan,\n2010).\nA substantial portion of the collection also includes\nphotographs sent to the different Popes by missionsand dioceses from around the world, as well as by\nprivate individuals. These images document places,events, institutions and various personalities, and\nhold great importance for the history of the Church\nand the customs of the 19th and 20th centuries. ThePhotographic Collection is currently being reorga-nized, and a general inventory will be available in\nthe near future, along with a scholarly volume featur-\ning a selection of the most interesting works from thecollection.\nThe Archive of the Vatican School of\nLibrary Science\nThe\ufb01rst course in the Vatican School of Library\nScience began in November 1934 (Graglia, 1947;\nPernigotti and Weston, 1991; Weston, 2020).\nCourses have been held regularly up to the presentday, with the only interruption being due to the\nSecond World War. Thousands of students have\nacquired knowledge relative to library management.For a long time, the school was the only traininginstitution in the \ufb01eld of professional librarian edu-\ncation. In an address on 11 May 1935, Pope PiusXI assigned the school \u2018the purpose of initiating in\nthe broadest and best way, a management, govern-\nance, and care of books that \u2026extends to whatVincenti: Navigating the Vatican Library repositories 801\nbooks represent, namely, science, the reverence for\nscience, and the noble effort around science \u2019,a s\nreported by Alecci (1983).\nFrom the very beginning, the number of requests\nfor enrolment has consistently exceeded thenumber of places available. Although the school\nwas initially intended for the bene \ufb01t of clergy, a\nlarge number of laypeople, both men and women,\nhave been admitted. Many former students hold, or\nhave held, signi \ufb01cant positions in various important\nlibraries.\nThe school has experienced signi \ufb01cant transfor-\nmations over the years, aligning itself with modern\nhigher education institutio ns through notable colla-\nborations. It has recorded its activities since its\nestablishment, providing scholars with an extensive\narray of materials in print, photographic and digitalformats.\nOther resources\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez Gait\u00e1n (2013, 2017) and Petrucci Nardelli(1993) explore the history and characteristics of the\nLibrary \u2019s Restoration Laboratory, which has a long\ntradition and can be considered one of the oldest res-\ntoration laboratories in the world. Various documentsfrom the 14th century testify to the Library \u2019s interest\nin preservation. Restoration interventions on manu-scripts, as well as the roles, duties and obligationsof book restorers and binders, are documented from\nthe 16th century onwards. The commitment to the\ncorrect preservation of the Library \u2019sh e r i t a g ea n d\nthe methods of intervention adopted over time are\nevident from various documents available in the\nLibrary \u2019s repositories. Initially, interventions aimed\nto ensure the usability of books; however, at theend of the 20th century, the Laboratory took its\ncurrent direction in studying how to prevent and\ntreat damage optimally. This shift began under PopeLeo XIII (1810 \u20131903), when the physical reorganiza-\ntion of the Library went hand in hand with its mod-ernization and the establishment of a series ofinterinstitutional relationships. This included a heigh-\ntened focus on conservation, adopting a modern\napproach to the restoration and preservation of thecollection from physical, chemical, and biological\ndamage.\nThe Laboratory staff currently record any speci \ufb01c\ninformation related to the restoration process on a\ndetailed form, accompanied by digital images. All\nthe data collected so far has been entered into a data-\nbase. Previous interventions were reported from the1920s onwards; currently stored in paper registers,\nthey will also be gradually digitized in order tofacilitate future understanding and evaluation of the\nprocedures and materials adopted, providing a guide\nfor future interventions.\nSuch a vast and comprehensive documentary appar-\natus provides robust s upport for historical research\non the Library. In particular, by retracing the last\ncentury of the Vatican Library \u2019s existence, it is pos-\nsible to delineate a vivid and in-depth narrative ofthe events and developments that have characterizedthe institution \u2019s recent history in its various aspects.\nThe period from Pope Leo XIII (1878 \u20131903) to\nPope Pius XI (1922 \u20131939) is particularly signi \ufb01cant\nfor the Vatican Library, as it marks the integration\nof the Library into the mainstream of modern library\norganization and management, as well as its alignmentwith major international library institutions. During thisphase, there was a fruitful and signi \ufb01cant convergence\nof initiatives, which impacted various aspects of theinstitution. In particular, Pope Leo XIII opened theLibrary to a wider audience by inaugurating the current\nReading Room for Printed Materials in 1892, organized\nwith open shelves, and introducing new opening hours.During the same period, the Library incorporated\nnew acquisitions; developed regulations for staff\nand readers; reorganized storage spaces; implemen-ted proper care of its heritage through the applicationof restoration and conservation techniques with up-to-\ndate restoration and photographic laboratories; and\nultimately increased its editorial and research activities,including distinctive photographic campaigns and\nfacsimile editions. Additionally, new tools were devel-\noped to facilitate access to the collections, includingstandardized cataloguing practices for manuscripts\nand printed volumes. With such achievements, the\nLibrary opened itself to readers worldwide whileensuring accessibility and the proper preservation of\nits collections.\nThe\ufb01rst rules and regulations of the Library were\npublished with a motu proprio by Pius IX (Pope\nPius IX, 1851)\n12and two subsequent motu proprios\ndated 187813and 1888,14both by Pope Leo XIII.\nTheRegolamento della Biblioteca Vaticana was issued\nin 1923 and has been regularly updated to the present\nday. The rules and regulations detailed the organization \u2019s\ninternal life by de \ufb01ning the Library \u2019s hierarchical struc-\nture, staff duties and administration directions, as wellas the main services of the Library, including opening\nhours. All of the preparatory drafts of these regulationsare preserved in the Library Archive, while their pub-\nlished versions are kept in both the Archive and the\nprinted books collections. This set of rules and regula-tions still serves as the primary point of reference for802 IFLA Journal 50(4)\ninstitutional activities and the management of services\nfor scholars.15\nThis substantial modernization process, initiated\nin the last decades of the 19th century and the early20th century,\n16has been further consolidated\nduring this century, consistently evolving with a suc-\ncession of signi \ufb01cant innovations for the Library.\nKey\ufb01gures, such as the Jesuit prefect Franz Ehrle,\nhave played a vital role. During Ehrle \u2019s tenure\n(1895 \u20131914),17the modernization initiatives contin-\nued, and the Library began to align itself with major\ninternational library institutions, being fully open to\nscholars from around the world and simultaneously\naccessible through its resources, as well as at the fore-front of properly valuing and preserving its collections.\nUnder Ehrle, signi \ufb01cant milestones were achieved,\nincluding the beginning of the analytical cataloguing of\nmanuscripts with the publication of a set of norms(Vattasso and Franchi de \u2019Cavalieri, 1902) and the\norganization of the International Conference of StGallen (Switzerland) on 1 October 1898, to addresspreservation-related concerns and foster collaboration\namong prominent European libraries.\n18This conference\nis known as the \u2018mother of all restoration conferences \u2019\nand signi \ufb01cantly in \ufb02uenced restoration practices.19\nEhrle (1898, 1899a, 1899b) himself highlighted the\npivotal nature and impact of this initiative.\nEhrle also initiated the publication of the Library \u2019s\nfacsimile editions and promoted the study of\npalimpsests \u2013an ongoing research area that the\nLibrary has consistently fostered up to the present\nday, employing cutting-edge multispectral technolo-\ngies. In addition, in 1912, the current Reading\nRoom for Manuscripts was opened to scholars andthe manuscripts collection was transferred to a new\npurpose-built depository.\nIn July 1914, Ehrle requested to be relieved of the\ndirection of the Library. Achille Ratti, who had beena librarian at the Ambrosiana Library in Milan from\n1903 to 1914, took his place as the prefect of the insti-tution until 1919. In December 1922, when he hadbeen appointed Pope with the name Pius XI, Ratti\nordained Ehrle as a cardinal and, in 1929, he appointed\nhim as Librarian and Archivist of the Holy RomanChurch. As the prefect of the Library, Ratti focused\non a comprehensive general catalogue of printed\nbooks and the conservation and restoration needs formanuscripts. As Pope, he further supported the\nLibrary by allocating new spaces for the collections\nand personally selecting the shelving. He also initiatedthe subsequent collaboration with the Carnegie\nEndowment for International Peace.\nFor new storage facilities, one of the Vatican\nLibrary \u2019s most urgent needs, Pius XI allocated theancient horse stables on the ground \ufb02oor of\nthe Bramante \u2019s eastern gallery in the courtyard\nof the Belvedere. He personally selected and donated\nthe sturdiest, most modern and most expensive shelv-ing (standard stacks) produced by the Snead Company\nof Jersey City, USA. By the end of 1928, the \ufb01rst\nstorage facility had been set up; a second, twice the\nsize of the \ufb01rst, was established three years later,\nand shelves of the same type were installed in the\nlarge Reading Room, which was reconstructed and\nreorganized at the end of 1931.\nIn 1929, the Library played an active role in the\n\ufb01rst World Congress of Libraries and Bibliography,\nwhere the International Library and BibliographicalCommittee, founded in 1927 in Edinburgh, assumed\nthe name International Federation of Library\nAssociations and Insti tutions (IFLA; Orlandi,\n2010; Vincenti, 2020). It is very likely that the city\nof Rome was chosen not only in honour of the \ufb01ftieth\nanniversary of the death of Antonio Panizzi,\n20but\nalso for the ongoing projects in the Vatican, wheresome American librarians were working in colla-\nborations supported by the Carnegie Foundation,as we will see later. The Pope personally welcomedthe 880 librarians, who came from 35 countries.\nHe received them with an audience in the Sistine\nHall of the Library and greeted them as \u2018af o r m e r\nand now old colleague \u2019(Guerrini and Speciale,\n2012). The Vatican Library \u2019s participation in\nthe\ufb01rst IFLA conference marked a signi \ufb01cant\nmilestone in its commitment to international library\ncooperation. This inaugural event fostered the\nLibrary \u2019s engagement with the library community\nworldwide; the conference facilitated an exchange\nof ideas, best practices and collaborative efforts on\nmatters related to the description and preservationof collections.\nIn the list of individuals who had a major impact\non the Library \u2019s history during the 20th century, it\nis also worth highlighting Eug\u00e9ne Tisserant and\nGiovanni Mercati. From 1908 to 1936, Eug\u00e8ne\nTisserant, who succeeded Ehrle, improved theLibrary \u2019s research tools, with a new general cata-\nlogue of printed books and a uni \ufb01ed index of manu-\nscripts, inspired and supported by a librarian at theUniversity of Michigan, William Warner Bishop.Between 1928 and 1941, around 20 young female\ngraduates worked on a comprehensive index of\nVatican manuscripts. Mattioli Hary (1996, 2009)discusses this unprecedented and signi \ufb01cant\nemployment of women in the Vatican as collabora-tors, which was due to the involvement of theCarnegie Foundation and its support of the\nLibrary \u2019s modernization project between the 1920sVincenti: Navigating the Vatican Library repositories 803\nand 1930s through a programme developed by\nAmerican experts.\nTisserant personally made a long tour of major\nlibraries in the USA in 1927 (Vian, 1980); thisearned him the epithet \u2018American \u2019. In 80 days, from\n29 April to 19 July, he visited various North\nAmerican libraries, acquiring ideas and learning\nabout their practices, and then promptly informinghis superiors in Rome through highly detailed\nletters. Following this experience, he oversaw the\ntraining of specialized personnel, who were sent forintensive training in prominent US libraries (Orlandi,\n2013).\nSimultaneously, a North American team assisted\nthe Library in drafting cataloguing standards, basedon the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules. In\n1926, Henry Smith Pritchett, president of theCarnegie Foundation for the Advancement ofTeaching, went to the Vatican Library to explore\nthe development of a cataloguing system for\nprinted books. In 1927, a working group \u2013compris-\ning William Warner Bishop, James C. Hanson of the\nUniversity of Chicago and Charles Martel, head of\nthe Cataloguing Division at the Library ofCongress in Washington, DC \u2013was joined by John\nAnsteinsson, Milton E. Lord and WilliamM. Randall, as well as the Vatican assistants return-ing from the USA (Enrico Benedetti, Gerardo Bruni,Igino Giordani, Giuseppe Graglia, Riccardo Matta,\nCarmelo Scalia and Nello Vian). The Norms for\nthe Cataloguing of Printed Books was issued in\n1931. Such developments allowed the Library toreduce the time needed to locate a book from a full\nday to an average of half an hour.\nThanks to this collaboration with the American\nlibrary world and the support of the CarnegieFoundation, the Vatican Library was actively engagedin initiatives that, during these years, led also to the\nestablishment of IFLA and the Associazione Italiana\nBiblioteche (Italian Library Association). This wasundoubtedly not only due to the interests of the Pope,a former librarian, but also because, during this phase,\nthe Vatican Library was led by individuals who were\noriented towards international cooperation and innov-ation for the improvement of services.\nGiovanni Mercati was the Cardinal Librarian of the\nHoly Roman Church from 1936 to 1957. He, alongwith Tisserant, aided Jews in evading racial persecu-\ntion by hiding them or providing them with employ-\nment in the Library (Vian, 2002). Ehrle andTisserant also assisted Jews in obtaining visas, allow-\ning some individuals to leave Italy with Vatican pass-\nports. Ardura (2023) acknowledges Tisserant \u2019s\ncommitment, which led him to be recognizedposthumously as \u2018Righteous Among the Nations \u2019by\nYad Vashem\n17.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, the\nLibrary increasingly reduced its offerings to scholarsdue to the closed borders, and then shut its doorsfrom 1943 to 1944; at the same time, the Vatican\ntook responsibility for the safeguarding operations\nfor several archives and libraries. As a cardinal,Mercati promoted a census of the ecclesiastical\narchives and libraries, and sent instructions to the\nbishops of central Italy to ensure the on-site protectionof their collections or manage their transportation to\nand temporary storage in the Vatican. Collections\nfrom the Abbey of Montecassino and some other rele-vant libraries in the Rome area were delivered to the\nVatican. The Library managed to protect the collec-\ntions. In March 1945, after the con \ufb02ict ended, an\nexhibition was organized by the Library to showcasethese collections before they were returned to their\nrespective institutions (De Luca, 1945 and Bruni,\n2016).\nOver the following decades, the Library increas-\ningly integrated itself into the global professionallandscape. In particular, the period that marks thebeginning of the computerization of activities and pro-\ncesses, as well as the study of the most effective solu-\ntions to be applied in the Library, deserves attentionand can be identi \ufb01ed as the phase from the second\nhalf of the 1980s onwards. From 1984 to 1997,\nPrefect Leonard Eugene Boyle, a Dominican Father\nwhose centenary is to be celebrated in 2024, embracedsome pivotal technological advancements. Boyle, an\nesteemed scholar and librarian, made signi \ufb01cant con-\ntributions to the Vatican Library during his tenure;\nhis dedication left a lasting impression on the institu-\ntion, which entered a new phase of modernization by\nimplementing new technologies in various areas. Itstarted with the adoption of speci \ufb01c software for the\nacquisition and cataloguing of printed books. Later,in the mid 1990s, the Library embarked on an exten-sive and signi \ufb01cant retrospective catalogue conversion\nproject: the printed cards, mainly from the collabor-\nation with the American experts during the 1920s,\nbegan to be entered manually into the new system.This original database has since evolved into the\ncurrent online catalogue, which has been improved\nfurther over the subsequent years with the adoptionof increasingly advanced systems and systematic efforts\nto update and enrich the bibliographic information.\nIn parallel with the adoption of computer tools,\nFather Boyle promoted and participated in theestablishment of the Unione Romana Biblioteche\nScienti \ufb01che a network created to facilitate cooperative\nwork between several research libraries in Rome,804 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nparticularly participatory cataloging and the sharing of\nauthority \ufb01les, fostering productive relationships with\nother foreign academic libraries in Rome (Contigianiand Vincenti, 2003). During Father Boyle \u2019s prefecture,\nan initial exploratory phase of digitizing the manuscriptheritage also began, paving the way for following experi-\nments until the digitization project of 2010 when these\nefforts culminated, during the tenures of Raffaele Farina(1997 \u20132007)\n21and Cesare Pasini (2007 \u20132023), in the\nre\ufb01nement of the acquisition process that is still applied\nby the Library today. Thanks to this project, approxi-mately 30,000 of the 80,000 manuscripts have been\nmade available for open access on the DVL website,\n22,23\nalong with some incunabula, archival materials and inven-\ntories, graphic materials, coins and medals, and printed\nmaterials.\nRaffaele Farina \u2019s vision led to the creation of digital\ndatabases and online catalogues, enabling scholars to\naccess the Library \u2019s holdings remotely. He also pro-\nmoted international collaborations, fostering partner-ships with leading academic institutions and librariesto enhance research and exchange knowledge. His\ncommitment to expanding the Library \u2019s digital pres-\nence signi \ufb01cantly contributed to its relevance in the\nmodern digital age.\nCesare Pasini succeeded Farina as prefect of the\nVatican Library in 2007 and continued to foster and\npromote its digital initiatives, emphasizing the import-ance of preserving and promoting the Library \u2019s cul-\ntural heritage through state-of-the-art technology.The Library accelerated its efforts to digitize rareand valuable manuscripts, incunabula and printed\nworks, not only providing increased access to its col-\nlections, but also ensuring the preservation of thesefragile and precious materials for future generations.\nPasini \u2019s dedication to digitization and technological\nadvancements solidi \ufb01ed the Vatican Library \u2019s reputa-\ntion as a global leader in digital preservation andaccessibility (Manoni et al., 2018; Pasini, 2014).\nBoth Farina \u2019s and Pasini \u2019s contributions have pro-\npelled the Vatican Library into the digital age, preserv-\ning its rich cultural heritage while also making it more\naccessible to scholars and researchers worldwide.\nTheir leadership and commitment to embracing tech-nology has furthered the Library \u2019s mission to\npromote knowledge, research and the preservation ofhumanity \u2019s intellectual heritage. Following Father\nBoyle \u2019s initiatives, during the last two decades,\nFarina and Pasini placed signi \ufb01cant emphasis on\ntechnological research, beyond cataloguing andlibrary automated services. As an example, by the\nlate 19th century, the development of the application\nof early photography techniques to palimpsests hadstarted; the Library \u2019s Photographic Laboratorycurrently employs advanced multispectral technolo-gies to reveal details not visible to the naked eye\n(Altamura et al., 2022; Schuler, 2009, 2010, 2013;\nSchuler et al., 2017). Such technologies allow thedetection of faded ink, erasures or underlying hiddenlayers within manuscripts without causing physical\ndamage; such diagnostic investigations are particu-\nlarly effective in recovering the scriptio inferior in\npalimpsest manuscripts. These technologies, applied\nto research, engage both academic professionals\nand staff with expertise from Photographic andRestoration Laboratories, as image specialists collab-\norate closely with philologists (Giuffrida et al., 2023).\nAnother area in which the Library has applied sig-\nni\ufb01cant technologies and experimented with innova-\ntive solutions is the long-term preservation of digital\nmaterials.\n24The digitization project was implemented\nby adopting the Flexible Image Transport System(FITS), which has been continuously updated by the\ninternational scienti \ufb01c community for over 40 years.\nGiuffrida (2021) underscores the Library \u2019s collabor-\nation with technical experts and scholars worldwide,which ensures that the FITS is implemented accurately\nand reliably so that the digital representations ofmanuscripts maintain their integrity and accuracy\nover time.\nThe Vatican Library \u2019s commitment to using the\nFITS aligns with its broader mission to safeguard its\ncollections while making them accessible. Exploring\nthe best preservation conditions for its heritage, the\nLibrary has not only participated in signi \ufb01cant joint\ninitiatives for the application and study of the FITS\nfor cultural heritage across Europe, but also contribu-\nted to the Arctic World Archive project in Spitsbergen,Norway, with a copy of the so-called Urbinate codex\n(Urb. lat.365) of Dante \u2019sDivine Comedy on digital\ntape.\nThe International Image Interoperability Framework\nis another key area in the Library \u2019s adoption of\ncutting-edge technologies to better disseminate andshare its heritage. It enables the creation of enricheddigital collections via the aggregation of contents\nfrom various cultural heritage institutions in order to\nfacilitate their comparative analysis (Manoni, 2022).In recent years, new frontiers in scienti \ufb01c and techno-\nlogical possibilities have opened up in the Library incollaboration with specialized research centres.Among these, it is worth noting codicological research\nthrough digital tools, and the focus on the recognition\nand classi \ufb01cation of objects in manuscript illuminations\nthrough arti \ufb01cial intelligence.\nFor decades, to promote wider knowledge of its\nheritage, the Library has granted loans from its collec-tions for temporary exhibit. This allows the circulationVincenti: Navigating the Vatican Library repositories 805\nof the Library \u2019s works in major museums around the\nworld and enables a broader audience to access the\ntreasures of the Popes. The loan registers are detailed\nby the Exhibition Service and regularly transferred tothe current Archive of the Service. As a recentexample, the Library participated in Expo 2020 in\nDubai, the \ufb01rst occurrence of such an event in the\nMiddle East, which had as its theme \u2018Connecting\nMinds, Creating the Future \u2019. The Holy See and the\nLibrary interpreted this as \u2018Deepening the Connection \u2019,\naccording to Pope Francis \u2019s encyclical letter Fratelli\ntuttion fraternity and social friendship.\nIn line with its cultural diplomacy mission, in\nNovember 2021, the Library unveiled an internal\nExhibition Hall, to share its collections with a wider\npublic (Watkins, 2021).\n25The inauguration was\nattended by Pope Francis, who stated:\nthe human heart \u2026needs culture, that which touches the\nsoul, which brings the human being closer to his or her\nprofound dignity. This is why the Church must bear\nwitness to the importance of beauty and culture, in dia-\nlogue with the particular thirst for the in \ufb01nite that\nde\ufb01nes the human being. (Pope Francis, 2021)\nTo conclude this brief overview of signi \ufb01cant events\nof the last century as narrated by the historical\nsources of the Vatican Library, it is worth mentioning\nthe case of the Marega Documents, an example of asurprising discovery within the collections in recent\nyears.\nDon Mario Marega was a Salesian missionary in\nBungo Province (now O \u0304ita Prefecture), Japan, before\nthe Second World War. For more than 40 years, he com-\nmitted himself to reconstructing the history ofChristianity in Japan by collecting a total of 14,000items; it is the largest collection concerning feudal\nJapan outside of Japan. This heritage is also remarkable\nbecause it contains some extraordinary autobiographicaldrawings made by Don Marega himself \u2013as o r to f\ncomic-book-style story, narrating his life up to 1945.In 1953, Don Marega, through the Apostolic Nuncioin Japan, managed to send this material to the Vatican.\nThis collection proved dif \ufb01cult to catalogue for a\nwestern library, so the documents remained stored\naway for some years and were only studied in March\n2011.\n26In 2013, a collaborative project was launched\nbetween the Library and various Japanese academic\ninstitutions to preserve the collection, which involveddigitizing and cataloguing it in order to create a compre-\nhensive database.\n27This also led to a paleography and\nconservation workshop in October 2016 (Aoki and\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez Gait\u00e1n, 2019) and, subsequently, a paleography\nmanual was published (O \u0304ta, 2021).The examples provided illustrate the development\nof the collections and the evolution of the institutionduring a pivotal period in its recent history. During\nthis time, the Library embraced technologicaladvancements and integrated them seamlessly withits core mission. The adoption of widely recognized\ncooperation principles; the pioneering use of techno-\nlogical standards; participation in large-scale projectsto ensure the best possible preservation of and\naccess to its heritage; exchange and collaboration\nwith other institutions in shared projects; and themultidisciplinary application of technologies to\nensure optimal heritage access and preservation,\nthanks to the joint efforts and competences of thewhole staff \u2013all these signi \ufb01cant moments in the\nLibrary \u2019s history can be accurately reconstructed\nfrom the records accumulated in its various archives.The overall wealth of these sources will providefuture scholars with a broad array of materials, includ-\ning paper-based, photographic and digital resources.\nEach piece of information is a tile in a vast and com-posite mosaic.

Japanese librarians were often sent abroad to observe and study library practices, attend inter-\nnational conferences, and receive professional library education. Others went overseas to teach Japanese lan-\nguage and culture, collecting Japanese books and materials for educational purposes and managing them as areastudy librarians. Additionally, many political and business \ufb01gures participated in international library activities.\nThis paper explores the motivations behind the involvement of Japanese individuals in international libraryactivities and conferences before World War II, shedding light on the historical context and the key \ufb01gures\nwho acted as bridges between Japanese and international librarianship.\nKeywords\nInternational Librarian Conference, international librarianship, Japan Association for the League of Nations,\nJapanese librarians, library history, League of Nations\nIntroduction\nOld issues of the Japan Library Association \u2019s( J L A )\nLibrary Journal (\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u96d1\u8a8cToshokan-Zassi ) included\nseveral photos and articles on the \ufb01rst IFLA conference\nin Rome in 1929. Those articles reported on that\nmeeting and stated that Izumi Morimoto ( \u68ee\u672c\u6cc9)\nattended the conference and made a speech ( Toshokan\nZassi , 1929). He was not known among Japan library\nhistory researchers. Although Morimoto reported onthe IFLA conference, nothing he did after the conference\nrelated to librarianship or library science. He was aformer appointed Governor of Yamagata and retired\nDeputy Mayor of Yokohama. Who was he? Why did\nhe attend this IFLA \u2019s\ufb01rst meeting in Rome? Were\nthere any other Japanese librarians attending the \ufb01rst\nIFLA conference? Also, the Japan Association for theLeague of Nations ( \u56fd\u969b\u9023\u76df\u5354\u4f1a) played a key role\nin international library activities in the 1920s and\n1930s. What was the Japan Association for the\nLeague of Nations?\nBefore the Rome IFLA conference, the Carnegie\nEndowment for International Peace (CEIP) donated\nbooks to the Tokyo City Library (now Tokyo\nMetropolitan Library) in 1921 (Yoshida, 2015). Whydid a U.S. library-related foundation donate books toJapan? Why did the Tokyo City Library accept those\nbooks? What did international library exchange activ-\nities between Japan and overseas countries look like inthis important period of library development?\nThis paper will analyze the international library\nactivity between Japan and overseas countries beforeWorld War II by using JLA \u2019sLibrary Journal issues\nfrom the \ufb01rst one to 1945. This paper aimed to \ufb01nd\nkey people who acted as bridges between Japan andinternational librarians. There were several journalsrelated to library activities, but most of them published\narticles on local and very limited themes. The Library\nJournal was a key national periodical in the early 20th\ncentury for librarians and library-related readers.

In 1912, Emperor Meiji died, and his\nson, Emperor Taisho, succeeded him to the throne,\nserving as Emperor for a short time before his death\nin 1926. In addition, the Kanto mega-earthquake hitthe Tokyo area in 1923, and many libraries burned.\nSame as Japan, intrnational community was facing\nconfused after the World War I, revolution in theRussian Empire, and so on. Founding of the League\nof Nations might be expected to reconstruct coopera-\ntive harmonzed international society.\nSource:From the \ufb01rst issue of Toshokan Zassi\n[Library Journal] in 1907 (\u660e\u6cbb40\u5e74\uff09to the issue\nNo.295 in1945( \u662d\u548c20\u5e74), analyzed by author.\nThrough an analysis of articles published in the\nLibrary Journal focusing on overseas library activities\nand librarians, a clear trend emerges within the\nJapanese library community(Figure 1). As described\nin the table, Japanese librarians focused their attentionon library developments and trends within the US and\nEurope between 1906 and 1915. Publications focused\non international library trends, which, understandably,lagged during World War I.\nThe post-war period, however, demonstrated\nrenewed interest in professional activities abroad. Bythe late 1920s, the JLA \u2019sLibrary Journal published\narticles on international library activities in Europeancountries like Greece, Belgium, Denmark, andGermany; there were also articles on Russia andChina. Despite a clear editorial interest in international\nlibrary activities, it is hard to say how much these arti-\ncles in \ufb02uenced Japanese librarians and library devel-\nopments. A few library cases were clearly in \ufb02uenced\nby overseas library activities.Two well-known examples of international in \ufb02u-\nence on Japanese libraries are the Kyoto Prefecture\n(municipal) Public Library (Inoue, 1969) and the\nYamaguchi Prefecture (municipal) Public Library(Ishii, 1953a,b). In 1903 or 1904, both started travel-ing libraries, children \u2019s services, partially open\nstacks, and extension services to schools or schoollibraries, even though most prefecture (municipal)libraries offered books to men with a charge. In this\nperiod, only men who were house owners and tax-\npayers could enter library buildings and borrowbooks, paying a small fee each time.Other men with\nproof letters by landlord or public of \ufb01cers could use\npublic libraries. There were a few examples where\nwomen were allowed in library buildings with\nwomen-only rooms. Only four municipal libraries\nallowed boys to enter (where there were boys \u2019\nrooms), but no girls. Both the Kyoto and Yamaguchilibraries were seemingly in \ufb02uenced by early 20th\ncentury US American library activities because bothdirectors studied librarianship in the US and readAmerican library journals. The nascent in \ufb02uence of\nWestern models of librarianship was seeminglylinked to increased mobility and personal exchangeby individuals who had the opportunity to study and\ntravel abroad(Ishii, 1976b-f).\nKey persons involved in international\nlibrary exchange activities\nBeyond the JLA \u2019sLibrary Journal , other library per-\niodicals and newspapers indicate some key people in\nthe library \ufb01eld. Most of them, however, were high-\nranking public of \ufb01cers who were not trained librar-\nians. After reviewing these materials, four categories\nof key people that impacted international exchanges\nwithin the Japanese library community wereidenti \ufb01ed.\nLibrary directors\nPrior to the Great Kanto Earthquake, many directors orpeople at high hierarchical levels at large libraries were\nordered by the Japanese government or local governors\nto go overseas to observe library activities. Thesepeople were public of \ufb01cers who sometimes had\nstrong political power in the local, regional, andnational government, and most of them had littlelibrary experience. Traveling overseas necessitated sig-ni\ufb01cant money and time, so directors of large libraries\nwere sent by the national or local government.According to several newspaper articles, the ImperialLibrary Director Kiichi Matsumoto ( \u677e\u672c\u559c\u4e00) used\nstudy-abroad students \u2019budgets to go overseas andInoue: International in \ufb02uence over Japanese libraries before World War II 811\nattend the 1926 Americna Library Association(ALA)\nannual meeting in Philadelphia, preventing those stu-\ndents from going overseas ( Asahi Simbun , 1926).\nSome of library directors who went overseas were:\n\u0081Inagi Tanaka ( \u7530\u4e2d\u7a32\u57ce; 1856 \u20131925), Director\nof Tokyo Imperial University Library and the\n\ufb01rst JLA President. Visited the US and UK\nbetween 1888 and 1890 (Nagao, 2016).\n\u0081Kichiro Yuasa ( \u6e6f\u6d45\u5409\u90ce; 1858 \u20131943),\nDirector of Kyoto Prefecture (municipal)\nPublic Library, Professor at Kyoto University\nand Doshisha University, and a poet. Studiedat Library School in Chicago, US between1902 and 1903 (JLA, 2016).\n\u0081Mankichi Wada ( \u548c\u7530\u4e07\u5409; 1865 \u20131934),\nLibrarian and Professor at Tokyo ImperialUniversity Library, and second JLA President.\nVisited the US and Europe between 1909 and\n1910 (JLA, 2016).\n\u0081Kan\u2019ichi Imai ( \u4eca\u4e95\u8cab\u4e00; 1870 \u20131940),\nDirector of Osaka Prefecture (municipal)Public Library. Visited the US, UK, andGermany between 1912 and 1913 (JLA, 2016).\n\u0081Tomosaburo Sano ( \u4f50\u91ce\u53cb\u4e09\u90ce; 1864 \u20131920),\nDirector of the Akita and YamaguchiMunicipal Public Library. Visited the US in1915 (Ishii, 1981). After he returned to Japan,\nhe published a book titled Beikoku Toshokan\nJijyou \u2013The library situation in the United\nStates (\u7c73\u56fd\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u4e8b\u60c5) in 1920 (Sano,\n1920).\n\u0081Bunjirou Shima ( \u5cf6\u6587\u6b21\u90ce; 1871 \u20131945),\nDirector and Professor at Kyoto ImperialUniversity Library. Visited the US, UK, and\nFrance from 1918 to 1920 ( Kyoto University\nLibrary , n.d.).\n\u0081Ki\u2019ichi Matsumoto ( \u677e\u672c\u559c\u4e00; 1881 \u20131945),\nDirector of the Imperial Library. Visited theUS and Europe from 1926 to 1927 (JLA, 2016).\nThese directors were high-ranking public of \ufb01cers,\nappointed as directors by local or regional governors.\nThese governors were appointed by the National\nJapan Government rather than being elected of \ufb01cials.\nThus, for political reasons, indicated by those govern-\nors\u2019political power, these directors were sent over-\nseas. Some among them wrote articles or presented\nlectures, or even changed library activities, likeYuasa and Sano, who tried to introduce free access\nopen stacks, traveling libraries to schools, or chil-\ndren \u2019s services, as noted previously. These new ser-\nvices, however, did not expand throughout Japan\nduring this period.Students of librarianship who studied overseas\nThe second group of key people enrolled in profes-\nsional programs in the US or Europe, includingseveral women. They earned library degrees and\nwere \ufb01nancially supported by the Japanese govern-\nment. Most people returned after \ufb01nishing their pro-\ngrams or were sent back to Japan with the onset of\nWorld War II, like the case of Naomi Fukuda ( \u798f\u7530\n\u306a\u3092\u307f ; Yasue, 2020).\n\u0081Kichiro Yuasa ( \u6e6f\u6d45\u5409\u90ce; 1853 \u20131943)\nattended the University of Chicago LibrarySchool and NY Albany Library School (US)\nfrom 1902 to 1904. He earned a PhD in\nBiblical Studies and Hebrew from YaleUniversity (US) and was Professor at Kyoto\nImperial University in Japan. After \ufb01nishing\nlibrary studies, Yuasa returned to Kyoto and\nwas appointed Director of the Kyoto\nPrefecture (municipal) Public Library. He tried\nto activate US American public library practicesin the Kyoto Public Library. However, he was\nremoved from his post as library director\nwhen the Kyoto governor was replaced andYuasa lost his political backing. Later, Yuasagot a teaching position at Doshisha University\nin Kyoto and published works of poetry\n(Takanashi, 2007 ; Ishii, 1976e,f ; Doshisha,n.d.).\n\u0081Seigoro Kitsui ( \u6a58\u4e95\u6e05\u4e94\u90ce;?\u20131947) attended\nUniversity College London (UK) from 1913 to1914. After returning to Japan, he was a librar-\nian at Namki Bunko ( \u5357\u8475\u6587\u5eab), which is now\na part of the Tokyo University Library \u2019s collec-\ntion (Rin, 2019).\n\u0081Chieko Hirano ( \u5e73\u91ce\u5343\u6075\u5b50; 1878 \u20131939)\nattended Simmons College Library School\n(Boston, US) from 1914 to 1916. She was the\ufb01rst Japanese woman to study library science\nat Simmons. After \ufb01nishing the program, she\nbecame a librarian at the Boston Museum ofFine Arts and wrote a bibliographical book on\nUkiyo-e (Hirano, 1939). Hirano graduated\nfrom the Joshi Eigaku juku \u2013English\nLanguage School for Girls ( \u5973\u5b50\u82f1\u5b66\u587e). The\nschool was founded by the prominent educatorUmeko Tsuda( \u6d25\u7530\u6885\u5b50) and continues as the\nTsuda Women \u2019s College. Tsuda was sent over-\nseas to a school in the US as a governmental\nstudent when she was six years old and stayed\nfor 10 years, from 1871 to 1882. She alsoattended university in the US from 1889 to\n1892. Tsuda established a foundation to812 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nsupport women \u2019s education to send Japanese\nwomen to study overseas. Hirano was the \ufb01rst\nJapanese woman to study library science in\nBoston through \ufb01nancial support from Tsuda \u2019s\nfoundation in 1914. Tsuda \u2019s school was sup-\nported by many Japanese and American\npeople, including Inazo Nitobe ( \u65b0\u6e21\u6238\u7a32\u9020),\nwho was Vice Secretary of the League of\nNations from 1920 to 1927.\n\u0081Miyogo Ohsa ( \u5927\u4f50\u4e09\u56db\u4e94; 1809 \u20131967)\nattended Columbia University \u2019s Library\nSchool from 1926 to 1928, earning a Master\nof Arts. He was a librarian and the Director of\nthe South Manchurian Railway Library(Tomotani, 2004). When Ohsa was a young\nstaff member at libraries founded by the\nManchurian Railway Company (Japan) inChina, he wanted to study library science inthe US. He asked the company to send him to\nColumbia in New York City. After \ufb01nishing\nthe program, Ohsa returned to his Manchurian\nRailway Library work.\n\u0081Naomi Fukuda ( \u798f\u7530\u306a\u3092\u307f ; 1907 \u20132007)\nattended the University of Michigan LibrarySchool from 1937 to 1939. Even though she\nworked at the Library of Congress, she was\nsent back to Japan during World War II, andworked at the Tokyo Imperial UniversityLibrary. After the war, Fukuda returned to the\nUS to work at the Maryland University\nLibrary and the Michigan University Library(Yasue, 2020).\nOverseas area studies librarians\nThe third group of key people were not originallylibrarians but traveled abroad to collect educational\nmaterials; they also created Japanese area studies col-\nlections within research universities. Through thiswork, they in \ufb02uenced the management skill of large\nuniversity and research library collectionss related toJapanese culture and language matrial collections.\n\u0081Toshio Eto ( \u885b\u85e4\u5229\u592b; 1883 \u20131953) worked for\nthe South Manchurian Railway Library as a\nlibrarian and director from 1931 to 1941\n(Maruyama and Tanaka, 1980). As he hadbeen workd at the library in Japanesearmy occupied Manchuria until the end of\nWorld War II, Eto could be worked both\nat overseas and Japan. Under his management,the Manchurian Railway Library changed\nfrom a public library to a military connectedinformation center. His librarian colleagues\nreturned to Japan after World War II and\nworked at large and mid-sized libraries, includ-\ning the National Diet Library. Eto himselfbecame a President of the JLA after the war(Maruyama and Tanaka, 1980).\n\u0081Kan\u2019ichi Asakawa ( \u671d\u6cb3\u8cab\u4e00; 1873 \u20131948)\nworked at Dartmouth and Yale universitiesfrom 1902 to 1942 as a professor and librarian.\nAsakawa traveled throughout Japan and col-\nlected Japanese language materials for the col-lections at both university libraries (Matsutani,\n2014).\n\u0081Ryusaku Tsunoda ( \u89d2\u7530\u67f3\u4f5c; 1877 \u20131964)\nserved as a number of educational roles inNorth America before beginning his af \ufb01liation\nwith Columbia University, where he worked\nfrom 1928 to 1948 as a professor of Japaneselanguage and culture and a librarian (Yanai,\n1994). He is credited with founding\nColumbia \u2019s Japanese collections.\n\u0081Miho Sakanishi ( \u5742\u897f\u5fd7\u4fdd; 1896 \u20131976)\nworked at the Library of Congress as a bibliog-rapher from 1930 to 1942 and taught at HollinsUniversity. After being sent back to Japan\nduring World War II, she worked at the\nInternational Cultural Center in Tokyo(Sakanishi-san editorial board, 1977).\n\u0081Masao Senda ( \u4ed9\u7530\u6b63\u96c4; 1901 \u20131977) worked\nat the Library of Congress as a bibliographerfrom 1931 to 1941. After returning to Japan,he taught librarianship at Tenri University in\nNara (Prof. Senda Masao as a memory of his\nseventy years of age memorial group, 1970).\nAf\ufb01liates of the Japan Association for the League of\nNations\nLastly, the \ufb01nal key group of people were not librarians\nbut acted internationally, often advocating library activ-ities. The members of the Japan Association for theLeague of Nations ( \u56fd\u969b\u9023\u76df\u5354\u4f1a) made up the bulk\nof the group, including the association \u2019s President\nEiichi Shibusawa ( \u6e0b\u6ca2\u6804\u4e00), as well as Inazo\nNitobe (\u65b0\u6e21\u6238\u7a32\u9020), Koujiro Miyaoka ( \u5bae\u5ca1\u6052\u6b21\n\u90ce), and Junzo Satou ( \u4f50\u85e4\u9187\u9020). They positively pro-\nmoted international library activities from 1920 to 1933as a means to promote both internationalism and peace.Additionally, these individuals were prominent\nmembers of the Japanese society.\nThe Japanese government had the intention to be a\nrecognized \ufb01gure on the international stage, including\nat the League of Nations. It tried to show JapaneseInoue: International in \ufb02uence over Japanese libraries before World War II 813\ninternational activities were not only governmentally\nand politically driven, but also a citizen-supported\nmovement. Most members of the Japan Association\nfor the League of Nations were not librarians,though some of them were directors of universitylibraries, including the director of the Tokyo\nImperial University Library. Still, those directors\nwere high-ranking public of \ufb01cers appointed by the\nJapanese government. Regardless of their political\naf\ufb01liations, this group was eager to promote inter-\nnational peace through library activities.\nInternational conferences and Japan\nWhile the JLA experienced a declining number of arti-\ncles on international activities and libraries (Figure 1),the Japan Association for the League of Nations parti-\ncipated in library activities internationally from the\n1920s to the 1930s. One of the reasons for the poorsupport to international library activities by the JLA\nwas \ufb01nancial constraints. As a non-governmental\norganization, the JLA was supported by its members\nand not by a government ministry directly. Although\nthe Japan Association for the League of Nations was\nalso an NGO, it was founded and \ufb01nanced by\nlawyers and business people who had mostly gradu-ated from the Tokyo Imperial University Law\nSchool and could convince other business people to\ndonate money, including those at the Ministry ofInternational Affairs (Iwamoto, 2005).\nThere were two streams of international meetings or\nconferences. One was organized by professional librar-ians\u2019groups, and talked mainly about bibliography and\nprofessional technical library works. The other was apart of the activities of the League of Nations andcovered copyright issues, art and cultural preservation,\nand the exchange of materials among involved\nnations(International Bureau - Intellectual Cooperation,\n1919 \u20131927 ; Bibliographica l Sub-Commitee, 1922).\nA representative from Japan joined the\nInternational Libraries Conference meeting in 1897for the \ufb01rst time, with a secretary from the Japanese\nEmbassy in London, Enjiro Yamaza ( \u5c71\u5ea7\u5186\u6b21\u90ce),\nin attendance. There was no record or report on thatmeeting in the JLA \u2019sLibrary Journal . In 1920, the\nJLA decided to join the International Bibliographical\nAssociation(Congres des bibliothecaires et biblio-\nphies,1923 ; Bibliographical Sub-Committee, 1922 :Johnston, 1922), but it did not send anyone to attendthose meetings. Izumi Morimoto ( \u68ee\u672c\u6cc9) attended\nthe 1929 conference of the World Congress ofLibrarianship and Bibliography in Rome, and hisreport was published in the Library Journal\n(Toshokan Zassi, 1929). Morimoto was not a librarianand had no experience working at libraries. It isunclear why he attended the conference, but the JLA\nmay have invited him to attend simply because he hap-\npened to be in Europe at the time of the meeting.\nJunzo Satou ( \u4f50\u85e4\u9187\u9020) also attended meetings\n(Asahi Shimbun 1926. He observed the 1922\nmeeting of the International Committee of\nIntellectual Cooperation; and when he was in Paris,the JLA wanted him to attend meetings on their\nbehalf. However, the JLA did not \ufb01nancially support\nhim. Instead, the Japan Association for the League\nof Nations supported Satou \u2019s attendance. Inazo\nNitobe (\u65b0\u6e21\u6238\u7a32\u9020), who served as the second sec-\nretary of the League of Nations from 1920 to 1926,was in charge of the International Committee of\nIntellectual Cooperation, so Satou was taken to\nattend the meeting with other diplomats and stafffrom the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Satouwas recruited by Henri Bonnet (UNESCO, n.d.\n; Bonnet, n.d.), who was secretary of the Institute of\nInternational Cultural Cooperation of the League ofNations (Shibusawa E 1931a; Satou, 1980).\nAlthough Satou resigned as a staff member of the\nJapan Association for the League of Nations inTokyo, he was soon funded by the organization as a\nvisiting scholar (Satou, 1980).\nSatou continued attending the International\nLibrarian Committee \u2019s meetings on behalf of the\nLeague of Nations at the 10th meeting in Paris in1936, the 11th meeting in Brussels in 1937, and the\n12th meeting in The Hague in 1938. Even thoughthe Japanese government walked away from the\nLeague of Nations in 1933, Sato worked at the\nInstitute of International Cultural Cooperation inParis until 1940 ( Japan Times , 1940). He was the\nonly Asian to attend these \u201cinternational \u201dmeetings,\nwhere everyone else was European (Satou, 1937).He kept the Japan Association for the League of\nNations and the JLA informed on library-related activ-\nities overseas during a period that saw Japan increas-ingly isolated by the international community.\nAfter returning to Japan, Satou was appointed\nof\ufb01cer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent to\nthe Of \ufb01ce of Information Department of the\nJapanese Embassy in Vietnam due to his French lan-\nguage ability and experience in Paris. After World\nWar II, he was arrested and put into political prisonfor almost three years (Satou, 1980).\nJapan Association for the League of\nNations and library activities\nIn the early 20th century, the US engaged in anti-\nimmigration activities that impacted its relations with814 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nJapan and East Asia. In 1924, the US Immigration\nExclusion Law was passed, prohibiting most Japanese\nimmigrants to enter into the US. To avoid this new\nlaw, the Japanese government unof \ufb01cially demanded\nthat Japanese international lawyers and businesspeopleorganize a citizen activism group to question on this\nlaw and appeal the \u201cunfair \u201doverseas political move-\nment. The Japanese government aimed to advocate\ninternationally and gather support from European or\nother nations to resist the US new immigration law\n(Ikei, 1995; Sibusawa E, 1927; Terada, 2015). EiichiShibusawa ( \u6e0b\u6ca2\u6804\u4e00) was appointed president of\nthis group, Japan Association for the League ofNations. He was a powerful business tycoon whofounded and assisted the co-founding of over 500 com-\npanies, banks, and organizations.\nOver the years, the governing board of the Japan\nAssociation for the League of Nations changed signi \ufb01-\ncantly. One notable board member, Yoshiro Sakatani(\u962a\u8c37\u82b3\u90ce), attended the in \ufb02uential 1911 business and\neconomic conference organized by the Carnegie\nEndowment for International Peace(CEIP) in Bern.\nBoard member Kenzo Takayanagi ( \u9ad8\u67f3\u8ce2\u4e09)w a sa\nlawyer and law professor at Tokyo Imperial University\nand the director of their university library. Koujiro\nMiyaoka ( \u5bae\u5ca1\u6052\u6b21\u90ce) was a board member and an\ninternational lawyer who helped the CEIP donate\nbooks to the Tokyo City Library in 1921(Yoshida,2015). Board member Aikitsu Tanakadate ( \u7530\u4e2d\u9928\u611b\n\u6a58) was a physicist and Japanese representative to the\nLeague of Nations from 1927 to 1933. Beyond boardmembers, Inazo Nitobe, Junzo Sato, and more\nlibrary-related scholars and political of \ufb01cers joined\nthis association as core activists.\nThe purpose of the Japan Association for the League\nof Nations was to promote the spirit of the League of\nNations in Japan. Their main activities included researchand public opinion surveys on the League of Nations,\nlectures and publishing, communication with allied orga-\nnizations in Japan and overseas, and ensuring representa-tion in 1920 meetings of the League of Nations(Shibusawa, 1931a). The Association sent Sato to inter-\nnational library conferences in Europe. In addition, it\nhelped to found branch activity groups in rural areasand student clubs at colleges and universities, including\nWaseda University, Keio University, Tokyo Imperial\nUniversity, Kobe Women \u2019s College, Tokyo Women \u2019s\nCollege, and Nippon Women \u2019s College. They further\nworked with women \u2019s activity clubs to spread the ideas\nof the League of Nations to a wider range of citizens.\nThe association also had a Business Committee, a\nDisarmament Committee, an Opium Committee, andan Intellectual Cooperation Committee. The OpiumCommittee demanded that the Japanese governmentestablish a law to prohibit opium. Meanwhile, theIntellectual Cooperation Committee sent people to\nGeneva to attend meetings and cooperated with the\nhead of \ufb01ce to discuss the preservation and conserva-\ntion of art works, copyright issues, and more. TheIntellectual Cooperation Committee \u2019s activities also\nincluded library activities (International Bureau -Intelletual Cooperation, 1919 \u20131927). Once the\nCommittee on Library Professionals was set up as a\nsub-committee of the League of Nations, the Japan\nAssociation for the League of Nations tried to be a\npart of it (Bibliographical Sub-Committee, 1922).\nPublications from the association included a\nmonthly periodical titled The League of Nations and\nan English-language monograph titled The Yearbook\nof Japanese Art , to promote Japanese culture overseas.\nIn addition to publications, promotion activitiesincluded traveling lectures in Japan, Taiwan,Manchu (West-Northern China), and Korea as well\nas lectures on radio programs.\nBeyond lectures, other international activities were\nfruitful. For example, the restoration project of theUniversit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain (Belgium), burned\nduring World War I by Germany, stimulated citizensto donate money and send rare books and materials\nto the university \u2019s library (Schivelbursch, 1988;\nSibusawa (1931b). The Japan Association for the\nLeague of Nations requested that Japanese culturalorganizations donate Japanese documents, including\nrare, illustrated hand scrolls, to the Universit\u00e9\nCatholique de Louvain \u2019s library. By requesting that\nthese rare manuscripts be included in the Universit\u00e9\nCatholique de Louvain \u2019s library, the association tried\nto establish that Japanese art works were world\nclass. In addition, these efforts linked Japanese\nsociety to internationalist efforts that sought to\nrebuild the library (Schivelbusch, 1992; Shibusawa,1931b; Witt, 2020).\nSimilarly, in September 1923, there was a major\nearthquake in the Kanto area and most Tokyo-arealibraires were destroyed. The League of NationsUnion (London, UK) sent a telegram to the Japan\nAssociation for the League of Nations asking how\nthey could help libraries, while the JLA sent letters over-seas asking international organizations to donate books\nto Japan.

No library associations\nor institutions sent books to Japan, but allied organiza-\ntions and religious groups did. Later, those books weredivided into several university libraries in Japan.\nThe Japan Association for the League of Nations\nsent a recommendation statement in 1927 on youtheducation, welfare, and the enrichment of school\nlibraries to the League of Nations. This recommenda-\ntion re \ufb02ected Shibusawa \u2019s ideas and philosophy.\nThrough his wealth, he contributed to education andsocial welfare within Japan. This included the estab-\nlishment of schools from elementary to university\nlevels, like the Nippon Women \u2019s College and the\nHitotsubashi University (founded as Tokyo\nCommerce College). After Shibusawa \u2019s\u201cof\ufb01cial\u201d\nretirement, he continued to advocate social welfare\npromotion activities (Shibusawa, 1931a).\nThe Japan Association for the League of Nations\nended its activities in 1931 for mainly four reasons.Firstly, most active members were also members ofdifferent but similar organizations. Secondly, the mili-\ntary government pushed organizations into smaller\nnumbers for easier control. Thirdly, the GreatDepression led the association into \ufb01nancial trouble.\nLastly, one of the governing board members, DrNitobe made unof \ufb01cial but critical statement on mili-\ntary arms caused a heated discussion among citizens\nand led to the dwindling support for the association.\nConclusion\nBefore World War II, Japanese librarians were highly\ninterested in overseas library activities, particularly in\nthe US and Europe, but this interest did not expand intopractical changes to Japanes e library activities. Some uni-\nversity libraries might have introduced European aca-\ndemic library management systems, but they were few.Some public library directors like Yuasa in Kyoto or\nSano in Yamaguchi tried to promote more user-friendly\nlibrary activities like open stacks, children \u2019s services,\nwomen \u2019s services, and free-of-charge usage, but once\nthey lost political support fro m local and municipal polit-\nical power, those services were not expanded (Ishii A,1953a,1953b, 1976c,e,f,k,q).\nMost directors who went overseas were high-ranking\npublic of \ufb01cers and not librarians. They publishedarticles and reports from conferences or visits to librar-ies, but rarely shared practical or technical innovations.\nTheir reports did not in \ufb02uence most Japanese librarians.\nThese public of \ufb01cers regarded overseas visits as a\nreward for being high-ranking of \ufb01cers rather than as a\nmeans to import new ideas about librarianship andlibraries being developed in North America and\nEurope. The JLA was strongly in \ufb02uenced by the\nMinistry of Education and the national government \u2019s\npolicy, but not by ideas or philosophies promotinglibrary activities for common people. The Ministry ofEducation targeted its library activities towards internal\ncultural and educational affairs, not international ones.\nInternational cultural and educational activities wereinstead promoted by the Ministry of International\nAffairs. The JLA could have followed that trend, but it\nwas focused on libraries, not international activities. Itis hard to say how many readers of the JLA \u2019sLibrary\nJournal were interested in overseas library activities or\ninternational conferences on libraries. The theme ofJapanese librarian scholarship should be deeply ana-lyzed via library journal articles in conversation with\nother contemporary publications.\nWithin Japan, international library activities took\nplace outside of library associations or professionallibrarian associations, and often for political reasons,\nwith a clear example being the Japan Association forthe League of Nations. Librarians discussed biblio-graphic control or professional technical dimensions\nof libraries, but not international cooperation. The\nreasons associations like the Japan Association for theLeague of Nations committed to library activities on\nan international stage should be examined further in\nthe future. The Japan Association for the League ofNations might have assumed that joining international\nconferences on library and art \ufb01elds was a vital cultural\nstage of international politics. Comparison to other\nAssociations for the League of Nations in the US and\nEurope or other countries may indicate similar \ufb01ndings\nto this association \u2019s activities in Japan. In addition,\nthese activities should be placed in dialogue with\nWitt\u2019s work on the role of the Carnegie Endowment\nfor International Peace in promoting libraries as vehi-cles for internationalism in ways similar to those bythe Japan Association for the League of Nations\n(Witt, 2021). Even though US President Woodrow\nWilson proposed the establishment of the League ofNations, the US did not join it. Instead, several\nprivate (US) associations such as the CEIP attempted\nto join international activities through the culturalrealms of libraries, art, book donations, and education.\nTheir promotion of these \ufb01elds may have in \ufb02uenced the\nactivities of the Japan Association for the League of\nNations for the purpose of world peace.

The Van-\ncouver Sun was founded in 1912 \u2018to consistently\nadvocate the principles of Liberalism\u2019 (Roy and Pot-\nter, 2010). At its peak in the 1970s, the Vancouver Sun\nreached a daily reading audience of more than\n245,000. The Vancouver Province was founded as the\nVancouver Daily Province in 1898 (O\u2019Clery and Pot-\nter, 2013) and, at its peak, its circulation was a more\nmodest 127,000 (Stephens et al., 1976). Currently, the\npolitical position of both newspapers is described as\ncentre-right due to their editorial coverage, and they\nhave high ratings for their fact-checking (Media Bias\nFact Check, 2023a).\nThe genesis of the work to gather and preserve the\nhistory of a newspaper library arose following current\ndiscussions on the need to preserve the history of\nlibraries and library associations (IFLA LibraryHistory Special Interest Group, 2023). Today,\nnewspaper libraries, along with many of their parent\nnewspapers, have largely disappeared either as print\neditions or by ceasing to operate entirely. During their\nhistories, newspaper libraries bridged the physical\npublishing environment of the 20th century into the\ndigital era of the 21st, and the collections they devel-\noped hold persistent value for historical and cultural\npurposes.\nSpecifically, this article examines the case of the\ndecline of a major metropolitan newspaper company,\nthe subsequent closure of the library that served two\nnewsrooms, and the dissolution of its collections. A\nnarrative inquiry approach was used to gather the\nstories of the individuals involved in the develop-\nments of the newspaper library over time.

In reviewing the literature on news-\npaper libraries, there ar e consistent themes that\nemerge related to the value and purpose of newspaper\nlibraries from the industrial age into the digital era. In\nthe 18th and 19th centuries, newspapers frequently\nheld collections of reference materials for the research\nneeds of their editorial staff. By the 1850s, a number\nof newspapers had fully formed libraries that not only\nheld reference materials but were also responsible for\nthe work of creating clipping files to support the\nresearch and information needs of their newsrooms\n(Hansen and Paul, 2015; Mills, 1981). Beyond the\ncollection of clipped article s, newspaper librarians\nconsidered the creation of an index to the clippings\nessential as \u2018insurance against the loss of the clip-\npings\u2019 (Mills, 1981: 476). Indexes quickly became a\nrequired tool in all news libraries, with early examples\nincluding the New York Herald \u2019s first index to its\nnews clippings developed in 1860 (Hansen and Paul,\n2015: 291).\nThe Special Libraries Association, founded in\n1909, provided opportunities for newspaper librarians\nto share their expertise and developments in library\npractices, such as in collecting, organizing and filing\nnewspaper resources to provide efficient, timely and\nvaluable service to their newsrooms. In his December\n1931 year in review, Joseph Sheridan, chairman of the\nSpecial Libraries Association Newspaper Group,\nshared words of great optimism on the role of news-\npaper libraries:\nThe newspaper library is constantly expanding. It is\ngrowing in importance each year ...The other depart-\nments in a well-organized newspaper are becoming\ngreatly dependent upon the library department for infor-\nmation ...the newspaper plant which has an efficient\nreference library is far ahead of the plants which do not\nhave reference libraries. (Sheridan, 1931: 437)\nAt the same time, he exhorts newspaper librarians to\n\u2018make themselves and their departments more effi-\ncient\u2019 because \u2018[t]ime is a factor in every newspaper\nplant\u2019 (437). The focus of the efficiencies in libraries\nbecame a persistent theme over the 20th century,although it was initially related to the need to improve\naccess to clips through classification systems.\nNewspaper libraries, as did other corporate or\nspecial libraries, led in library innovation. Black\n(2011: 3) describes the developments in special\nlibraries as \u2018arenas where, like in no other, the pro-\nfessional identities of library and information profes-\nsionals were tested and formed\u2019. The Special\nLibraries Association\u2019s journal offered newspaper\nlibrarians the opportunity to share their successes and\ninitiatives with their colleagues. The 1931 issue of the\njournal contains reports from libraries in Great Britain\nand the USA on their information management prac-\ntices. A report on the space designated for the news-\npaper library in the new offices of London\u2019s Daily\nTelegraph , for example, explained that while there\nwere traditional library resources, the newspaper clip-\npings were the critical resources of the library: \u2018the\ncuttings file constitutes the backbone of the Depart-\nment\u2019 (Macer-Wright, 1931: 440). Not only the col-\nlection but also the organization of those materials\nwas understood to be key for both mediated and\nunmediated retrieval: \u2018The cuttings are filed on an\nalphabetical-numerical system and as simply as pos-\nsible, so that anyone should be able to find what he\nwants if there is none of the Library staff available\u2019\n(Macer-Wright, 1931: 440). Further forms of annota-\ntions or indexing meant that newspaper libraries, such\nas those of the London Daily Herald andDaily Mail ,\ncreated card systems for the management of and\naccess to stories: \u2018Several hundred cards are written\neach day, and on these each name and incident is\npicked out, thus dealing with the news in a far more\ndetailed way than is possible in the cuttings\u2019 (Griffiths,\n1931: 443).\nNewspaper libraries served a gap in addressing\ninformation needs at a time when print and radio news\nwas predominant, and prior to the proliferation of tele-\nvision in the home. For some corporate libraries,\naddressing this gap became part of the continuum of\ntheir work, as they recognized the value to the general\npublic of the information that was collected for other\npurposes (Kozak, 2022). For example, in 1931, the\ninformation service of the Seattle Times (USA), enti-\ntled \u2018Main-0300\u2019, delivered telephone service informa-\ntion to up to 15,000 citizens per day, 24 hours per day:\nProblems touching all the school subjects are brought to\nthe librarians of the Bureau. Later in the evening their\nelders may request the most recent rulings on backgam-\nmon and contract bridge. Housewives, social leaders,\nmanufacturers and sportsmen call to save valuable time\nand to acquire needed information for planning future\naction. (Walsh, 1931: 447)821 Schachter and Millward: An oral history of the rise and fall of a newspaper library\nEven in 1939, at a time when much of the world was\nfocused on war, there was an understanding of the\nvalue of information access and the service that\nnewspaper libraries contributed to society:\nThe newspaper library is, in brief, a collection of still\npictures culled from the thrilling, and dull, romantic and\nprosaic, beautiful and horrible motion picture called\nlife ...the newspaper library stores away the happenings\nof current life as they occur. (Harr, 1939: 298)\nWhile other libraries collected the materials that\nprovided recollections and analysis of world events,\nthe newspaper library\u2019s collections were the point of\nview of the contemporary viewer. The value of the\npreservation of and access to these resources, however,\nwas little understood by the consumers of the day:\nFew of the millions who read our daily newspapers\nrealize that these accounts of current life would be only\nfragmentary, probably inaccurate ...were it not for the\nresources of the library behind the men who write the\nnews and the editorial writers who comment on it. (Harr,\n1939: 298)\nBy 1945, some newspaper libraries were finding\nthemselves falling behind other news departments in\ntheir access to resources and technology to enable\neffective research services for their journalists and\neditors. While clipping files and indexes were created\nin most libraries, there were no standards or policy\nacross newspaper libraries, in contrast to the growth\nin other library classification systems (Fenimore,\n1945). Over the subsequent decades of the 20th cen-\ntury, there was a pervasive thread of existential threat\nto newspaper libraries, as the newspapers themselves\nweathered cultural, economic and technological chal-\nlenges. British journalist John M Shaftesley felt\nimpelled to call for recognition of the importance of\nthe press libraries in the mid 1970s:\nMay I support wholeheartedly the plea ...for the rescu-\ning of press libraries from destruction when unfortunate\na newspaper is forced to close down ...concerned with\nthe priceless research material in the cuttings collec-\ntions, but I would add, even more importantly, the\nindexes of the newspapers themselves, so painstakingly\ncompiled over the years. (Shaftesley, 1974: 57)\nMicrofilm technology was taken up by many types of\nlibraries, including newspaper libraries (Mills, 1981),\nboth as a means of preservation and, most pragmati-\ncally, to save physical space: \u2018The Toronto Globe and\nMail began filming in 1954 and calculated that it could\nreduce fifteen cabinets of clippings into one microfi-\nche ...According to the Globe and Mail, to not convertto microform was penny-wise but pound foolish\u2019\n(Mills, 1981: 470). In 1971, the New York Times cre-\nated the first form of automated retrieval system by\nautomating access to its indexes and clippings: \u2018Within\na short time, the Information Bank was one of the larg-\nest databases in the world, with an annual input of\n100,000 New York Times articles\u2019 (Mills, 1981: 478).\nIn a discussion of the history of newspaper preser-\nvation, Hansen and Paul (2015) describe the impor-\ntance of maintaining print news-story files and\nindexes even while more efficient microfilm, bound\nvolumes and even digital archives were being used for\npreserving the print newspapers. Once digital archiving\nwas possible, however, the old collections were moved\ninto storage or relocated to other organizations: \u2018Some\ngave the clipping files to local historical societies or\nlibraries, which were equally under resourced to cata-\nlog and preserve them. And some organizations simply\nthrew them all away\u2019 (Hansen and Paul, 2015: 292).\nArchiving the digital output of a news organization\nwas not recognized as being of importance even as\nrecently as the late 1990s, meaning that the secondary\nuse of the materials was not understood by newspaper\nowners to have persistent value as a secondary prod-\nuct offering (Hansen and Paul, 2015). As Hansen and\nPaul\u2019s study of 10 newspapers reveals, newspaper\nlibraries were largely dismantled in the first decade\nof this century:\nNews library/research staffs have been decimated\nsince the mid-2000s. The most stunning example saw\nthe news library staff shrink from 20 people to three.\nOthers typically fell from 10\u201315 to one or two. These\nstaffers historically mana ged the newsprint archive\nand the photo files and then transitioned to manage\nthe digital database of the print product. (Hansen and\nPaul, 2015: 293)\nIn many cases, the ongoing preservation of traditional\nnewspaper articles continued through digital systems\ndeveloped in the 1990s and early 21st century. How-\never, web and other born-digital content is less likely\nto be preserved (Carner et al., 2014).\nIn today\u2019s environment of almost unfettered access\nto information, it is difficult to comprehend the very\ndifferent situation in the 20th century when \u2018no mod-\nern metropolitan paper could operate successfully for\na month without a library\u2019 (Harr, 1939: 300). As Mills\n(1981) notes, however, 20th-century scholarly per-\nspectives on the value of newspapers to the historical\nrecords were mixed. In response to the lack of per-\nceived value due to the perception of sensationalism\nand bias inherent in newspaper reporting and publish-\ning, Mills comments:822 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nThese scholars ...have failed to realize that the very\nunreliability of the newspaper is an important record of\nits environment. Newspapers not only record events with\nunique immediacy and impact, but they also preserve\nsociocultural attitudes and biases in their historical con-\ntext. (Mills, 1981: 464)\nToday, newspaper databases provide access to primary\nhistorical records for researchers, historians and policy-\nmakers in many nations. Preservation, access and\nincreased awareness of newspaper collections were\namong the purposes behind a recent newspaper digitiza-\ntion project at the British Library: \u2018The business case\nunderlying the Newspaper Strategy underlined the\nurgent need for digitization of the Newspaper Archive\nto enable the long-term preservation of the collection\nwith future access to the historic collection via surro-\ngates\u2019 (Stephens et al., 2014: 208). These themes of\naccess and preservation can be overlaid by the rapid\nevolution in publishing, technology, access and disse-\nmination of information through new and emerging\nmedia, including the rise of the Internet and social\nmedia. While today newspaper libraries have primarily\ndisappeared, the treasures of their labours persist\nthrough the interventio ns of national and public\nlibraries, archives, museums and historical societies,\npreserving the historical record for current and future\nresearchers and historians.\nThe case study methodology: an oral\nhistory of a newspaper library\nIn this section, we present a case study of the history\nand background of the Vancouver Sun andVancouver\nProvince newspaper library through the recollections\nof managers and librarians who worked at the news-\npaper library over a 60-year period, from 1968 to the\npresent day. A narrative inquiry (Bochner and Herr-\nmann, 2020) approach to oral history was used to\ncapture the recollections and reflections of library\nmanagers and librarians who led and played a part\nin the development of the library, its services and its\nproducts. This qualitative approach, through inter-\nviews that enabled storytelling, provided a rich under-\nstanding of the important role that the newspaper\nlibrary played from those who experienced the many\nchanges in these particular newspapers and the indus-\ntry at large.\nTwo library managers and three librarians\nresponsible for specific functions of the library were\ninterviewed through in-person and Zoom meetings in\nOctober 2023. Notes were transcribed during the\ninterviews. The questions asked were as follows:1. Tell us about your role at the Pacific Press\nnewspaper library, both over time and at the\ntime when you departed from the organization.\n2. Tell us what you believe most defined the role\nof that library to the two newspapers it served.\n3. What did you see as the role of the Pacific\nPress library to the city of Vancouver, prov-\nince of British Columbia and potentially\nCanada at large?\n4. What in the history of the Pacific Press library\nstands out to you as particular inflection points\nor critical developments?\n5. What specifically concerned or concerns you\nwith respect to the archiving, preservation and\naccess to the materials collected by the library?\nThe following sections provides a narrative of the\ncontributions to the development of the newspaper\nlibrary and its technological and digital evolution in\ntandem with its parent newspapers.\nAt its height in the 1990s, the library team com-\nprised a departmental manager and two librarians (a\nphotograph/negatives manager and a text-database\nmanager), 23 library assistants, and operated on a 24-\nhour, 7-days-a-week schedule. The physical library\nclosed in 2012 and the newspapers themselves persist\nin print and online to this day. The two newspapers\nwere combined into one newsroom following a move\nby the parent organization in 2017, and the combined\nphysical newsroom was then closed in 2023. All\nreporting, editing and other aspects of the two newspa-\npers\u2019 work continues remotely. In 2023, there is no\nlibrary, although one librarian remains, working for\nthe newsrooms and managing reprints/permissions\naspects of the original library work as well as other\nnon-library-related activities. Table 1, below, details\nthe interviews conducted.\nMergers and technological progress,\n1963\u20131991: Shirley Mooney\nShirley Mooney was hired as the Library Manager for\nPacific Press in 1968. Shortly before her hiring, the\nmerger of the Vancouver Sun andVancouver Prov-\nince newspapers was approved by the Canadian Com-\npetition Bureau, enabling the creation of a new parent\nentity for the two newspaper companies. Following a\nreview to determine the impact of the merger on the\nCanadian newspaper industry and local market, the\nnewspapers became a single entity known as Pacific\nPress. Under this unified parent company, the news-\npapers continued to operate as two distinct and\ncompeting newspapers.823 Schachter and Millward: An oral history of the rise and fall of a newspaper library\nThere was no functional library when Mooney was\nappointed to the role of manager: \u2018When I was hired,\nthe library was about two years old and had\nfunctioned without an acting head for most of the past\nyear. When the first librarian resigned to marry, her\njob was advertised\u2019. From the merger, 26 staff mem-\nbers, who cut and filed the clippings for their respec-\ntive newspapers, came together in the new shared\nlibrary, but the merger created a divisive culture in\nthe library. Further, a fundamental belief in the com-\npetitive nature of the two newspapers persisted, even\nwhen they became a single business entity. Due to this\ncompetitive culture, the editors for each of the news-\npapers instructed Mooney to keep their clippings sep-\narate and not let the other newsroom use their content.\nThis sense of competition would continue to charac-\nterize the ongoing relationship between the two news-\npapers for many decades. The result of these\ndirectives by senior editors was that the library was\nrequired to create separate keywording and indexing\nby separate sets of clerks for the respective newspaper\nclipping files.\nRoles of the library as viewed by the newsrooms\nThis \u2018two-headed monster\u2019 was squashed when Mooney\npersuaded the directors to remove the library from edi-\ntorial control and instead create an independent depart-\nment. This paved the way for the resource intensity of\ninformation management and retrieval; the development\nof more of a shared purpose of the library towards the\ntwo newsrooms and other departments; and library to be\ngradually freed from the strict restrictions on which\nlibrary staff worked for which newspaper.\nKeep in mind the somewhat unique circumstances, as Pac-\nPress [Pacific Press] was crea ted to provide new printing\npremises to Vancouver\u2019s tw o major newspapers. Among\nother services, it was decided certain \u2018services\u2019 could be\namalgamated, one being \u2018the library\u2019. At that time, I guess\nwith the blessing of the comp etition board hearings, it was\ndecided that the papers\u2019 clippi ng libraries must be strictly\nseparated and used only by journalists from their own\npaper. In retrospect all o f that was so unnecessary, and\ntrying to correct it was so much more costly.\nIn the late 1970s, Mooney, along with the librarian for\ntheSeattle Times , was invited by the Special Libraries\nAssociation to form a task force to develop guidelines\nfor automating news libraries through developing\nfull-text databases. This effort came to the attention\nof the American Press Institute, which recommended\nMooney as one of the first news librarians to present\nsessions at the annual American Newspaper Publish-\ners Association conference on this topic.Roles of the library to the city, province and country\nDuring her tenure as manager, Mooney determined\nthat it would be valuable for the community at large\nto provide photocopies of articles to the public for the\ncost of copying. This type of access was invaluable at\na time when access to primary newspaper source\nmaterials was difficult. Over the years, Mooney also\nensured that authors and researchers were granted\npermission to come into the private library to use the\ncollections. Table 2 provides a timeline of the library\npractices, milestones and other developments in the\nnewspaper library from 1968 to 2023 .\nInflection points in the history of the library\nIn 1970, Pacific Press experienced a lengthy strike\n(three months), which essentially set the stage for\ndramatic changes at the newspapers, including signif-\nicant changes to the newspaper library. Mooney and\nthe only other non-union librarian at the library during\nthat period took the opportunity to merge the subject\nheading lists of the two newspapers\u2019 separate clipping\nfiles into one thesaurus. At the same time, Pacific\nPress\u2019s Data Processing Department had received the\ncompany\u2019s first computer and, being unsure of what\nto do with it, agreed to allow the librarians to use it.\nThe librarians developed a computerized thesaurus\nfor the clippings and generated colour-coded labels\nto affix to the newly sorted clipping files.\nAnother of Mooney\u2019s major assignments was to\nintroduce computers to the newsrooms, supporting the\nautomation of production for both daily newspapers. It\nthen became the role of the library to train journalists in\nthe use of the computers, setting the pattern of respon-\nsibility in subsequent newsroom-technology changes.\nIn 1986, the Library Manager\u2019s title changed to\nManager of Editorial Services due to the incorpora-\ntion of the two newspapers\u2019 film labs and the associ-\nated responsibility for the storage and retrieval of the\nnegatives for the library. The Manager of Editorial\nServices also oversaw the building of a new film lab,\nwhich opened on the first day of one of the most\ntransformative events in British Columbia \u2013 the\nWorld Exposition on Transportation and Communi-\ncation, Expo 86, held in Vancouver.\nI realize so much of what I implemented was so coloured\nby what went before, but I believe some of the steps we\ndid take helped provide a platform for the modernizing\nmy successors must take credit for. But I blow my own\nhorn in that it was mewho managed to create profes-\nsional library positions in Pacific Press library and it was\nmewho had the brilliance to see them filled by Mill-\nward, Bird, Schachter and a number of enthusiastic staff.824 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nChanges in the newspapers\u2019 ownership created\ninflection points over the years when Mooney was\nmanager (see Table 2), and she found the Special\nLibraries Association\u2019s Newspaper Division impor-\ntant to the development of the newspaper library,\nparticularly through conference programming:\n\u2018 Iw a sb r i n g i n gm a n yi n n o v ations back to PacPress,\nwas the second Canadian to chair the International\nNews Division ...and also the second Kwapil\nAward-winner\u2019.1\nIn the late 1980s, the creation of the Infomart text\ndatabase began the transition from clipping files to\nelectronic retention and dissemination. First the Van-\ncouver Sun , in 1987, and then the Vancouver Prov-\nince, in 1989, led to the newspaper library converting\nactivities from physical indexing, clipping, photoco-\npying and filing to capturing and enhancing electronic\nnews stories for publishing in the Infomart system.\nLeadership transitions and technological\ndevelopments, 1988\u20132012: Debbie\nMillward\nDebbie Millward was first hired in 1988 as a librarian\nafter completing her Master of Library Science\n(MLS) degree at the University of British Columbia,\nduring which time she had worked on call as a library\nassistant after doing a practicum at the Pacific Press\nlibrary: \u2018I was hired to manage the new text database\ntransition, which would replace indexing and filing\nclippings with submitting full-text article content, that\nwe enhanced with keywords and other descriptors, to\nInfomart\u2019. In 1995, Millward was appointed Manager\nof Editorial Services \u2013 a position she held until 2012\nwhen the library was closed.\nRoles of the library as viewed by the newsrooms\nDuring this period, the library\u2019s profile was increased\nby having librarians attend daily news meetings and\nfile freedom-of-information requests on behalf of the\nVancouver Sun , and the Graphics Librarian managing\nthe Merlin photo archive and training newsroom staff\nto use it. Millward pushed for library researchers\u2019credits to be published, as the librarians worked more\nclosely with editorial staff on large projects.\nIn an article for the Vancouver Sun \u2019s centenary\nedition in February 2012, Millward wrote:\nTheVancouver Sun has had the support of a department\nto serve this [research support] role for most of its his-\ntory, definitely since the 1940s. It has answered to [the\nname of] morgue, press li brary and news research\nlibrary \u2013 sometimes all three in the same week. ...The\nSun\u2019s library today is a hive of activity that has less to do\nwith the custody and cataloguing of what was published\nyesterday, and more to do with collaboration on what\nwill be published today. The daily wrangling of Sun\ncontent that has been printed or posted online is mostly\nautomated now, with human intervention only for cor-\nrections and troubleshooting. The days of a 24/7 library\noperation to manually clip, index and file every story\nand photo ended 20-odd years ago (Millward, 2012).\nThat legacy continues to deliver, however, as a point\nof entry into a trove of Vancouver memories, both\nsilly and solemn \u2013 from swooning Beatles fans at the\nForum to the tragedies of harbour explosions and col-\nlapsing bridges. New roles for the press library\nevolved while retaining the archiving and organizing\ncore of the past.\nRoles of the library to the wider society\nMillward continued to allow vetted authors to come in\nto do research in the collections, and oversaw the\ndevelopment of the public fee-based service, named\nInfoline, to sell photograph reprints and page repro-\nductions, and provide permissions. The library staff\ncontinued to prepare newspaper print editions for\nmicrofilming, which were distributed by subscription\nto various academic and other libraries, and earned\nroyalties for the newspaper company.\nInflection points in the history of the library\nDigital archiving was one of the most significant\nimpacts to the newspaper library.

As\nan indicator of the perceived importance of the ser-\nvice, the library was given a large footprint in a prime\nlocation, although separated for the first time from its\nprevious location between the two newsrooms. To\nremain more connected to the journalists and editors,\nlibrarians were also embedded in the newsrooms for a\nperiod of time. Over time, the library space contracted\nas the newspapers themselves did, moving to a\nsmaller space within the building in 2010.\nInnovation in services continued throughout this\ntime period, including the development of a\nrevenue-generating service: Infoline. For the first\ntime, the library was moving from being solely a cost\ncentre to a revenue-generating and cost-recovery\ndepartment. This approach broadened relationships\nwith the Promotions Department of the newspapers\nin their shared interest in generating revenue outside\nof the traditional newspaper streams.\nAlong with newsroom-technology changes came\nopportunities to develop training roles for the librar-\nians, particularly when the World Wide Web was in its\ninfancy, and also when newsrooms switched to Macin-\ntosh computers, and then from Macintosh to person\ncomputers and into new pagination systems. The\nlibrary finally closed as a separate department in 2012.\nConcerns regarding the collections\u2019 archiving,\npreservation and access\nWhile happy that many of the library-created and\n-indexed collections (negatives, photographs, micro-\nfilm) had found a new home, Millward hoped that the\nremaining collections would also find locations that\nwould continue to make them accessible for research\n\u2013 especially the unique microfiche collections of the\nnewspapers\u2019 pre-database subject-indexed news arti-\ncles. The newspaper print clippings processes ended\nsoon after the advent of the Infomart databases in the\nlate 1980s, and the clippings were later microfilmed\nand processed into biography or subject fiche formats.\nDigital image developments, 1990\u20132015:\nKate Bird\nKate Bird began her work at the Pacific Press library\nin 1990, in a new position as a Graphics Librarian:\n\u2018My first role was to create a database to index thenewspapers\u2019 negatives for [their] 20,000 photo-\ngraphic assignments each year\u2019. This was a period\nof significant technological innovation, which was\nsupported by the initiatives and evolving expertise\nof the newspaper librarians. In 1994, the newspa-\npers were at the leading edge of digital photography\nand digital transmissions when they experimented\nwith digital cameras at the Commonwealth\nGames held in Victoria, British Columbia. Then,\nin 1995, the Vancouver Sun andVancouver Prov-\nince became the first newspapers in North America\nto go all digital \u2013 a huge challenge to the tradi-\ntional trades, systems and processes at the newspa-\npers. Through these initia tives, the emerging skill\nof project management became a new part of the\njob of Bird and other librarians within the Pacific\nPress library.\nWithin the company, the library demonstrated\nleadership in new technology both through the use\nof tools and software to create databases and in\nexpertise developed during the early years of online\nresearch. Bird became a trainer in both new technol-\nogy and technology upgrades for the newsroom and\nother staff. She also conducted training across the\nPostmedia chain for hundreds of employees in the\nuse of the digital image archiving system, led by its\nadoption at the Vancouver Sun andVancouver Prov-\nince newspapers.\nPrimary role of the library\nAccording to Bird, research was the primary role of\nthe library \u2013 identifying an dr e t r i e v i n gb a c k g r o u n d\nstories, photographs, maps, documents and other\ninformation, and especially statistics, to augment\nreporters\u2019 stories. Librar y staff created chronolo-\ngies, timelines, fact boxes, quizzes and other valu-\nable content, often in advance of specific requests\nfor such information. Librarians were also the\nnewsroom-technology trainers, who understood the\nwork of reporters and other employees and were\nable to design training programmes to better meet\nstaff needs than outside trai ners could, particularly\nin that the librarians, as is true of many special\nlibrarians, tended to be at the front edge of tech-\nnology and library services to meet the needs of\ntheir specific communities.\nRoles of the library to society at large\nThe library\u2019s public-fee service, Infoline, demon-\nstrated that the library could generate income from\nboth ad hoc research and the resources developed as\npart of the work it did for the newspapers and the\nnewspaper chain. The Vancouver Sun andVancouver827 Schachter and Millward: An oral history of the rise and fall of a newspaper library\nProvince were the newspapers of record for Vancou-\nver and the province of British Columbia, and the\nlibrary staff provided newspaper-article indexing\nbefore this function was automated, while other\nresources, such as indexed notations related to crimes\nand criminals and other specific events, as well as\nphotographic assignments, were developed for inter-\nnal purposes, which could be useful today if they were\naccessible. For now, the published collections that the\nlibrary formerly managed continue to be used to illus-\ntrate articles and books about the city\u2019s and the prov-\nince\u2019s past, either through the newspaper itself or\nthrough the current holders of the collections at Van-\ncouver Public Library and the City of Vancouver\nArchives.\nInflection points and critical developments\nIn the 1990s, the transition of the Photography\nDepartment from using 20,000 rolls of film a year\nto all digital was a huge step forward both technolo-\ngically and environmentally. Access, use and reuse\nbecame much more the norm when images were eas-\nily identified through the digital image archiving\nsystem. On the other hand, when the indexing func-\ntions for the print archive were automated and the\nlibrary staff were no longer required to mediate,\nthere was a significant loss of quality in the records,\nwhich made searching less precise and meant the\nloss of some content.\nImplications for the materials\u2019 archiving, preservation\nand access\nThe collection of photographic negatives has\nbecome more inaccessible now that it is housed at\nthe City of Vancouver Archives. It was planned that,\nover time, the collection would gradually become\nmore accessible, but after several years the Archives\nhave not yet released many newly scanned images\nfrom the collection. Access to the photograph col-\nlection at the Pacific Newspaper Group is severely\nlimited as there is only one remaining staff member\nin the library, who no longer works on the premises\nsince the closure of the newsroom. Since Bird\u2019s\nretirement, the digital photograph archive is no lon-\nger monitored, much content has been lost between\nthe assigned and published photographs, and the pre-\nservation of the newspaper content has degraded.\nThe text archive, lnfomar t, is automated and there\nis no audit of the articles ingested into the system\ncompared to those that have been published, making\nfull retrieva l uncertain.Librarian roles in a declining library,\n2012\u20132023: Sandra Boutilier\nSandra Boutilier worked in several roles at Pacific\nPress in the 1990s and, in 2001, following the\nachievement of her Master of Library and Information\nStudies (MLIS), she was hired as a librarian in the\nnewspaper library. Bouti lier\u2019s primary role was in\nsupporting reporters by doing research for the next\nedition of the newspapers. Over time, Boutilier also\nbecame involved in content creation for the newspa-\npers. Compilations for the newsrooms\u2019 websites\nincreased as the newspapers understood the impor-\ntance of other platforms, including \u2018This Day in His-\ntory\u2019 \u2013 historical photographs of the day as social\nmedia posts. She then took on additional roles as an\narchivist, creating databases and photograph files, and\nsaving physical materials. As with many newspapers,\nreprints were a source of income, and Boutilier took\non the role of Copyright Librarian. In this role, she\noversaw permissions for the reuse of newspaper con-\ntent in the context of selling and providing commer-\ncial reprints of articles and images, and liaising with\nthe public, other news outlets, book publishers and the\nfilm industry.\nPrior to Boutilier\u2019s depart ure in June 2017, and\nwith an imminent newsroom move to a different site\nin the city of Vancouver, she was focused on finding a\nhome for the content of the newspaper library. This\nwork included cold-calling other libraries to find\nhomes for books from their small collection that\nmight be considered of value to others, or to ensure\nthe preservation of critical materials for future\nresearchers and historians. Boutilier worked with the\none remaining librarian to curate and reduce the col-\nlection, and to argue for the value of saving these\ncollections with senior editors and executives of the\norganization. As primary source materials of value to\nthe city and province, negatives and their indexes\nwere donated to the City of Vancouver Archives, tak-\ning advantage of the Archive\u2019s newly acquired cold-\nstorage space for this collection of over a million\nphotographic negatives.\nInflection points in the history of the library\nWhen the manager of Editorial Services left in 2012,\nBoutilier noted:\nthe library no longer had anyone to advocate for it, to\nliaise with management. [The l]ibrary was not a priority\nfor management, not only the staff but the collections. It\nfelt like the beginning of the end of the library, and put\nthe library into survival mode.828 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nThe remaining staff were moved into the two news-\nrooms, and work focused more on content creation.\nImplications for the collections\u2019 archiving, preservation\nand access\nThe most significant implication is that there is no\nlonger any physical space for the collections. Since\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, all staff have worked remo-\ntely. All that is left on-site in the former newsrooms is\none Lektriever (vertical filing carousel) containing\nphotograph files and index cards, plus a small number\nof books. As the newsrooms will not return to a phys-\nical site, these collections will have to be relocated or\ndonated. Before Boutilier left, she approached many\norganizations, such as Vancouver Public Library and\nLibrary and Archives Canada. The sense of frustration\nwas at its height when it came to the survival of the\ncollections beyond the closure of the library.\nThe last of the newspaper librarians:\nCarolyn Soltau\nSince 2017, Carolyn Soltau, who joined the library in\n2005, has been the sole librarian at the Vancouver Sun\nandVancouver Province .F u r t h e r ,s h er e m a i n st h e\nonly news librarian within the Postmedia newspaper\nchain, and is one of only three in Canada when includ-\ning the other major Canadian newspapers \u2013 the\nToronto Star and the Globe and Mail . Soltau contin-\nues to manage corrections for the newspaper text\ndatabase in solely a reactive approach to content\nerrors. The common thread that persists in Soltau\u2019s\nwork, and continues through the history of the Van-\ncouver Sun and Vancouver Province newspaper\nlibrary, is the provision of news research.\nSoltau defined her role as \u2018half archivist, half pri-\nvate investigator\u2019, which connects her work with that\nof her predecessors in the field. Soltau\u2019s other roles\ninclude content creation related to posting informa-\ntion on the newspapers\u2019 websites; training employees\nin the use of internal systems; and transferring old\nstories onto websites, such as major criminal or\naward-winning news features. Because of the dimin-\nished newsroom personnel, Soltau\u2019s work has\nexpanded from traditional news support to include\nscanning and procuring photographs as a liaison\nbetween the newsroom and photograph agencies;\nselecting letters to the ed itor for publication; fact-\nchecking; and posting on social media platforms on\nbehalf of the newspapers. In a continuation of the\nmore traditional expertise of newspaper librarians,\nSoltau is responsible for copyright education.Continuing role beyond the newsrooms\nThe newspaper library\u2019s strength has been its\nconnection to the local communities of British Colum-\nbia through its archiving and preservation of the stories\nand lives of its citizens. That news content may have\nbeen considered incidental at the time, perhaps, but it\nstill gets reused by the newspapers. The stories and\nphotographs capture the historical periods through\nfashions and personal or cultural moments. For exam-\nple, a 1970s news photograph was taken of a couple in\na nightclub and was recently republished in the Van-\ncouver Sun newspaper. Soltau related the story of this\nsame couple contacting the newsroom to let the editors\nknow that the picture was of their first date and they\nhad been married for more than 30 years. When old\nimages are republished, connections are made with\npeople globally. The final preservation tasks for the\nclosed library include finding homes for unique collec-\ntions and ephemera, such as the Vancouver Sun Test\nKitchen\u2019s files of recipe cards and scrapbooks.\nInflection points in the 21st century\nWhat stands out for Soltau is what she terms \u2018journalism\nin crisis\u2019, which has had seismic impacts on the exis-\ntence of the newspaper library. In 2012, the decision to\nclose the library led to the need for the remaining three\nlibrarians to self-manage and \u2018keep the faith\u2019. The sup-\nport of the reporters helped the librarians in their transi-\ntion, and they became embedded in the merged\nnewsroom. The positive of being embedded in the\nnewsroom was that these librarians were fully integrated\ninto the newsroom team. Sitting at the Vancouver Sun\nnewspaper\u2019s City Desk hub meant that they knew what\nwas going on, could offer to help and be part of the buzz\nof the newsroom. Copywriters also discovered that they\ncould make use of the librarians\u2019 expertise.\nImplications of archiving, preservation and access\nto the collections\nWith respect to preserving the historical work of the\nlibrary, Soltau referred to the specialized clipping files\nknown as the Microfiche Collection. Since the closure\nof the newsroom, all work is done remotely and the\nphysical storage space must be vacated, so the need to\ndispose of the remaining physical collections has\nreached peak urgency. This means that these unique,\nnon-digitized microfiche story records are one of the\nmost pressing collections remaining to be relocated or\ndonated to a willing organization. As the \u2018last librarian\nstanding\u2019, Soltau underlined her responsibility to the\ncollections and described it as a privilege to shepherd\nthem into safe homes.829 Schachter and Millward: An oral history of the rise and fall of a newspaper library\nConclusion\nT h el i b r a r yo ft h e Vancouver Sun andVancouver Prov-\nince daily newspapers, united under Pacific Press and\nlater the Postmedia Network, was central to preserving\nthe newspapers\u2019 content. The library evolved to per-\nform the additional role of creating content, including\ncontributing to award-winning journalism features.\nThe librarians\u2019 and staff\u2019s expertise and labour-\nintensive work, produced over many decades for the\njournalists and editors, created searchable collections\nof local and regional history as a specific valuable\nproduct. The library\u2019s managers pushed the department\nto become an innovator in technology adoption for the\nnewspaper company \u2013 from the 1970s use of the first\ncomputer to create a thesaurus for the news clippings,\nthrough using dial-up modems to access the first data-\nbases in the 1980s, to training reporters on the new\nhardware and programmes adopted by the newsrooms\nin the 2000s. The library created revenue streams for\nthe newspapers through the fee-based Infoline\u2019s sales\nof reprints and permissions, and by preparing physical\ncopies of the newspapers for microfilming and sales,\nthereby generating royalties. The librarians were key to\nprotecting the newspapers\u2019 copyright and ensured that\nphotographers were compensated when their photo-\ngraphs were provided to other publications with per-\nmissions for reuse. This library is essentially gone but\nits work persists for the benefit of future researchers,\nhistorians and the broader community.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declared no poten tial conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of\nthis article.\nFunding\nThe authors received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nDebbie Schachter https://orcid.org /0000-00 03-0943-\n8570\nNote\n1.

Essential to Sagan \u2019s theory\nof the origins of the library is the concept of extrasomatic information, or knowledge stored outside thebody. Surprising evidence on behalf of Sagan \u2019s theory has been presented in recent years by Nobel-Prize-win-\nning neuroscientist Eric Kandel and others: that the human brain has not signi \ufb01cantly grown for 50,000 years,\npresumably not due to evolutionary stagnation, but because cultural evolution has superseded biological evo-lution in Homo sapiens , an advance which has led to us becoming the dominant species on Earth.\nKeywordsDNA, human brain, human intelligence, extrasomatic intelligence, libraries, genetic evolution, cultural evolution\nCarl Sagan was by academic af \ufb01liation Professor of\nAstronomy and Space Sciences at Cornell. Unlike\nmost of his colleagues in academe, however, by the\ntime of his death in 1996, at age 62, Sagan hadbecome a household name across the globe, achieving\nenormous popularity as a promoter of scienti \ufb01c ideas.\nHis TV show Cosmos (1980 \u20131981), winner of two\nEmmys, was seen by an estimated 500 million peoplein 60 countries ( Cosmos ). His novel Contact (1985)\nabout the \ufb01rst encounter between humans and extrater-\nrestrials, published in 1985, received an advance of $2\nmillion, at the time the highest advance ever paid for a\nbook as yet unwritten. It went on to sell 1.7 million\ncopies in its \ufb01rst two years. As an international \u201csuper-\nstar professor, \u201dSagan can only be compared to the\nItalian semiologist and novelist Umberto Eco, author\nofThe Name of the Rose (1984). Had he lived,\nSagan would have turned 90 in November of 2024.\nFor librarians, Sagan \u2019s most notable achievement\nwas probably the ideas presented in his book The\nDragons of Eden (1978), winner of the Pulitzer\nPrize for Non \ufb01ction in 1978. In addition to advancing\na comprehensive theory of human evolution against thedizzying backdrop of cosmic ( \u201cdeep\u201d) time, Dragons ofEden lays, almost en passant, the groundwork for a\ntheory of libraries, ancient and modern, as a natural,\nindeed inevitable, part of our species \u2019evolution. What\nthat theory is and how it has stood the passage of time\nis the subject of this paper.\nInDragons of Eden , Sagan distinguishes three\ntypes of intelligence in life as it has evolved onEarth. There is, \ufb01rst,genetic intelligence, which we\nand all forms of life, even viruses, inherit with ourDNA. Genetic intelligence is distinguished fromextragenetic intelligence, which is in our brains but\nnot in our genes. We acquire it through experience and\nlearning. Extragenetic intelligence \u2014usually called\nknowledge \u2014is anchored in memory, in humans, primar-\nily in that part of the brain known as the neocortex,though even very primitive life forms without brains\ncan learn, too.\n1In humans, learning to hunt or learning\na language is possible because our DNA provides the\ngenetic basis for doing so successfully; but neither spe-\nci\ufb01c skills like hunting nor a knowledge of a speci \ufb01cl a n -\nguage are passed on through our genes. Such skills must\nbe acquired by learning them, experientially (through\nexposure); through parents, teachers, the community;or\u2014at least for the last 5000 years of human history \u2014\nCorresponding author:\nJeffrey Garrett, University & Deering Libraries, 1970 CampusDrive, Evanston, IL 60208, USA.Email: jgarrett@northwestern.edu Correction (November 2024): This article has been updated\nwith footnote numbering and minor corrections since its originalpublication.Original Article\nInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions2024, Vol. 50(4) 832 \u2013837\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024Article reuse guidelines:sagepub.com/journals-permissionsDOI: 10.1177/03400352241286172\njournals.sagepub.com/home/i \ufb02\nthrough stored learning resources (e.g., books and librar-\nies). In Dragons of Eden , implicitly building on work by\ncontemporary philosopher Marshall McLuhan (1964),Sagan develops the concept of a third form of intelli-gence, namely extrasomatic intelligence: human intelli-\ngence and memory located outside the body, which\nover the millennia has become ever more vast and\ncomplex \u2014and ever more essential for human survival\nand our continuing evolution as a species.\n2This,\nof course, is where libraries3come in.\nBefore going further with our consideration of this\nbook, it is worth mentioning that The Dragons of Eden\nis a fascinating read even today, even for non-scientists. It is written in a breezy, accessible, wrylyhumorous style, qualities which combine to make\nSagan \u2019s at times nerdy theorizing easier and even\nfun to follow. For sure, 50 years after its publication,\nit is dated in many ways. For example, Sagan \u2014not\nunlike his scienti \ufb01c peers \u2014had no idea how the dino-\nsaurs were wiped out: the so-called \u201c\ufb01fth extinction \u201d\nwhich would lead to the rise of mammals, including,in time, Homo sapiens . After describing and dismiss-\ning numerous theories,\n4he comes down in favor of an\nexplanation advanced by Soviet cosmologist ISShklovskii, that the cause of the extinction was likely a\nnearby supernova which destroyed the Earth \u2019s protective\nozone layer, letting in lethal solar radiation (Sagan, 1978:\n145). Since around 2010, however, we know the almostcertain cause of this cataclysm was the 6- to 9-mile-wide\nChicxulub asteroid which impacted Earth 66 million\nyears ago, annihilating the dinosaurs and, with them,almost 75% of life on Earth (Preston, 2019).\nAnother topic which we know much more about\ntoday than scientists did in the 1970s is the possibilityof extraterrestrial life, which Sagan studied intensely\nthroughout his career \u2014as re \ufb02ected in his novel\nContact (1985). Today, scientists have discovered\nthousands of so-called \u201cexoplanets, \u201deven studied\ntheir atmospheres, some of which seem to offer the\nconditions for life to arise and develop. It nowappears likely that planets circle many or even mostof the billions of stars in our galaxy, making intelligent\nlife elsewhere in the universe an almost statistical\ncertainty.\nAs signi \ufb01cant as they are, none of these discoveries\nof the last half century detract from what The Dragons\nof Eden is actually about, which is the evolution of ter-\nrestrial and speci \ufb01cally human intelligence, and the\ncrucial signi \ufb01cance for Homo sapiens of that third\nkind of intelligence: extrasomatic intelligence, whichis to say intelligence we have learned to place and\nstore outside the human body.\nSo let \u2019s look more closely at what Sagan writes, start-\ning with his most famous (and quickly popularized)\ninvention, the \u201cCosmic Calendar \u201dwhich, thoughalready introduced in The Dragons of Eden (Sagan,\n1978: 13 \u201317),\ufb01rst became popular after it was shared\nwith millions of Americans in the inaugural episode ofhis series Cosmos , broadcast on 1 October 1980. Its\npurpose was to help human beings understand whatscientists (following John McPhee) now call \u201cdeep\ntime\u201d(McPhee, 1998): just how unfathomably old the\nuniverse is and how insigni \ufb01cant human history is in\nthe cosmological scheme of things.\n5S a g a na s k su st o\nimagine all 13.8 billion years of natural history sincethe Big Bang packed into a single year of our time.The Cosmic Calendar chronology then goes like\nthis: Since the likely origin of our universe on 1\nJanuary, many months pass as stars and galaxiesform. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, becomes a disk,\nslowly rotating, sometime in May. The solar system\nforms in September \u2014and the most primitive life\nforms on Earth come into being soon thereafter.Cells with nuclei arise, but not until November.\nW h i c hb r i n g su st oD e c e m b e r ,av e r yb u s ym o n t h\nhere on Earth, at least from our perspective. Thedinosaurs exist for about a week before Chicxulub,\nthat asteroid we mentioned earlier, hits Earth on 30\nDecember, inaugurating what we today call (some-what grandiosely) the \u201cage\u201dof mammals, which\nhas lasted, so far, just one day in cosmic time.\nWe must now attend very carefully to what happens\non that last day of the year, 31 December, since, if weblink, we will miss something signi \ufb01cant. At dawn,\nour branch of the mammalian evolutionary tree, theprimates, begins dividing, \ufb01rst separating apes from\nmonkeys, then, after sunset, proto humans from chim-\npanzees. Most crucially, after 9 p.m. on the last day of\nthe cosmic year, our hominid ancestors begin to walkupright, which others have theorized had to do with\nclimate change in Africa: the replacement of vast\nforests with dry savannah, meaning locomotion onthe ground rather than through trees. Within moments\n(so to speak), the brain size of these hominid ancestors\nbegins to multiply in size. Is there a connection? Sagan(1978: 91) says yes, absolutely, because the momentwe no longer move or amble on all fours, that frees up\nour upper appendages, until then just front legs, to\nbecome useful for entirely different things. Feet evolveinto hands, front toes into \ufb01ngers, claws into far more\ndelicate \ufb01ngernails. These front limbs become dexterous;\nthe sense of touch in the former toes, now \ufb01ngers,\ndevelops, becoming in time extraordinarily subtle.\nOur ancestors \u2014Homo erectus ,Australopithecus \u2014\nbecome capable of seizing, holding, inspecting,\nand throwing things, ultimately crafting tools to\nhold, along with tools \u2019close relatives: weapons.\n6\nAnd to exploit this potential and to manage all the\nnew information streaming in, the pre-human braingrows rapidly in size and in capabilities, in fact triplingGarrett: Carl Sagan and libraries: An original thinker remembered 833\nin size by 10:30 p.m.7Finally, our own species, Homo\nsapiens , evolves in Africa during the eighth minute\nbefore midnight.\nFast forward yet again. The \ufb01nal minute of the\ncosmic year begins. As is evident in cave paintings,\nsymbolic thinking \u2014thisstands for that\u2014arises, result-\ning in a far greater ef \ufb01ciency of thinking.8Writing\nevolves outside the body \u2013i.e., extrasomatically \u2013starting\naround 12 seconds before midnight, which may seem\nimpossibly rapid until you realize that one second on\nthe cosmic calendar represents 434 years in real time.With that invention, history supplants prehistory. In a\nway, human beings become us.\nJust as the discovery of actual exoplanets brought\nsome empirical evidence to the discussion of the exist-ence of extraterrestrial intelligence, a recent discovery\nby neuropaleontologists in the 50 years since Sagan \u2019s\nbook has now added a key facet to our understandingof human evolution. Here is the astonishing fact: about\n50,000 years (or two minutes) ago, the human brain, and\nspeci\ufb01cally the neocortex, where humans \u2019higher reason-\ning capabilities reside and which had been rapidly\ngrowing for thousands of years, stopped growing in\nsize(Kandel, 2016: 44).\n9What happened? Clearly, one\nfactor was that ever larger brains meant larger andlarger craniums, and this poses a problem for the birthing\nmother. It is already one of the riskiest parts of birth,getting our outsized heads out through the birth canal.But evolution has dealt with equally dif \ufb01cult problems\nbefore. Are we as a species perhaps stagnating?\nA completely different explanation has been pre-\nsented by Eric Kandel, the neurophysiologist at\nColumbia whose work on learning and memory in\nsea snails, referenced above, won the Nobel Prize in2000. Kandel makes the audacious claim that no\nfurther evolution of the human brain has been neces-\nsary for human evolution to continue. He explains:\nIn us, learning has led to the establishment of a completely\nnew kind of evolution \u2014cultural evolution \u2014which has\nlargely supplanted biological evolution as a means of trans-\nmitting knowledge and adaptations across generations. Ourcapacity for learning is so remarkably developed thathuman societies change almost exclusively by cultural evo-\nlution. (Kandel, 2016: 44)\nThere are numerous precedents in nature, writes\nKandel, of biological processes or structures beingso essential for survival of a species that they are \u201ccon-\nserved \u201dover time (Kandel, 2016: 48).\n10This is why\nKandel \u2019s molecular study of learning in sea snails\ngives us insight into human intelligence: the wayexperience causes chemical changes in neurons has\nbeen conserved throughout the course of evolution \u2014\na discovery that was found worthy of a Nobel Prize.Kandel \u2019s statement aligns perfectly with Sagan \u2019s\ndiscussion of the emergence in Homo sapiens of\n\u201cextrasomatic \u201dintelligence and memory.\n11Sagan \u2019s\nargument is as follows: It is one thing to learn, expand-\ning upon the knowledge we receive through our genes,through remembered experience as well as through\nteaching by parents and by others, creating what Sagan\ncalls extragenetic intelligence. Other mammals do this,too. But unless preserved and passed on, extragenetic\nmemory is lost when an individual dies. Preservation\nof much knowledge \u2014especially if it is kinetic in\nnature, like dance, baking bread, or hunting skills \u2014can\nbe passed on without writing and even without language,but past a certain point, language, and above all writing,becomes an evolutionary necessity. That \u2019s where extra-\nsomatic intelligence comes in:\n[H]uman beings have, in the most recent few tenths of a\npercent of our existence, invented not only extrageneticbut also extrasomatic knowledge: information stored\noutside our bodies, of which writing is the most\nnotable example. (Sagan, 1978: 3 \u20134)\nThe qualitative leap represented by knowledge pre-\nserved extrasomatically is hard to overestimate. EventheIliad, even the Bible, and perhaps even the\nQur\u2019an would not have endured to the present day\nwithout the invention of writing (Welch et al.,2012)\n12\u2014not to mention the uncountable intricacies\nof technology, the minutiae of history, cooking\nrecipes, the blossoms of poetry and extended narra-\ntive\u2014in other words, human culture in all its manifes-\ntations. In the words of a Bosnian chronist of the 18th\ncentury, Mula Mustafa \u0160evki Ba \u0161eskija, \u201cthat which is\nwritten down endures, that which is remembered dis-\nappears \u201d(Verde, 2016: 26).\nSo, to summarize: Sharing memory with another\nperson is possible without speech, and de \ufb01nitely\nwithout writing. Animals convey extragenetic knowl-edge to their young effectively, and we, too \u2014also\nanimals \u2014do the same. Teaching someone how to\nmake a lay-up or to bake bread involves extensive useof non-verbal communication, even today. The develop-\nment of language \u2014which took well over a minute in\ncosmic calendar time, though probably not as long as\nan hour \u2014introduced an entirely different level of com-\nplexity and opportunity to communication, transformingindividual memory \u2014for example, of a sage, a medicine\nman, or a storyteller \u2014into communal memory, trans-\ncending the human life span and, therefore, time.\nThe development of spoken language over tens of\nthousands of years was, as Sagan writes, a \u201ccrucial\nturning point in the evolution \u201dof our species. But\nthink of all the things that even complex speechcannot accomplish. Oral cultures attained something834 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nlike permanence by sharing and sanctifying some\nspeech over generations \u2014prayers, songs, or heroic\npoems, for example \u2014but this was still always endan-\ngered by outside forces, like plague or war.\nAnother evolutionary pressure in favor of writing\nwas the encoding of authority, which includes not\nonly proof of a source, that is, the veri \ufb01ed identity\nof an original speaker, but also accuracy (protection\nof a statement against alteration). The need to make\nspeech concrete, even permanent, was felt \u2014and so\nthe next leap was taken.\nLovers have forever inscribed and linked their per-\nsonal signs on tree bark to attain a kind of permanence\nof their love \u2014though, alas, tree bark as a writing surface\nis only as permanent as the tree is, though at least that\npermanence can be measured in years \u2014and is usually\nmore permanent than the relationship being celebrated.\nW r i t i n go nr o c ki sd e \ufb01nitely longer lasting. On a\nboulder in a park outside of Stockholm, we \ufb01nd an\ninscription in runes from the Middle Ages in Swedish.It\u2019s a personal message, an epitaph on a gravestone,\nand it reads: \u201cRagn\u00e4lv let this stone be raised for\nAnund, his good son. May God help his spirit andsoul better than he deserved \u201d(Maria Nikolajeva,\n2023, personal communication). It is believed that\nthis stone has never been moved, which is a\nproblem, because another desire for messages, apartfrom permanence and authority, is transportability.The ancient Sumerians solved this problem by using\n(relatively) small clay tablets to record prayers, busi-\nness contracts, and other important things thatcannot be held by speech. Clay is, however, a less\nthan perfect medium when it comes to permanence.\nIt dissolves slowly but surely in water, and withoutwater or humidity, over time, it becomes brittle and\ncan break or shatter. The one thing that separates it\nfrom permanence is . . . \ufb01re. So, the clay tablets\nwhich have come down to us astonishingly intact are\nthose that have been baked in \ufb01re, though often\nenough by plundering armies rather than intentionally\nby their creators \u2014one of the rare instances in history\nwhere \ufb01re is good for books (Polastron, 2007: 2).\nOver the centuries \u2014we are now in historical time\n\u2014a host of media came into existence that ful \ufb01lled\nthe requirements of permanence (or at least durabil-\nity), encoded authority (including accuracy), and\ntransportability. And so we have had clay tablets,papyrus, parchment, paper, and now backed up\ndigital \ufb01les, which can encode messages, articles and\nbooks, websites, sound, and images, both still and\nmoving.\nWhat \u2019s missing now to get us to the present? A\nplace to collect, store, protect, and make accessiblethese written records. What would that be?The library\nNo wonder then that Carl Sagan includes the library inhis account of the evolution of human intelligence,though not as genetically encoded inherited intelligence,\nlike DNA, but as intelligence culturally produced and\npreserved across generations and made shareableoutside the body. Figure 1 shows a chart (Sagan, 1978:26) which is Sagan \u2019s attempt to quantify and summarize\nhis thoughts on genetic, extragenetic, and extrasomaticinformation. Note that the y-axis is time since the BigBang, starting at the top and moving in a logarithmic\nscale down to the present. The x-axis is also logarithmic,\nincreasing from left to right in powers of 10, startingwith 3 \u00d710\n4, or 30,000 bits of information encoded in\nDNA \u2014think of Eric Kandel \u2019s sea snails \u2014and the\nbrain, and increasing to the most advanced species, ushumans, as we move to the right. Sagan calculates thatour DNA encodes 10\n10or 10,000,000,000 bits of infor-\nmation, but our brains can hold far more, 1013bits of\ninformation, or 1000 times more than is passed ongenetically.\nYou might say that the horizontal distance between\nthe solid black line and the dashed black line is thecapacity for learning of a given species or group at\nany point in time. As you see here, it is almost zero\nfor reptiles \u2014or have you taught your pet lizard any\ncool tricks lately? \u2014rather signi \ufb01cant for mammals,\nand the largest for human beings. But this is whereour species has, over the course of time, leapt off thecharts to the right: by evolving culturally, propelledby memory encoded as extrasomatic cultural informa-\ntion, such as science, engineering, music, the arts.\nThere is no limit to what we can do, and the numberof bits we put into our brains is increasing not in\ncosmic time, not in geological or even in evolutionary\ntime, but explosively this very moment. The speed ofcultural evolution represents a powerful selective\nFigure 1. Sagan \u2019s original caption reads: \u201cThe evolution of\ninformation content in genes and brains during the history\nof life on Earth. \u201dGarrett: Carl Sagan and libraries: An original thinker remembered 835\nadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis other species. Only viruses can\nevolve nearly as fast or faster than human culture, as\nwe have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEnter: arti \ufb01cial intelligence, which is also a product\nof cultural evolution, and as such is an extension of\nour minds \u2014though what we fear is that it will\nbecome autonomous, like a newly evolved,man-made but no less real species (Brazma, 2024).Sagan \u2019s chart may have to be revised at some point\nto take AI into account, but for the moment, libraries,museums, textbooks, and so on, taken together, havealready situated (referring back to Sagan \u2019s chart) the\ndots for bits of information we have in our brainsand those we store extrasomatically way off thechart to the right.\nConcluding remarks\nLike tools (and weapons) extend humans \u2019physical abil-\nities, libraries have come into being to extend our mentalabilities. The library is an extrasomatic tool that works inintimate connection with the human brain. So: for whatspeci\ufb01c purposes did we devise libraries, and what\nmakes a library so important for cultural evolution totake place? It is a place (physical or virtual):\n\u0081To preserve and protect information over timeand across generations \u2014\u201cin perpetuity, \u201din\ntoday \u2019s archival parlance;\n\u0081To maintain authoritative records and texts, forexample, contracts, religious and literary texts,\nbut also \u201cgood \u201deditions of books;\n\u0081To hold larger quantities of information and\nmore complex information than our minds can\nretain, but which individuals can tap into when-\never needed;\n\u0081To create order among and to increase connec-tions between pieces of information, also\nknown as intertextuality;\n\u0081To allow broader access to information than\nscattered information carriers (like a single\nbook) owned by a single person can.\nSo the problem that libraries have evolved to solve is\nthe need people and societies, and our species, have to\nquickly, ef \ufb01ciently, and reliably \ufb01nd the information\nthey want or need, and for it to be good information,authoritative and uncorrupted.\nThe library, be it physical or virtual, is an extraso-\nmatic tool that works with the brain to continue our\nevolution as a species. We owe Carl Sagan an enor-\nmous debt of gratitude for giving us a framework tounderstand just where libraries \ufb01t into who we are.\nMay he rest in peace.Declaration of con \ufb02icting interests\nThe author declared no potential con \ufb02icts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\"\nFunding\nThe author received no \ufb01nancial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nJeffrey Garrett https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3567-5150\nNotes\n1.In fact, Columbia neurophysiologist Eric Kandel (bornin 1929) won a Nobel Prize for his studies on how a\nlarge sea snail, Aplysia , with only 20,000 neurons (com-\npared to the human brain \u2019s 100 billion), actually learns.\nHis prize-winning achievement was then to demon-strate how and why this is relevant to human learning(Kandel, 2016; see alsoThe Nobel Prize, 2000). (More\non Kandel in a moment.)\n2.InThe Dragons of Eden (1978), Sagan does not make\nreference to his concept of \u201cextrasomatic intelligence \u201d\nas having been in \ufb02uenced by McLuhan in\nUnderstanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964),\nand yet it clearly has been. Prior to McLuhan \u2019s\nUnderstanding Media and Sagan \u2019sDragons of Eden,\nas a review of the Oxford English Dictionary \u2019s entry\nfor the word reveals, \u201cextrasomatic \u201drelated solely to\nperceptions of events outside the body, not to a locuswhere information is or can be stored (Oxford English\nDictionary 2023).

We follow the de \ufb01nition offered by German\nlibrarian (and library theorist) Martin Schrettinger\n(1772 \u20131851) that a library \u201cis a sizable collection of\nbooks [substitute: \u201ccarriers of information \u201d\u2014JG], the\norganization of which enables every patron to \ufb01nd\nwhatever he or she requires without unnecessary\ndelay \u201d(Schrettinger, 1829: I, 11; my translation). It is\ntheorganization of the carriers of information, what-\never form they take, and the ease of user access to\nthem, which are de \ufb01nitionally fundamental. A more\ndetailed (re-)de \ufb01nition of \u201cthe library \u201din light of\nSagan \u2019s thought is offered near the end of this article.\n4.The most delightful of the discarded theories allegedthat the end of the dinosaurs was due to \u201cthe extinction\nof a plant with apparent laxative qualities, in which case\nthe dinosaurs died of constipation \u201d(Sagan, 1978: 145).\n5The term \u201cdeep time \u201dmay be of recent coinage, but the\nnotion of deep time goes back at least as far as Scottish\ngeologist James Hutton (1726 \u20131797). John McPhee836 IFLA Journal 50(4)\nasks us to do the following thought experiment, using a\ncomparison from Hutton \u2019s age, to understand deep time:\n\u201cConsider the Earth \u2019s history as the old measure of the\nEnglish yard, the distance from the King \u2019s nose to the\ntip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail \ufb01le\non his middle \ufb01nger erases human history \u201d(McPhee,\n1998: 77; see also Baxter, 2003).\n6Sagan (1978: 96) comments that fossil \ufb01nds of human\nremains of this period begin showing holes in the skull\nand other massive traumata consistent with the use of\nweapons such as clubs and lances.\n7\u201c[S]tanding on our own two feet freed our hands for\nmanipulation, which then led to a major accretion ofhuman cultural and physiological traits \u201d(Sagan, 1978: 74).\n8\u201cThe symbolic thinking that developed in humans led to\nrapid technological innovation, sophisticated visual arts,and language \u201d(Miyagawa et al., 2018: 6).\n9\u201c[T]here is no strong evidence of any biological change\nin the size or structures of the human brain since Homo\nsapiens appeared in the fossil record some 50,000 years\nago\u201d(Kandel, 2016: 44). There is also evidence that the\nhuman brain has actually shrunk since the advent of\nsymbolic thinking: \u201cThis newly formed cognitive cap-\nacity may have had another, unexpected result. Aftercontinuously growing in size over the span of the\nPleistocene, our brain has contracted in size by 13% in\nthe past 20,000 years or so. One possible explanationis that the symbolic thinking that developed in modern\nhumans led to a fundamentally different way to\ncompute data, one that extracts only the essence requiredfor abstract representation instead of computing the\nentire set of incoming raw data \u201d(Miyagawa et al.,\n2018: 6).\n10\u201cA conserved biological process is one that proved so\nuseful in primitive organisms that it has persisted,through evolution, in animals of increasing complexity \u201d\n(Kandel, 2016: 48).\n11Tellingly, Sagan de \ufb01nes\u201cextrasomatic information \u201din\nhis glossary to Dragons of Eden as:\u201cInformation\ncarried outside the body (for example, the contents of\nbooks) \u201d(Sagan, 1978: 263).\n12Regarding the Qur \u2019an, Islamic tradition tells us that the\nearliest companions of Mohammed who memorized the\nQur\u2019an\u2014originally transmitt ed orally by the angel\nGabriel to Mohammed \u2014were given special protection,\nbut after the Battle of Yamama (632 CE), in whichseveral of these sages were killed, it was reluctantly\ndecided to write down the Qur \u2019an, which literally means\n\u201crecitation, \u201dor risk losing it for future generations.\nReferences\nBaxter S (2003) Ages in Chaos: James Hutton and the Discovery\nof Deep Time .

IFLA has aimed to strengthen libraries for a more literate, informed and participatory society. Its struc-ture includes Sections, a Governing Board, and Regional and Professional Divisions. From an exploratory inves-\ntigation on the IFLA web pages, the author surveyed the participation of countries in the entire structure, the\nnationality of the presidents and the headquarters of the World Library and Information Congress. The needfor the organization to expand its regional diversity through internal policies stands out, since Global South\ncountries, such as those in Latin America and Africa, occupy few places. Since IFLA is the main global entity\nin librarianship, it is essential to expand these representations, from participation in its structure to the pos-sibility of a president-elect from these regions or the largest congress being hosted in these areas more often.\nKeywords\nLeadership, library advocacy, library associations, regional representation, IFLA\nIntroduction\nTo democratically ensure that a cause or the rights of anentity or group are defended in public spheres, articula-\ntion among interested individuals is fundamental. Oneof the most effective ways of doing this is advocacy.\nAdvocacy is a term that accompanies the transforma-\ntions over time in political and power relations. Itcomes from the verb \u2018to advocate \u2019, which means to\ndefend and argue in favour of a cause, a demand or a\nposition, usually with political incidence or pressure\nand with articulations mobilized by organized civilsociety (Libardoni, 2000). Being such a broad concept\nand applied by different organizations, advocacy is\nfound in broad causes and areas, including libraries.\nMcLane (2011) exempli \ufb01es the work of the Association\nof College and Research Libraries, which, through agovernment relations group, sought to amplify in the legis-lative sphere discussions around censorship, access to\ninformation, copyright and privacy. These are contempor-\nary, ever-changing issues that affect both libraries and thecommunity.\nTo ensure the defence of the library profession and\nof libraries, the work of professional associations is ofparamount importance. The International Federationof Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) is a\nglobal, non-pro \ufb01t institution, with its headquarters inThe Hague, the Netherlands; it was created on 30September 1927, in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has almost\na thousand af \ufb01liated institutions from more than 130\ncountries, besides the possi bility of individuals also\njoining. Its vision is to create \u2018[a] strong, united global\nlibrary \ufb01eld, empowering literate, informed, and partici-\npatory societies \u2019, and its mission is \u2018[t]o inspire, engage,\nenable, and connect the global library \ufb01eld\u2019(IFLA, 2022).\nRecently, as part of its strategic efforts to promote\nand showcase the work of libraries worldwide, IFLAaligned itself with the United Nations \u20192030 Agenda\nfor Sustainable Development. This Agenda has beenincorporated into reports, events, meetings, guides,and toolkits, and has gathered inspiring library pro-jects for the IFLA Library Map of the World.\nTo be able to act globally, taking into account the dif-\nferent types of libraries and d iversity of technical topics,\nIFLA \u2019s organizational chart is quite complex and struc-\ntured. It was recently updated in 2019 and 2021, where\nCorresponding author:\nJorge Mois\u00e9s Kroll do Prado, Department of Library Science andInformation Management, Postgraduate Programme inInformation Management, Santa Catarina State University, Av.Madre Benvenuta, 2007, Itacorubi, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil.Email: jorge.exlibris@gmail.comOriginal Article\nInternational Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions2024, Vol. 50(4) 838 \u2013850\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024Article reuse guidelines:sagepub.com/journals-permissionsDOI: 10.1177/03400352241259480\njournals.sagepub.com/home/i \ufb02\naf\ufb01liated individuals and institutions were consulted via\nquestionnaires and face-to-face meetings to identify\nnew strategies for action. Figure 1 illustrates the new\norganizational chart resulting from this process.\nExcept for the IFLA headquarters, where the work is\npaid, in the other bodies the activity is voluntary, with\nan election process for people who apply for the avail-\nable positions in the Sections, Regional Divisions,Professional Divisions, Special Interest Groups and\nGoverning Board. The term of of \ufb01ce is two years for\nthe Regional Divisions and Governing Board, and four\nyears for the other groups. Librarians who would like\nto serve on the Advisory Committees can submit their\nletters of interest during the election process, and theGoverning Board will analyse them (IFLA, 2023a).\nTable 1 presents the details of this governance structure.\nThe largest number of representations and groups are\nconcentrated in the Sections, with up to 20 members in\neach. Currently, there are 42 Sections, with their own\nmanagement plans, which report their results to the\nProfessional Council and Governing Board whenevernecessary. They are distributed between types of librar-\nies (public, parliamentary, national and school, among\nothers) and themes (administration and marketing, newmedia, statistics and evaluation, and architecture and\nequipment for libraries, among others). Speci \ufb01cally,\nwithin each Section committee there is a person\nelected as chair and secretary; the others are members,being responsible for projects and other activities pro-\nposed in the management plans.\nThe dedicated and specialized work of each Section\nis fundamental for advocacy actions. Examples of thiscan be found in the UK with regard to the future of\nlibrary science education based on IFLA \u2019s proposed\nre\ufb02ections on advocacy and political engagement\n(Marcella and Oppenheim, 2020). There is also evi-dence on how library advocacy promotes communityengagement and the importance of developing a\nwell-established brand (Singh and Trinchetta, 2020).\nFinally, in Bradley (2009), IFLA \u2019s own experiences\nin measuring the impact of its activities are discussed.\nMany of these Sections contribute considerably to\nlibrarianship on a global level. One of the best-knowncases is the IFLA-UNESCO Public Libraries Manifesto.In 1949, UNESCO created the document \u2018The public\nlibrary: A living force for popular education \u2019,w h i c h\nlater, in 1994, had the cooperation of IFLA for the creationof the current Manifesto (IFLA Public Libraries Section,\n2022). To begin, it is fundamental to recognize that they\nare predisposed to develop pioneering projects thatadvance the \ufb01eld through events, publications and colla-\nborations with non-governmental organizations.\nIn view of the importance of these groups, it is neces-\nsary to consider the diversity in their constitution. In theprocedures for the last elections, the only guideline con-cerning the representation of countries was that there\ncould not be more than two elected members from\nthe same country for the same committee (IFLA,2021b). However, this does not guarantee the necessaryregional representation that considers socio-economic\ndifferences and countries \u2019very particular realities.\nThus, the purpose of this article is to analyse this\nrepresentation of countries on IFLA committees since2015 (which includes the last three management man-\ndates); the nationality of the presidents who have been atthe head of the institution since its establishment; its\naf\ufb01liated institutions; and the countries that have hosted\nthe IFLA World Library and Information Congress\n(WLIC) since 1928. Since its founding, IFLA has made\nefforts to be internationally active, with links to a large\nnumber of countries. Throughout its history, however, pol-itical conditions may have affected some of this work.Underwood (2015) mentions, for example, the apartheid\npolicies in South Africa that have severely impacted this\nw o r k .H e r ea g a i n ,t h ei n \ufb02uence of UNESCO was import-\nant for the continuity of global action, not only by IFLA,\nbut also by other interna tional organizations.\nFinally, I will use in this article the de \ufb01nition of\nGlobal North and Global South from the theoretical con-tributions of Santos (2014), who states that a global\nhegemony of economic, social, cultural and politicalstandards exists in the countries of the Global North.This phenomenon is not only due to the geographical\naspect, but also mainly to the inequality and multiplicity\nof knowledge made invisible and wasted by modernity,which is an evident colonialis t characteristic, according\nto Santos (2014). Moreover, it presents itself in different\ncontexts, including the institutional context, as is thecase of IFLA from the results presented in this article.\nMethodology\nThis research is an exploratory and documentary studybased on the historical records on the web pages of the\nIFLA website, which are maintained and preserved by\nthe Internet Archive Initiative. The procedure wasbased on a visit to the IFLA home page (i \ufb02a.org)\nwithin the Wayback Machine search tool. The InternetArchive Initiative is \u2018non-pro \ufb01t [and] is building a\ndigital library of internet sites and other cultural artifacts\nin digital form \u2019; it comprises 625 billion pages and 38\nbillion books and other materials (Internet Archive,\n2022). For each IFLA group, there is a dedicated webpage. However, I chose to navigate from the home site\nto avoid inconsistencies or the impermanence of URLs\nover the years.\nBefore turning to the Internet Archive, IFLA was\ncontacted to request the data to write this article, butPrado: Representation of countries in IFLA 839\nthe answer was negative because the data was not\norganized in the requested format (without personal\nidenti \ufb01cation). Some old pages were found by brows-\ning the IFLA Archive,1but the old Sections page pre-\nsents only the names of the chairs and secretaries,\nwhich made the collection of information unfeasible\nbecause it did not represent the whole and could preju-\ndice the counting of other countries involved.\nThe data of the members who make up each of the\ncommittees is public, containing their name, af \ufb01liation,\nemail, country and the period of the term for whichthey were elected. An Excel spreadsheet was used to\norganize the data and subsequently create graphs for\nbetter visualization of the distribution of the countries.The data was collected in October 2023, covering the\nlast\ufb01ve IFLA administrations (from 2015 to 2025).\nThis period was selected because it yielded the most\nresults, since the Wayback Machine does not store all\ntime periods.\nIn its new governance format, which was updated in a\nprocess covering the years 2019 and 2020 and tookeffect in July 2021, IFLA has the following structure,\nwhich guided access to the web pages: 42 Sections,one Governing Board, six Regional Divisions and two\nCouncils (one professional and one regional). These\nnew changes had no impact on the data collection as\nthe number of vacancies remained the same. What wasidenti \ufb01ed was a greater representation of countries in\nthe Regional Divisions, given the rule that no more\nthan two members from the same country can be elected.\nThe data of the Special Interest Groups was not collected\nbecause the old IFLA website did not give the names of allmembers, only the convenor of each. With regard to the\nAdvisory Committees, data was collected from the three\nthat have records since 2015 (Standards, Copyright and\nOther Legal Matters, and Freedom of Access to\nInformation and Freedom of Expression). The otherswere created later (Cultural Heritage) or discontinued,\nchanging their name (Action for Development through\nLibraries and Library Development Programme) or evenbecoming Sections (e.g. Environment, Sustainability andLibraries).\nIn addition to IFLA \u2019s governance structure, the\nregional distribution of the 88 WLICs was analysed, aswell as the nationality of the presidents who have been\nat the head of the institution and the distribution of\nFigure 1.

Note: CLM is Copyright and other Legal Matters and\nFAIFE is Freedom of Access to Information and Freedom of Expression.840 IFLA Journal 50(4)\naf\ufb01liated associations and institutions by country. The\nlatter information is available on the IFLA website,\nwithout the need to explore the Internet Archive.\nThe data on the WLIC and the nationality of the presi-\ndents, as it is open access on the IFLA website, was con-\nsidered from IFLA \u2019s creation as it will contribute to the\nveri\ufb01cation of the predominance of the Global North\nover the years. Data relating to IFLA Sections was\nconsidered based on the availability of the InternetArchive, with most pages preserved from 2015. This col-lection of data brings a more complete vision of how\ncountry representation occurs within IFLA.\nResults\nIFLA membership is available in two categories: per-sonal and institutional. To become a member, one\nsimply has to choose the type of membershipTable 1.

The amount is de \ufb01ned according to the\nspeci\ufb01c characteristics of each category, such as asso-\nciations \u2019operational expenses and the three bands of\nthe UNESCO Scale of Assessment, for example(IFLA, n.d.c). The data of the af \ufb01liated associations\nand institutions is public and, in the August 2023update, there were 142 countries represented (IFLA,n.d.a). Table 2 shows the 12 countries with the\nhighest number of member institutions.\nThe\ufb01gures in Table 2 indicate a strong presence\nfrom the Global North (expect for China and SouthAfrica). It is dif \ufb01cult for countries in the Global\nSouth to be among those with the most members\ndue to the costs of membership and even the\nabsence of local support. This is detrimental\nbecause, according to Santos (2014), the developmentof a\ufb01eld from a single cultural and socio-economic\nperspective (mainly European and North American\ncountries) can lead to the exclusion of various other\ncultures, knowledge and needs. The English languagecan also be an obstacle. Even though IFLA has six\nother of \ufb01cial languages (IFLA, n.d.b), the translation\nof documents is not always carried out because it is\ndependent on voluntary collaboration.\nOn the other hand, in electoral processes, the fact\nthat one country has more members than another doesnot interfere in the Standing Committees becausevotes for a potential member can come from any\naf\ufb01liated member. What happens in most cases is that\nmany Sections do not have regional representation\nbecause there is no internal policy to ensure diversity\n(that each Section has one country from each region,\nfor example). However, the number of af \ufb01liatedmembers per country, from the same region, can in \ufb02u-\nence the election for president. Since its inception in\n1927, Germany has had the most people elected to\nthe position (four), followed by the USA andAustralia (three each). Only Botswana and SouthAfrica, as Global South countries, have had presidents,\nin 2003 and 2009 respectively. Table 3 lists the IFLA\npresidents and their countries of origin.\n2\nThe longer the career of a candidate for the IFLA\npresidency, the more recognition they will receivefrom countries. This is important because, in additionto a consolidated record of work on behalf of libraries,\nthe following characteristics are essential to winning\nthe position. These numbers may make it dif \ufb01cult\nfor other professionals from the Global South with\nthe same qualities because, generally, they have\nfewer members to support them.\nNext to the presidency, a f undamentally important\nteam for the work of each administration is the\nGoverning Board because it is responsible for a series\nof strategic decisions. The re presentation by country in\nthis group is as follows: Aus tralia and the Netherlands\n(seven members each); the UK and the USA (six);Denmark and Germany ( \ufb01ve); Canada and South\nAfrica (four); Greece, Mexi co and Singapore (three);\nBrazil, China, Egypt, Finland, India, Spain, Sweden\nTab le 3.

Currently\nheld over \ufb01ve days and usually in the last week of\nAugust, the WLIC brings together participants from,and facilitates the exchange of knowledge related to,the IFLA groups. Organized since 1928, the congress\nhas been held on 88 occasions in 40 different countries\n(IFLA, 2023b). Denmark, England, France, Italy andthe USA are the countries that have hosted the\nWLIC the most ( \ufb01ve times each). As for South\nGlobal countries, South Africa stands out once\nagain, having held the Congress twice (IFLA,\n2023b). IFLA seeks to spread the Congress across\ncountries to allow for the greates number of partici-pants and to decentralise away from the Europeanaxis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, WLIC 2020,\nwhich was to be held in Dublin, was cancelled and\nmoved to 2022, and WLIC 2021 was held virtually.The 2024 congress, which was due to take place in\nDubai, was cancelled by the Emirates Library and\nInformation Association.\nTo host the Congress, a country needs to make a\nlarge \ufb01nancial investment, which makes it impossible\nfor many countries in the Global South to organise theevent. This investment is the result of a strong articu-lation between local governments and companies that\ncan provide \ufb01nancial support. Other determining\nfactors include a strong national library association,\nthe necessary infrastructure for hosting international\nevents and security measures.\nAs for data on the representation in the IFLA\nSections, it was collected for the period 2015 to 2025\u2013that is, \ufb01ve administrations. For some Sections, it\nwas not possible to collect data in the Wayback\nMachine regarding their management from 2017 to\n2019. However, this did not have a detrimental effect\non the analysis intended for this article. It is also import-ant to mention that although each administration had 20vacancies, not all of them were \ufb01lled. Table 4 presents\nall the IFLA Sections and the countries \u2019representation.\nI choose to present the data in detail in order to allow forother analyses, such as regional or even thematic.\nFrom this data, it can be observed that the USA is in\n\ufb01rst position with the largest number of positions\noccupied (693). Of the 44 IFLA Sections, there are\nonly three in which it does not have representation,\nwhich are regional Sections (Asia and Oceania,Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa). Next\ncomes China with 198 places, Germany with 172,\nCanada with 161, France with 139, Sweden with121, Australia with 102, the UK with 100, Italywith 82, and Russia with 76. In relation to SouthGlobal countries, the country with the most places\nin the IFLA Sections is Brazil, with 64. Among\nthe countries with the low est number of representa-\ntions (one each) are Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda,Bahrain, Belarus, Fiji, Latvia, Mali, Mariana\nIslands, Mauritius, Nepal, Paraguay, Puerto Rico,\nS o m a l i a ,S y r i a ,T a n z a n i a ,V i e t n a m ,t h eU n i t e dNations and Uzbekistan.\nThere are three positions on the Standing\nCommittee of each Section: Chari, Secretary andInformation Coordinator. The position of Chair is con-\nsidered to be a proeminent one, both in terms of lead-\nership and knowledge of the subject the Section isworking on. Here again, the USA ranks \ufb01rst with 66\npeople serving as chair, followed by Australia (18),Canada (12), the UK (9), France (8), Finland (7),and Germany and Italy (6 each). Argentina,Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Mexico and\nSouth Africa are the only southern countries with\nmembers holding the position of chair.\nThe committees with the largest number of countries\nrepresented are those of the National Libraries Section(34), Management of Library Associations Section(30), and Freedom of Access to Information and\nFreedom of Expression Advisory Committee (29).\nSince there is generally one national library percountry, this accounts for the National LibrariesSection being that with the largest number of countries.\nAcademic and Research Libraries results from the fact\nthat these types of library tend to have the most resourcesand employ the most professionals. And \ufb01nally, the\nManagement of Library Associations Section is relatedto countries \u2019librarian associations.\nDiscussion\nFor the organization of the discussion of the results, Istart from what is illustrated in Table 5.\nThe highlight at the regional level is Europe. It is\nthe countries of this region that have the largestnumber of af \ufb01liated associations and institutions\n(438), including representations in IFLA (31). This\nhelps to account for the fact that, since 1927, 15\nEuropean presidents have been elected and 60WLICs have been held in European cities.\nThe USA has the largest number of af \ufb01liated asso-\nciations and institutions, and therefore also the largestnumber of representatives in IFLA. It has a strongadvocacy for libraries that is exemplary for others;\nthe American Library Association (2022) has almost\n50,000 members. The USA \u2019s interest in global librar-\nianship activities can be found as early as 1877 in its\nparticipation in the founding of the British LibraryPrado: Representation of countries in IFLA 843\nTable 4.

Almost 20 years later, Melvil Dewey,\npresident of the American Library Association,\nhoped that the association \u2019s congress could be increas-\ningly international (Mohrhardt, 1977).\nSouth Africa and Botswana stand out as the only\ncountries from the Global South with a presidency\nin IFLA. There is no representation from LatinAmerica and the Caribbean among the 23 presidents,and only Gloria P\u00e9rez-Salmer\u00f3n had Spanish as her\nnative language, which was considered a very positive\napproach by Latin American and Caribbean countries.\nA better distribution of the regions is noticeable on\nthe Governing Board. It is important to consider that amember may have been re-elected, and so wascounted again, as is the case with Australia, Brazil,\nMexico and other countries where the same people\nhave served two consecutive terms.\nWith regard to the WLIC, the countries that hosted\nthe event the most were Denmark, England, France,Italy and the USA ( \ufb01ve times each).

From 2021, they became Regional Divisions and are\ncurrently in the process of \ufb01nalising their \ufb01rst management.\nbThere is no data on the IFLA website regarding the composition of this Advisory Committee before 2021.\ncThe IFLA website has data on this Advisory Committee only for the term 2015 \u20132017.\ndThe IFLA website has data on this Advisory Committee only for the term 2019 \u20132021.Prado: Representation of countries in IFLA 847\nBangkok (1999), Beijing (1996), Havana (1994), New\nDelhi (1992), Nairobi (1984) and Manila (1980). Asmentioned earlier, organizing the Congress requires\nstable political and socio-economic conditions, with an\ninfrastructure that is suitable for hosting internationalevents and a strong national library association. The\nfull set of these features is often dif \ufb01cult to \ufb01nd in\nGlobal South countries, especially in terms of \ufb01nance.\nAn IFLA Section \u2019s mandate is generally represented\nby an average of 20 countries. When analysing the man-\ndates selected for this research (since 2015), the numbercan vary from 10 (such as the Indigenous MattersSection and the Africa Division) to 34 countries (such\nas the National Libraries Section).\nIt is interesting to note that not all countries that have\ninstitutions af \ufb01liated with IFLA have representation in\nthe groups. This is the case of Albania, Andorra, the\nBahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia,Cura\u00e7ao, Dominican Republic, Faroe Islands, Gambia,\nGeorgia, Gibraltar, Greenl and, Guatemala, Guyana,\nHonduras, Iceland, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Jamaica,Jordan, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Malawi, the Maldives,Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, North Korea, North\nMacedonia, Panama, Samoa, Sierra Leone, Suriname,\nTuvalu, Ukraine and the Vatican City.\nThe distribution of the data on the structure of IFLA,\nthe countries that hosted the WLIC and the nationality ofthe presidencies demonstrates a strong predominance ofthe Global North. Jordan (1954) stated that several initia-\ntives failed or were merely symbolic, even with work\nwith organizations such as UNESCO andFID (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Documentation) onbehalf of Global South libraries. Jordan explained thatit was necessary to have better planned work that under-stood the nature of regional problems. Allied to this,\nthere was the problem of the passage of two World\nWars, which brought about a great impasse in inter-national politics and the dialogue between nations \u2013in\nother words, a very fragile socio-economic context(Campbell, 2002).\nIt was 50 years after its foundation that IFLA created\ninitiatives that paid attention to the countries of theGlobal South \u2013most notably, the Working Group for\nDeveloping Countries (Parker, 1977). At the time, ofthe 350 positions in the IFLA structure, only 22 were\nheld by librarians from that region, which led to the cre-\nation of the Division for Regional Activities. It was amilestone for the time that culminated in programmes\nfor regional development, the emergence of regional\nof\ufb01ces (Parker, 1977) and the \ufb01rst steps towards what\nis now understood as the IFLA Regional Divisions.\nConclusion\nIn the 96 years of its existence, IFLA has been consid-ered the \u2018global voice of libraries \u2019. Its structure has\nbeen consolidated into Sections, Regional Divisions,Special Interest Groups, Advisory Committees, aGoverning Board and the staff at its headquarters inThe Hague. This allows IFLA to reach different\ntypes of libraries and sub \ufb01elds of librarianship.\nHowever, regional diversity is still a challenge to be\novercome. In a blunt letter to Pierre Bourgeois, the\nIFLA president, Ranganathan (1954), an IndianTable 5.

Thus, Ranganathan indicated that\nthere should be more representation in the decision-making groups, avoiding a colonialist attitude.\nThe data from this survey shows a predominance of\nGlobal North countries, especially European ones,which may stem from the historical factors aroundIFLA (its establishment in Edinburgh, the headquarters\nmoving to The Hague in the Netherlands in the 1970s,\nand the \ufb01rst congresses being held in European cities).\nIn a way, this data shows that Ranganathan \u2019s concern\nnearly 70 years ago remains.\nThe absence of Latin American countries, for\nexample, in certain IFLA Sections may be detrimen-\ntal to the regional development of the \ufb01eld. The\nEducation and Training Section is one example.\n3\nI ts e e k st ow o r ka r o u n d \u2018new professional competen-\ncies and tools for the development of librarians in anever-changing information age \u2019(IFLA Education\nand Training Section, 2022), and there is no\nrepresentation from Latin America. This may indicate\ndiscussions around professional pro \ufb01les, training cur-\nricula and theoretical frameworks centred on realities\nthat have little to do with Latin America and the\nCaribbean.\nThe Indigenous Matters Section is another example\nwhere the presence of Latin American countries would\nbe important, since its goal is to promote international\ncooperation between libraries, and culture, knowledge\nand information services to indigenous communities(IFLA Indigenous Matters Section, 2022). According\nto the Economic Commission for Latin America and\nthe Caribbean (2015), mainly South American coun-tries have made different efforts on behalf of indigen-\nous peoples, from census mapping to the preservation\nof their cultural practices.\nWhen it is not in the Regional Divisions, the partici-\npation by Global South countries requires supportduring the election period, knowledge of the Englishlanguage, and the availability to travel to mid-yearmeetings and to the WLIC. In addition, those countries\ncompete with professionals from countries that may\nhave more recognition in certain subjects.\nIFLA has always been aware of this context with\nregard to Global South countries. Recent efforts tominimize it can be highlighted in the BuildingStrong Library Associations programme and the\nInternational Advocacy Programme. The \ufb01rst was\ndedicated to the strengthening and sustainability of\nlibrary associations, as they are seen a strong points\nfor the representation of their countries (IFLA,\n2016). The second brought advocacy activitiescarried out by libraries around the world to includethem in national development plans for the implemen-tation of the United Nations \u2019Agenda 2030 (IFLA,\n2017). Both projects worked well in the past andshould be taken up again.\nMore recently, IFLA has been working to broaden\nthe diversity of countries in its groups. Since the 2020\nelection, based on the results obtained from the\nprocess called \u2018IFLA \u2019s Global Vision \u2019, which struc-\ntured the new governance system, it is not possible\nto have more than two people from the same country\nin the same Regional Division. However, this decisionalone does not prevent certain Sections from having a\npredominance of only one region, as is most often the\ncase with Europe. It would be necessary to make itmandatory that all regions be represented among the\n20 members that are elected.\nThere are other options inspired by, but not limited\nto, Ranganathan (1954). One that could be incorpo-\nrated, at least in the discussions within the Sections,\nis for IFLA to guide and monitor how each Standing\nCommittee treats regional diversity in its discussions.Internal guidelines and tool kits could be used in this\nregard. Broadening the number of of \ufb01cial languages\ncould also be a way forward, bringing in those that\nare most widely spoken instead of keeping only to\nthose of the countries with the most paying\nmembers. As for the membership aspect, differen-tiated values should be applied, not only followingthe UNESCO Scale of Assessment and the United\nNations \u2019List of Least Developed Countries, but also\nobserving more closely the \ufb01nancial reality of each\ncountry. The practice of sponsorship between institu-tions could also help, so that more members from\ncountries in the Global South can participate.\nDuring the research, it was identi \ufb01ed that there are\nmany countries with IFLA-af \ufb01liated institutions but\nwithout any representation in the groups. Futureresearch is recommended to analyse the reasons\nwhy small countries (such as the Nordic countries)\nhave large representation in IFLA and other largercountries (such as Ukraine and Israel) are not partof the groups that make up the institution \u2019s structure.\nI also suggest comparing the populations of the coun-tries in terms of the number of af \ufb01liated members\nand libraries to identify the strength of the profession\nin each.\nNearing its 100th anniversary, IFLA will remain an\ninstitution of global relevance. Its challenges aretypical of organizations of this size, but its work to\nextend its regionality does not depend exclusivelyon itself, but also on the regional interest of librarians.\nAdvocacy for libraries goes beyond institutional\nboundaries and should be seen as an opportunity anda duty for all professionals.Prado: Representation of countries in IFLA 849\nDeclaration of con \ufb02icting interests\nThe author declared no potential con \ufb02icts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of\nthis article.\nFunding\nThe author received no \ufb01nancial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nJorge Mois\u00e9s Kroll do Prado https://orcid.org/0000-\n0002-7287-8133\nNotes\n1.See http://archive.i \ufb02a.org\n2.Although Kay Raseroka was born in South Africa, her work forlibraries over many years has been outstanding in Botswana\nand it is for this reason, among others, that she was elected to\nthe IFLA Governing Board and later as president.\n3.IFLA has a Special Interest Group called LIS Educationin Developing Countries, which considers the regional\ndiscussions, but it is currently not a Section and has\ntherefore not been accounted for in this research.\nReferences\nAmerican Library Association (2022) ALA updates.

In den letzten Jahren wurden\u00fcberraschende Belege f\u00fcr Sagans Theorie vomNobelpreistr\u00e4ger und Neurowissenschaftler Eric\nKandel (2016) und anderen vorgelegt: Das menschliche\nGehirn ist seit 50.000 Jahren nicht wesentlich gewach-sen, vermutlich nicht aufgrund einer evolution\u00e4ren\nStagnation, sondern weil die kulturelle Evolution die bio-\nlogische Evolution beim Homo sapiens abgel\u00f6st hat, einFortschritt, der dazu gef\u00fchrt hat, dass wir zur dominier-\nenden Spezies auf der Erde geworden sind.\nRepresentation of countries in IFLA\nVertretung der L\u00e4nder in der IFLA\nJorge Mois\u00e9s Kroll do Mois\u00e9s Kroll do Prado\nIFLA Journal, 50-4, 838-850Zusammenfassung:\nDiese Studie untersucht die Beteiligung von\nL\u00e4ndern an einer der f\u00fchrenden internationalenBibliotheksorganisationen, der IFLA.

They have change social perspectives\nand guide their readers towards the desired objectives. The relative decline of\ntraditional media, such as television and paper, that once attracted millions of\npeople, has forced news organizations to shift their focus towards social media\nto increase viewership. Using `like', share and comment counts to understand the\nreaders has been fruitful, but the news organizations should utilize the new reaction\nbuttons introduced on Facebook. My objective is demonstrate how these news\norganizations can analyze their own, and their competitors, new articles to predict\nwhich highest reaction they are likely to receive. The conclusions drawn from my\ndissertation is that it is possible. However, caution must be drawn for scenarios\nwhen predicting controversial news article.\n1 Introduction\nSocial media has become an integral part of daily life. It was initially used for commu-\nnicating with friends, and family, as well as dating. Overtime, it expanded to encompass\ne-commerce, political discussions, brand promotion and connecting those with common\ninterests with one another (Udanor et al.; 2016). In addition, many news organizations\nuse social media sites to increase their viewership, by posting news article links, and\nvideos. This has resulted in users generating hundreds of terabytes of data daily.\nFacebook introduced reaction buttons, to complement their `Like' button, at the end\nof February 2016 (Stinson; 2016). These new reactions are `Love', `Haha', `Wow', `Sad'\nand `Angry'. These new reaction buttons have given people more freedom in expressing\ntheir opinion with a single press and swipe. It has also opened a new resource for re-\nsearchers and organizations to utilize towards generating content that would get a desired\nreaction.\nWith the advantage of attracting more viewers online than through traditional media,\nnews organizations compete with one another vigorously. In order to gain advantage over\ncompetitors, it is important for a news organization to understand their readers, and how\n1\nthe reader reactions towards their published article online. It is also important to know\nhow their competitors` readers would react to their news articles. In addition, knowing\nhow the reader would react could also allow the marketing department to create improved\ntargeted ads that would utilize the readers emotional state upon reading the article.\nPilon (2016) provided a guide to businesses on how to interpret reactions. Peterson\n(2015) and Greenberg (2016) have stressed the bene\fts that marketers and advertisers\ncan gain by evaluating these reactions. Turnbull and Jenkins (2016) explains how media\ncampaigns can utilize these reactions to better understand how users react towards pos-\nted content. Given these potential applications of reactions, Badache and Boughanem\n(2017), Pool and Nissim (2016) and others have used them in their research. They \fnd\nthe reactions to have signi\fcant implications in their studies.\nFor the purpose of this dissertation, the main objective is to analyze if text analysis of\nnews articles can be used to predict user reactions on Facebook. This objective is divided\ninto 3 research questions, in order to better understand the main objective:\n1. Can news articles predict which (Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry) reaction gets the\nhighest count from Facebook?\n2. Can news articles predict which groups of (Love And Haha, Wow and Haha, Sad\nand Wow, etc) reactions gets the highest count from Facebook?\n3. Does the \frst research question di\u000ber for articles posted by di\u000berent news organiz-\nations?\nIn order to answer these questions, articles posted by the following news organizations\nare used: Yahoo News, CNN, New York Times, Fox News, NBC News, Washington Post,\nThe Guardian, ABC News, BBC News, USA Today and Los Angeles Times. The o\u000ecial\nFacebook posts and news articles of these 11 news organizations are extracted, cleaned\nand analyzed. The data extracted are from March 2016 till June 2017.\nResearch is conducted to check if reactions can be predicted, with regards to news\narticles posted on Facebook by di\u000berent news organizations. More than one years worth\nof posts, along with the reactions, are extracted from news organizations o\u000ecial pages on\nFacebook. Using the article links in the post, the main content of the article is extracted\nfrom the news organizations site. After cleaning the extracted news articles, text analysis\nthrough LIWC is conducted. The results of the text analysis are joined with the original\nFacebook post. Finally, Support Vector Machine is used to address the above research\nquestions. Using the results of the classi\fer, each of the questions are separately analyzed\nand conclusions drawn.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 covers related works and\nprovides a literature review, where other research, addressing similar questions, is dis-\ncussed in detail. Section 3 discusses the Research Methodology, while section 4 discusses\nimplementation. Section 5 address the research questions stated above. Section 6 gives\nthe conclusion and discusses future work.\n2\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Introduction\nAs of the third quarter of 2017, there are more than 2 billion active monthly users on\nFacebook1. With Facebook connecting large numbers of people, it has provided many\nacademic researchers and organizations with the opportunities to analyze and understand\nsocial media users. They utilize Facebook to understand human behaviour. As such,\nMachine learning techniques have been extensively used to analyze people, and their\ninteractions on Facebook.\n2.2 Limited Collection of User Reactions: Like\nThe Facebook `Like' button has been extensively researched by both academics and or-\nganizations. Most journal articles show that the like button has a positive impact on the\npost. People having greater connection to the post have a higher chance of pressing the\nlike button (Pelletier and Blakeney Horky; 2015) than those who do not have the connec-\ntion. In addition, people use the like button for a wide range of reasons, like maintaining\na conversation and social ties, and dating e\u000borts (Eranti and Lonkila; 2015). Even journal\narticles that received one or more likes on Facebook are likely to have a higher number\nof citations (Ringelhan et al.; 2015). The number of likes on a post about movies, before\ntheir release date, has a wide impact on the box o\u000ece performance of movies (Ding et al.;\n2017).\nHowever, while there are many di\u000berent bene\fts associated with `like', it is not uni-\nversally acknowledged as the ideal candidate to focus upon. Brands that respond to\ncomplaints quickly, develop loyal relationships with customers, and understand the fact\nthat people have greater control over their brand image online (Avery et al.; 2017), can\ngain greater online presence and followers than many others. In addition, Winter et al.\n(2015) have demonstrated that positive comments or likes do not in\ruence a readers per-\nspective on a news story or its content.\nWhile researchers do not always agree on the signi\fcance, or insigni\fcance, of the `like'\nbutton, they do agree that `like' button limits the users interaction towards `a\u000ermation' of\nthe post. This limited interaction makes it di\u000ecult to `like' posts with negative contexts,\nlike natural disasters, deaths or crime. With the addition of \fve di\u000berent reaction buttons,\nthis limitation has been signi\fcantly mitigated. As such, it allows many researchers to\nimprove their existing studies.\n2.3 Extended Collections of User Reactions\nFor years, many studies have been conducted on Facebook that focused on `Like', share\nand comment counts. This is common to studies conducted on Twitter, YouTube and\nother social media networks. The Facebook Reactions provide the opportunity to con-\nduct a wider range of studies. Search Engines use social signals (e.g. like, +1, rating)\nas a source of evidence for their retrieval ranking systems. Ranking functions based on\n1https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2017/Q3/Q3'\n17-Earnings-Release.pdf\n3\nsocial and sentic features of users feedback in YouTube, perform better than those based\non basic features (e.g. title, tags) (Orellana-Rodriguez et al.; 2014). As such, Badache\nand Boughanem (2017) studied the impact of Facebook reactions, and concluded that\nincorporating Facebook reactions can also improve the retrieval ranking performance. In\naddition to analyzing each reaction individually, they also demonstrate that analyzing\ncombinations of reactions is also useful for analysis.\nResearch has been conducted to detect emotion from a Facebook post. Pool and Nis-\nsim (2016) used Facebook reactions to train a support vector machine to detect emotion.\nBy comparing their results with other emotion detection methodologies, they achieve\ncompetitive results without relying on handcrafted resources. Tian et al. (2017) analyze\nthe correlation between emoji usage and Facebook reactions, and conclude that Facebook\nreactions and comments can be used to investigate a user's emotional attitude towards a\npost. In addition, they demonstrate that it is possible to detect positive emoji usage un-\nder negative context, and vice versa. Guzman et al. (2016) were able to predict reactions\nby analyzing only the headlines posted on a Facebook post. They have identi\fed Support\nVector Machine as the most ideal classi\fer when using Facebook reactions, though it has\nbeen stated that other classi\fers can perform better by the changing parameters of the\nclassi\fers and feature models.\nThe \frst research question is inspired by Guzman et al. (2016) research. In their\nresearch, they analyze headlines posted on Facebook to predict the reactions. However,\nin \frst research question, the whole news article text, extracted from news organizations\nwebsites, is analyzed to predict reactions. Badache and Boughanem (2017) inspired the\nsecond research question. They demonstrated the usefulness of analyzing combinations\nof reactions.\n2.4 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Text Analysis\nLinguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a text analysis software which is ex-\ntensively used by many researchers. It analyses text provided by the user and returns\npsychologically meaningful categories in numeric form(Tausczik and Pennebaker; 2010).\nLIWC provides over 95 psycho-linguistic categories, including Functional Words, Percep-\ntual Processes, Biological Processes, Drives, E\u000bect, Social, Cognitive Process etc..\nIn order to investigate how citizens select election news online, Jang and Oh (2016)\nused LIWC to analyze the news headline and subhead to get the positive and negative\nemotional percentage. To understand the relationship between political ideology of U.S.\npolitics and mind-body focus, Robinson et al. (2017) used LIWC to analyze news art-\nicles, presidential state of union address and layperson writing sample. Their conclusion\ndemonstrated that text written liberal ideologies score positively in mind-body terms,\nwhile conservative ideologies score negatively in mind-body terms. Hwong et al. (2017)\nuses LIWC to analyze if social media messages that focus on space science posts, have\nunique psycho-linguistic features.\nDue to its extensive usage by many researchers and extensive text analysis capabilities,\nLIWC is used to analyze the news article to address all three research questions.\n4\n3 Methodology\nFor the dissertation, R Programming language is primarily used. It is an open source\nstatistical software, that incorporates features from both object oriented programming\nand functional programming (Matlo\u000b; 2011). It has a dedicated online community, that\ncontributes libraries and updates that are essential for a data analyst. It is used for\ndata extraction, cleaning and transforming, as well as implementing classi\fers, such as\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM).\nThere are many di\u000berent text analysis libraries and software available. For the dis-\nsertation, LIWC is used to analyze the news articles. Unlike many other text analysis\nlibraries, LIWC is robust and does not require an extensive amount of text cleaning prior\nto analyzing. For analysis of the results of SVM for each research question, Tableau is\nused to create graphs and complement the evaluation.\nFigure 1: Flow Chart\n3.1 Facebook Posts Data\nIn order to ensure the best possible analysis for this dissertation, news organizations\nwith largest number of followers, as of August 2017, are selected2. To ensure that `Fake\nNews' does not have any in\ruence over the analysis, the Facebook ID of the original news\norganizations is extracted from their o\u000ecial web site. No uno\u000ecial news organizations\nFacebook ID is included in the Facebook post extraction process.\nAs this dissertation is about analyzing the Facebook reactions, news organizations'\nFacebook post extraction starts from the 1st March 2016. This is when Facebook reac-\ntions were introduced world wide (Stinson; 2016). The extraction ends before June 2017.\nThis is because Facebook introduced a new reaction, Pride, to celebrate LGBT pride\nmonth3. As the analysis requires Facebook posts data containing the reactions buttons,\n2http://fanpagelist.com/category/news/world/\n3https://www.ajc.com/news/facebook-introduces-rainbow-reaction-celebrate-lgbt-pride-month/\n93HZe0ZEX8FJ0bStVgl9CJ/\n5\nthat spans more than a year, the new Pride reaction is not included. As the Pride reac-\ntion would interfere with the analysis, the Facebook posts extraction is limited till 31st\nMay 2017.\nTo extract the news organizations posts from Facebook, Rfacebook4library is used.\nThe bene\ft of using this API is that, even with free Facebook developer credentials, it\nensures that it extracts as many posts as possible on a given day. Due to the limitation\nof 25 post returns on free Facebook developer credentials, the API will call the extraction\nservice multiple times in the same day. As there is a limit to calling the extraction service\n200 times per hour, this causes the API to generate errors when it calls the extraction\nservice beyond 200 time per hour. By using a combination of `Sys.sleep' and `tryCatch'\nfunctions of R, it is possible to make the extraction process completely automated. The\ndata retrieved is saved in CSV \fles periodically, in case the `tryCatch' function is unable\nto capture the error generated.\nAs new organizations Facebook posts contain multimedia content, they need to be\ncleaned. This is done by removing the posts that only contained either videos or images.\nOnly the posts with news article links remain.\n3.2 News Article Data\nThe links to access the news article are provided by Facebook posts. However, the URL\nprovided are shortened. This causes some issues when accessing the website for article\nextraction. To resolve this issue, longurl5library is used to expand the short URL to\nit original format. The original URL format is also checked to make sure it redirects\ntowards the actual article, and not towards the main page of the news organization.\nThere have been cases of some Facebook posts pointing towards the same news article.\nTo resolve this issue, the original URL links are compared with one another. If they are\nthe same, the original URL link posts are combined. The reaction counts will add with\ntheir respective reactions counts in other posts.\nIn order to extract the news articles, the library boilerpipeR6is used. Unlike the\nFacebook extraction process, there are no limitations to extraction. However, the API\ndoes generate java related errors in some cases. To ensure that the errors are minimized\nand handled appropriately, `tryCatch', `withCallHandlers' and `withRestarts' functions\nof R are used.\n3.3 News Article Analysis\nUnlike the unstructured text commonly available online, the news articles are relatively\nclean. However, they are still required to undergo text cleaning before analysis. The\ncleaning involves removing text that does not contribute towards the news article, like\n`Click here to read more' or `Newsletter Sign Up'. Each news organization article had to\n4https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rfacebook\n5https://cran.r-project.org/package=longurl\n6https://cran.r-project.org/package=boilerpipeR\n6\nbe cleaned separately from other news organization articles.\nEven though LIWC is more robust than other text analyses, it still requires the\ncleaning and transforming of text before analysis. Grammar, capitalization and sentence\nstructure do not need to be corrected. However, meaningful abbreviations, like month\n`Dec', should be December. Common abbreviations like `Dr.', `Ms.` or `Mr.' need to have\ntheir periods removed. Common internet notations, like email address, URL address,\nhash tag and twitter handler need to be changed. Other common problems like `w/' or\n`b/` also need to be changed.\nOnce the text is ready for analysis on LIWC, a csv \fles is created, containing all the\nnews articles extracted. The csv \fle is analyzed by the LIWC software, and a new csv\n\fle is generated. The new csv \fle contains 95 LIWC text analysis components of each\nnews article.\nThe new csv \fle is read by R and preprocessed for the main analysis. The results of\nthe text analysis conducted by LIWC are based on the total number of words the text\ncontains. Text with 10000 words give far more reliable results than 100 words7. So, in\norder to conduct analysis with reliable results from LIWC, news articles with word count\nless than 300 are removed.\n3.4 Main Analysis\nTo evaluate the research question, multiple datasets are made from the main data for\nanalysis. The `like' reaction is removed from the analysis, as it has the highest count\nacross the entire data, as shown in Fig 2, and would cause issues with the evaluation.\nFigure 2: Total Count\nFor each research question, multiple datasets are created to handle each reaction. In\nthe case of second research question, multiple datsets are created to handle each group of\n7https://liwc.wpengine.com/how-it-works/\n7\nreactions. Each dataset is given an additional column, `Category', which identi\fes which\nnews articles have the highest particular reaction, relevant to that dataset. For example,\nin a dataset handling `Angry' reaction, the `Category' is set to 1, if that news article\nhas `Angry' count greater than other reactions count. Otherwise, the `Category' is set\nto 0. For the second research question, a dataset handling `Wow' and 'Haha' group, the\n`Category' is set to 1, if the news article has `Wow' and `Haha' count greater than others\nreactions. Otherwise, the `Category' is set to 0. Please note that count between `Wow'\nand `Haha' reactions is not considered, only that they are individually greater than others\nreactions count.\nTo conduct the research question analysis, the following four libraries are used. The\n`splitstackshape'8library is used to stratify the data, ensuring that the data analyzed\nare balanced. The `caret'9library is used to divide the data into test and train sets, and\ncalculate the confusion matrix of the classi\fer, which is analyzed in the Evaluation sec-\ntion of the dissertation. The `e1071'10library is used for conducting the analysis through\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM).\nIn order to reduce the bias associated with one-shot random sampling, each analysis is\nconducted 10 times with di\u000berent sets of strati\fed data and di\u000berent test and train sets.\nThe resulting data generated is transferred to Tableau, where the average is calculated,\nand the standard deviation is also calculated to ensure consistency between each analysis.\nIn addition to SVM, other classi\fers were also considered for main analysis. Guzman\net al. (2016) also used Stochastic Gradient Descent and Multinomial Naive Bayes classier\nbut found SVM to perform the best. Decision Tree and Arti\fcial Neural Network are\ntested for the dissertation, but did not perform as well as SVM. Hence, SVM is the main\nclassi\fer used for all three research questions.\n4 Implementation\n4.1 Facebook Post Retrieval\nIn order to retrieve data from Facebook, a developer account is created on Facebook, and\nan application is created. The application ID and secret ID are retrieved.\nAfter deciding on which news organizations to cover, their o\u000ecial Facebook account\nIDs are retrieved from their o\u000ecial websites. Using the Rfacebook library, the application\naccount ID and secret ID are authenticated. A date list is then created, using the `seq'\nfunction to retrieve each day between 1st March 2016 till 1st June 2017.\nA `for' loop is used to sequentially go through all the days. Inside the loop, the\n`getPage' function of the Rfacebook API is used to retrieve all the posts posted on that\nparticular day, using the speci\fed news organization ID. The `getPage' function will call\nthe a post retrieval few time, in order to get all the posts for that day. On average,\nthe `getPage' function will call the post retrieval function 3 to 4 times, to retrieve all\n8https://cran.r-project.org/package=splitstackshape\n9https://caret.r-forge.r-project.org\n10https://cran.r-project.org/package=e1071\n8\nthe posts posted by the news organization in a day. As there is a limit of 200 calls per\nhour on Facebook, the `getPage' function is called between 60 to 70 times before the\n`Sys.sleep' function is called to hold the loop for 1 hour. The `tryCatch' will handle the\nerrors generated by the `getPage'.\nAmong the information retrieved from Facebook, it also provides `type'. It gives\n3 categories regarding the post - video, photo and link. As per requirement of the\ndissertation, only the posts with links are saved and the rest are discarded.\n4.2 News Article Retrieval\nOn Facebook, the news organizations save short URL links. In half the cases, directly\nretrieving the news articles from the short URL link causes problems with boilerpipeR\nlibrary. To resolve this issue, the `longurl' library is used to convert the short URL to\nthe original URL, by using the `expand urls' function.\nOnce the original URL has been retrieved, it is checked to make sure that they redir-\nect towards the actual article, and not the main web page of the news article. All the\nURLs below a certain size are collected and visually inspected. If they redirect towards\nthe home page, they are discarded.\nThere have been cases, while inspecting the articles retrieved, that news articles were\nrepeated across multiple posts. Using R code, these article original URLs are identi\fed,\nand their relevant posts are combined. This eliminates article repetition, and still pre-\nserves their relevant Facebook information.\nThe library boilerpipeR is used to retrieve the news articles from the original URLs,\nwith `ArticleExtractor' function. While the library does not have the same limitations\nas the Facebook retrieval process did, it still generated errors that needed to be handled.\nTo handle scenarios where the extraction process toke too long, the `evalWithTimeout'\nfunction was used to give the `ArticleExtractor' 4 seconds to retrieve the article. Oth-\nerwise, it would interrupt the process and generate an error. BoilerpipeR library, which\nis provides an interface to the Boilerpipe Java Library, generates java related errors in\nsome scenarios. As `tryCatch' is unable to handle java related errors, a combination of\n`withCallHandlers' and `withRestarts' functions is incorporated with `tryCatch' functions\nto handle the java related errors. In order to ensure that the article is extracted, the same\noriginal URL is called 3 times if the \frst attempt at retrieval fails.\n4.3 News Article Cleaning, and Analysis\nOnce all the articles are extracted from a news organization website, they undergo a\ncleaning process before they are analyzed by LIWC. The articles have to be grouped by\nnews organization, as each news organizations articles require a di\u000berent cleaning process.\nUsing combinations of `sapply' and `gsub' functions, the news article text is cleaned. The\nsame combination is also used to clean the text as required by LIWC Operator Manual11.\n11https://liwc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LIWC2015_OperatorManual.pdf\n9\nWhen the news article texts are cleaned, they are all combined. After they are com-\nbined, they are saved in .csv \fle. The LIWC software uses the .csv \fle to analyze all\nthe news articles extracted, and generates a new .csv \fle with additional text analysis\ncolumns. The new csv \fle is then cleaned in R, and articles with word count less than\n300 are removed.\n4.4 Main Analysis\nInitially, `set.seed(15040704)' is set in the R code. This is to ensure that the results of\nthe analysis conducted on R are reproducible.\nOnce the data reactions has been categorized, columns of data that are not relevant\nto the analysis are removed. The `Category' column is factorized for classi\fer analysis\npurposes. In case of \frst and second research questions, two `for' loops are used to ana-\nlyze the categorized data. The external `for' loop selects the speci\fc reaction/s data to\nanalyze, and the inner `for' loop is to run the same analysis 10 times. In case of the\nthird research question, three `for' loops are used. The \frst `for' loop is used to select\nthe speci\fc reaction data to analyze, the second `for' loop is used to select the news\norganization, and the third `for' loop is used to run the same analysis 10 times.\nWithin the inner most loop, the selected reaction data is strati\fed using the `strati\fed'\nfunction. The function takes the data, `Category' as the column to identify for grouping\nand the total number of `Category' that are identi\fed as 1. This is to ensure that the\nresulting dataset is balanced and has equal numbers of `Categories' with 1 and 0. This\nis also the primary reason why entire main analysis is run 10 times. The total number\nof `Category' that are identi\fed as 1 are small, when compared to the entire dataset.\nHence the need to run it 10 time so that there is greater chances of selecting `Category'\nidenti\fed as 0 that were not select in the previous analysis. Thus ensuring that the end\nresult is consistent, and unambiguous.\nThe `createDataPartition' function is used to create datasets for testing and training\nthe SVM. `Category' is identi\fed as the vector to considered when creating the testing\nand training sets. 75% is the training set size, and 25% is the testing set size of the\ntotal strati\fed dataset. The List parameter is set to false. Running the main analysis 10\ntimes also allows the function to used di\u000berent sets of data for each analysis, within the\npercentage set.\nThe `svm' function is then used to run the SVM analysis using the training dataset.\nThe function is used is set to default settings. The `Category' is set as the dependent\nvariable, and the rest of the data is set as independent variables. The data is scaled\ninternally. The type used is categorical classi\fcation. Cache size is set to 40. Tolerance\nof termination criteria is set to 0.1. Shrinking Heuristics is set to TRUE.\nThe `predict' function is then used to calculate the predictability of the SVM using\nthe training dataset. The `confusionMatrix' function calculates the variables related to\nclassi\fer `predict' function. The resulting variables of`confusionMatrix' are placed into csv\n\fles, which are read by the Tableau. The averages and standard deviation are generated\nand their respective graphs are generated. These graphs are discussed in detail in the\n10\nEvaluation section of dissertation.\n5 Evaluation\nFor evaluation of each research question, the averages of accuracy, kappa, speci\fcity,\nand sensitivity of the SVM are evaluated. In the third research question, the standard\ndeviation will be considered, as it has a considerable impact over the other variables\nconsidered for evaluation. The \frst and second research questions have standard deviation\nof less than 0.02, thus having negligible e\u000bect over their conclusion.\nAccuracy (%) =(TruePositive +TrueNegative )\n(TruePositive +FalseNegative ) + (FalsePositive +TrueNegative )\nThe accuracy de\fnes the capability of the model to predict the reaction of the news\narticle. However, it cannot be solely relied upon to give an overall evaluation of the\nresearch questions. Other variables of the analysis are also considered to provide de\fnitive\nevaluation.\nKappaStatistic = 1\u0000(1\u0000Po)\n(1\u0000Pe)\nPo = Relative Observe Agreement among Rater (similar to Accuracy)\nPe = Hypothetical Probability of Chance Agreement\nThe Kappa statistic evaluates the model by analyzing its accuracy, while taking possibility\nof correct prediction by chance into account. It will help explaining, how the model\nperforms better than the probability of chance. Evaluating the Kappa value is arbitrary,\nand largely dependent upon the analysis being conducted. The Kappa Statistic Table 3\ndisplays the common bases of evaluating Kappa values.\nFigure 3: Kappa Statistic\nKappa Statistic Strength of Agreement\nLess than 0.20 Poor Agreement\n0.20 - 0.40 Fair Agreement\n0.40 - 0.60 Moderate Agreement\n0.60 - 0.80 Good Agreement\n0.80 - 1.00 Very Good Agreement\nSensitivity =TruePositive\nTruePositive +FalseNegative\nSpecificity =TrueNegative\nFalsePositive +TrueNegative\nSensitivity calculation indicate if the model is able to better predict the correct reaction\nfrom the actual correct reaction. Speci\fcity calculation indicate if the model is able\nto better predict the incorrect reaction from the actual incorrect reaction. These two\nvariables are needed to judge if the current model is suitable for use by news organizations\nand marketing teams.\n11\n5.1 Research Question 1: Can news articles predict which (Love,\nHaha, Wow, Sad, Angry) reaction gets the highest count\nfrom Facebook??\nFigure 4: Average Accuracy\n Figure 5: Average Kappa\nThe average accuracy displayed on Fig. 4 indicates that the model gives a good predic-\ntion. The average kappa values in Fig. 5, on the bases on Table 3, demonstrate fair to\nmoderate agreement.\nFigure 6: Average Sensitivity\n Figure 7: Average Speci\fcity\nThe sensitivity in Fig.6 and speci\fcity in Fig.7 show moderate to good level.\nAs the data analyzed is based on the social media, attaining accuracy above 0.90\nis hard. However, it is possible to improve this model accuracy by incorporating other\ntext analysis systems, in addition to LIWC. The increase in accuracy will subsequently\nimprove the Kappa value. The additional parameters will also improve the sensitivity\nand speci\fcity.\nBased on the accuracy, kappa, speci\fcity and sensitivity, it is possible to use the SVM\nto predict which reaction will get the highest count on Facebook, based on the analysis\nof news article.\n12\n5.2 Research Question 2: Can news articles predict which groups\nof (Love And Haha, Wow and Haha, Sad and Wow, etc) re-\nactions gets the highest count from Facebook??\nFigure 8: Average Accuracy\nThe accuracy shown in Fig.8 demonstrates that all 10 groups of reactions have moderate\nto good level of prediction. Compared to Fig.4, the overall accuracy is lower in group re-\nactions than individual reactions. However, the variation between each group of reaction\nis higher than between reaction.\nFigure 9: Average Kappa\nThe Kappa values in Fig.9 have varying numbers of Kappa statistics, ranging from\nlow fair agreement to moderate agreement.\n13\nFigure 10: Average Sensitivity\nFigure 11: Average Speci\fcity\nThe sensitivity in Fig.10 and speci\fcity in Fig.11 show moderate to good level.\nBased on the variables shown, it is possible to use the SVM to predict which groups\nof reactions will get the highest count on Facebook, based on the analysis of news article.\nHowever, in comparison with the \frst case study, it performs a little worse.\n14\n5.3 Research Question 3: Does the \frst research question di\u000ber\nfor articles posted by di\u000berent news organizations?\nFigure 12: Average Accuracy\nThe accuracy shown in Fig.12 demonstrates that 10 groups of news organizations have\ngood level of prediction, between 70% to 74%. Yahoo, however, has a low accuracy com-\npared to others. Compared to Fig.4 and Fig.8, the overall accuracy is higher, excluding\nYahoo.\nFigure 13: Average Kappa\nThe Kappa values in Fig.13 have varying numbers of Kappa statistics, ranging within\nlow fair agreement. Yahoo Kappa has a poor agreement.\n15\nFigure 14: Average Sensitivity\nThe Sensitivity in Fig.14 high-moderate and low-good level, while Yahoo has a low\nsensitivity of 0.55.\nFigure 15: Average Speci\fcity\nThe speci\fcity in Fig.15 has good level, while Yahoo has low speci\fcity of 0.57.\n16\nFigure 16: Standard Deviation\nThe standard deviation is prominent in the third research question. The cause for\nthis is that all reactions data has been averaged, after being grouped by news organiza-\ntions. The \frst two research question show large variations between reaction(s) in terms\nkappa, sensitivity and speci\fcity. Thus concluding that for better analysis, each news\norganization reactions should be analyzed individually to get a better evaluation.\nBased on the variables shown, there is no de\fnitive conclusion. It needs further\nevaluation by analyzing articles of each individual news organization.\n17\n5.4 Discussion\nBased on the analysis of this dissertation, it is possible to identify which reaction(s) will\nget the highest count by the text analysis of news articles. The \frst research question\nis comparable with the study conducted by Guzman et al. (2016). They reported the\nhighest accuracy of 0.7254, for love reaction. They provided a colored confusion mat-\nrix graph, which demonstrates love, haha and sad achieving moderate to high accuracy,\nbut angry and wow achieving very low accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved in \frst\nresearch question is 0.76, for sad reaction, and demonstrated high accuracy across all 5\nreactions. In addition, the current model includes a larger dataset of 16 months data,\nwhile Guzman et al. (2016) used 4 months of data. The \frst research question concludes\nthat the current model performs better in terms of accuracy than used by Guzman et al.\n(2016). However, Guzman et al. (2016) did not report any other variables regarding their\nmodel, like kappa, sensitivity and speci\fcity.\nThe second research question is inspired by the recommendation of Badache and\nBoughanem (2017). They recommended that, in addition to analyzing individual reac-\ntions, group of reactions should also be analyzed. The second research question also\nperformed as good as the \frst research question, but not as well. This is due to signi-\n\fcantly large variations in the kappa values(0.3) in Fig. 9 of second research question,\nwhen compared to \frst research question kappa values(0.14) in Fig. 5.\nThe third research question shows how the reactions perform on the basis of news\norganization. Other than Yahoo, all other news organizations perform well, as per the\nvariables. However, the standard deviation shows that some news organizations have\nlarge variations between some of the variables. For example, Fox and USA Today kappa\nvalue has a large standard deviation, around 0.13 and 0.11. The largest standard devi-\nation is the USA Today sensitivity, which is more than 0.14.\nWhen the dissertation was started, the news organizations were selected that had the\nlargest number of followers on Facebook12, as of August 2017. By checking the political\nleaning of the news organizations covered, through All Sides13, Media Bias Fact Check14\nand Pew Research Centre15websites, the large standard deviation of Fox and USA Today\nbecome clearer. All news organizations covered are either left or left center wing of polit-\nical spectrum. Fox is the only right wing news, and USA Today is the only center wing\nnews. The large kappa standard deviation of Fox and USA Today is because the model\nis trained primarily by the left wing news articles bias. Fig 17 shows that articles with\nhighest sad counts is similar to left wing news bias regarding sad reaction. In Fox case,\nthe other reactions have very little in common with left wing bias reactions. In USA\nToday case, this is only true for love reaction. It could also explain why there is a large\nstandard deviation in sensitivity of USA Today, as displayed in Fig 18.\n12http://fanpagelist.com/category/news/world/\n13https://www.allsides.com\n14https://mediabiasfactcheck.com\n15http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/\n18\nFigure 17: Average Kappa of Fox and\nUSA Today\nFigure 18: Sensitivity of USA Today\nThe third research question also indicates that the Yahoo is the outlier of all the news\norganizations used for the dissertation. In addition to USA Today and Fox data, it would\nexplain why there is large variation in kappa, sensitivity and speci\fcity in the \frst two\nresearch questions. Removing these three news organizations data from the entire dataset\ncan improve the performance of the model.\nExcluding the Yahoo news, the sensitivity and speci\fcity readings in research ques-\ntions indicate the current model has moderate credibility, ranging from 0.62 to 0.80 of\nboth sensitivity and speci\fcity. However, the Kappa values indicates fair to moderate\nagreement. This indicate that the model can be used by news organizations to see how\nthe users would react, but only in supporting role. If the kappa values had been higher\nthan 0.70, then the model can be used as primary source for predicting the reactions. The\nmarketing team can utilize the model to create targeted ads that would take advantage\nof the user reactions. However, since the model does not have excellent credibility, it\nwould be a risk to use the model for controversial new articles. This is especially true\nfor marketing team, as the ads they post with the news article can receive backlash.\nExamples of this include how Cheerios tried to honour Prince death with a tribute that\nwas of poor taste and it back\fred, harming the company pro\fle16.\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\nSocial Media has increased in size and prominence greatly in last couple of years. More\npeople are joining social media to connect with one another. Dwindling News Organiza-\ntions and Advertisement are embracing social media to reach wider audience than they\ndid through traditional methods. Understanding how their audience, and their compet-\nitor audience, would react towards news articles is important. This dissertation is the\ninitial step towards understanding audience reactions in Facebook.\n16https://www.netbase.com/blog/dos-donts-celebrity-deaths-trendjacking/\n19\nBased on the conclusion of the research questions, it is possible to predict which re-\naction will get the highest count, by analyzing the text of news article published online.\nHowever, there are many ways this can be further improved. Using a di\u000berent classi\fer\nthan SVM can improve performance. Using Deep learning methods, like deep neural\nnetworks, would perform better than SVM. It is also possible to test a scenario, in second\nresearch question, where larger groups of reactions can be predicted. Ranking within\nthe group reaction can also give a better understanding of the reactions. For example,\nangry and sad are grouped, but the angry count is greater than sad, and sad is greater\nthan the other reactions. Using a di\u000berent text analysis software, like Open Information\nExtraction, might give a di\u000berent insight into predicting reactions, and improve overall\nperformance of the model. It is possible to study the di\u000berences of audience reactions to\nnews organizations with a di\u000berent political leaning.\nOverall, there are many di\u000berent branches of Data Analysis that can expand the\ncurrent research.\nReferences\nAvery, J.

While social media can amplify this emotional divide \u2014called affective polarization by political\nscientists \u2014there is a lack of agreement on its strength and prevalence. We measure affective\npolarization on social media by quantifying the emotions and toxicity of reply interactions. Wedemonstrate that, as predicted by affective polarization, interactions between users with sameideology (in-group replies) tend to be positive, while interactions between opposite-ideology users(out-group replies) are characterized by negativity and toxicity. Second, we show that affectivepolarization generalizes beyond the in-group/out-group dichotomy and can be considered a structuralproperty of social networks. Speci \ufb01cally, we show that emotions vary with network distance between\nusers, with closer interactions eliciting positive emotions and more distant interactions leading toanger, disgust, and toxicity. Finally, we show that similar information exhibits different dynamics whenspreading in emotionally polarized groups. These \ufb01ndings are consistent across diverse datasets\nspanning discussions on topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic and abortion in the US. Our researchprovides insights into the complex social dynamics of affective polarization in the digital age and its\nimplications for political discourse.\nDemocrats and Republicans in the United States not only disagree on many\neconomic, political and cultural issu es but have also grown less tolerant of\nopposing viewpoints, with members of each party disliking and distrustingthose af \ufb01liated with the opposing party. The emotional divide \u2014dubbed\naffective polarization by political scientists\n1,2\u2014has become a destabilizing\nforce in a democracy, reducing cooperation across party lines, stokinghostility towards out-group members\n3\u20136and eroding trust in experts and\ninstitutions. For example, the pola rized response to the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic led individuals af \ufb01liated with one political party to distrust recom-\nmendations from public health exp erts if they were supported by the\nopposing party, hindering effect ive response to the health crisis7\u20139.\nResearch shows that affective polariz a t i o ni sd r i v e nb yf a c t o r si n c l u d i n g\nthe news media, political elites, and demographics2,4,10.A l t h o u g hs c h o l a r s\ndisagree on how much social media contributes to partisan animosity11,m a n y\ns e ei ta sa ni m p o r t a n ta m p l i \ufb01er12. Social media discourse tends to promote\nin\ufb02ammatory language and moral outrage directed at the out-group13\u201315.\nMoreover, social media echo chambers, which segregate users within com-\nmunities of like-minded others, may amplify political polarization byexposing users to extreme and divisive content\n16. Beyond echo-chambers,\nexposure to out-party views exists17and may worsen political polarization18.\nThis paper describes an empirical study that makes a three-fold con-\ntribution to this body of research: we propose an instrument to quantifyaffective polarization in social media, establish an empirical relationship\nbetween emotions and structure of online networks, and characterize par-tisan differences in the dynamics of information spread on them. In contrastto existing research, which measures affective polarization by looking at howpeople talk about out-group members\n15,19\u201321, we focus on how they talk to\nthem. We leverage state-of-the-art l anguage models to measure emotions\nand toxicity of online interactions between social media users anddemonstrate they exhibit the hallmarks of affective polarization\n1,n a m e l y in-\ngroup favoritism \u2013out-group animosity . Moreover, these emotions vary with\ndistance between interacting users in a social network, demonstrating anassociation between affective polariz ation and the structure of online net-\nworks. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 1: when replying to people closer to\nthem in a network (e.g., a retweet network), users express more positiveemotions, but when replying to those who are farther away, they expressmore negative emotions and toxicity. These \ufb01ndings are consistent across\ndatasets of discussions abo ut the COVID-19 pandemic\n22and abortion23on\nTwitter. Finally, we analyze the sprea d of information and show that dis-\ncussions of contentious issues within partisan groups exhibit different\ndynamics. Some issues show random bu rsts of re-sharing, consistent with\nbeing driven by the news cycle, while others persist over longer periods of\ntime, re \ufb02ecting how their emotional salience to ideological divisions helps\nfocus attention of polarized groups.\n1USC Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA, USA.2USC, Computer Science Dept, Los Angeles, CA, USA. e-mail: lerman@isi.edu\nnpj Complexity |             (2024) 1:8 11234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\nOur study sheds light on the complex dynamics of affective polariza-\ntion in the digital age, offering insigh ts into the emotional foundations of\npolitical discourse on social media and the interaction of emotions withnetwork structure and information diffusion.\nResults\nWe study two massive datasets of onli ne discussions on Twitter: tweets\nabout the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and tweets about the over-\nturning of the Roe v Wade d e c i s i o nt h a tl e g a l i z e da b o r t i o ni nU Si n1 9 7 3 .\nWe classify users \u2019ideology as liberal or conservative based on the text of\ntheir tweets, and use transformer-based language models to detectemotions and toxic language in their replies (see Methods). Finally, weidentify contentious issues in online discussions and study dynamics ofre-sharing by each ideological group. Table 1summarizes statistics of\nthe two datasets.\nEmotions of In-group vs Out-group Interactions\nWe measure affective polarization by quantifying emotions expressedin reply interactions between users with a known ideology. In-group\ninteractions are replies between same-ideology users: liberal replying to\nal i b e r a l ,e t c . Out-group interactions are replies between opposite-\nideology users: liberal replying to a conservative or vice versa. Figure 2\nshows the distribution of emotion con \ufb01dence scores of replies in the\nabortion dataset. Anger, disgust and toxicity scores of out-group replies\nare substantially higher than for i n-group replies, consistent with out-\ngroup animosity . Similarly, in-group replies have higher scores for joy,\nconsistent with in-group favoritism . We observe similar trends in the\nCOVID-19 data (Supplementary Fig. 1) . All differences are statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant. The differences between in -group and out-group interac-\ntions remain after disaggregating replies by ideology across bothdatasets (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3).\nOur empirical analysis yields additional insights. We did not \ufb01nd\nsigni\ufb01cant differences in love, sadness or optimism. Out-group interactions\nare more emotional but shorter. Additionally, fear does not behave like othernegative emotions in that it is higher for in-group interactions. This mayre\ufb02ect the role of fear as an agent of social cohesion. By identifying acommon threat (see folktales and legends\n24,25), fear creates solidarity, which\nunites the group.\nFigure 3summarizes these results for b oth datasets by showing the\ndifference between th e mean emotion con \ufb01dence of out-group and in-group\nreplies. There exists a consistent emotion gap: interactions across ideological\nlines exhibit more negativity and toxicity, and less joy. Surprisingly, out-group replies are signi \ufb01cantly shorter: in the Roe_v_Wade data, out-group\nreplies are on average 17 characters sho rter, while in the COVID-19 data, they\nare 8 characters shorter. Together with the \ufb01nding that out-group interac-\ntions are more emotional, this suggests that people communicate across party\nlines not to convey information but rath er to express animo sity and to troll.\nEmotions and network distance\nNext, we explore the interplay between emotions and network structure,\nusing retweet networks to represent the online social networks (see Meth-\nods). Due to their large size, we use an embedding technique LargeVis26to\nvisualize the networks. Figure 4shows the heatmap of these embeddings,\nwith bright spots corresponding to dense clusters of users who frequentlyretweet one another.\nThe retweet network of the disc ussions in the Roe_v_Wade data\n(Fig. 4a) shows two main clusters with ad ditional substructure near the\nlarger cluster. The coarse-grained structure re \ufb02ects the polarized nature of\nthe abortion debate: most of the liberals are in the larger cluster and theconservatives are in the smaller one. The retweet network of the COVID-19discussions (Fig. 4b) contains many small clusters. Although these discus-\nsions did grow to be polarized, during the \ufb01rst months of the pandemic\ncovered by our dataset, these divisions do not appear entrenched.\nWe measure network distance between two users in the retweet net-\nwork embedding space (see Methods). Figure 5shows con \ufb01dence scores of\nemotions in reply interactions as a fu nction of network distance between\ninteracting users in the Roe_v_Wade d ata. We divide the distances into four\nequal-statistics bins, or quartiles. The \ufb01rst quartile (Q1) represents the 25%\nof the closest pairs of interacting users, while Q4 represents the 25% of themost distant pairs. There are systematic differences in emotions: when usersreply to those farther away in the retweet network, they tend to express moreanger and disgust, and use more toxic l anguage; while they tend to express\nmore joy and fear in replies to closer users and also use more words. All\ndifferences between the quartiles are statistically signi \ufb01cant.\nTo measure these trends, we perform linear regression on emotion\ncon\ufb01dence scores using network embedding distance as the independent\nvariable (see Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). Figure 6brings together all\nregression coef \ufb01cients across both datasets, showing similar trends across\ndatasets, in agreement with Fig. 3. Refer to Supplementary Table 1 and\nSupplementary Table l for detailed re gressions results. The relationship\nbetween emotional expression and network distance holds separately for in-group and out-group interactions and after disaggregating by ideology(Supplementary Figs. 7, 8). These results show that we can measure affectivepolarization even in the absence of partisan labels that de \ufb01ne the out-group.\nEmotions and networks interact so that users feel warmer towards those\nwho are closer to them and colder towards those who are farther away,regardless of group af \ufb01liation.\nFor robustness, we calculate the shortest path length between pairs of\nnodes in the retweet network as an alternate measure of network distance.We\ufb01nd that the trends do not depend on how we measure network dis-\ntance, with results largely remaining the same when using either metric(Supplementary Fig. 8), even after disaggregating by ideology (Supple-mentary Figs. 9 and 10).\nInformation spread in affectively polarized populations\nUsers interact across diverse network distances, seeing information shared\nby allies and foes alike. Their emotional reactions modulate attention to\ncontentious issues, affecting how thos e issues spread through the network.\nRoughly half of the tweets in the COVID-19 corpus discuss at least one\ncontentious issue, such as vaccines, education, masking, lockdowns, or\n@user11 @user1\nFig. 1 | Affective polarization in networks. People express warmer feelings when\nreplying to those closer to them in a social network; when replying to those farther\naway, they express more negativity.\nTable 1 | Number of retweets and replies from the datasets in\nour study\nDataset #Retweets #Retweeters #Replies #Responders\nRoe_v_Wade 7,131,980 1,005,156 460,868 172,988\nCOVID-19 46,419,871 10,758,690 4,173,679 833,875\nNumber of retweeters and the number of responders gives the total number of unique user ids that\nparticipated in a retweet and reply interaction respectively.https://doi.org/10.1038/s44260-024-00008-w Article\nnpj Complexity |             (2024) 1:8 2\no r i g i n so ft h ev i r u s( s e eM e t h o d s ) .A ttention to issues waxes and vanes as\nevents drive partisan interest and the diffusion of tweets. Figure 7(top row)\nplots the daily number of retweets of each issue by liberals and conservativesat different periods of the pandemic. Th e absolute number of retweets varies\ngreatly due to difference in the size of the partisan groups. To address the\nimbalance we standardize the number of retweets within each group usingz-score normalization.\nEach time series in Fig. 7represents the complex dynamics of infor-\nmation diffusion within a group. To characterize these dynamics, wecalculate the autocorrelation function (ACF), which measures the correla-\ntion of different points in the same time series, separated by time lags. Themiddle row of Fig. 7shows ACF along with con \ufb01dence intervals (blue lines).\nSome ACF plots show weekly patterns in t h ev o l u m eo fr e t w e e t sw i t hp e a k s\nat 7, 14, etc. days. However, others show a rapid or gradual decay of ACF tonon-signi \ufb01cant values. The former trend is consistent with short-lived\nspikes in retweets occurring at rand om times, while the latter trend is\nindicative of persistent attention. The bottom row of Fig. 7shows the time\nlags at which the ACF drops below the con \ufb01dence interval. The early\npandemic (post-President Trump \u2019s declaration of national emergency, left\ncolumn of Fig. 7) was characterized by school closures and challenges of\nonline learning, a topic favored by liberals. Ending lockdowns and\nreopening the economy became an important issue for conservatives, cul-minating in protests at state capitals in April 2020. Consistently, discussionsabout education were persistent among liberals, while discussions about\nlockdowns were more persistent among conservatives. The summer of 2020(right column of Fig. 7) saw mass protests for racial justice, sparked by the\nmurder of George Floyd, in which many liberals participated. Sincedemonstrations required violating so cial distancing measures enacted to\nlimit the spread of the virus (lockdowns issue), liberals promoted masking to\nstay safe, which made masking an impor tant issue among both liberals and\nconservatives.\nIn June 2022, the Supreme Court reversed federal guarantees on\nabortion access made by the 1973 Roe v Wa de decision.

After the overturning of Roe v Wade, dynamics of information\nspread among conservatives changed, with issues related to religion, fetalrights and exceptions to abortion b an reverberating among this group.Discussion\nWe investigated the emotional dimension of political polarization in online\nnetworks and the interplay between em otions, network structure, parti-\nsanship and dynamics of information sp read. Analyzing emotions expres-\nsed in online discussions about abortion and the COVID-19 pandemic, wefound that users expressed more emotions in their replies to opposite-ideology users and their valence had the hallmarks of affective polarization,Fig. 4 | Heatmap of the embeddings of social\nnetworks. Each network was constructed by linking\nusers who retweeted each other in online discussionsabout a) the 2022 overturning of Roe_v_Wade andb) the COVID-19 pandemic. The massive retweet\nnetworks were embedded in a lower-dimensional\nspace using a graph embedding method. The heat-map of the embedding shows bright spots of\ndensely-linked communities of users who frequently\nretweet one another. The retweet network of abor-tion discussions ashows two overaching polarized\ncommunities, while the network of the pandemic\ndiscussions bhas a multi-focal structure.\nFig. 5 | Affective polarization in the retweet network of Roe_v_Wade data. Each\nplot shows emotions in reply interactions as a function of network distance betweeninteracting users. Network distance is calculated in the network embedding space\nand then divided into quartiles, with Q1 showing the 25% of closest interactions and\nQ4 showing the 25% of the most distant interactions. Emotions aanger, bdisgust\nandctoxicity increase with distance between users in the network embedding space,\nwhile djoy and efear decrease with distance, as does freply length. The boxes spanthe\ufb01rst to third quartiles, with whiskers extending 1.5 times the interquartile range.\nThe horizontal line inside the box represents the median, and diamond symbol\nmarks the mean. Differences in means were tested for statistical signi \ufb01cance using a\ntwo-sided Mann-Whitney U Test with the Bonferroni correction: *indicates sig-\nni\ufb01cance at p< 0.05, **-p< 0.01, ***-p< 0.001, **** -p< 0.0001 and, ns - not-\nsigni\ufb01cant.https://doi.org/10.1038/s44260-024-00008-w Article\nnpj Complexity |             (2024) 1:8 4\nnamely \u201cin-group favoritism, out-group animosity \u201d1.I m p o r t a n t l y ,w e\nshowed that affective polarization generalizes beyond the in-group/out-group dichotomy. When accounting for network distance between inter-acting users in the retweet network, a proxy of the follower graph, anger,disgust and toxicity increased with distance, while joy largely decreased.\nThese \ufb01ndings generalized across datasets and measures of network dis-\ntance con \ufb01rming robustness of \ufb01ndings.\nOur\ufb01ndings shed more light on affective polarization. Only a subset of\nemotion and toxicity categories we me asured displayed group differences:\nanger, disgust, fear, joy, toxic language and obscenities. Our study alsorevealed that like joy, fear is usually higher within in-group replies. Thisstands in contrast to previous studies\n27, but highlights the complex role of\nfear in social interactions. Studies of f olklore and mythology suggest that fear\nhelps social cohesion: by making thre ats salient, fear increases in-group\nsolidarity24,26. In-group replies also tend to be longer, supporting the notion\nthat they serve to share information within the group on how to negotiate\nthreats.\nOne implication of this \ufb01nding is that information may spread dif-\nferently among interacting groups within the same population based on itsemotional salience to each group. We saw some evidence for this in howliberal and conservative users shared various issues during the COVID-19\npandemic. Conservatives paid more a ttention to lockdowns during the early\nphase of the COVID-19 pandemic, as demonstrated by the persistence ofretweets about lockdowns. During th is period of time conservatives pro-\ntested lockdowns, suggesting the em otional importance of this issue in\ndifferentiating them from liberals. At other times the lockdowns issue\nattracted short bursts of attention, triggered by events in the news. Similar\npatterns in our data point to the complex interplay between emotions,\npartisanship and dynamics of information spread within a polarizedpopulation.\nOur results also highlight important differences between reply and\nretweet interactions. While r esearchers sometimes con \ufb02ate them when\nbuilding social networks, our \ufb01ndings suggest that these interactions serve a\nvery different purpose and that combi ning them may obfuscate important\nfeatures of network structure.\nLike any study of social media, ours has limitations that tamper con-\nclusions. By necessity, our datasets represented a small sample of onlinediscussions, even when controlling fo r the topic. Replication of results in\nmore representative samples of onlin e discussions could help verify the\ngeneralizability of \ufb01ndings. Beyond biases introduced by keyword-centered\ntweet collection, not observing all int eractions may have limited the range of\nemotions we observed. Similarly, retw eets are a biased sample of the follower\nrelationships\n28, which may have impacted our conclusions. Errors in par-\ntisanship detection, emotion and toxicity classi \ufb01cation, may have furtheraffected our \ufb01ndings. While we cannot discount all of these biases, the\nconsistency of our results across datasets and scenarios gives us con \ufb01dence\nabout our conclusions.\nOur study does not disentangle the directionality of the relationship\nbetween network distance and emotive expression, limiting its theoretical\ncontributions. Despite this limitation, we believe that the descriptive analysis\nof the interplay between emotions and network structure is still valuable.\nAnother thing to consider is that our results could be explained by\nsome confounder, rather than group po larization or network structure. For\nexample, emotionally charged cont ent is retweeted more frequently13,\nadding emotional texture to retweet networks. Moreover, Twitter \u2019s perso-\nnalization algorithm may highlight emotionally charged content, therebydriving engagement\n14, while rapid information spread within communities29\nmay also distort emotions. Although we cannot discount all confounders,\nthe consistency of our \ufb01ndings across different datasets is encouraging.\nDespite potential limitations like incomplete observability and data\nbias, the consistency of results across datasets and methods provides con-\ufb01dence in the conclusions of our study about the interplay between emo-\ntions, network structure and the dynamics of information spread across andwithin groups. Understanding these m echanisms is crucial for addressing\nchallenges related to misinformation, polarization, and the health of public\ndiscourse in the digital age.\nMethods\nData\nWe used a public corpus of tweets about the COVID-19 pandemic22,\nfocusing on tweets posted between January 21, 2020 and April 22, 2020 in\nthe analysis of polarization. Our seco nd dataset is a public corpus of tweets\nabout abortion rights collected be tween January 1, 2022 to January 6, 202323.\nThe tweets contain keywords and hashtags that re \ufb02ect both sides of the\nabortion rights debate in US during the period that Roe v Wade wasoverturned.\nFor both datasets, Carmen\n30, a geo-location tool for Twitter data, was\nused to link tweets to locations within US. Carmen relies on metadata intweets, such as \u201cplace \u201dand\u201ccoordinates \u201dobjects that encode location, as\nwell as mentions of locations in a user \u2019s bio, to infer their location. We used\nthis approach to \ufb01lter out users whose home location is not one of US states.\nTo study dynamics of emotional polar ization and information spread,\nwe focus on interpersonal interactions in online social networks. On plat-forms like Twitter, these engagements predominantly manifest throughretweets and replies. Each retweet or reply post typically refers back to anoriginal tweet, hereinafter referred to as the parent tweet. Furthermore,every retweet or reply record includes the IDo fi t sa u t h o ra sw e l la st h e IDof\nthe author of the parent tweet. We analyze all retweets and replies whereboth the author and the referenced tweet \u2019s author are situated in the United\nStates and discard the rest. Table 1shows statistics of the resulting datasets.\nEmotions & toxicity detection\nEmotions represent feelings, which are often expressed through language.\nEarly attempts to automate emotion reco gnition from text relied on emotion\nlexicons \u2014curated collections of words categorized by their emotional\ncontent, e.g., LIWC31,E m o L e x32,a n dW K B33. The advent of transformers\nhas revolutionized emotion det ection, which could now bene \ufb01tf r o m\ncontextual cues.\nTo measure emotions we use an open-source library Demux34.T h i s\nmodel was shown to outperform com peting methods on the SemEval 2018\nTask 1 e-c benchmark35. Demux assigns none, one or more emotions to\ninput text, along with a scalar value representing its con \ufb01dence score. The\ncon\ufb01dence score is the likelihood the tweet expresses that emotion. Demux\ncan recognize a range of emotions in multi-lingual text, including anger,\ndisgust, fear, sadness, joy, love , trust, pessimism and optimism.\nTo measure toxicity, we use an open-source classi \ufb01er Detoxify ( https://\ngithub.com/unita ryai/detoxify ). The model is trained on the multilabel toxic\ncomment classi \ufb01cation task to recognize toxicity levels of tweets. The model\noutputs a score, a scalar value that captures the likelihood the tweet expressesFig. 6 | Regression coef \ufb01cients of affect as a function of network distance in the\nRoe_v_Wade and COVID-19 datasets. The bars represent the value of the\nregression coef \ufb01cient of the emotion or toxicity of replies as a function of normalized\ndistance between interacting users in the network embedding space. Distance was\nnormalized by rescaling distances in the embedding space to unit interval.

The column on lefthighlights dynamics post declaration of National Emergency and the column on\nright highlights dynamics after the July 4th holiday weekend.

In this study, we only\nuse toxicity scores.\nIdeology classi \ufb01cation\nTo estimate the ideology of social media users, studies have relied on fol-\nlower relationships36, mention and retweet interactions37,38,a n dU R L\nsharing16,39\u201341. Here we use a method described in41to classify individual\nTwitter users as liberal orconservative based on the text of the messages they\nshare. The classi \ufb01er leverages political bias scores assigned to well over 6K\nonline sources by Media Bias-Fact Check (MBFC)42. Based on these scores,\ntraining data is created by assigning each user a score that is a weightedaverage of the political bias scores of the URLs they share. After training atext embedding-based model on this data, the classi \ufb01er achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance on recognizing user ideology.\nIssue detection\nContentious issues that emerged during the pandemic include (1) the origins\nof the virus , involving debates over bats, wet-markets, lab leak and the gain of\nfunction research; (2) the implementation of lockdown measures via quar-\nantines, business closures, social dis tancing and bans on mass congregation;\n(3)masking mandates and face mask shortages; (4) the impact of the\npandemic on education with school closures and shift to online learning;\nand (5) vaccine -related discussions43\u201347.\nThe issues central to the abortion debate in the US48,49include (1)\nreligion and faith-based arguments against abortion; (2) views promoting\nprimacy of fetal rights ; (3) framing abortion as a bodily autonomy issue and\nfreedom to choose; (4) abortion as a women \u2019shealth issue; and (5) the\nquestion of exceptions to abortion restrictions, for example, to save a\nwoman \u2019s life or in the case of rape or incest.\nWe leverage a method developed and validated in previous works to\ndetect these issues. The method harvests relevant keywords and phrasesfrom Wikipedia pages discussing speci \ufb01c issues, labels a subset of tweets\nusing these terms and trains a transformer-based model on this data. Thetrained models were shown to achiev e state-of-the-art performance\nrecognizing pandemic and abortion-related issues in these datasets\n50,51.A\ntweet could discuss multiple issues or no issue at all.\nNetwork construction\nStudies of online social networks differ in how they represent edges betweenusers. Some researchers\n16,52use follower relations to capture the attention\nusers pay to others. However, collecting follower links is highly impracticaldue to API limitations. Instead, rese archers rely on retweets, which can bemore easily extracted from the tweet s metadata, to construct the social\ngraph\n28. Retweet networks are foundational to social media analysis and\nhave been used in studies of information spread53, virality prediction29,f a k e\nnews54, online echo chambers16,55, political polarization37,56, and online\ndiscussions57,58. Following this practice, we co nstruct a retweet-based social\nnetwork for each dataset. Retweets are evidence that both the author of the\noriginal tweet and the author of the retweet were, at least on one occasion,exposed to the same information. Ther efore, we model retweet networks as\nundirected, unweighted graphs whose nodes represent users and edgesrepresent the existence of at least one retweet between them (in eitherdirection).\nW em e a s u r ed i s t a n c ei nn e t w o r k si nt w ow a y s .T h e \ufb01rst one uses the\nshortest path between two nodes in th e retweet network.

Andra Johnson, dean for UF/IFAS Extension.Have you ever come to an election and wished you knew \nmore about the issues on the ballot? Have you ever wanted \nto know more about what is happening in your city, state, or \nthe world? What about understanding your options, risks, \nand benefits regarding a medical issue? Becoming informed \nabout an issue does not happen overnight. Rather, as with \nthe unattributed adage, the best time to have planted a tree \nwas ten years ago, but the next best time is today. A tree \ndoesn\u2019t grow to its full potential for years, and you, too, can \ngrow your knowledge a little bit at a time. This publication, \nfor all readers but also for educators who want to build a \ncurriculum to help learners, shares strategies for identifying \nsources, building habits, and becoming more confident in \nyour knowledge on various current topics.\nWhy be informed?\nHaving the most up-to-date information available helps \nto refine your knowledge and think critically about what \nthe best choice for your family, community, and/or self \ncould be when you are faced with a decision. Information \n(i.e., facts about the world) and knowledge (i.e., what \nindividuals understand about those facts) are constantly \nchanging. In the case of scientific information, scientists \nconduct research to answer emerging questions about how \nthe world works, such as understanding the effects of fossil \nfuel use on climate, or specifically on how climate change \naffects Florida and its residents (Papacek et al., 2020).  Political information tracks governments making changes \nto their communities, including how to fund services such \nas schools and fire departments.\nAdults in the U.S. are interested in news; in late 2021, 75% \nof survey respondents said they were very or somewhat \ninterested in news about science, including health and \nmedicine, while 85% were interested in news about their \nlocal community (Saks & Tyson, 2022). In addition, U.S. \nadults agree that voters should be knowledgeable about \nissues and follow what goes on in government and politics \n(Oliphant, 2018).\nIt is important to be aware of differences in interest levels \nin particular topics as well as disparities in access to news \non said topics. Only about 40% of people of color, namely \nBlack, Hispanic, and Asian Americans, thought the U.S. \nnews frequently enough covered the topics which are \nmost important to them, such as healthcare, crime, and \nthe economy, versus 54% of White Americans (Tomasik \n& Forman-Katz, n.d.). Across the U.S., access to news, \nparticularly local news, continues to change dramatically \n(Abernathy, 2020; Abernathy & Stonbely, 2023). U.S. \nadults have a range of interests and concerns, but trying to \nincrease news consumption on all topics at once may be \nunsustainable.\n2\n Creating and Maintaining Balance in News ConsumptionIdentify your topic interest and \nyour goals\nThere is large agreement that knowledge is important \nin a democratic system and in making personal life and \ncommunity decisions, and knowledge begins with gather -\ning information. Now let\u2019s turn to how to accomplish \ninformation gathering. First, recognize that you cannot \nimmediately learn about everything. Select a few areas or \neven a single topic area to start with. What is it that you \nwant to know more about and why? Do you want to be an \ninformed voter in an upcoming election or address a health \nissue? Use this goal to drive the sources and frequency with \nwhich you consume news.\nIdentify sources and formats\nHow do you like to get information? Far from the histori -\ncal limitations of word of mouth and traditional printed \nnews, today the news ecosystem  encompasses a variety of \norganizations, technological formats, and content which \ninteract in the process of news production (Wiard, 2019). \nSources of information are those organizations and indi -\nviduals who produce content. Sources can be legacy news \noutlets, such as The Associated Press, Fox, and The New \nYork Times. Sources include emerging media companies, \nsuch as organizations which may produce both audio- and \nvideo-based content, perhaps in combination with legacy \nmedia outlets; an example here is iHeartMedia (formerly \nClear Channel Communications), which owns radio \nstations but also produces a number of podcasts distributed \nonline. Finally, several smaller production outfits, ranging \nfrom individuals with a single show to groups who support \na number of shows, exist that can offer different perspec -\ntives, levels of factuality, and bias (see the section on media \nliteracy below).\nSources today offer a variety of formats, so you are not \nlimited to reading a physical newspaper or watching a live \ntelevision broadcast. Y ou can read traditional news articles \nonline. Maybe you would rather listen to a daily or weekly \npodcast, attend government or community meetings, or \nwatch videos shared on social media or livestreamed. These \ncan be valuable ways to gather information if the sources \nare reputable.\nStart small and grow over time\nOnce you have identified your topic, sources, and formats, \ndetermine a frequency and an amount of time you can \ndevote to news and work to make news check-ins part of \nyour routine. Think about what will make it most likely for you to take in some news. If you can get a daily 10-minute \nnews podcast, set up an app for an automatic download or \nbookmark the website. If you would rather watch a longer \nvideo once a week, schedule that time for lunch or another \nwindow in your week. Start with one source, and once that \nbecomes habit, consider adding other sources to round \nout your consumption, as described in the sections below, \nand break your \u201cfilter bubble\u201d (Bozdag & van den Hoven, \n2015), wherein you have a narrow rather than diverse set of \nperspectives on news in the sources you consult.\nDevelop media literacy\nMedia literacy  can be defined as \u201cthe ability to analyze [and] \naccess \u2026 media in a variety of forms and contexts and a \ndesire to act upon such abilities in a manner that benefits \na healthy and democratic citizenship\u201d (Strasburger et al., \n2009, p. 523). That is, it is not enough to take in informa -\ntion; one must know how to evaluate the legitimacy and \naccuracy and how to use the information for it to become \nactionable knowledge. Programs on television and radio, \nsimilar to newspaper sections, may have different purposes \nand therefore, different amounts of bias and opinion versus \nstraight reporting. Vetting your sources for credibility \nis a first step in understanding whether the content you \nconsume is likely to be accurate. The News Literacy Project \n(2022) suggests five steps to vet sources:\n1. Determine whether others have rated the organization \nas credible. See more below on fact checking and rating \nwebsites.\n2. Look at standards for publication, which should be easily \naccessible and clear.\n3. Check for transparency including ownership and who \nproduces content.\n4. Understand how the organization handles errors.\n5. Examine several of the pieces of content for yourself for \ninclusion of facts vs. opinions when appropriate and \nprofessionalism including lack of errors.\nThe News Literacy Project infographic on vetting  also \ndiscusses elements that can degrade trust.\nIt is important to understand that stations and news \noutlets also make decisions on what to cover as well as \nhow to cover it. Two-thirds of U.S. adults have experienced \ncoverage differences even within a single news source, \nat least about recent elections (Shearer, 2020); within a \n3\n Creating and Maintaining Balance in News Consumptionsingle media outlet, news content or programs designed \nto report information versus editorial programs which \noffer opinions may be rated differently in their political \nlearnings. A notable example is The Wall Street Journal; \nthe outlet\u2019s online political news is rated as centrist in U.S. \npolitical leanings by the rating site AllSides.com (see more \nabout this rating group in the following section), while its \nonline political opinion pages are rated as right-leaning. In \naddition, related media properties may also rate differently; \nthe rating site Ad Fontes Media (see more about this rating \ngroup in the following section) rates CNBC more centrist \nthan NBC News overall. These programs and sources \ncan also change over time with changes in leadership, as \nwhen CNN\u2019s then-new CEO Chris Licht was revamping \nthe network (Helmore, 2022), so regularly revisiting your \nsources may also help keep your news diet balanced.\nConsider following sources that are reputable with high \nfactuality ratings but perhaps different editorial content \nthan you typically choose. The following sites cover both \nnational news and major regional outlets and topics from \npolitics to healthcare. Some ways to assess factuality and \neditorial leaning are through:\n\u2022 Media Bias/Fact Check , a website founded in 2015 by an \nindividual but now run by a \u201ccollective of volunteers and \npaid contractors\u201d (Media Bias/Fact Check, 2023, para. 2) \nwhose credibility comes through extensive use over the \nyears rather than the credentials of their founder (Media \nBias/Fact Check, 2023). The site offers ratings of news \noutlets as a whole on both editorial leaning (right, center, \nleft) and factuality (Whitney, 2022). Y ou can also find \ndaily fact checks of claims made in news, a weekly media \nliteracy quiz on current events, and a browser extension. \nY ou can read about their methodology  for rating outlets \nas well.\n\u2022 NewsGuard , a browser extension free for users at schools \nand libraries, or available to individuals for a monthly \nfee in some browsers (Whitney, 2022). The extension \ndisplays NewsGuard\u2019s rating of websites on nine criteria \nincluding publication of false content, correction policies, \nand maintaining responsible distinctions between news \nand opinion (NewsGuard, n.d.). Ratings come from \njournalists. The extension also notes satirical websites \nsuch as TheOnion.Com, and NewsGuard publishes a free \nmonthly newsletter called the Misinformation Monitor. \nThe site is funded partially by Microsoft.\n\u2022 AllSides.com , a website founded in 2012, which presents \nside-by-side headlines from the center, left, and right \non U.S. political topics. AllSides.com offers a Red Blue \nTranslator  to show differences among political affiliations on especially contentious topics. An app is available \nalong with third-party browser extensions. AllSides.com \nhas a hybrid funding model of both media business and \nnonprofit, donor-based funding (AllSides, 2018).\n\u2022 Ad Fontes Media.com , a \u201cpublic benefit corporation\u201d \n(Ad Fontes Media, n.d., p. footer) founded in 2018 that \nprovides an interactive chart  to check fact-based report -\ning and bias of sources. Users can submit articles to be \nfact-checked as well. The information is available as a \nsmartphone app.\n\u2022 Ground News , which offers reports on the number of \nsources reporting (left, center, and right), the overall \nfactuality of stories, and the ownership of sources, such \nas from private equity, media conglomerate, or \u201cindepen -\ndent\u201d media, as explained in their methodology . The site\u2019s \nBlindspot report can offer you a personalized newsletter \nof stories you may have missed if you primarily consume \nnews from particular outlets. Ground News reports bias \nand factuality based on a combination of information \nfrom Media Bias/Fact Check, Ad Fontes, and AllSides.\ncom.\nTo check individual stories or claims that you see, consider \nthese resources in addition to the bias and factuality \nreporting of the sites overall:\n\u2022 FactCheck.org , from the University of Pennsylvania \nAnnenberg Public Policy Center, \u201cmonitor[s] the factual \naccuracy of what is said by major U.S. political players\u201d \n(FactCheck.org, n.d., para. 1) in media, including \nadvertisements. A subset of claims on science is found \non SciCheck.  Users can submit questions as well via the \nwebsite.\n\u2022 PolitiFact.com  was founded in 2007 by journalists at \nthe Tampa Bay Times,  and is now owned by the Poynter \nInstitute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Florida. It \nchecks politicians\u2019 and candidates\u2019 press releases, as well \nas a variety of social media posts and media personalities \nwho cover politics. Searchable by person as well as by \nissue, the site also has several state editions, including \nfor the most populated U.S. states of California, Florida, \nTexas, and New Y ork.\n\u2022 Snopes.com  was founded in 1994 to investigate \u201curban \nlegends, hoaxes, and folklore\u201d (Snopes.com, n.d., para. 2). \nToday, Snopes also covers U.S. politics and news as well \nas sports and pop culture. Snopes has a more extensive \nrating of information truthfulness, including Research \nin Progress, Unproven, Outdated, Miscaptioned, and \nUnfounded.\n4\n Creating and Maintaining Balance in News Consumption\u2022 TrustServista browser extension uses artificial intelligence \nand analytics, rather than humans, to provide feedback \non context (i.e., facts, sentiment, and source trustworthi -\nness) (Whitney, 2022).\nConsider the people behind the \nstory\nThe role of the content producer comes more starkly into \nfocus when stories cover people from marginalized com -\nmunities, such as individuals with diverse racial and ethnic \nbackgrounds, individuals with diverse gender identities, \nor people with disabilities. Some evidence suggests people \nfrom marginalized communities feel journalists do not \nadequately cover issues that are relevant to those communi -\nties (Pew Research Center, 2023). Criticisms include overly \nnegative coverage, lack of variety of experiences depicted, \nand frequent failure to tell the full story. Considering the \nbackground of the staff, from writers and editors to produc -\ners and photographers or camerapeople, can help you \nunderstand whether coverage may be representative of the \ncommunity or off base.\nShare the habit and the news with \nfriends\nTalking about habits you are trying to form or maintain, \nsuch as consuming news media, not only encourages you \nto continue, but it can help deepen your own knowledge \nwhile simultaneously sharing information with others. \nDiscussion can also alert you to new sources, blind spots, \nother perspectives, and new areas of interest. Remember \nto hold both yourself and your friends accountable to \nproviding facts that can be backed up with evidence; do not \nallow people to share information from misleading sources \nor early on in a rapidly evolving situation without calling \nattention to potential problems and misinformation.\nBalance mental health needs and \nmedia use\nOverall, mental health professionals acknowledge the news \ncan be anxiety-inducing, especially when we can update \nourselves nonstop (Dodgen-Magee, 2021). Creating a \nscheduled time to check in on news can help keep us from \nbecoming overwhelmed. Consider turning off notifications \nin news apps, setting timers for reading news (especially \non social media), and instituting tech-free times, such as \ngoing outside for a walk or doing a puzzle or arts and crafts \nproject (Huff, 2022). If necessary, take a longer break (such \nas days or even weeks) if that fits with your goals of building \nyour knowledge over time. Especially after natural disasters, care with media consumption may be needed (Frohlich \net al., 2021). Combine news consumption with concrete \nactions to help alleviate stress of lack of control over outside \nforces which you cannot entirely or substantively influence \n(Huff, 2022).\nRegularly reassess\nAs your life changes and your information store grows and \nevolves, your need and available time and energy for fol -\nlowing news, especially particular topics, may change. On a \nregular basis, review whether the sources you consume still \nserve your goals. If needed, seek out new sources and stop \nfollowing some which no longer serve you. Set limits and \ntake breaks as needed, pausing your regular news check-ins, \nsuch as when going on vacation or when you might be in an \nalready heightened emotional state (Dodgen-Magee, 2021). \nAs you build your knowledge, you will begin to see that you \ncan more easily catch up after breaks and learn from other \nsources as many stories cross boundaries from personal, to \ncommunity, to political levels.\nConclusion\nBuilding your knowledge on issues important to you \nand your communities, whether those are geographic or \ncultural, can take time. However, with small, regular steps, \nyou can increase your understanding of issues and be better \nprepared to engage at many different levels of society to \nimprove your well-being.\nResources\nTheConversation.com : Nonprofit news organization featur -\ning web articles, videos, and podcasts written by academic \nexperts for public audiences.\nInstitute for Nonprofit News directory : Independent \nnews organizations that are nonpartisan and dedicated to \npublic service.

In contrast, this study incorporates passive consumption data to investigate the \nprevalence of active participation in online discourse. We introduce a metric to quantify the share of \nactive engagement and analyze over 17 million pieces of content link ed to a polarized Twitter debate \nto understand its relationship with several features of online environments, such as echo chambers, \ncoordinated behavior, political bias, and source reliability. Our findings reveal a significant proportion \nof users who consume content without active interactions, underscoring the importance of considering \nalso passive consumption proxies in the analysis of online debates. Furthermore, we found that \nincreased active participation is primarily correlated with the presence of multimedia content and \nunreliable news sources, rather than with the ideological stance of the content producer , suggesting \nthat active engagement is independent of echo chambers. Our work highlights the significance of \npassive consumption proxies for quantifying active engagement, which influences platform feed \nalgorithms and, consequently, the development of online discussions. Moreover, it highlights the \nfactors that may encourage active participation, which can be utilized to design more effective \ncommunication campaigns.\nThe advent of the digital age has opened up the possibility of fast and direct communication among members of \nour society. While these technological advancements have expanded public access to information, they may have \nalso fostered several pervasive issues, such as polarization, misinformation, and the emergence of phenomena \nsuch as filter bubbles and echo chambers, that could all influence public opinion and negatively impact society1\u20134. \nWhile some signs of this societal fragmentation could already be observed during the twentieth century2, the \nideological divide between opposite factions has been increasing in the recent past3,5,6.\nThis radicalization in opinions has been shown to be a clear obstacle to dialogue, consensus, and policymaking1,2. \nGiven the potential impact of such divides on our society, scholars have intensively studied this topic, considering \nvarious aspects and different definitions of polarization7. To reveal ideological divides in online environments, \nmany social media studies have relied on users\u2019 interactions, such as follower-following relationships, linking, \nor re-sharing3,5,8\u201310. In these studies, the concept of polarization mainly aligns with the notion of \u2018interactional\u2019 \nor \u2018structural\u2019 polarization11, which refers to the segregation of users into ideologically distinct groups based on \ntheir interactions12,13. Polarized debates are also a fertile environment for the spread of misinformation that may \nharm society at different levels14. Falsehoods and unsubstantiated claims have been shown to spread widely in \nsocial media15\u201317 and may erode trust in reliable sources18. Such spreading can be facilitated by the emergence \nof phenomena such as echo chambers10 and filter bubbles19. These two concepts, which share some common \nground, refer to the information environment that users experience online and how it could affect the diversity \n1Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics, Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice, Venice, \nItaly. 2Department of Network and Data Science, Central European University, Wien, Austria. 3Institute for \nCross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems, IFISC (UIB-CSIC), Palma, Spain. 4Institute of Media Studies, \nKU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. 5Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy. 6Department of Computer Science, \nUniversity of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. 7Department of Mathematics, City University of London, London, UK. 8Department \nof Mathematics, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. 9Northeastern University, London, UK. 10Istituto di scienza \ne tecnologia dell\u2019informazione \u201cA.

However, while the term \u2018filter bubbles\u2019 mainly refers to the reduction in the \nideological diversity of news a user is exposed to due to the personalization of recommendation algorithms21, \necho chambers also consider the interactions among users10. Inside echo chambers, users primarily interact \nwith others who share similar beliefs, which may reinforce their views and create segregated environments \nwhere alternative viewpoints and dissenting voices are frequently silenced or ignored22. For these reasons, echo \nchambers may also exacerbate polarization and favor the spread of misinformation23, as they trap individuals \nwithin their ideological bubbles and limit their exposure to diverse perspectives24.\nAlthough some literature questions the existence25 and effects\u2014especially in terms of exposure to diverse \nviews26\u2014of such structures27,28, the majority of research has found evidence of echo chambers, with only works \nbased on self-reported data finding no proof supporting this hypothesis29. Indeed, echo chambers have been \nidentified in various online domains, including blogs30, forums31, and prominent social networks like Facebook \nand Twitter10,32\u201334. Over the last decade, there has been a surge of academic research to understand the underlying \nmechanisms and real extent of echo chambers. Scholars have dedicated substantial efforts to characterize \nthem within online social networks10,24,34\u201337, and developed indices to gauge their presence and strength38\u201340. \nFurthermore, various models have been proposed to elucidate the mechanisms driving the emergence of echo \nchambers39,41,42. While these models consistently emphasize the role of homophily as the primary catalyst for \nthe echo chamber effect, a diverse range of contributing factors has also been proposed. Such factors include \nlimited attention spans24, selective exposure43, confirmation bias44, the silencing effect22, and the role of feed \nalgorithms10,45.\nIn addition to the interaction structure, other factors such as the platform\u2019s suggestion algorithms also \nplay a crucial role in shaping online debates. These algorithms can either boost or limit the visibility of certain \ncontent or narratives, thereby further influencing the spread of information and the diversity of opinions \nusers encounter46,47. Moreover, also bots and coordinated accounts, which are designed to inflate engagement \nto increase content visibility and promote specific narratives, can influence online discussion48. Some studies \nhighlighted that bot-driven coordination can distort political discourse by fostering echo chambers and \nspreading misinformation49, and despite efforts by platforms to curb these activities, coordinated accounts and \nbots may still hold a significant presence in online debates50,51.\nThe empirical works mentioned above are largely based on the traces of active actions left by users to interact \nwith the content they were shown. For instance, on Twitter(X), such active actions include liking a tweet, replying \nto it, or reposting it\u2014also known as retweeting. Y et, users may also consume content without performing any \nactive actions-a phenomenon known as lurking . Although precise measurements of lurkers\u2019 prominence are \nlimited, estimates suggest they constitute the majority of social network users, ranging from 75 to 90% of those \ninterested in debates52,53. Researchers have examined lurking behavior by inferring users\u2019 interests54, ranking \ntheir significance55, analyzing their behavior across contexts and platforms56, and proposing strategies to \nencourage participation57. However, the definition of lurkers varies by context and timeframe, as users may lurk \non some topics while actively engaging in others, or shift between passive and active participation over time.\nFurther, several definitions of active and passive user consumption have been proposed, and the impact \nof active participation on public opinion and debates has been extensively studied, with scholars identifying \nvarying degrees of active consumption depending on the perspective from which the issue is analyzed58. \nUnderstanding the relationship between audience activity and the information they are exposed to is crucial for \nvarious reasons, including quantifying media influence, comprehending the interaction dynamics between users \nand information sources, and developing more effective communication strategies59\u201362.\nNowadays, social media plays a central role in the current information ecosystem48, and researchers have \nanalyzed various online debates, showing that certain types of content and accounts-such as hyperactive users63, \nbots and coordinated behavior64, and public figures61-can attract more engagement, potentially playing a pivotal \nrole in shaping online discussion. However, many of these studies have focused on engagement dynamics by \nexamining only active actions such as shares, likes, and comments, without considering users who view the \ncontent without taking any action. As a result, it remains unclear which factors encourage active participation \namong users once they are exposed to content.\nIn our work, we adopt a complementary approach and include the presence of passive users to explore the \nfactors that may encourage active content consumption-specifically, those that increase the proportion of users \nwho take active actions when exposed to content. Additionally, we examine the relationship between active \nparticipation and various aspects of the debate, such as echo chambers, ideological bias, and source credibility. \nBy integrating both active actions and passive consumption metrics, our work analyzes audience activity in \nTwitter discussions, highlighting the factors that correlate with increased active participation.\nIn particular, by using the recently introduced metric called impressions count to quantify passive \nconsumption our work investigates whether the fraction of users who actively engage with content-meaning \nthey leave explicit feedback actions-depends on user and content characteristics such as the ideological \nleaning or popularity of the author, the presence of multimedia features, the political bias, or the reliability of \nthe mentioned source. Notably, an impression represents content appearing on a user\u2019s screen, reflecting the \nfrequency of visual engagement. While the impressions count can be used to estimate the proportion of users \nwho leave explicit feedback actions after seeing the content, it does not necessarily reflect the cognitive effort a \nuser spends in processing the presented content.\nWe introduce a metric based on impression count, called Active Engagement  (AE), which quantifies the \nfraction of active user engagement, and analyze 17M+ tweets about a controversial topic, whether to provide \nmilitary support to Ukraine in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. We use this metric to estimate the prevalence \nof active consumption, intended here as the presence of explicit feedback actions in the consumption process, \ngenerated by different types of content.\nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:4906 2 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88117-xwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nThe results indicate that heightened active participation is predominantly associated with the presence \nof unreliable and extremely biased news rather than with the popularity or ideological stance of the content \nproducer. This suggests that the level of active participation does not depend on the echo chamber where the \ncontent is generated. Conversely, our results imply that different communities experience similar levels of active \nconsumption.\nOur work reveals an absence of a relationship between active engagement in online debates and echo \nchambers, while highlighting the factors that drive users\u2019 active participation. Understanding these relationships \nis crucial for uncovering, on one hand, the interplay between active consumption and feed algorithms that \ndetermine content visibility and contribute to shaping online debates, and on the other hand, for designing \ncommunication strategies that are more effective in capturing users\u2019 active participation and, thereby, fostering \nmessage circulation.\nResults\nUsers\u2019 interaction structure\nThe ongoing debate on whether countries should provide military assistance to Ukraine during its conflict with \nRussia has generated significant attention from influential figures such as politicians, journalists, and committed \ncitizens. The emergence of echo chambers, environments in which users predominantly interact with like-\nminded peers and reinforce their beliefs, is a common phenomenon observed in such controversial debates \nwithin social networks5,33. Examining the presence of echo chambers around this polarizing topic is our first \nstep to analyze the dependence of active consumption on ideological stance. Hence, we estimated users\u2019 stances \nby Latent Ideology Estimation (see \u201c Methods \u201d section). After selecting a set of influential accounts representing \nthe two opposing factions, referred to as influencers, this procedure infers users\u2019 ideology scores based on the \ninfluencers they have retweeted. Users who have retweeted similar sets of influencers will share similar ideology \nvalues, while those who have retweeted disjoint sets will be placed farther apart.\nPanel a of Fig.\u00a0 1 shows the results of this analysis, with the distribution of both users\u2019 and influencers\u2019 ideology \nscores on the top and the retweeters distribution for the top 20 retweeted influencers on the bottom (see\u00a0 https://\nosf.io/5m3vr/  for the figure with all the influencers). We notice a clear division between users supporting military \naid to Ukraine and those opposing it, with the first group\u2019s scores tending towards \u2212 1, and the second\u2019s to close \nto + 1. This bimodal distribution of opinions depicts a polarized discussion where most users unambiguously \nbelong to one camp of the debate. On the left side, we find accounts that explicitly expressed support for Ukraine, \nsuch as \u201c@NATO\u201d , \u201c@SecBlinken\u201d , and the Ukrainian president \u201c@ZelenskyyUa\u201d , while on the right side, \naccounts are associated with the Russian government or have a clear pro-Russia stance. This result allows us to \ncategorize users into two groups based on their estimated ideology score: supporters of Ukraine (ideology score \n\u22640) or opponents (ideology score >0). To better visualize the presence of echo chambers, panel b of Fig.\u00a0 1 \nillustrates the retweet network for users and influencers with a degree higher than 100, color-coded according \nFig. 1 .

The division between supporters (orange) and opponents (black) of military aid is clear, \nhighlighting the high level of homophilic interaction and underscoring the prevalence of echo chambers (as \ndefined in Cinelli et al.10) in this debate (see also Fig. S2 in SM). Noticeably, the two groups differ in size, with \nsupporters being nearly 8 times more numerous than opponents.\nUnveiling the drivers of active engagement\nHaving identified the presence of two distinct echo chambers, we then focus on measuring the proportion of \nthe active audience in relation to both the popularity and ideological stance of the users who generated the \ncontent, as well as the various characteristics of the content itself. To gauge the proportion of active consumers, \nwe introduce the Active Engagement  metric. Active Engagement (AE) is calculated as the ratio between the count \nof one active action, such as the number of likes, retweets, quotes, or replies, and the number of times a piece \nof content has been viewed, quantified by the \u201cimpression count\u201d metric provided by Twitter (see \u201c Methods \u201d \nsection). Notably, impressions quantify appearances, not unique viewers, and hence can be used to estimate the \nshare of passive consumers of content, but not their exact number.\nUsers\u2019 popularity and ideological stance\nWe initially explore the correlation between active consumption and content producers\u2019 popularity by comparing \nthe number of followers of the producer with the average Active Engagement (AE) score of their tweets. As \nshown in Fig.\u00a0 2a, the majority of users encountering a tweet do not actively interact with it: the average Active \nEngagement for most users is at least an order of magnitude lower than 1 for all the actions. Further, the graph \nsuggests the dependence of the AE on the type of action, while producers\u2019 popularity seems to have a milder \nimportance. To better quantify the interplay between users\u2019 popularity and AE, we computed the average AE and \nPearson\u2019s correlation between content producers\u2019 followers and average Active Engagement for each action (see \nTable S1 in SM). Quotes exhibit the lowest level of average AE (0.06%), whereas replies and retweets showcase \nhigher and comparable values (0.24% and 0.29% respectively). Likes display the highest AE value (1.1%), \nsuggesting that actions requiring written feedback from users are generally associated with a lower level of active \nengagement. Notably, we observe a weak to moderate inverse correlation (minimum Pearson\u2019s r coefficient: \u2212 \n0.2250, maximum: \u2212 0.5690, see Table S1) between the number of followers a user has and her average AE. This \nsuggests that higher popularity does not promise a greater ability to attract active engagement; instead, very \npopular users seem to experience a slightly higher level of passive consumption.\nNext, we shift our focus to examining the relationship between users\u2019 ideological stance and active \nconsumption, exploring the connection between the level of Active Engagement and the echo chamber in which \nthe content is generated. Thus, we utilize the inferred ideology of individual users to compare users\u2019 average AE \nbetween the two opposing groups, i.e., Ukraine aid supporters and opponents. Figure\u00a0 2b shows the boxplots \ncorresponding to the distributions of AE for content generated by supporters and opponents for each action \ntype.\nAcross the four actions, there are minor differences in the AE distributions between the two communities. \nOpponents\u2019 retweets, replies, and quotes show a slightly higher median AE, and supporters exhibit wider \ndistributions with longer lower tails. The distributions of likes appear to be very similar, with supporters showing \na longer tail of potential outliers. Apart from these minor variations, we do not observe major differences, \nFig. 2 .

Specifically, we explore whether the political leaning or reliability of the \nsources linked in the tweets, along with the presence of multimedia features, correlates with active participation.\nIndeed, some studies have found that audiovisual content garners more attention compared to mere text65. \nHence, we investigate the AE distribution for tweets containing or not containing media (i.e., videos, photos, \nand GIFs) by relying on the tweet media_type  field available through the API66. Firstly, we observe that the \nmajority of tweets (63.85%) does not contain any media (see Table S2 in SM), and thus the tweets with attached \nmedia make up for 36.15% of the original dataset, with a strong prevalence of photos as attached media (30.96%). \nThis distribution highlights that the discussion of UA-aid on Twitter is mainly afforded by text-based content. \nHowever, as depicted in Fig.\u00a0 3a, we find that tweets with media exhibit increased AE compared to those without, \nalthough replies are an exception. Specifically, considering tweets incorporating a media, we observe distinct AE \ndistributions across different actions: likes feature a left-skewed distribution with a peak at higher AE values, \nwhile quotes exhibit a right-skewed distribution peaking at lower AE values. Replies and retweets, on the other \nhand, display a more symmetrical distribution. Again, this suggests a dependence of AE on the type of action \nbeing considered. Focusing solely on tweets containing visual content (i.e., a video, photo, or animated GIF), the \nresults in Fig.\u00a0 3b reveal a comparable distribution for photos and videos, with photos generating slightly more \nactive engagement in terms of likes. Notably, GIFs display slightly different patterns with a higher AE in the case \nof replies and a wider range of AE values in the case of quotes. While the inclusion of any multimedia content \nincreases AE, fewer distinctions are observed across the various types of visual content.\nNext, we examine the relationship between the political leaning and reliability of news sources and Active \nEngagement. Indeed, researchers found that politically loaded and controversial content attracts more attention67. \nHere, we study whether the presence of such content is also correlated with a higher share of active consumers. \nEmploying a source-based approach, we categorize the URLs contained in the tweets based on the domain \nclassification obtained from Media Bias Fact Check (MBFC)68 and retrieve labels both for political leaning and \nreporting reliability. Tweets linked to any news source listed on MBFC can be assigned a political leaning ranging \nfrom extreme left to extreme right, and a reliability label from very low to very high (see \u201c Methods \u201d section).\nFigure\u00a0 4a, shows the distribution of AE with respect to the political leaning of the sources in the tweets for the \nfour actions. We notice that highly biased categories, such as extreme right, right, and left, tend to have a higher \nmedian engagement and a wider distribution with respect to right center, center, and left center. The extreme \nleft seems to be an exceptional case with a very narrow distribution, but the volume of such tweets is quite low. \nY et, these results suggest that heavily biased news can attract more active engagement compared to moderate \nsources.\nBesides political leaning, we also examine the relationship between sources\u2019 reliability and AE. Given \nprevious findings of an imbalance between the consumption of reliable and questionable information14\u201317, and \nrecognizing the fact that various news sources may have significantly different outreach depending on their \npopularity, we also consider the number of unique shares as a proxy to estimate sources\u2019 audience size. Figure\u00a0 4b \ndisplays the Active Engagement (AE) plotted against the number of unique shares for news sources, color-coded \nbased on their reliability. Noticeably, AE is not heavily dependent on the popularity (i.e., the number of sharers) \nof the news sources linked in the tweet, a pattern consistent with our observations in the previous section\u2019s user-\nlevel analysis. Moreover, the order of magnitude of AE varies across different types of actions on tweets sharing \nFig. 3 . Active engagement level vs content type. ( a) Subplots show, for each action, the distribution of active \nengagement received by tweets having/ not having attached a media. ( b) Subplots display, for each action, the \ndistribution of active engagement received by tweets having attached different types of media, i.e., photo, video, \nGIF. \nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:4906 5 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88117-xwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ndomains: the majority of likes maintain a relatively higher AE level around 10\u22123\u201310\u22122, while the AE of retweets \nand replies concentrates in a lower range of 10\u22124\u201310\u22123, with the AE of quotes being the lowest around 10\u22124\n. Nevertheless, the impact of low and very low reliability news sources on AE emerges clearly. The two lowest \nreliability categories appear to be distributed at the top of all plots, implying that tweets linked to these types \nof sources can attract a higher level of active engagement than those linked to more reliable ones. Among all \nthe users and content characteristics investigated, the presence of low-credibility sources seems to be the most \ncharacterizing factor associated with increased levels of AE.\nSince previous literature3,5 found an overlap between users\u2019 ideology and news source usage, as a final analysis \nwe compare the political leaning of domains shared by users and their estimated ideology (see Fig. S1 of SM). \nResults highlight that support for the supply of weapons to Ukraine tends to drop for more extreme political \nleanings. However, there is still an important distinction between extreme left and extreme right, as the former \ndoes have a wider distribution, but the majority of its users are still in favor of military aid, while the latter \nopposes such aid in its majority.\nCoordinated activities\nWe conclude our analysis by examining how coordinated accounts relate to Active Engagement (AE). Since \nour data includes only aggregate statistics on view counts, it does not allow us to directly assess the impact of \ncoordinated or bot-like behavior on AE. However, we used retweet information to identify signs of coordination \nand studied how AE varies in relation to coordination. We classified accounts into two categories, \u2018Coordinated\u2019 \nand \u2018Non-Coordinated, \u2019 based on whether they retweeted the same content at least 10 times within a 10-s \nwindow. Of the 3,181,029 accounts in our dataset, 3.66% were involved in coordinated activities. Moreover, \namong influencer accounts, 6 out of 49 who opposed aid to Ukraine participated in coordinated activities, \nwhile 134 out of 355 influencers who supported Ukraine aid were involved. Additionally, 32.57% of the total \n12,475,527 retweets originated from accounts engaged in these coordinated efforts.\nFigure\u00a0 5 presents the distributions of AE for content generated by coordinated (red) and non-coordinated \n(green) accounts for each action type: retweet(I), reply(II), like(III), and quotes(IV).\nContent generated by coordinated accounts shows a higher peak and a narrower distribution compared to \nnon-coordinated content for retweet, reply, and quote actions. Non-coordinated accounts exhibit a broader \nrange of engagement, with the retweet and quote distributions slightly skewed toward higher AE values. The \nlike distributions are more similar, though coordinated accounts display a more pronounced peak. Notably, \ncoordinated accounts exhibit a small secondary peak at high AE values for retweets, which may suggest the \npresence of a highly coordinated group retweeting the same content.\nOverall, the differences in AE between content generated by coordinated and non-coordinated accounts are \nminor. Results show that while non-coordinated accounts tend to have a wider AE distribution and are slightly \nmore likely to attract active engagement, the similarity in the consumption dynamics between the two groups \nremains high, suggesting that content from coordinated accounts does not have an increased AE.\nFig. 4 .

Complementary to recent research that investigates content \nvisibility and user engagement by considering only active actions, our work, which also incorporates information \non passive consumption, focuses on estimating the prominence of active consumption, defined as the proportion \nof users who actively engage with a tweet through explicit feedback actions after being exposed to content. Given \nthe presence of algorithmic curation that often prioritizes highly engaging content, active consumption plays a \nsignificant role in shaping online debates. However, its prevalence is often challenging to quantify due to the lack \nof proxies for passive consumption, leading it to be overlooked in social media studies.\nBy comparing the number of active actions with the number of views for tweets related to the Russo-Ukrainian \nconflict, we analyze the dependency of active participation on several factors at both the user and content levels. \nOur findings reveal that active actions constitute a smaller portion compared to the number of views, indicating \nthat passive consumers account for a significant share of users who view the content. Moreover,actions that \nrequire writing efforts can experience a lower level of active participation than less demanding actions, such as \nliking. Notably, the most characteristic feature associated with an increased active consumption is the presence \nof far-right and misinformation-spreading news sources. These contents exhibited a higher ratio of actions per \nview (i.e. Active Engagement) compared to content from less biased and more reliable sources. Our results \ncomplement the existing literature suggesting that polarizing and highly biased political messages are associated \nwith increased engagement67 by showing that such content also increases the proportion of users who engage \nin active feedback actions. In contrast, the author\u2019s popularity, the presence of a coordinated community of \naccounts, as well as the ideological leaning of the content exhibited a milder effect on active participation. Our \nresults show that, although popular users reach a broader audience, they fail to elicit more active actions from \nusers who see their content, as active engagement has a slight tendency to decrease with users\u2019 popularity. \nSecondly, since the fraction of active consumers does not depend on the producers\u2019 opinions, the level of active \nconsumption is independent of the echo chamber effect. This suggests that both active and passive consumption \ndynamics are similar among communities and the level of active engagement inside different echo chambers \nis similar. Finally, we can speculate on the reasons for the higher active participation obtained by less reliable \nnews sources. The increased active engagement generated by news outlets spreading misinformation may be a \nconsequence of their publishing style. Unreliable sources may be more likely to use emotionally loaded words \nand pursue clickbait, which may, in turn, trigger more active actions.\nAlthough this study provides an initial understanding of the prevalence of passive consumption in online \ndebate, it also raises several unresolved questions that warrant further investigations. Exploring the prevalence \nof active consumption in other debates and social networks, such as Facebook or Reddit, is crucial to clarifying \nits interplay with different environments. Indeed, Twitter is often heavily polarized around topics related to \nelections69, healthcare70, or climate change3. Other platforms with lower levels of polarization, such as Reddit71, \nmay exhibit a different prevalence of active consumption. Understanding the relationship between active \nconsumption and polarization at the platform level is fundamental for assessing its impact on shaping online \ndebates. Further, the study of active consumption in other online environments can shed light on its interplay with \nseveral factors influencing online debates such as coordinated behavior and suggestion algorithms. Moreover, \nTwitter does not provide data about deleted content. Although the amount of deleted content is unlikely to \nheavily affect our results3,72, analyzing the level of active consumption of deleted content, which may contain \nhighly politicized and extreme messages73,74, could provide interesting insights for designing strategies to \nidentify potentially problematic content. Finally, views count does not provide any information at the individual \nuser level. Studying the characteristics of users who are exposed to content but do not actively interact with it can \nclarify the role of the interaction structure on information exposure, reveal how content spreads on the platform, \nand clarify the presence and influence of automated and coordinated accounts in boosting active engagement.\nBy recognizing the importance of passive consumption alongside more active forms, and examining the \nrelationship between levels of active engagement and factors such as echo chambers, misinformation sources, \npolitical bias, coordinated accounts, and other influences on online discussions, this study offers a more \ncomprehensive understanding of engagement dynamics in online social networks, providing a complementary \nFig. 5 . Distribution of Active Engagement (AE) for content created by coordinated (red) and non-coordinated \n(green) accounts across each action. While non-coordinated accounts tend to display a broader AE range, \ncoordinated accounts show a small secondary peak at high AE values for retweets. \nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:4906 7 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88117-xwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nperspective that is often overlooked in the literature. Unveiling the prevalence of active participation in online \ndebates is fundamental for assessing how it influences suggestion algorithms and, consequently, information \nspreading. Additionally, studying the content characteristics that can increase active engagement may aid in \ndesigning more effective communication strategies to actively involve a higher proportion of users, thereby \nenlarging the potential outreach of the message. Finally, our work emphasizes the need for comprehensive access \nto social network data, including a rich set of features and metrics for effective and thorough analysis of online \ndiscussions.\nMethods\nWe utilize two datasets\u2014Twitter data and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) domain labels\u2014for our case study of \nthe debate\u2014whether or not to provide military aid to Ukraine in the 2023 war.\nTwitter data\nWe collected tweets regarding Ukraine military aid through the standard Twitter API. We use a keyword-based \nsearch query that picks up tweets mentioning one of the following terms: \u201cmilitary aid\u201d , \u201cmilitary support\u201d , \n\u201ctanks\u201d , \u201cabrams\u201d , \u201cleopard\u201d , \u201cchallenger\u201d , \u201cjet\u201d , \u201caircraft\u201d , \u201cmunitions\u201d , \u201cHIMARS\u201d , \u201crockets\u201d and \u201cmissile\u201d . \nFocusing on a four-month period from November 22nd, 2022 to March 1st, 2023, we retrieved a dataset of 17 \nM+ tweets posted by 5.2 M+ users. Each of these tweets includes the impression count, a new Twitter feature \nrolled out in December 2022, which we use to measure the proportion of hidden audience across various means \nof interaction (i.e., retweet, reply, quote, like) provided by Twitter.\nMedia bias fact check dataset\nTo categorize tweets that share a link to news domains we rely on labels retrieved from Media Bias/Fact Check \n(MBFC)68, an independent fact-checking organization that classifies news outlets based on their reliability and \npolitical leaning. The MBFC label list we retrieved contains a total of 2190 news outlets, each of which has a \ndomain URL, a political leaning label among \u201cextreme left\u201d \u201cleft\u201d , \u201cleft center\u201d , \u201ccenter\u201d , \u201cright center\u201d , \u201cright\u201d , \n\u201cextreme right\u201d , and a reliability label among \u201cvery low\u201d \u201clow\u201d , \u201cmixed\u201d , \u201cmostly factual\u201d , \u201chigh\u201d , \u201cvery high\u201d . For \ndomains with missing labels of ideological leanings, we manually checked the domain page displayed on MBFC \nto ensure a comprehensive analysis. Using this dataset, we were able to classify 26.6% of all links. We analyzed the \nmost used domains and verified that the unclassified domains are not associated with political or news sources \n(see Figs. S6, S7 of SM).\nData filtering\nThe process of data filtering contains the following three steps. First, we filter out tweets that do not have a valid \nimpression count. Intuitively, the impression count should always be greater or equal to any of the active action \nmetrics (i.e., counts of likes, replies, quotes, or retweets). Second, we restrict our analysis to tweets in English to \navoid conflating factors (such as geography) that may affect the detection of users\u2019 ideological stances. Third, we \nonly include original tweets in our estimation of hidden audiences, as we do not have information on how the \nimpression count would be passed along downstream in retweets, replies, or quotes.\nInteraction network\nUsing the dataset described in Section Data Filtering, we build the retweet interaction network. This methodology \naligns with prevailing practices in Twitter analysis research3,5,75, as retweets are regarded as endorsements of \ncontent. On the other hand, quotes and replies are disregarded since they are less likely to signify endorsement \nand are often used for expressing opposing viewpoints or engaging in polemics5. Considering retweets of \nEnglish content, we build a network by assigning a node to each unique user in the dataset. The set of nodes of \nthe network includes every user who either authored an original English tweet or retweeted an English tweet \ncontaining the specified keywords. We create a directed edge from node A to node B if user A retweeted a post \nauthored by user B, and the weight of the edges is determined by the count of unique retweets between the two \nusers, reflecting the strength of their interaction. The final interaction network counts 2.5 million nodes and 7.1 \nmillion edges.\nLatent ideology estimation\nTo estimate the ideological stance of users in the debate, we start from the latent ideology algorithm proposed \nin Refs.8,76. Following the studies already conducted in this field3,5, we consider retweets instead of follower/\nfollowing relationships as interaction. The latent ideology algorithm requires the extraction of a subset of \nthe influencer which critically affects the ideology estimation results. The method by which such extraction \nis performed is the main topic of the following subsection. Once the influencer set is known, we apply the \nCorrespondence Analysis algorithm77, which follows three steps: (i) Construction of the interaction matrix A, \n(ii) normalization of the matrix, and (iii) singular value decomposition. For the first step, we construct a matrix \nA, whose elements Aij represent the number of retweets user i directs toward influencer j. Once A is known, we \nnormalize it as follows. First, we divide by the total number of retweets, obtaining:\n P=A\u2211\nijAij. (1)\nThen, we define the following quantities:\nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:4906 8 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88117-xwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n \uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3r=P1,\nc=1TP,\nDr=diag(r),\nDc=diag(c), (2)\nand we perform the following normalization operation:\n S=D\u22121/2\nr(P\u2212rc)D\u22121/2\nc. (3)\nFor the third step, we perform a singular value decomposition of the form S=U\u03a3VT, where U,\u00a0V are \northogonal matrices and \u03a3 is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of S. We estimate the ideological \nleaning of users by taking the subspace associated with the first singular value of the decomposition. Thus, we \ntake the latent ideology the latent ideology of user i to be the i-th entry of the first column of the orthogonal \nmatrix U, while the influencer ideology is estimated by taking the median of its retweeters\u2019 ideology scores.\nInfluencers selection\nTo apply the ideology-scoring algorithm we first need to extract a set of influencers from the retweet network. \nThe influencer group encompasses several subgroups: (i) Russian and Ukrainian politicians, (ii) official accounts \nfrom information media sources such as journals and TV channels, and (iii) political activists. Users in the \nretweet network are ranked according to their in-degree, corresponding to the number of unique users who have \nretweeted them. This enables us to start from a manually selected set of prominent accounts pertaining to the \nthree aforementioned categories with some of the highest in-degree. This set then serves as a seed as we further \nselect similar accounts using the \u201cWho to follow\u201d recommendations made by Twitter on their accounts\u2019 page. \nWe repeated this procedure until no new accounts were suggested and then refined the selection by excluding \naccounts with an in-degree lower than 100 and those whose content is unrelated to the Ukrainian conflict. These \ncriteria yield a comprehensive set of 204 influencers, representing both supporters and opponents of military \nassistance to Ukraine.\nEstimation of the active consumption level\nThe estimation of the active consumption leverages tweet-level metrics, including the number of likes, replies, \nretweets, quote tweets, and, crucially, the number of views, quantified by the impressions count. We define \nthe level of active consumption as the ratio between the count of an active action\u2014namely, liking, replying, \nretweeting, and quote retweeting\u2014out of the number of impressions received by a given tweet, a given user, or a \ngiven domain, depending on the comparison unit of interest. We call this ratio Active Engagement (AE) .\n AE=#of actions\n#of impressions. (4)\nCoordinated behavior\nWe identify coordinated behavior on social media using CooRTweet78 to detect patterns where multiple accounts \nshare the same content within a certain timeframe. An action on social media is defined as an account x posting \ncontent c at a specific time t. Two or more accounts are considered coordinated when they perform the same \naction at least n times within a set time window \u03c4. These actions can include sharing the same URL, using \nthe same hashtag, or retweeting the same post. The shared content, or \u201cobject\u201d , is tracked as a set of possible \ncoordinated actions A={o1,o2, ..., o n}. Coordination between two accounts x1 and x2 occurs when their \nposts c1 and c2 share the same object o, and the time difference \u2206t=|t1\u2212t2| is less than or equal to the time \nwindow \u03c4, i.e., \u2206t\u2264\u03c4. In our case, we apply this procedure on retweet data, choosing n= 10  and tau= 10  as \nparameters for coordination detection.\nData availability\nThe code and Twitter data used in this research, shared in accordance with the platform\u2019s terms and conditions, \nare publicly accessible at https://osf.io/5m3 vr/. MediaBias/FactCheck data is publicly available on the MBFC \nwebsite: https://mediabia sfactcheck.com/.\nReceived: 6 November 2024; Accepted: 24 January 2025\nReferences\n 1. Andris, C. et al.
