We also compared average thread lengths, average comment lengths,\n \nand profanity rates across channels, and present simple machine learning classifiers for\n \npredicting the bias category of a video based on these statistics.\n \n \n \nMotivation\n \nMany social media platforms have recently seen an increase in the spread of\n \nmisinformation, defined as information which is misleading or factually incorrect. This spread\n \nwas well documented in the wake of the 2016 US presidential election, and has colloquially\n \nbeen labelled as the spread of \u201cfake news.\u201d\n \nInflammatory articles and stories often incorporate video content, and their comment\n \nsections provide an approximate measure of how people react to a given story. Despite this,\n \ncomment threads on YouTube videos have not been studied in the context of fake news as\n \nmuch as on other social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit, likely since YouTube\n \nemphasizes hosting videos whereas websites like Reddit focus on encouraging discourse. Our\n \naim is to understand the difference in YouTube comment responses to misinformative and\n \nfactual videos, as well as to political and apolitical videos.\n \n \nNote\n\u200b\n: We avoid using the term \u201cdisinformation\u201d in our work because it implies that said\n \ninformation is purposefully spreading misleading or factually incorrect information for political,\n \nprofitable, or other reasons, and we cannot precisely determine the intent of our sources. Like\n \nmany in the field, we also avoid using the term \u201cfake news\u201d to refrain from bringing its\n \npolitically charged connotations into our work.\n \n \n \n \nData\n \nBecause determining bias and identifying misinformation is not a fully objective process,\n \nwe rely heavily on labels provided by Media Bias Fact Check (\n\u200b\nhttps://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\n \nabout/\n\u200b\n) to categorize the sources for our collected data. Media Bias Fact Check (MBFC) is a\n \nsource of independent critique which uses an explicitly defined methodology to label both the\n \nbias and the factual trustworthiness of many media sources.\n \n \nChannel Selection\n \nWe selected 15 YouTube channels for analysis in this work. They are primarily news\n \nsources for political content and come from a variety of perspectives. We defer to MBFC to\n \ncategorize bias and classify the trustworthiness (Factual Rating) of our sources. The descriptions\n \nfor each of the categories and factual ratings of our data are in item 1 of our appendix.\n \nThe biases and factual ratings of our sources are depicted in Figure 1.\n \n \nFigure 1: A graphic depicting the MBFC categorizations and MBFC factual ratings (where applicable) for the\n \nfourteen channels we scraped. We made some categories of our own, marked as [unofficial], for later reference.\n \n \n \nWe chose our channels to cover a wide range of media. We included popular news\n \nsources such as Fox, BBC, and the New York Times; \u201cQuestionable Sources\u201d such as Breitbart,\n \nAmerican Renaissance, and Infowars; and sources less-focused on politics such as The Dodo,\n \nNumberphile and Science Magazine to act as a control group. Note that even channels with a\n \nhigh MBFC Factual Rating can be considered biased.\n \n \nSix of our sources support left-leaning views (New York Times, The Guardian, BBC,\n \nDemocracy Now, Young Turks, Syriana Analysis); six of our sources support right-leaning views\n \n \n \n(Fox, InfoWars/ Alex Jones, RT, Breitbart, American Renaissance, PragerU); and 3 of our sources\n \nare relatively apolitical (The Dodo, Numberphile, and Science Magazine). All of these\n \ncategorizations save for The Dodo, Numberphile, and PragerU are by MBFC; we unofficially\n \nlabelled the last three channels based on Wikipedia descriptions and separate those from\n \nMBFC-labelled sources in our analyses. For details on each channel, see item 2 in the appendix.\n \nFigure 2 displays the average number of views per video for each of the different bias\n \ngroups to provide context for our later work.\n \n \nFigure 2: Views across all sampled videos for the YouTube channels, normalized by the\n \nnumber of videos per group. Grouped visually by category and factual rating. Views measured in\n \nthousands. A chart of the views by channel can be found in the appendix, item 3.\n \n \n \n \n \nNote\n\u200b\n: Among our chosen channels, we see significant differences in viewership, which\n \ncould add a confounding variable to our later analyses. Channels with higher view-counts often\n \nhave lower engagement rates, so if one of our categories has many highly-viewed channels,\n \nthat category may be erroneously labelled as having less engagement than another category.\n \n \nAs this is an exploratory work, we have included a Released Datasets & Code section to\n \nallow others to continue and build off our work.\n \n \n \n \nData Collection\n \nWe used the YouTube API found at \n\u200b\nhttps://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/\n\u200b\n to\n \ncollect comments. For each of the channels we selected, we tried to collect the 200 most recent\n \nvideos which were more than two weeks old. We ignored videos less than two weeks old in\n \norder to give them enough time to saturate with comments. The only exception to the\n \ntwo-week rule is the InfoWars/Alex Jones data subset (150 videos), which was deleted from\n \nYouTube before we began enforcing it. At the time we collected the American Renaissance\n \ndataset, they only had 172 videos which fit our time-step requirements. All our further analyses\n \nare done on the (up to) 200 most recent videos per channel.\n \nFor each video, we retrieve all video metadata, all comments on the video (\n\u200b\ndirect\n \ncomments\n\u200b\n), and all replies to these comments (\n\u200b\nreplies\n\u200b\n). The \n\u200b\nvideo metadata \n\u200b\nconsists of view\n \ncount, like count, dislike count, favorite count, publish date, date accessed by the scraper, the\n \npublisher\u2019s channel title, and the duration of the video. Each \n\u200b\ncomment\n\u200b\n (which includes both\n \ndirect comments and replies)\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\nalso has its own metadata consisting of the author\u2019s display\n \nname, timestamp of the comment, and a like count. For more details on comment structure\n \nand how the metadata is gathered, please refer to the YouTube API we linked earlier in this\n \nsection.\n \n \n \nReleased Datasets & Code\n \n \nDatasets\n \nTo access 14 of our 15 analyzed datasets, please request access to \n\u200b\nthis Google Drive\n \nfolder\n\u200b\n. We have released all but our Infowars/ Alex Jones dataset.\n \nEach dataset, save for American Renaissance, has information on 201 videos. The\n \nAmerican Renaissance dataset has information on 172 videos.\n \n \nCode\n \nFind the code we used for comments-scraping and analysis at \n\u200b\nthis GitHub link\n\u200b\n. You can\n \nuse it to generate your own YouTube comment data from whichever channels you like. Our\n \nanalyses follow in the Results section. Please cite this work if you use the code.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nResults\n \n \nComment Engagement For Political Content:\n \n \nSummary\n \nOur data suggests that political content generates significantly more engagement via\n \ncomments than apolitical or pro-science content. It also suggests that biased content gets more\n \ncomment engagement than moderate content, through a quick comparison between Left-Bias\n \nand Left-Center channels. On channels labelled as Conspiracy-Pseudoscience and Questionable\n \nSources, we see an even greater engagement per user. Political or biased content also tends to\n \nhave more profane comments than apolitical or less-biased content.\n \n \nComments per view (CPV)\n \nSome channels were significantly more popular than others, with disparities up to a\n \nfactor of 200 between the total views on the channels we chose (Figure 2). We wanted to see\n \nhow well our different channels solicited responses from their viewers, and measure this by\n \nseeing how many \n\u200b\ncomments per view (CPV)\n\u200b\n each channel received. We measure CPV by\n \nchannel by going through each video in a channel and finding how many comments that video\n \nreceived per view, then averaging that ratio over all the videos in the channel (Figure 3A). To\n \nmeasure CPV by category, we take the CPV\u2019s of each of the channels in that category and\n \naverage those (Figure 3B).\n \n \nFigure 3A: Total CPV, organized by channel, within our dataset.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3B: Total CPV, by category. Total view counts per channel are provided in our appendix item 3.\n \n \n \nAfter normalizing, we find that both left-leaning and right-leaning political content\n \nresulted in more comments and replies per view as compared to non-political content. Content\n \nlabelled as Left-Bias, Right-Bias, Conspiracy/Pseudoscience, or Questionable Source has 7.5x\n \nmore comments per view and 10.42x more replies per view on average compared to content\n \nlabelled as Apolitical or Pro-Science (Figure 3B). This indicates greater engagement in the\n \ncomment sections on political channels. For our readers\u2019 convenience, we also include a\n \nfiner-grain breakdown of comments per view per channel (Figure 3A).\n \nOur data also suggests that more polarized content receives greater engagement than\n \nless polarized content. Most notably, we find 8.3x more comments per view on channels\n \nlabelled as Conspiracy-Pseudoscience and Questionable Sources compared to channels labelled\n \nas Apolitical or Pro-Science. We also see that Left-Bias channels have 2.56x more comments per\n \nview than Left-Center channels on average.\n \n \nAlthough we saw the difference between Conspiracy-Pseudoscience/ Questionable\n \nSources and Apolitical/ Pro-Science, that does not take into account the great difference in\n \nviews between the four categories; there are far more views on our Apolitical channels than on\n \nchannels in the other three categories (Figure 2).\n \n \n \n \n \n \nComments per video\n \nFocusing on comments per view can sometimes downplay engagement on more\n \npopular channels, since channels garnering high viewership do not always receive a\n \nproportional number of direct comments. Thus, we also wanted to make a baseline\n \nmeasurement by tracking the average responses per video, as opposed to per view, by channel\n \n(Figure 4A) and by category (Figure 4B).\n \n \nFigure 4A: Total comments, including both direct comments and replies, divided by videos per channel.\n \n \n \n \nFigure 4B: Total comments divided by videos per channel, averaged over category.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage thread length (ATL)\n \nSince we are also interested in the depth of interaction between users in YouTube\n \ncomment sections, we also measure the \n\u200b\naverage thread length (ATL)\n\u200b\n across each channel\n \n(Figure 5A) and category (Figure 5B). We consider ATL a good measure of deeper engagement\n \nbecause they require viewers to interact with other commenters over longer periods of time.\n \nWe calculate ATL\u2019s for channels by taking the average number of replies on each direct\n \ncomment in that channel, then for category by averaging the ATL\u2019s of the channels in that\n \ncategory.\n \n \nFigure 5A: Average thread length for each channel. Average thread length is the average number of replies on\n \neach direct comment over all the videos we scraped for a particular channel.\n \n \n Figure 5B: Average thread length organized by category.\n \n \n \n \nDespite having higher total view counts per video than most of the news sources (Figure\n \n2), the apolitical channels The Dodo and Numberphile both have significantly shorter ATL\u2019s than\n \nother news sources. All our apolitical channels have ATL\u2019s < 1. Shorter ATL\u2019s is not unique to\n \nApolitical channels; we do see that some Left-Bias, Questionable Source, Pro-Science and\n \nConspiracy-Pseudoscience channels have ATL\u2019s < 1 (Figure 5A). However, those particular\n \nchannels do not have view counts per video which are comparable to those of the Apolitical\n \nchannels. If we compare the Apolitical ATL (with an average of 400k views per video) to the\n \nPragerU ATL (with 1,050k views per video), we see that PragerU\u2019s ATL is 1.5 comments more\n \nthan the Apolitical ATL.\n \nFor our chosen channels, the Apolitical ATL is much less than the ATL of any other\n \ncategory. This broadly hints that political content leads to greater engagement.\n \nSome further work on ATL can be found in our appendix, items 5 & 6.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage comment lengths (ACL)\n \nAs another measure of comment engagement, we analyze the \n\u200b\naverage comment\n \nlengths (ACL\u2019s)\n\u200b\n for each channel. ACL by channel takes the average of the number of characters\n \nper comment for every video in the channel\u2019s dataset (Figure 6A). ACL by category is taken by\n \ntaking the averages of the ACL\u2019s of the channels in each category (Figure 6B).\n \n \nFigure 6A: Average number of characters in a comment, organized by channel.\n \n \n \n \nFigure 6B: Average comment length, organized by category.\n \n \nImmediately, we see that comments on PragerU were longer than comments on any\n \nother channel (Figure 6A); people are not only creating long threads (Figure 5A), but also using\n \nmore words in each comment. We see similar behavior across the Democracy Now and\n \nAmerican Renaissance channels, suggesting there may be longer comments on videos reflecting\n \nmore polarized political views (Figure 6A). The Dodo lags behind.\n \n \n \n \nProfanity trends on political content\n \nWe wanted to see if political channels inspired more profanity than apolitical channels,\n \nand whether or not there would be a relationship between MBFC ratings and profanity.\n \nWe calculate \n\u200b\nchannel profanity\n\u200b\n by finding the percentage of profane comments per\n \nvideo, then averaging those percentages over all the videos in a channel (Fig. 7A); \n\u200b\ncategory\n \nprofanity\n\u200b\n is calculated similarly but averaged over all videos in an MBFC category (Fig. 7B).\n \nProfane comments\n\u200b\n contain at least one profane word. Profanityfilter, a universal Python library\n \nfor detecting profane words, checks each comment against a dictionary of profane words.\n \n \nFigure 7A: Channel profanities for our dataset.\n \n \n \nFigure 7B: Category profanities for our dataset.\n \n \n \n \nChannels with political content have 1.82x more profane comments across their videos\n \nwhen compared to our apolitical and pro-science sources. We also see that Left-Bias channels\n \nare 1.82x more profane than Left-Center Bias channels.\n \nWe note that Science Magazine (Pro-Science, High Factual Rating), BBC and The\n \nGuardian (both Left-Center Bias, High Factual Rating) have comparable levels of profanity\n \ncompared to Russia Today (Questionable Source), Fox News (Right-Bias, Mixed Factual Rating),\n \nand Syriana Analysis (Left-Bias, Mixed Factual Rating), which suggests that factual rating is not\n \nnecessarily immediately correlated with profanity. Even so, it is interesting to note that the\n \nmost profane channels, American Renaissance (Questionable Source), Democracy Now\n \n(Left-Bias, Mixed Factual Rating), Young Turks (Left-Bias, Mixed Factual Rating), and Breitbart\n \n(Questionable Source), had some of the lowest factual ratings.\n \nWe made a number of word clouds per channel in the hopes of seeing what\n \ncommenters on each channel were saying, but drew no conclusions. The word clouds can be\n \nfound in our appendix (item 4).\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPredicting the MBFC Category of a Video using Metadata\n \nAfter observing notable differences in engagement statistics from channel to channel,\n \nwe were interested in seeing how well we could leverage these differences for prediction. We\n \nselected four basic machine learning models from the scikit-learn package for Machine Learning\n \nin Python (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear SVM, and SVM with RBF kernel), and trained\n \nthese models to predict the bias category which a given video comes from.\n \n \nSummary\n \nFor our limited dataset, the Random Forest and SVM with RBF kernel are the highest\n \nperforming models, achieving test accuracies of 80.2% and 79.0% respectively in this 8-class\n \nclassification problem. The most important features used by the Decision Tree and Random\n \nForest models to determine the bias category of a video were \u201cLike Count\u201d of the video,\n \n\u201cComments Per View\u201d, and \u201cProfanity Rate\u201d. In future work, we hope to increase the size of our\n \ndataset and leverage NLP techniques on the text of comments to improve classification\n \nperformance and gain more insight on differences in engagement and language between videos\n \nfrom different political bias categories.\n \n \nPredicting the MBFC category of a video\n \nWe combined the videos of our 15 YouTube channels into one large dataset of 2904\n \nvideos. Each video was given 10 features, shown in Figure 8A below. These features consist of\n \nthose engagement statistics which we compared earlier (ex. \u201cProfanity Rate\u201d) and other\n \nmetadata which we had easy access to (ex. \u201cLike Count\u201d).\n \nFigure 8A depicts the importance of these features according to our Decision Tree and\n \nRandom Forest models, where \n\u200b\nfeature importance\n\u200b\n is defined as \n\u200b\nthe normalized total reduction\n \nof the split criterion (Gini impurity) provided by that feature\n\u200b\n.\n \nIt is worth noting the slight redundancy in using \u201cComments Per View\u201d, \u201cNumber of\n \nComments\u201d, and \u201cNumber of Views\u201d as features; the first is the ratio of the other two.\n \nInterestingly, the Decision Tree and Random Forest models find that the \u201cComments Per View\u201d\n \nis a substantially more informative feature than the two statistics alone.\n \n \n \nFigure 8A: A list of the features we used, as well as each one\u2019s importance in Decision Tree and RF\n \n \n \n \n \nWe visualized the 10-dimensional data, labelled by its bias category, using\n \n2-dimensional t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding in Figure 8B. \n\u200b\nThe most visible trait\n \nof this visualization is that Apolitical videos, which had the lowest average value for many of the\n \nfeatures in the original feature space (e.g. \u201cComments Per View\u201d, \u201cAverage Thread Length\u201d,\n \n\u201cProfanity Rate\u201d), form a relatively independent cluster.\n \n \nFigure 8B: A 2-dimensional t-SNE visualization of the training data.\n \n \nFor each model applied to the data, we used 5-fold cross validation on our training set\n \n(85% of the total dataset) to find optimal hyper-parameters. After training our models on those\n \nhyperparameters, we evaluated them on an unseen test set (15% of the total dataset). The\n \nresulting confusion matrices on the unseen test data for each model can be found in Figure 8C.\n \n \nWe find that the Random Forest and SVM with RBF kernel perform best, with test\n \naccuracies of 80.2% and 79.0% respectively.\n \n \nWe know that Random Forest models generally perform well on any dataset with\n \nminimal regularity because of their ensemble nature and their robustness to outliers. It is no\n \nsurprise that the linear SVM underperforms because there is no reason to believe that the\n \noptimal decision function for this problem would be a linear decision boundary. Thus, we\n \nhypothesize that the linear SVM suffers from bias to a greater extent than the other models.\n \n \nThe SVM with RBF kernel likely performs well because the RBF kernel function can be\n \ninterpreted as a similarity score based on Euclidean distance between points in the feature\n \nspace. Videos from the same channel tend to have similar feature representations, and each\n \nbias category in our dataset is composed of videos from no more than three unique channels.\n \n \n \n \nFigure 8C: Confusion matrices for models with hyper-parameters chosen by 5-fold cross validation.\n \n(Top left) Decision tree with maximum depth = 12: test accuracy = 65.7%. (Top right) Random forest with\n \nunlimited max depth, 61 estimators: test accuracy = 80.2%. (Bottom left) SVM with C = 100: test accuracy =\n \n62.5%. (Bottom right) SVM with RBF kernel, with gamma = 0.1, C = 175: test accuracy = 79.0%.\n \n \n \nFor future work, it would be interesting to see if the SVM with RBF kernel continues\n \nperforming well with greater amounts of broader data. We are also interested in applying NLP\n \ntechniques to the comments of videos to gain novel insights about differences in the language\n \nof comments in videos from different bias categories.\n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion\n \n \nOur preliminary findings indicate notably higher viewer engagement on biased, political,\n \nor misinformative channels when compared to unbiased, apolitical, and truthful channels,\n \nappearing to corroborate similar research in this field. Using Decision Tree and Random Forest\n \nclassifiers on our dataset suggested that \u201cLike Count\u201d, \u201cComments per View\u201d, and \u201cProfanity\n \nRate\u201d were the most important features for determining the bias of a channel or whether it was\n \nclassified as \u201cConspiracy-Pseudoscience\u201d or a \u201cQuestionable Source\u201d.\n \nHaving limited our scope to 15 YouTube channels, a majority of which were American, it\n \nremains to be seen if the trends discussed in this paper occur across a larger and more\n \ncomprehensive dataset. Furthermore, the differences in viewership across the chosen channels\n \nmay have led us to different conclusions than if the compared channels had more similar\n \nviewership. These uncertainties could be resolved by running the same analyses on a larger,\n \nmore diverse dataset. We would also like to expand our scope to analyze why certain\n \ncomments receive greater traction and why some channels have longer average thread lengths,\n \nas well as how discussions and arguments develop on YouTube.\n \nWe welcome fellow researchers and the open-source community to use and build upon\n \nour work. We hope our readers remember that online comments and discussions may never\n \naccurately reflect the nature of people\u2019s attitudes towards the content they see - many\n \ninteractions happen offline, \u201cin real life\u201d - and look to stimulate further analysis in the domain\n \nof discourse surrounding misinformation online.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences\n \n \nMisinformation:\n \n-\nThe spread of true and false news online\n\u200b\n - Vosoughi, Roy, Aral - MIT Media Lab. brief\n \nhere\n \n-\nInformation Operations and Facebook\n\u200b\n - Weedon, Nuland, Stamos - Facebook.\n \n-\n\u201cEverything I Disagree With is #FakeNews\u201d: Correlating Political Polarization and Spread\n \nof Misinformation\n\u200b\n - Ribeiro, Calais, Almeida, Meira Jr. - Universidade Federal de Minas\n \nGerais.\n \n-\nCombating Fake News: An Agenda for Research and Action\n\u200b\n - Lazer, Baum, Brinberg,\n \nFriedland, Joseph, Hobbs, Mattsson - Harvard, Northeastern University.\n \n \nComments analysis:\n \n-\nCharacterizing Online Discussion Using Coarse Discourse Sequences\n\u200b\n - Zhang, Culbertson,\n \nParitosh - MIT CSAIL, Google.\n \n-\nThe Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus: A Large Dataset for Research in Unstructured Multi-Turn\n \nDialogue Systems\n\u200b\n - Lowe, Pow, Serban, Pineau - McGill University, Universi\u00e9 de\n \nMontr\u00e9al.\n \n-\nThe Sequential Analysis of Group Interaction and Critical Thinking in Online Threaded\n \nDiscussions\n\u200b\n - Jeong - Florida State University\n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix\n \n \nItem 1: MBFC Categories and Factual Ratings\n \nThese definitions are sourced directly from Media Bias Fact Check. Their methodology can be\n \nfound at \n\u200b\nhttps://mediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/\n\u200b\n. We have only provided descriptions\n \nfor the categories and factual ratings for our channels.\n \n \nCategory details\n \n-\nLeft Bias\n\u200b\n: \u201cThese media sources are moderately to strongly biased toward liberal causes\n \nthrough story selection and/or political affiliation.  They may utilize strong loaded words\n \n(wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or\n \nstereotypes), publish misleading reports and omit reporting of information that may\n \ndamage liberal causes. Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy.\u201d\n \n-\nLeft-Center:\n\u200b\n \u201cThese media sources have a slight to moderate liberal bias.  They often\n \npublish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to\n \ninfluence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor liberal\n \ncauses.  These sources are generally trustworthy for information, but may require\n \nfurther investigation.\u201d\n \n-\nRight Bias:\n\u200b\n \u201cThese media sources are moderately to strongly biased toward conservative\n \ncauses through story selection and/or political affiliation. They may utilize strong loaded\n \nwords (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or\n \nstereotypes), publish misleading reports and omit reporting of information that may\n \ndamage conservative causes. Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy.\u201d\n \n-\nPro-Science:\n\u200b\n \u201cThese sources consist of legitimate science or are evidence based through\n \nthe use of credible scientific sourcing.  Legitimate science follows the scientific method,\n \nis unbiased and does not use emotional words.  These sources also respect the\n \nconsensus of experts in the given scientific field and strive to publish peer reviewed\n \nscience. Some sources in this category may have a slight political bias, but adhere to\n \nscientific principles.\u201d\n \n-\nConspiracy-Pseudoscience: \n\u200b\n\u201cSources in the Conspiracy-Pseudoscience category may\n \npublish unverifiable information that is not always supported by evidence. These\n \nsources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information, therefore fact\n \nchecking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when\n \nobtaining information from these sources.\u201d\n \n-\nQuestionable Sources:\n\u200b\n \u201cA questionable source exhibits one or more of the following:\n \nextreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to\n \ncredible information, a complete lack of transparency and/or is fake news. Fake News is\n \nthe deliberate attempt to publish hoaxes and/or disinformation for the purpose of profit\n \nor influence (\n\u200b\nLearn More\n\u200b\n). Sources listed in the Questionable Category may be very\n \nuntrustworthy and should be fact checked on a per article basis. Please note sources on\n \nthis list are not considered fake news unless specifically written in the reasoning section\n \nfor that source.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \nFactual rating details:\n \n-\nVery Low\n\u200b\n: \u201cthe source almost never uses credible sources and is simply not trustworthy\n \nfor reliable information at all. These are the sources that always need to be fact checked\n \nfor intentional fake news, conspiracy and propaganda.\u201d\n \n-\nMixed\n\u200b\n: \u201cthe source does not always use proper sourcing or sources to other\n \nbiased/mixed sources.

Desmarais\nABSTRACT\nWe study the roles of elected officials in the dissemination of misinformation on Twitter. This is a \nparticularly salient online population since elected officials serve as primary sources of information \nfor many stakeholders in the public, media, government, and industry. We analyze the content of \ntweets posted from the accounts of over 3,000 U.S. state lawmakers throughout 2020 and 2021. \nSpecifically, we identify the dissemination of URLs linked to unreliable content. Our starkest finding \nis that Republicans share more misinformation than do Democrats by an order of magnitude. \nAdditionally, we uncover distinct patterns in the temporal trends of tweets and tweets associated \nwith misinformation across party and state lines. Delving into the content of tweets referencing \nunreliable URLs reveals discussions of election integrity, abortion, COVID-19 policies, and immigra -\ntion. Furthermore, consistent with the literature on asymmetric polarization, Republicans exhibit a \ngreater inclination toward engaging in partisan attacks. We also find that state lawmakers often \ntweet about state-specific topics. These findings enhance our understanding of misinformation, \npolitical communication, and state politics.KEYWORDS \nMisinformation; twitter; state \nlegislator; political \ncommunication\nIntroduction\nThe proliferation of misinformation on social \nmedia poses a major threat to democracy in the \nUnited States (Osmundsen, Bor, Vahlstrup, \nBechmann, & Petersen, 2021 ). Although the influ -\nence of political elites on public opinion has been \nwell-documented (Berinsky, 2017 ; Slothuus & \nBisgaard, 2021 ), we have limited knowledge about \nthe reliability of information shared by those elites, \nwith the exception of some recent studies of U.S. \nCongress members (e.g., Lasser et al., 2022 ; Mosleh \n& Rand, 2022 ). To advance knowledge in this area, \nwe investigate U.S. state legislators \u2013 a population \nof officials with significantly more members than \nCongress \u2013 who are more reliant on social media to \nconnect with constituents and other stakeholders \ndue to the lack of state and local media sources \n(Kim et al., 2021 ).\nThe majority of U.S. state legislators use Twitter \n(Cook, 2017 ; Kim et al., 2021 ). We examine tweets \nfrom legislators over a two-year period (2020\u2013 \n2021), a considerably longer period than used by \nprevious studies on misinformation shared by \nAmerican political elites. This period encompasses \nnumerous notable political and social events, such \nas the (Singh et al., 2020 ) election, and the Black Lives Matter movement. This provides a fertile \nground for examining trends and disparities in \nsharing misinformation across states and parties. \nTo identify misinformation, we focus on the qual -\nity of the sources linked by legislators. Examining \nURLs is a common approach to identifying mis-\ninformation in tweets (Bellutta, Uyheng, & Carley,  \n2022 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Teng, Lin, Chung, Li, & \nKovashka, 2022 ). Analyzing URL quality allows us \nto capture an array of misinformation content, an \napproach that complements more specialized treat -\nments of individual topics of misinformation (e.g., \nelections, see Green, Hobbs, McCabe, and Lazer \n(2022 ) and vaccines, see Jamison et al. (2020 )).\nAnalyzing state-level officials provides insights \nunavailable through studying national-level offi-\ncials: the variation in misinformation dissemina -\ntion across states. We find that (1) the temporal \ntrend of tweets containing URLs, excluding those \nfrom social media and search engines, differs from \nthe trend in the percentage of tweets with unreli -\nable URLs; (2) the dissemination of unreliable \nURLs varies significantly across political parties; \n(3) topics in unreliable tweets include election \nintegrity, abortion, COVID-19 policies, criticism \nCONTACT Yuehong Cassandra Tai \n yhcasstai@psu.edu \n Center for Social Data Analytics, The Pennsylvania State University, Pennsylvania, USJOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS \nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19331681.2023.2257682\n\u00a9 2023 Taylor & Francis \nof Biden\u2019s domestic policies, Trump\u2019s campaign, \nand immigration; and (4) there is substantial varia -\ntion across states in the rate at which unreliable \nURLs are shared.\nThis study is, to the best of our knowledge, the \nfirst analysis of the dissemination of misinforma -\ntion by state-level officials, examining the largest \nsingle population of lawmakers ever studied in this \ncontext. Our study contributes to the expanding \nliterature on asymmetric partisan politics, where \npolarization, affective partisanship, and extremism \nare stronger on the right due in part to the \u201ccon -\nservative media universe\u201d (Grossmann & Hopkins,  \n2016 ). We find significant partisan disparities in \nthe dissemination of misinformation, which aligns \nwith patterns of asymmetric polarization given that \nmisinformation is significantly more extreme and \nsensational (Jerit & Zhao, 2020 ). Our results also \nprovide new evidence of variation across states \nwithin an increasingly nationalized political land -\nscape (Grumbach, 2022 ; Hopkins, 2018 ). \nAccordingly, our findings contribute to research \non state politics, digital politics, and legislative \npolitics.\nMethods & research design\nOur primary objective is to examine variability in \nthe dissemination of misinformation by state legis -\nlators over time, political party, and state. \nAdditionally, we aim to gain insight into the pre-\nvalent topics about which state legislators dissemi -\nnate misinformation. In the following sections, we \noutline our method for measuring misinformation \ndissemination, analyze trends in dissemination, \ninvestigate partisan differences, explore the topical \ncontent of misinformation-laden tweets, and sum -\nmarize variations observed across states.\nOur unit of analysis is tweets from state legisla -\ntors that include URLs that are not originating \nfrom social media or search engines. Following \nthe best practices regarding the trustworthiness of \nshared information (Grinberg, Joseph, Friedland, \nSwire-Thompson, & Lazer, 2019 ; Guess, Nyhan, & \nReifler, 2020 ; Lasser et al., 2022 ), we assess the \ncredibility of these tweets by evaluating the relia -\nbility of the URL domains. For this purpose, we \ncollected URL ratings coded by Media Bias/Fact \nCheck (MBFC, mediabiasfactcheck.com) as our raw reference source, a widely used source in pre-\nvious research on misinformation (e.g., Chen et al.,  \n2022 ; Guimaraes, Figueira, & Torgo, 2018 ; \nStefanov, Darwish, Atanasov, & Nakov, 2020 ). \nHowever, we note that MBFC is not the only \nnews/website indexing platform (e.g., \nOpenSources (Han, Kumar, & Durumeric, 2022 )). \nSince we study aggregate patterns of sharing, and \nnot, e.g., references to specific websites, we expect \nthat our results would be robust to the use of \nalternative sources for URL classification. \nNonetheless, integrating multiple URL sources \ninto a single quantitative study is challenging as \nspecific categorizations (e.g., low fact, question -\nable) vary across alternative sources.\nRaw data\nWe collected 3,345,232 tweets from all 50 states \nfrom 2020-01-01 to 2021-12-31 using the Aca- \ndemic Twitter API through the R package \nacademictwitteR (Barrie & Ho, 2021 ). Following \nthe procedure outlined in Kim et al. (2021 ), we \nperiodically retrieved tweets from legislators\u2019 \nTwitter accounts throughout this period. Of the \n8,003 state representatives and senators who were \nin office during our data collection period, 5,712 \nlegislators, comprising 2,943 Democrats, 2,740 \nRepublicans, and 29 Independents, had at least \none Twitter account (Kim et al., 2021 ).1 \nImportantly, a significant number of Twitter \naccounts may have been inactive during the collec -\ntion period or inaccessible after legislators left \noffice. Despite these restrictions, the collection of \nall available tweets still encompasses 64% of \nDemocrats, 61% of Republicans, and 55% of \nIndependents (see Kim et al. (2021 ) for further \ninformation on account scope and collection). \nGiven that Democrats were more active on \nTwitter, 70.9% of the collected tweets originated \nfrom Democratic legislators, while 28.6% were \nfrom Republican legislators, despite the compar -\nable numbers of Democrats (n = 1,885) and \nRepublicans (n = 1,682).\nReferences for unreliable URLs\nWe scraped URL rating details from the MBFC \nwebsite, including the Source URL, Bias Category, 2\n Y. C. TAI ET AL.\nBias Rating, Questionable Reasoning, Factual \nReporting level, and the date the record was last \nupdated. After removing duplicates, our MBFC \ndata includes 5,255 unique URL domains. This \ndata will be useful for future research on the dis-\nsemination of misinformation on social media.\nWe use the term \u201cunreliable\u201d to refer to the \nURL categories, as rated by MBFC, that we treat \nas sources of misinformation. We defined unreli -\nable URLs through the following steps. First, we \nconsidered all URLs classified as questionable \nsources, those having mixed, low, or very low \nfactual reporting, and those designated as conspi -\nracy-pseudoscience (n = 1,829). To refine our \nreferences, we retained URLs that were categor -\nized as questionable due to conspiracies, pseu -\ndoscience, and failed fact checking and filtered \nout URLs that were labeled as having questionable \nsources because of transparency-related and/or \nideological bias. We also removed official web-\nsites, such as gop.gov and democrats.org. Our \ngoal in thinning out the URLs was to focus on \nthe most misleading content, not just the most \npolitically biased \u2013 an important distinction \ngiven that we are studying politicians. We ended \nup with 1,292 unreliable sources. Since not all \ntweets spreading misinformation include URLs, \nour process provides a conservative assessment \nof the scale of misinformation spread by state \nlegislators.The political leaning of unreliable content on the \nMBFC list is, on average, skewed to the right (n =  \n974) compared to the amount of left-leaning unre -\nliable content (n = 43) (see Table 1). In total, the \nnumber of \u201cright\u201d labeled sources (n = 1,606) is \nlarger than \u201cleft\u201d (n = 968). We deal with this \nissue later when analyzing party differences \nthrough weighting.\nAnalysis data\nSince we focused on URL quality, we constructed \nour analysis data set (n = 383,193) by excluding \ntweets without URLs and those with URLs linked \nto social media and search engines. Our analysis \ndata comprises 1,783 Democrats who tweeted \n66.63% of the total tweets (n = 255,319), 1,464 \nRepublicans who tweeted 35.57% of the tweets (n  \n= 124,814), and 12 Independents who tweeted the \nremaining tweets (n = 3,060). In our analysis data \nset, 13420 tweets included unreliable URLs. Of \nthese, 12785 were shared by 575 Republicans \n(10.24% of Republicans\u2019 tweets) and 630 were \ntweeted by 221 Democrats (0.25% of Democrats\u2019 \ntweets). There is no gold standard against which to \ncompare these percentages. However, in a recent \nstudy that used the Twitter streaming API to gather \nhealth-related tweets (Singh et al., 2020 ), research -\ners found that, of all tweets including URLs, the \npercentage of tweets including low-quality and/or \nTable 1.

The rate of \nquestionable URLs shared by Democratic state leg-\nislators is relatively low in comparison, while the \nrate for Republicans is substantially higher.\nAlthough we do not know precisely what drives \nthe dissemination of misinformation by elected officials, we inquire whether the trend in the per-\ncentage of sharing unreliable URLs follows the ebb \nand flow of the total tweets in our analysis data. We \nanalyze the daily tweet counts and the percentage \nof unreliable tweets shared by Democrats and \nRepublicans, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the \nFigure 1. Daily count of tweets and percentage of unreliable tweets shared by state legislators, 01/01/2020\u201312/31/2021. Vertical \ndotted lines indicate the top 10 peak days. Y-scale varies by party.4\n Y. C. TAI ET AL.\ntemporal trends of tweet count and the percentage \nof sharing unreliable URLs by party. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans had their top 10 \ntweet peaks between mid-March and early April \n2020, with a focus on COVID-19 developments, \nstate measures, mitigation and relief policies, and \nthe 2020 census. On peak days, Democrats tweeted \naround 1,000 times, while Republicans tweeted \nfewer than 450 times. Notably, the surge in \nCOVID-19-related tweets returned to pre-pan -\ndemic levels more quickly for Republicans than \nfor Democrats, aligning with Republicans\u2019 percep -\ntion of COVID-19 as a lesser health hazard \n(Research Center, 2020 ). Regarding unreliable \ntweets, we observe an increasing trend in the per-\ncentage of unreliable URLs shared by Republicans \nwith peaks in mid-2021. In contrast, we do not \nidentify a clear trend, either upward or downward, \nin the percentage of unreliable URLs shared by \nDemocrats. This finding, viewed from the perspec -\ntive of the political divide, partially runs counter to \nrecent work that notes the increasing prevalence of \nmisinformation on social media (He & He, 2022 ; \nMrah, 2022 ; Weber et al., 2021 ). The bottom panel \nof Figure 1 shows that the average percentage of \nunreliable URLs over 723 days was around 3.5%. \nHowever, Democrats had a maximum of 2%, while \nRepublicans had a maximum of 30%.\nThis striking pattern could suggest a higher pre-\nvalence of unreliable URL sharing by Republicans. \nHowever, the MBFC index includes more right-lean -\ning sources (1,606) than left-leaning sources (968). It \nis possible that right-leaning sources have a higher \nprevalence of unreliable content than the overall \npopulation of URLs. Another possible explanation \nfor this ideological disparity in unreliable URLs is \nbias in the MBFC source selection process. As we \nlack precise information about this process and can-\nnot rule out this possibility, we explore whether the \nobserved differences between Democrats and \nRepublicans are attributable to ideological disparities \nin sources by applying a weighting scheme.\nResults\nParty differences in unreliable URL dissemination\nIn this section, we compare the percentage of unre -\nliable URL dissemination between political parties, adjusting for potential bias in the MBFC URL \nindex. Republicans tend to share right-leaning \nsources more frequently, while Democrats tend to \nshare left-leaning sources. To address the possibi -\nlity of over-sampling right-leaning sources in \nMBFC\u2019s construction of the URL list, we introduce \na weighting scheme that assumes equal numbers of \nright- and left-leaning sources in the population. \nThe weighting utilizes the ratio of right- to left- \nleaning sources in MBFC\u2019s source pool, counting \neach right-leaning and neutral URL as one share \nand each left-leaning URL as 1.66 (1,606/968) \nshares to account for hypothetical under-sampling \nof left-leaning unreliable sources.2 Legislators with \nfewer than 10 tweets are excluded from the analysis \nto avoid misleading percentages. As a result, 838 of \n3,582 legislators are excluded.\nThe weighted partisan comparison is visualized \nin Figure 2. Since the data is heavy-tailed with a \nlarge number of zeros for both parties, a linear- \nscaled plot is insufficient to capture the majority of \nthe data. Therefore, we employed a pseudo-log \n(base-10) transformation, which avoids taking the \nlogarithm of zero by adding 1 to the absolute value \nof x. For large positive numbers, a pseudo-log \nbehaves much like a log (base-10). For ease of \ninterpretation, the labels on both axes utilize the \noriginal linear scale values rather than logarithmic \nscale values.\nOur analysis reveals a statistically significant dif-\nference in the mean percentage of unreliable URLs \nshared by Republicans and Democrats (p < 0.001 in \na two-tailed test). Republicans have a mean percen -\ntage of 5.577%, 20 times higher than Democrats\u2019 \nmean percentage of 0.275%. Furthermore, we find \nthat 52.57% of Republican legislators have shared \nat least one unreliable URL, while only 15.03% of \nDemocratic legislators have done so. A large \nmajority of legislators (70.14%) have not shared \nunreliable URLs. Variations exist within both par-\nties, although to different degrees. The median \npercentage of unreliable URLs for Democrats is 0, \nwith a standard deviation of 1.738 and a maximum \npercentage of 46.948. On the contrary, the median \npercentage for Republicans is 0.571, with a stan-\ndard deviation of 10.476 and a maximum percen -\ntage of 85.714. To test the sensitivity of the data set \nweighting, we performed a robustness check with -\nout applying the weight. Although the mean JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS\n 5\npercentage for Democrats decreased by 0.04% \npoints, the main result remains robust (see A1 A1 \nfor detailed information).\nOur findings reveal a significant partisan asym -\nmetry in the dissemination of unreliable URLs, high -\nlighting that Republican state legislators show a \nconsiderably higher tendency than Democrats to \nshare tweets containing such URLs. Despite this \ndisparity, the majority of legislators refrained from \nsharing unreliable URLs during the study period. \nResearch on Congress has identified an increasing \nlevel of partisan politics that is not equally divided \nbetween parties, with the Republican Party taking a \nmore prominent role in discussions about polarized \nissues (Hacker & Pierson, 2005 ). In the subsequent \nsection, we delve deeper into this asymmetry by \nexamining the specific topics in unreliable tweets \nacross parties.\nTopics in unreliable tweets\nTo explore the specific topics discussed within the \ncontext of unreliable URL dissemination, we trained \nstructural topic models for the full set of unreliable \nURLs using the stm R package (Roberts, Stewart, & \nTingley, 2019 ). In our analysis, we incorporated partisanship and date as covariates in the topic pre-\nvalence equation. This functionality of STM allows \nthe likelihood that a token (i.e., word) within a \ndocument (e.g., tweet) is drawn from a given topic \nto depend on attributes of the document (e.g., the \nauthor\u2019s partisanship, the date of the tweet). \nFollowing the best practices and diagnostic proce -\ndures outlined by Roberts, Stewart, and Tingley \n(2019 ), we determined the optimal number of topics \nto be 38. We tested models with varying topic num -\nbers close to 38 and discovered that this number \nyielded the most understandable set of topics.\nFigure 3 presents the top words for each topic \nbased on frequency and exclusivity scores (FREX \nscores, Airoldi and Bischof (2016 )), along with the \nprevalence of each topic in the models. By examin -\ning the top FREX words and reviewing 20 ran-\ndomly selected associated tweets for each topic, \nwe identified the most prevalent and interpretable \ntopics. These include COVID-19 policies, Trump\u2019s \n2020 campaign, immigration at the border, cri-\ntiques of Biden\u2019s domestic policies, abortion, and \nelection integrity. The mean proportions of topics \nacross parties are plotted in Figure 4. Dashed lines \nindicate statistically significant disparities (p < \n0.05) in topic prevalence across parties for five \nFigure 2.

Republicans demonstrated a greater empha -\nsis on topic 29, criticisms of Biden\u2019s domestic poli-\ncies, topic 1, attributing bias to Democrats in \nMissouri\u2019s audit of Senator Hawley, and topic 3, \nscrutinizing COVID relief policies and mask man -\ndates. Democrats, on the other hand, exhibited a \nhigher prevalence of topics 30 and 31, which are \nnot easily interpretable.\nOur findings fit with the broader results of \nresearch on misinformation largely focused on \nordinary social media users, not political elites. \nFor example, the prevalence of topics supports \nthat misinformation tends to spread more readily \nwhen it pertains to highly polarized topics (Kim et \nal., 2018 ). The divergence in topics across parties \ndemonstrates that users are more inclined to share \nmisinformation if the perspective presented in the content reinforces their beliefs and partisan views \non a polarized subject (Neyazi & Muhtadi, 2021 ; \nYeon Lee, 2020 ). In our study, this partisanship- \ndriven misinformation is disproportionally promi -\nnent for Republicans, reflecting previous findings \nthat the coordinated Republican Party is capable of \nimposing ideological discipline and engaging in \npartisan warfare to question opponents\u2019 motives \n(Grossmann & Hopkins, 2016 ; Theriault, 2013 ).\nUnreliable tweets across states\nThe last dimension we investigate \u2013 a perspec -\ntive made possible by our focus on state-level \nofficials \u2013 is how the dissemination of unreliable \nURLs varies across states. Through our analysis, \nwe discovered considerable heterogeneity in the \nFigure 3. Topics in legislators\u2019 unreliable tweets.JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS\n 7\nproportion of unreliable URLs across different \nstates (Figure 5). Arizona emerges as the fore-\nmost purveyor of unreliable tweets (n = 6,342, \n28.35%), followed by Alabama (n = 410, 9.73%) \nand Arkansas (n = 391, 8.41%). When account -\ning for the number of tweets from Democrats \nand Republicans in Arizona and employing our \nweighted mean percentage of unreliable tweets, \nthe expected percentage of unreliable tweets in \nArizona should be 3.51% rather than 28.35%. \nThis inflated percentage was driven by the \nactions of two specific legislators who collec -\ntively disseminated the majority of unreliable \ntweets (see details in B1 B1). This finding fits with the general \u201cbursty\u201d and heavy-tailed nat-\nure of digital communication on social media \nplatforms, where a disproportionate volume of \ninteractions are driven by a small number of \ninfluential actors (Bessi et al., 2015 ; Lerman & \nGhosh, 2010 ; Myers & Leskovec, 2014 ).\nA further examination reveals that states have \nvarying temporal patterns in the percentage of \nunreliable tweets: some states had more concen -\ntrated peaks, while others had more dispersed \npeaks. For example, Pennsylvania experienced \npeaks in the second half of 2021, whereas \nArizona\u2019s peaks spread across both 2020 and 2021 \n(as depicted in Figure 6).\nFigure 4. Topic prevalence in legislators\u2019 unreliable tweets, by party. Horizontal dashed lines indicate that the specific party talks \nsignificantly more about the particular topic at 95% confidence intervals.8\n Y. C. TAI ET AL.\nTo understand the content of unreliable tweets, we \nsampled 50 tweets in peak days, characterized by the \nhighest absolute number of unreliable tweets, from \nArizona, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Tennessee. We \nfound that topics varied. Arizona\u2019s unreliable tweets \ncovered a range of topics (the border crisis, AZ\u2019s \nelection audit/election fraud, critical race theory/ \nBLM, abortion, COVID-19 measures/leak theory), \nas did Pennsylvania\u2019s (abortion, PA\u2019s election audit, \nand COVID-19 vaccines/leak theory). Texas\u2019 unreli -\nable tweets (covering topics like COVID-19/anti- \nFauci, abortion, and BLM/police defunding) differed \nfrom Tennessee\u2019s unreliable tweets (which covered \npolicy funding, BLM/1619 projects, and election \nfraud/China\u2019s intervention).\nRecent scholarship on state politics has identified a \ntrend toward nationalization (e.g. Burke, 2021 ; \nZingher & Richman, 2019 ). This phenomenon entails \na diminishing prominence of the characteristics that \ntraditionally define \u201clocal politics.\u201d Nationalization \ncan be attributed to various factors, including top- \ndown influences stemming from nationally consoli -\ndated parties and their alliances, bottom-up behaviors \nof average voters that align with national political \ntrends, or both (Grumbach, 2022 ; Hopkins, 2018 ). \nOur results regarding this trend are mixed. In tweets \ncontaining unreliable URLs, state legislators discuss \nhighly nationalized issues. However, the ebb and flow \nof attention within states tends to coincide with state- specific events and discussions. For example, a flurry \nof tweets about the 2020 election audit in Arizona in \nlate June 2021 arose as the ballot recounting effort in \nArizona was completed (Bydlak et al., 2021 ). The \npatterns we identify are consistent with the process \nby which the national conversation determines the \ntopics most subject to infiltration by misinformation, \nand state-specific events drive the timing of misinfor -\nmation gaining broad traction.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present an example of extensive \ndescriptive work that focuses on a highly salient but \nunderstudied topic \u2013 the dissemination of misinfor -\nmation by elected officials. There is considerable need \nfor such research in the rapidly growing field of digital \npolitics (Munger, Guess, & Hargittai, 2021 ). We iden-\ntified unreliable tweets posted by U.S. state legislators \nbetween 2020-01-01 and 2021-12-31. The temporal \ntrends of tweets diverged from the percentage of \nunreliable tweets. Although the general trend of tweets \nremained relatively stable, the percentage of unreliable \ntweets fluctuated, with variations observed across par-\nties. Our strongest finding is that Republicans share a \nlarger percentage of unreliable URLs than do \nDemocrats \u2013 a result that is robust to correction for \npotential bias in the MBFC\u2019s sampling of URLs.\nFigure 5. Percentage of unreliable tweets across states, 2020-01-01 to 2021-12-31.JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS\n 9\nThrough the implementation of structural topic \nmodeling, we also identified the key topics discussed \nwithin unreliable tweets, encompassing COVID-19, \n2020 election integrity, abortion, immigration, and \nmore. Republicans tended to focus on criticisms of \nBiden and Democrats\u2019 public health and economic \npolicies. These findings emphasize that elected offi-\ncials are subject to the same forces as ordinary social \nmedia users \u2013 they are prone to sharing misinforma -\ntion about subjects that are highly polarized politically \nand consistent with partisan ideology. At the state \nlevel, we found variations across states in the percen -\ntage and trends of unreliable tweets over time. Prolific \nsharers of misinformation focused on different \naspects and some topics were state specific. This result highlights yet another way in which researchers can \ntake advantage of the comparative nature of state \npolitics research.\nOur study extends the examination of asymmetric \npolitics to the state level, providing empirical evidence \nof local characteristics within the broader trend of \nnationalized politics (Grossmann & Hopkins, 2016 ; \nGrumbach, 2022 ; Hopkins, 2018 ). Given the crucial \nrole of state politics in shaping policymaking and the \ninherent threat misinformation poses to democracy, \nfuture research should investigate: 1) the factors \nunderlying the varying degrees and topical focuses of \nmisinformation dissemination across states and 2) the \ncauses and consequences of misinformation dissemi -\nnation by subnational officials on social media.\nFigure 6.

Unfortunately, between the emergence of fake news\narticles,politicalpropagandainthemedia,andalsohateful\nlanguage around the Web, it is important to be alert and\npotentially show mistrust to the providers of information.\nWe consider the following de\ufb01nition of media bias (based\non the Oxford University Press de\ufb01nition): A biased news\narticle leans towards or against a certain person or opinion\nby making one-sided, misleading or unfair judgements. An\nunbiased news article reports fair, impartial and objective\ninformation.\nMedia bias can be expressed in multiple ways (Saez-\nTrumperetal.,2013),forinstanceitcanbepresentinword\nchoices: some use the word \u201cterrorists\" vs. \u201cfreedom \ufb01ght-\ners\"or\u201cdeathtax\"1vs.\u201cinheritancetax\"2.Eventhoughsuch\nphenomena are present and can introduce bias in the news,\nreliable labelled corpora are missing to learn automatically\nthe hidden patterns in the text. In fact, while there are rel-\nevant studies in political science (Hamborg et al., 2018),\nworks that investigate the scope of bias (Groseclose and\nMilyo, 2005), how it is generated (Gentzkow and Shapiro,\n2010) and others that detect it in di\ufb00erent domains (Cohen\nand Ruths, 2013; Recasens et al., 2013; Iyyer et al., 2014),\nrelated work lacks automatic solutions for the binary clas-\nsi\ufb01cation task that classi\ufb01es mainstream news articles as\nWork partially done during a full-time summer internship at\nFactmata.\n1https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/04/24/bill-\nshorten-death-tax/\n2https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/hmrc-\ninheritance-tax-bill-rise-23-per-cent-inland-revenue-treasury\\\nprotect\\discretionary{\\char\\hyphenchar\\font}{}{}a7860626.\nhtmlbiased or unbiased.\nMoreover, we have observed opinionated news pieces that\nare not marked as \u201cOpinion\" or \u201cEditorial\" at the begin-\nningofthearticleandregardless,theyuseextremepolitical\nlanguage. For instance, an article from Right Wing News3\ndescribestheBarackObamaadministrationasawfulandan-\notheronefrom RedState4writesthatliberalsareregressive\nleftistswithmentalhealthissues,respectively.Eventhough\nthe domain names reveal a stance in this case, other exam-\nples cannot always be captured by the commonly accepted\nnewspaperstances(UmarovaandMustafaraj,2019).Hence,\nwedonotrelyonprede\ufb01nedandcommonlyacceptedslants\nof media (Patricia Aires et al., 2019), but we identify the\nimportance of human labels for news media bias detection\nand introduce them in our paper.\nDetecting politically toxic content on the Web can prepare\nand protect both news readers and online social network\ncommunitiesfrommisleadingortoxicinformation.Journal-\nists can also bene\ufb01t from such content evaluation in order\nto re\ufb02ect on their work. News aggregators, such as Google\nNews, can incorporate this feature along with others (e.g.,\nfake claim, missing citations, etc.) to facilitate the user\u2019s\nbrie\ufb01ng and remove the lenses that certain news sources\nwrite their articles from. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the \ufb01rst work that introduces news data with domain ex-\npert annotations for media bias, and compares them with\ncrowd-sourced and silver standard (automatic) annotations\nas well.\nOur goal is two-fold: to discover whether domain expertise\nisnecessaryforthistask,andtoshowwhetherdeeplearning\ntechniquescantacklesuchachallengingclassi\ufb01cationprob-\nlem even for humans.

Related Work\nThe problem of political bias in the news is originally and\nmainly tackled in political science , though lately it has\ngained attention in computer science as well.

In contrast, we aim to classify automatically\npolitical bias in traditional news articles on the article level\n(notedas spinbias (Hamborgetal.,2018)),whosetextcon-\ntains mainly subtle manifestations of political viewpoints\nthat are not encouraged as they are in political blogs.\nFurthermore,reportersoftenchangetheirnarrativeinorder\nto focus on a certain aspect, a technique that is called news\nframing.Relatedworkanalyzesspeci\ufb01ctypesofframingin\nthemedia(Morstatteretal.,2018).Anotherlineofresearch\nperforms a linguistic analysis of hyperpartisan (extremely\nbiased)andfakenewsandshowsthatthelatterareoftenpo-\nliticallybiased(Potthastetal.,2018).

To the best of our knowledge, there\nis not an existing automatic solution for classifying a news\narticle in a binary manner as biased or unbiased, mainly\ndue to the unavailability of reliable document-level labels\nby trustworthy annotators. Another reason is the noise of\nthe existing labels inferred from the commonly accepted\nstance of the newspapers (Umarova and Mustafaraj, 2019).\nThese inferred assumptions could potentially change over\ntime due to trends or new owners and reporters joining the\nnewsoutlets.Incontrast,humanlabelsaremorereliableand\npotentially explainable, e.g., by looking into the annotator\nagreement or the notes annotators leave while labeling.

These\npublisher-based labels are produced based on newspaper\ncredibility scores.\nArticlesannotatedbyjournalists. AsshowninTable1,\nthis is a rather small collection ( E). However, due to the\nexperience of the annotators in their \ufb01eld and their ability\nto identify one-sided text even in cases where bias is very\nsubtle,wehypothesizethatthisdatasetisveryvaluable.This\nsetofnewsarticlesisincludedinthenon-expertdataaswell\n(NE), in order to facilitate their comparison. The platform\nthat was used is an internal annotation tool of Factmata,\nwhere the users (eight journalists) were asked to read a\nsetofpoliticalnewsarticlesandmarkatleastonebiasedor\nunbiasedtextsnippetthatthey\ufb01ndineacharticle,following\nthe bias de\ufb01nition in Section 1. (i.e., the author is favoring\nor discriminating a certain view or person). The labelers\nwereaskedtoidentifythebiasoftheoverallarticleandthen\nhighlight the evidence for their decision. By extension, the\nannotations can be words, sentences, paragraphs or entire\ndocuments. We chose this setting, because these low-level\nannotations can give more concrete evidence of bias and\ncanbeusedasgroundtruthforexplainingourmodelinthe\nfuture (Arras et al., 2017).\nWe propagate these \ufb01ne-grained labels to the article level\nandweassumethateacharticlethatcontainsatleastonean-\nnotatedbiased(orunbiased)sentenceisbiased(orunbiased\nrespectively). We exclude articles that contain both biased\nandunbiasedmarkedtext.This\ufb01lterpruneslessthan1%of\nthe data, because the journalists were asked to not annotate\neach document exhaustively. It is obvious that regardless\nthe annotations, a biased article can contain neutral text as\nwell (and vice versa). We manually examined the excluded\narticles and we observed that sometimes in these cases the\n6Example news sources: AbcBusinessNews, Associated Press,\nAlbuquerque Journal, Baptist News Global, BBC, Breitbart,\nChicago Reporter, Circa News, CNN, CounterCurrents, Daily\nBanter, Ethics and Public Policy Center, Fair, Federalist Press,\nFox Business, Free Beacon, Greensboro, Guardian, Heavy, In-\nfoWars, Intrepid Report, In These Times, Lima Charlie News,\nMotherJones,MSNBC,NBCNews,NewsMax,NewYorkTimes,\nOccupy,OpsLens,PoliticalInsider,PoynterInstitute,RawStory,\nReal News Network, Reuters, San Jose Mercury News, Seattle\nTimes,Slate,TimesofIndia,Townhall,Upworthy,ValleyNews,\nVox, Washington Blade, 21st Century Wire, The Whim.text contains the relevant facts, but also a few opinionated\nwords that one might identify as biased. It also occurs that\nsuch articles are biased towards a given perspective, but\nthey are well-written and cite the appropriate sources. We\nregard them as unclear, but we are interested in gaining in-\nsightsintothesepotentiallycontroversialnewspiecesinour\nfuture work.\nArticles annotated by the crowd. The next dataset con-\nsists of annotations from our two crowd-sourcing tasks for\nmedia bias detection, launched in the Amazon Mechanical\nTurk7(1,979documents)andtheFigureEight8(1,014arti-\ncles)platforms.NotethattheFigureEightdatasetwasorigi-\nnallyintroducedin2018(VincentandMestre,2018),though\ninthisworkweconsiderthefulldataset,insteadofthepro-\nposed \ufb01ltered version based on an in-house evaluation of\nthedata.Inbothdatasets,thecrowdworkersevaluatedeach\narticle using a score range similar to related work (Yano et\nal., 2010), where 1 meant \u201cunbiased\" and 5 signi\ufb01ed \u201cbi-\nased\".Similarlywiththeexperts,theywereaskedtofollow\nthe media bias de\ufb01nition in Section 1. and read the full ar-\nticle before they annotate. Both the crowd and the experts\nwere asked to be mindful of bias manifestations, such as\nloaded or subjective language, opinionated text, one-sided\nclaims, or unsupported arguments. As we can observe in\nTable1,thecombinationofthesetwonon-expert( NE)data\ncollections contains almost 3,000 news articles labeled for\ntheirpoliticalbias.Wehavecombinedtheannotationsfrom\nthesetwotasksintooneuni\ufb01eddataset.Theexpertandnon-\nexpert document collections are available via our industry\ncollaborator for further details and research purposes.\n3.2. Data Preprocessing\nInthissection,weexplainhowweaggregateandtransform\nour datasets.\nArticle transformation. There are at least three annota-\ntions per article in EandNE, and the class distribution in\neachcaseisfairlybalanced.Inordertoaggregatethelabels\nof multiple annotators for each article, we apply the Dawid\nSkenealgorithm (Dawid and Skene, 1979), speci\ufb01cally an\noptimized variation of it (Sinha et al., 2018). This model\nproduces one \ufb01nal label for each document and it improves\non simpler methods, because it considers the annotators\u2019\nbias and competence. It is assumed that each worker corre-\nspondstoaconfusionmatrixthatshowsthejointprobability\ndistributionovercorrectandreportedlabels.Thecorrectla-\nbels are initialized with the Majority Vote method, which\noutputsthelabelthatwasreportedmostoften.Fora N-way\nclassi\ufb01cation task (in our case N= 2), a workerwand a\n7https://www.mturk.com/\n8https://www.\ufb01gure-eight.com/\n1271data instance d, the Dawid-Skene assumption is as follows:\nP(Xwd=l) =p\u0003\nwlxd\nwhereXwdistherandomvariablethatmodelsthereported\nlabellof annotator wand for the document d, and allXwd\nare mutually independent. After generating one annotation\nperarticle,westillfacethechallengethat Econtainsbinary\nlabels, but NEcorresponds to a multi-class classi\ufb01cation\nsetting. For this purpose, we binarize the non-expert data,\nfollowingtheliteratureinsimilartaskswhere\ufb01vestarranges\nwere used (Maas et al., 2011). We take into account only\nthe two ends of the scale, namely only the highly polarized\ntext.Thatis,weconsiderthearticleswithbiasscore1and2\nasunbiased (negativeclass), andthe oneswithbias score4\nand 5 as biased (positive class).

Hence with this setting, our training data contain\n\u201cdiverse\" articles, whose labels might or might not be the\nsame inEandNE.\n4. Label Quality Assessment\nIn this section, we describe our annotation analysis as an\ne\ufb00ort to determine the quality of the datasets and improve\nour classi\ufb01cation results later on.\n4.1. Per-dataset Agreement\nAs a \ufb01rst step to examine the quality of the human labels,\nwemeasuretheinter-annotatoragreement( ITA)withineach\ncollection.Thatis,wecalculatetheagreementfortheexpert\ndataset, the Figure Eight dataset and the MTurk dataset\nseparately. Note that for this experiment we consider the\noriginal labels in the raw data, without binarizing them\n\ufb01rst (we transform the labels as described in Section 3.2.\nonly later on for machine learning purposes). We chose\nKrippendor\ufb00\u2019s \u000bcoe\ufb03cient9, which is independent of the\nsample size, the categories, and numbers of annotators and\nmeasurement levels. Krippendor\ufb00\u2019s \u000bfor a text document\nis de\ufb01ned as follows:\n\u000b=pa\u0000pe\n1\u0000pe\n9https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendor\ufb00%27s_alphaDataset ITA\nCrowd workers (Figure Eight) 0.21\nExperts (Journalists) 0.59\nCrowd workers (MTurk) 0.66\nTable 2: Inter-annotator agreement (Krippendor\ufb00\u2019s \u000b) for\neach of the three humanly labeled datasets.\nwherepais the weighted percent agreement and peto the\nweightedpercentchanceagreement.Accordingtothismet-\nric, the documents and the agreement scores assigned to\nthem are statistically unrelated. When \u000b= 1, this indi-\ncates perfect reliability and when \u000b= 0, there is absence\nof reliability. Moreover, \u000bis zero when disagreements are\nsystematic and exceed what can be expected by chance.\nWe present our \ufb01ndings in Table 2. Considering how chal-\nlenging the given problem is, we observe the expert ( E)\nandMTurkannotatorstoagreesu\ufb03cientlywellinternallyin\neachcollection.However,thedataproducedviaFigureEight\nseemmoreambiguous.Chronologically,wehaveperformed\nthese annotations tasks starting with Figure Eight, continu-\ningwiththejournalistsandthencompletingourstudywith\nMTurk. That is why the di\ufb00erences in the agreement could\nbe justi\ufb01ed due to the continuous improvement of our in-\nstructions to the annotators, which potentially makes the\nannotations\u2019 quality higher at the later rounds in contrast\nto the earlier ones. For instance, we discovered that we had\nto explicitly emphasize to all annotators the di\ufb00erence be-\ntween when a reporter\u2019s words and viewpoints are toxic\nthemselves,towhenapoliticallytoxiceventorstatementis\nreported, and that we are only interested in the \ufb01rst case.\nFurthermore, the labeled dataset from Figure Eight was in-\ntroduced earlier (Vincent and Mestre, 2018), where an in-\nhousegoldstandarddatasetbasedonfact-checkingwasused\nto evaluate the workers and disqualify unreliable ones. In\nour study we consider the full dataset (thus, we see a lower\ninter-annotatoragreement),inordertomaintainamoregen-\neralized setting without constraints. Note that both crowd-\nsourced datasets use a numerical range for the bias score.\nWeleveragethenumericaldistancebetweenthelabelswhen\ncomputingthe ITA,whichisnotpossibleinabinarysetting,\ne.g., in the expert dataset. Taking this range into account,\nwe have signi\ufb01cantly improved the inter-annotator agree-\nment (from 0.14 to 0.21 in Figure Eight and from 0.44 to\n0.66 in MTurk), where both original agreement scores are\nlower than in E.\n4.2. Cross-dataset Agreement\nTo investigate whether media expertise is necessary for our\ntaskandultimatelywhichannotatorgroupismoreappropri-\nate to solve our problem, we compute the annotator agree-\nment between EandNE. For the crowd-sourced data, the\ntransformed annotations to binary labels are used as de-\nscribedinSection3.2..Weapplyawell-establishedmethod\nfor expert versus non-expert analysis in natural language\nprocessing tasks (Snow et al., 2008), using the articles that\nbothEandNEannotated. The authors calculate how (non-\n) experts perform within their community and against all\ninvolved annotators (experts and non-experts combined).\nGiven two communities AandB, for every individual ai\n1272inA, they compute the ITAwith all the individuals bjin\nBand then average the results. In the following step, they\naverageacrossallindividuals aiinordertoobtainhowwell\nAagrees with Bin total. The authors use the Pearson cor-\nrelation coe\ufb03cient ( PCC) as agreement metric. Given two\nvectors (the labels of two di\ufb00erent annotators), the com-\nputedPCChasavaluebetween1(positivecorrelation)and\n-1 (negative correlation). For our task, this agreement met-\nric is not appropriate, because not all user pairs annotated\nexactlythesameamountofarticlesandthismakes PCCnot\nworkasexpected:ityieldsahighscorewhentwoannotators\nhave many common articles, and very low score (close to\nzero)whenthesharedarticlesarefew.Wehaveworkedwith\na limited number of eight journalists, as it is cumbersome\nand expensive to obtain domain expert annotations, but the\ncrowd-sourcing platforms are generally low-cost and em-\nployaveryhighnumberofannotatorsfortheirtasks(inour\ncase eighty). Thus, the non-experts have annotated gener-\nally more articles and also more articles in common with\neach other \u2013 the latter could make their agreement scores\nmore robust. We apply a simpler method instead of PCC,\ni.e., the percentage of times that two annotators agreed on\nthe article bias.\nOur \ufb01ndings are presented in Table 3. Surprisingly, the ex-\npert community and the crowd-workers appear to agree on\nwhat isbiased and what isnot at approximately 70%of the\ntime. Thus, inthe majority of the articlesthe individuals in\nEandNErecognizetheevidenceinthetexttomarkitasbi-\nasedorunbiased.Wehypothesizethatinthemajorityofthe\nagreement cases the articles are either very obviously hy-\nperpartisan or very fair and balanced news, and potentially\nthe disagreement occurs when the article topics are more\ncontroversial and ambiguous.

Moreover, journalists do not\nagree with each other signi\ufb01cantly more than non-experts\nagreewithoneanother.Thiscouldbepotentiallyexplained\nby the fact that media bias can be a very sensitive and of-\nten times subjective topic for journalists.

Article Classi\ufb01cation\nIn this section, we describe our approach to detect media\nbiasautomaticallyandhowweapplyacurriculumlearningtechnique to improve our results.\n5.1. Baseline Method\nWe use the FastText classi\ufb01er (Joulin et al., 2016), a basic\nneural network that uses averaged n-gram features, well-\nknownforcompetitiveresultstostate-of-the-artapproaches\nfor text classi\ufb01cation. We run all our experiments with the\nlearning rate set to 0.1 and for 500 epochs.\n5.2. Curriculum Learning Method\nTo enhance our baseline model, we leverage the data qual-\nity assessment we performed in the Section 4., and apply a\ncurriculum learning approach, which is based on transfer\nlearning: Given a target classi\ufb01cation task T1and an exter-\nnal oneT2, transfer learning techniques that solve T1could\nleverage information derived by T2in di\ufb00erent ways. For\ninstance, one can use word embeddings or losses of output\nlayers trained on T2, or take an entire network designed for\nT2and train it on T1to improve the classi\ufb01cation perfor-\nmance. Unlike traditional transfer learning approaches, our\nexternal information is not provided by another classi\ufb01er,\ndataset or task. In contrast, it is derived by the humans that\nshare our mission to \ufb01ght misinformation on the Web and\ncontributetoourtaskbylabelingourpoliticalnewsarticles.\nUltimately,usingtheirwisdom,weaimtoguideourclassi-\n\ufb01er during training with some initial data instances (\u201ceasy\nto learn examples\") and perform better in the next steps.\nWe follow the de\ufb01nition of curriculum as introduced by\nBengio et al. (Bengio et al., 2009), i.e., sorting the training\nexamplesfrom\u201ceasy\"to\u201cdi\ufb03cult\"andintroducingthemto\nourclassi\ufb01erinthisorderduringtrainingtoavoidconfusing\nthe learner. This method can not only speed up the train-\ningprocess,butitcanimprovetheclassi\ufb01cationresultsand\nmodel generalization as well. The authors perform experi-\nmentsonshaperecognitionandlanguagemodelingintheir\nwork. For the latter task (which is more relevant to ours),\nthecurriculumlearningstrategywastogrowthevocabulary\nsizegradually,i.e.,startingfromthemostpopularwordsina\nWikipediacorpusandthenconsideringmorewordsineach\ntraining pass.\nOur learning di\ufb03culty de\ufb01nition. In our proposed ap-\nproach, we leverage our previous agreement analysis and\nbuild a curriculum that stems from the quality of the ar-\nticle annotations. That is, we compute the inter-annotator\nagreement( ITA)inEandNEwiththeKrippendor\ufb00\u2019salpha\ncoe\ufb03cient as shown in Section 4.1. We consider the agree-\nment score to be the learning di\ufb03culty of an article. This\nchoice is based on the assumption that an \u201ceasy\" article is\nan article that causes very low to no disagreement between\nits annotators regarding its bias. We hypothesize that these\nnewspiecesareeitherveryobjectiveorverysubjective,and\nhence this makes the decisions of the annotators simpler.\nOn the other side, newspaper articles with high label dis-\nagreementmayindicatecontroversyandpotentiallycontain\na mixture of facts and opinionated words. We leave these\ndi\ufb03cult-to-learnexamplestobegiventoourmodelafterthe\nclearerexampleshavebeenintroduced.Wesplitthetraining\ndata into 10 parts, namely we \ufb01rst consider the top-10% of\nthe documents with the highest agreement score, then the\ntop-20% and so on and so forth. We build a classi\ufb01er with\n1273each of these data chunks and every time we load the latest\ncalculated weights from the previously trained model. We\nthen\ufb01tthecurrenttrainingsetandpredictthemediabiasof\nour test set.\nOur technique is also similar to the stochastic curriculum\nlearningde\ufb01nition(Weinshalletal.,2018),whichisavaria-\ntionofstochasticgradientdescent,wherethemodelimports\ntraining data instances gradually based on their di\ufb03culty\nscore.Inthiscase,theauthorsde\ufb01netheircurriculumwith-\nout the presence of human knowledge.

Sincetheannotatoragreementresults\nfor the Figure Eight dataset were not satisfactory, we use\nonly the MTurk dataset for the rest of our experiments.\nThus,whenwerefertothenon-expertannotations,onlythe\ndatasetfromMTurkisconsidered.Wehaveactuallytrained\nour model on the Figure Eight dataset and the performance\nwassimilartoarandomdecision\u2013wedonotreportthede-\ntailedresultshere.Hence,weconcludedthatitisnecessary\nfor the inter-annotator agreement to be at least 60% for our\ntask and the Figure Eight labels did not achieve it.

As mentioned earlier in Section 3.2., our\ntest set is balanced and it consists of a random sample of\nthenewsarticlesforwhichboththedomainexpertsandthe\ncrowd workers agreed on their labels in order to eliminate\nnoise. After removing these 237 articles from the training\ndata, there are 759 articles in Eand 1,805 in NEremain-\ning for our model to learn ( Pdoes not exhibit an overlap\nwithEandNE).

Note that even though the con-\nsensusinMTurkishigherthanintheexpertdata(seeTable\n2), the prediction power of MTurk is lower. Thus, higher\ninter-annotator agreement does not automatically lead to\nhigher classi\ufb01cation results in this case.

Bias Detection Requires Expert Curriculum\nWe compare our proposed solution to di\ufb00erent methods in\nTable6.Inordertocon\ufb01rmtheusefulnessofanexpertcur-\nriculum,wecompareourapproachwithan anti-curriculum\napproach. Namely, we rank our training data instances in\nan ascending order of their learning di\ufb03culty as de\ufb01ned in\nSection 5.2.. In this way, we introduce the most ambiguous\nand hard to learn examples to our classi\ufb01er \ufb01rst, and then\nproceed with the rest of the training data, completing the\nlearningprocesswiththeeasiestexamples.WeshowinTa-\nble 6 that, as expected, this \u201creverse\" curriculum technique\n(E_rc)worsenstheresultsofourexpert-basedmodelsignif-\nicantly.Inaddition,itproducesalmostthesameoutcomefor\nthe non-expert data ( NE_rc). We hypothesize that for this\nreason the labels of the crowd are not of the same potential\nastheonesbyjournalists.Thatis,thenon-expertconsensus\nfor a given article does not provide additional intuition or\nhelp to a media bias detector.\nIn Figure 1 we show how our precision increases while we\nincrease the training set size using E_c,E_rc,NE_cand\nNE_rc.Weobservethat E_coutperformstherestduringthe\nwhole training process, and it starts approximately at the\nsame precision value as NE_cdoes.

Quality is More Important than Quantity\nWe perform an additional comparison of our approach to a\nmodel trained with automatically labelled articles for their\nmediabias.Asbrie\ufb02ymentionedinSection3.,weconsider\narticles with inferred publisher-based bias from a Semeval\ncompetition (Kiesel et al., 2019). In this dataset ( P), each\ndocument is marked as hyperpartisan (or not) if the news\nFigure1:Achievedprecisionbyourmodeltrainedwithex-\npertcurriculum( E_c),non-expertcurriculum( NE_c),com-\npared to the respective reverse settings, E_rcandNE_rc.\nWetrainincrementallywithstep=10%,startingwiththetop\n10% of the training set that is the \u201ceasiest\" ( c) or \u201chardest\"\n(rc) to learn.\noutlet where the article originates from is considered ex-\ntremelypoliticallybiased(ornot).AsshowninTable1,this\ndatasetisconsiderablylargerthanours.Notethatafewhun-\ndredsofannotatedarticlesbythecrowdwereincludedinthe\nSemeval training set by the organizers, which we removed\nfromP,because weaim tocompareour smallmanually la-\nbeled training datasets to a massive silver standard dataset.\nThecomparativeresultsareshownatthebottominTable6.\nIt is evident that small amounts of human labels and do-\nmain expertise are more essential for our task than the size\nof training data, which is not true for every machine learn-\ning problem. Large amounts of weak labels are su\ufb03cient\nforothertasks,suchassentimentclassi\ufb01cation(Deriuetal.,\n2017). Other similar works that miss correct labels include\ntracking and matching individuals in images with transfer\nlearning (Peng et al., 2016). The outcome can also be jus-\nti\ufb01ed, because we consider the Semeval dataset to address\na slightly di\ufb00erent task, namely the prediction of the news-\npaper\u2019s bias and not the article\u2019s (similarly to Aires et al.,\nwhere domain level labels are used (Patricia Aires et al.,\n2019)). It is expected that the Semeval dataset can achieve\ncompetitiverecallvalues(almost90%)duetoitsverylarge\nsize, but the precision is still su\ufb00ering from the uncertain\nqualityinthetrainingset.Ourmanualqualitativeexamina-\ntionshowsthatthereissigni\ufb01cantnoiseinSemevalthedata,\nwhich is on par with the results (60\u201370% classi\ufb01cation ac-\ncuracy) of recent studies based on this dataset (Saleh et al.,\n2019). For instance, every news article by Pjmediais con-\nsideredhyperpartisaninthisdataset,butnotallarticlesfrom\nthis news source in the MTurk dataset are labeled as such.\nNotethatalthoughourtestsetissmall,aftercomparingour\napproach with the classi\ufb01er trained on P, we consider our\nresultsindeedsigni\ufb01cant.Thatis,weassumethatifourtest\nset was easy to classify, then the baseline with the Semeval\ndata would be able to outperform or at least compete with\nour proposed expert-based approach.\n6.4. Qualitative Analyses Bring Further Insights\nInthissectionweanalyzetheerrorsofourexpertcurriculum\nmodel (E_c) and also apply it to a new dataset.\n1275False predictions. Approximately 9% of our predictions\nare incorrect. Over 50% of the articles that are misclassi-\n\ufb01ed contain loaded language . Heavy words can be either\nthe journalist\u2019s (an article calls Donald Trump \u201cmisogy-\nnist\") or could describe a sensitive topic (the same article\nis discussing \u201csexual assault\"). Hence, sentiment detection\nalone would be a rather inconclusive approach, because\nsuch words are not always chosen by the journalist, but are\noftencontainedincitedtext(thisisoneofthemultiplerea-\nsons that sentiment analysis performs poorly on the news\ncorpora (Hamborg et al., 2018)). Moreover, in 60% of the\nerrors thearticles containboth factsand opinions. Someof\nthem are essentially opinion pieces with factual informa-\ntion and veri\ufb01ed sources, but are disguised columns , i.e.,\nthereisnodeclarationofthisinanypartofthenewsarticle\npage.Eventhoughtheyareannotatedcorrectlyandtheyare\nalmost all classi\ufb01ed correctly by the model, there is still a\nvery small set that is very hard to classify automatically.

Among these errors, over 85% of\nthem are false positives and the rest are false negatives.\nSucharticlesgenerallyreportapolitician\u2019sstatementorac-\ntion, and at the same time describe them with endorsement\nor criticism. An example is the article of MSNBC, where\nthe journalist describes Michelle Obama\u2019s standpoints on\nDonald Trump\u2019s taped comments about women. This arti-\ncle is a representative error, because it has somewhat sub-\njective tone (\u201cMichelle Obama slammed Donald Trump\"),\ndiscusses a sensitive subject and it is about two politicians.\nA very challenging task for our model is to distinguish the\npresence of bias when the article is about very sensitive\ntopics, e.g., incidents of racism, sexual assault, terrorism,\nbrutalcrimes.Theseerrors(13%)areallfalsepositivepre-\ndictions, which indicates that loaded language can some-\ntimes lead the model to confuse tragic news stories with\nbiased reporting. Note that this is not a rule, because we\nalso classify relevant unbiased articles correctly (e.g., an\narticleinCircaNews aboutthedomesticterrorismattackin\nCharlottesville was a true negative). Furthermore, in about\n10% of all errors, the article author is using \ufb01rst-person\npronouns, which could be discovered with claim/argument\nmining.First-personexpressionscouldserveasanindicator\nthat an article contains the author\u2019s/newspaper\u2019s subjective\npoint of view (G\u00e9n\u00e9reux and Santini, 2007) or that it is an\neditorial (Bonyadi, 2010).\nResults on independent dataset. We additionally apply\nourmodeltoasmallrecentsetofnewsarticlesfromtheNew\nYork Times. We use the newspaper\u2019s Most Popular API to\nget the most read articles in mid August 2019. Out of the\n17 articles in this test set, our model classi\ufb01ed 13 as unbi-\nased(includinganopinionarticlethatwemissed),andonly\nfour of them were classi\ufb01ed as biased. Among these four,\none article is an opinion piece and another one is self-help\nguide giving relevant professional opinions, which justi\ufb01es\nthe decision of our model. The other two articles are about\nbrutal crimes in Afghanistan and New York, respectively,and we consider them falsely classi\ufb01ed as biased. The \ufb01rst\narticle about a suicide bomber that killed dozens of people\nin the capital city of Afghanistan describes the tragic event\nwith factual reporting. However, the language is somewhat\nloaded (mainly due to the nature of the news story) and\nthe title is described by one commenter as too dramatic.\nSimilarly to our error analysis of our own test set, we see\nthatsuchtragiceventreportsarehardertoclassifycorrectly.\nMoreover,inthearticleaboutacrimecommittedbyapolice\no\ufb03cerintheNewYorkregion,weobserveonlyfactualand\nfair reporting. Thus we regard this as false positive predic-\ntionaswell.AccordingtoMediaBiasFactCheck10,theNew\nYorkTimesisahighlyfactualandreliableunbiasedsource,\nthat occasionally publishes articles with loaded language\nthatmoderatelyfavorsliberalviews.We\ufb01ndourqualitative\nstudy to be on par with MediaBiasFactCheck, because our\nmodel labels the majority of the articles unbiased, captures\nalmost all the opinion pieces (which are explicitly declared\nand do not belong to our focus) and understandably mis-\nclassi\ufb01es the articles on hard-to-classify topics due to the\npresence of emotional words.\n7. Summary and Future Work\nIn this paper, we tackle the problem of media bias detec-\ntion in the news. We introduce two novel humanly labeled\narticle sets and use them to build very competitive deep\nlearning models for our task. Our work is the \ufb01rst to con-\nsider and compare human labels (by domain experts and\ncrowd-source workers) to automatically derived labels for\nmediabiasdetection.Weclassifynewsarticlessuccessfully\nfortheirbiasandalsogivehumanknowledgetoourmodelas\nacurriculum ,byintroducingthearticlesincrementallydur-\ning training. Our conclusion is that human labels are more\nsuitable than automatic labels for this task, with both mod-\nels trained on crowd and expert data respectively achieving\nhigherF-1scores.Theexpertknowledgecanbeusedinthe\nformofacurriculumtoboosttheclassi\ufb01cationperformance\nfurther,e.g.,amodeltrainedwiththetop-20%articleswith\nthe highest consensus among experts can already achieve\n80% precision. Moreover, we show that the inter-annotator\nagreementscoreforourtaskshouldbeatleast60%andthat\ntheamountoftrainingdataisnotasin\ufb02uentialasitsquality.\nWe also contribute further insights with our manual error\ninterpretation and discover challenging corner cases to be\naware when annotating or classifying new media bias. In\nthe future, we aim to shed more light into our ambiguous\nhuman annotations (articles marked with score=3/5 in the\nnon-expertdataandarticleswithbiasedandunbiasedsnip-\npets in the expert data). This set of articles could become a\nvery di\ufb03cult and interesting test set for our task, or a train-\ning set for controversy detection in the news. Moreover, we\nplan to experiment with stricter learning di\ufb03culty scores,\ne.g.,theglobalannotatoragreementinallcollectionsinstead\nof the internal agreement within each collection. We intuit\nthat this could result to an even more robust and powerful\ncurriculum.\n10https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/\n12768. Bibliographical References\nAhmed, A. and Xing, E. P.

Kennedy School of  \nGovernment.  \n\n \n \n \n Facebook\u2019s downranking interventions against groups and websites that repeatedly share misinformation 2 \n \n\u25cf For groups repeatedly sharing misinformation, we observed a significant reduction in engagement \nper post of 16% to 31% depending on the methodology used to identify them. We did not observe \na substantial change of the posting behavior in terms of posts volume and proportion of low -\nquality links shared wi thin posts, and the total engagement generated by repeat offender groups \ndoes not decrease over time.  \n\u25cf Facebook users\u2019 engagement per article from websites with two or more articles marked as false \nby fact checkers  decreased by  about 45%, suggesting that posts containing a link to these websites \nwere downranked by Facebook. Websites display similar patt erns of total engagement generated \non Facebook and Twitter, so one cannot conclude that Facebook\u2019s policy leads to reducing their \nengagement in the long run.  \n\u25cf The present study highlights the importance of accessing platforms\u2019 data to enable external \nagents  (e.g., researchers, journalists, etc.) to successfully monitor and audit misinformation \ninterventions and their impact.  \n \nImplications  \n \nThe spread of misinformation on online platforms is a growing concern in society, and experts have \nincreasingly highlighted platforms\u2019 responsibility in addressing the issue ( Misinformation, conspiracy \ntheories, and \u201cinfodemics, \u201d 2020). In particular, Facebook posts from \u201cmisinformation \u201d news providers \nhave been shown to receive consistently higher enga gement than \u201cnon-misinformation \u201d (Edelson et al., \n2021). To tackle misinformation, Facebook has announced many policies and interventions over the past \nfew years (see Rosen, 2021).  \nContextual labels and banners applied to misleading posts have been studied  in previous research \n(e.g., Sanderson et al., 2021), but little is known about the effectiveness of interventions consisting in \nremoving or downranking content from unreliable sources (Saltz et al., 2021). To fill this gap, the present \nresearch investigat es the downranking intervention that Facebook has introduced in these terms:  \u201cPages, \ngroups, accounts and websites that repeatedly share misinformation will face some restrictions, including \nhaving their distribution reduced\u201d  (Meta, n.d.). \u201cGroups \u201d refer t o discussion -based environments on \nFacebook typically organized around one topic, while \u201cpages \u201d refer to public -facing Facebook channels \nused by a publisher to share updates (Facebook, n.d.). Facebook ranks each  post in users\u2019 news feed by \nassigning a rele vance score to it. A high rank leads to a high likelihood of the post appearing at the top of \na user\u2019s news feed (Lyons, 2018). By downranking its posts, Facebook can make an entire page or group \nless visible. A website\u2019s visibility can also be reduced by downranking all the Facebook posts containing a \nlink to it.  \nTh\u00e9ro and Vincent (2022) analyzed engagement data and showed that the engagement on posts from \nFacebook pages temporarily decreased by about 50% after they shared misinformation twice, but that \ndrop in engagement was not observed among Facebook groups over the 2019 \u20132020 period. This article \ninvestigates the implementation of Facebook\u2019s \u201creduced distribution \u201d policy on groups, as it has come \ninto force recently, and on websites, as it has not yet be en studied.  \nFacebook announced the enforcement of a \u201creduced distribution \u201d policy for groups in September \n2020 (Alison, 2020) and added groups as a target of the policy to their help center during the spring of \n2021 (see Business Help Center, 2021 February, in which Facebook only mentions \u201dpages and websites ,\u201d \nnot groups), but the exact date of its enforcement is not publicly available. We were able to track when \nthe policy was first tested and when it was more widely deployed by searching fo r messages posted by \ngroups mentioning that their distribution was reduced. Platforms\u2019 announcements of misinformation -\nrelated interventions often lack details on how and when the measures are exactly implemented \n \n \n \n Vincent; Th\u00e9ro; Shabayek  3 \n \n   \n(Krishnan et al., 2021). Our methods for se arching for accounts speaking about a specific restriction can \nbe generalized to other policies and platforms.  \nWe identified websites that repeatedly shared misinformation between 2019 and 2021 according to  \nfact checkers  partnering  with Facebook. We observ ed a significant decrease in the number of Facebook \nengagements per article published by websites that had shared two or more URLs flagged as false in less \nthan 90 days, placing them under a presumptive \u201crepeat offender\u201d status, with a median decrease of 4 1% \nto 47% in engagement depending on the fact -checking dataset used. We observe that Facebook groups, \nwhen they are under a presumptive repeat offender status, saw their engagement per post decrease by \na median of 31%. Groups for which an admin posted that  they were under a \u201creduced distribution\u201d status \nsaw a median decrease of their engagement per post of 16%. Based on simple metrics, these groups do \nnot appear to change their posting behavior after receiving a notification from Facebook. In particular, \nthe median share of posts containing a link to a website rated as low or very -low credibility by \nmediabiasfactcheck.com (MBFC) is around 10% both before and after the notification. Further qualitative \nresearch is needed to get a better understanding of how w ebsites, groups , and pages react to being \nsubjected to Facebook\u2019s misinformation interventions.  \nWhile we observed a substantial reduction in engagement per post in the short term, we observed \nthat the total number of engagements generated per day on conte nt from these websites/groups does \nnot decrease in the long run. Even though it is short -lived, the magnitude of the reduction resulting from \nthis policy is substantial. For reference, Guess et al. (2020) showed that providing \u201ctips\u201d on how to spot \nfalse n ews to social media users in the United States improved their discernment between mainstream \nand false news headlines by 26.5%. Bak -Coleman et al. (2022) formalized a model of viral misinformation \nspread and by applying it to a corpus of misinformation eve nts, they estimate that combining several \npolicies such as fact -checking, behavioral nudges , and banning repeat offenders could reduce the \nprevalence of misinformation in users\u2019 feeds by an estimated 50%. It should be noted that groups can \neasily evade the  consequences of Facebook\u2019s policy, given that an admin deleting the offending content \nis enough to cancel the strike against the group (Facebook\u2019s message to admins indeed reads: \u201cYou can \ndelete false information to help restore your group\u2019s distribution .\u201d See Figure 1).  \nAt a time when platforms are announcing new interventions to tackle online misinformation ( Yadav, \n2021) and a large proportion of their users report having been exposed to such interventions (Saltz et al., \n2021), there is a critical n eed to further monitor their implementation and to assess their impact, \neffectiveness , and acceptability.  \nReducing the algorithmic amplification of content from known misinformation sources and promoting \nmore reliable sources appears to be a promising appr oach to tackling misinformation at scale. However, \nthe rules put in place by Facebook could be gamed by recurrent publishers of misinformation as group \nadmins can simply delete offending posts, and Facebook page or website owners can have their strike \nremo ved by appending a \u201ccorrection \u201d to their post. To avoid these shortcomings, we recommend that \nFacebook take s into account these removed strikes, as a half -strike for instance. In addition, Facebook\u2019s \n\u201crepeat offender\u201d policy considers the strikes of an acc ount over a short period of 90 days. To better \nregulate the spread of misinformation in the long run, the company should consider the behavior of actors \nover longer periods: for instance by changing their \u201c2 strikes in 90 days \u201d policy into a \u201c2 strikes in 180 \ndays \u201d policy and/or by extending it into a \u201c2n strikes in 180n days \u201d policy, so an account would also be a \nrepeat offender if it shared four false news in 360 days and so on, which would take into account all \ninformation available about the account\u2019s p ast behavior.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Facebook\u2019s downranking interventions against groups and websites that repeatedly share misinformation 4 \n \nFindings  \n \nFinding 1: Facebook started enforcing its repeat offender policy against groups in February 2021.  \n \nIn September 2020, Facebook announced it would start enforcing its repeat offender policy on groups. \nOur first goal was to verify when and how this new regulation was implemented. To identify repeat \noffender groups, our first approach was to search for posts that shared a message or a screenshot of \nFacebook\u2019s notification, which reads \u201cYour group's distribution is reduced due to false information.\u201d  We \nidentified 100 posts, whose publication dates are displayed on the bottom panel of Figure 1. Most posts \nwere published after February 23, 2021 . However, there are three outliers before this date, corresponding \nto three groups clai ming to be under reduced distribution on June 27, July 27, and July 28, 2020. This \nsuggests that Facebook may have A/B tested its measure on a subset of groups in the summer of 2020, \nbefore announcing the policy publicly in the fall of 2020, and starting t o enforce it at scale in February \n2021.  \n \n \n \nFigure 1. (Top panels) Screenshot of two posts found when searching for \u201cYour group's distribution is reduced due to false \ninformation\u201d displaying the notification Facebook sends to group admins. (Bottom panel ) Dates of the 100 Facebook posts \nfrom groups complaining to be under \u201creduced distribution.\u201d Each black bar corresponds to the date on which a Facebook \ngroup admin published a post similar to the examples in the top panels.  \n \nFinding 2: Facebook groups rep eatedly sharing misinformation had their engagement per post reduced in \n2021.  \n \nIf Facebook decreased the visibility of a group\u2019s posts in users\u2019 news feed s, we expected  this measure to \nbe quantifiable by metrics related to the group\u2019s posts views. But sinc e we did not have access to the \ncount of views, we used as a proxy the engagement per post, defined as the sum of user reactions to a \n\n \n \n \n Vincent; Th\u00e9ro; Shabayek  5 \n \n   \npost: likes, shares, and comments. To measure the policy\u2019s effect, we calculated the percent  change in \nengagement duri ng a 30 -day period after minus before the notification date. As an example, the Facebook \ngroup \u201cWoke Shit \u201d shared a reduced distribution notification from Facebook on April 23, 2021 (Figure 1). \nWhen we compared their engagement per post during a 30 -day per iod before and after this date, the \npercent change was -29% (Figure 2 , top panel).   \nFor all groups, the median percent change between the two periods is -16%, and a Wilcoxon test \nindicated that the percent changes are significantly different from zero, W =  1117, p = 0.010 (Figure 2, \nbottom panels). Groups declaring to be reduced thus exhibit a modest decrease in engagement on their \nposts. This is a self -selecting set of groups who chose to speak publicly about Facebook\u2019s policy; it might \nnot be representati ve of all groups.  \n \n \nFigure 2. (Top panel) Engagement per post for one example Facebook group. The value on the y -axis is the sum of likes, \nshares and comments on posts published by the \u2018Woke Shit\u2019 group on a given date (x -axis). (Bottom panels) Change in \nengagement during a 30 -day period after versus before the notification date for groups claiming to be under \u201creduced \ndistribution\u201d. (Left) The value on the y -axis corresponds to the median number of engagement per post (half of the groups \nhave an  average engagement per post below/above that value). (Right) The value on the x -axis for each dot represents the \npercent change in engagement for a given group; the y -axis is randomly generated.  Here and in the following figures, the \nerror bars show the m edian in the middle and its 90% confidence interval (see Appendix A for details).   \n \nTo see if we could reproduce this result with a different set of groups, we used another approach to \nidentify groups repeatedly sharing misinformation. We used a dataset of  fact-checked URLs obtained from \nScience Feedback, one of Facebook\u2019s fact -checking partners, and listed all the URLs they flagged as false. \nWe then identified all the Facebook public posts sharing a link to one of these URLs using CrowdTangle \nand identifie d 138 public groups that repeatedly shared false information in 2021.  \nA Facebook staff member indicated to a journalist that: \u201cTwo strikes in 90 days places an account into \n\u2018repeat offender\u2019 status, which can lead to a reduction in distribution of the acco unt\u2019s content\u201d  (Solon, \n2020).  In this article, we considered that each false URL resulted in a strike against the account and used \nthe \u201ctwo strikes in 90 days \u201d rule to identify  repeat offender periods. A repeat offender period is thus \n\n \n \n \n Facebook\u2019s downranking interventions against groups and websites that repeatedly share misinformation 6 \n \ndefined as any given time in which a group has shared two or more \u201cfalse news links \u201d over the past 90 \ndays (see Figure 3, top panel for one example).  \nWe calculated the percent change in engagement between the repeat offender periods and the rest \nof the time for each of the 138  new groups identified. The median percent change between the two \nperiods is -31%, and a Wilcoxon test indicated that the values are significantly different from zero, W = \n784, p = 1.5 x 10\u221217 (Figure 3, bottom panels). Our observations confirm that Fa cebook has implemented \nits repeat offender policy on groups in 2021 while it wasn\u2019t enforced in 2019 \u20132020 (Th\u00e9ro  & Vincent, \n2022).  \n \n \nFigure 3. (Top panel) Engagement per post for one example Facebook group. Each red mark below the x -axis corresponds to \nthe date on which the group has shared a URL marked as false by a fact -checker. (Bottom panels) Change in engagement \nbetween the repeat offender and normal periods for groups  identified using Science Feedback data.  \n \nFinding 3: The Facebook groups that recei ved a Facebook notification have not substantially changed their \nposting behavior in terms of volume and quality of content.  \n \nWe wished to investigate whether accounts that are being targeted by a downranking policy change their \nposting behavior. Here we l imited the analysis to the 81 groups that had shared a post mentioning the \nFacebook reduced distribution notification, because receiving and speaking about such a notification \nindicates that the group admins are well aware that they have been targeted by t he intervention.  \n We studied the change of two simple metrics before and after the notification date: (i) the volume of \nposted content , and ( ii) the share of posts containing a link to low or very -low credibility websites \naccording to the MBFC Factual Reporting metric (see Appendix B for details). We found that the median \nnumber of posts per day over 30 days before the notification is 14.4, aga inst a median of 11.9 posts per \nday during the 30 -day period after the notification. A Wilcoxon test shows that this change is not \nsignificant at the 5% level but is significant at the 10% level, W = 1249.5, p = 0.0755. Furthermore, we \nfound that the media n of the proportion of links redirecting to low credibility websites (for posts \ncontaining a link) is 10% both before and after the notification date, W  = 990, p =  0.7376.  \n\n \n \n \n Vincent; Th\u00e9ro; Shabayek  7 \n \n   \nHence, there doesn't seem to be a substantial change in posting behavior when consi dering the \nposting volume and the credibility of websites shared. Further qualitative research is needed to better \nunderstand the behavior of agents targeted by misinformation policy, such as whether they develop \nevasion strategies.  \n \nFigure 4. Change in number of posts per day (Top panels) and share of low/very -low credibility links in posts (Bottom panels), \nduring a 30 -day period after versus before the notification date for groups claiming to be under \u201creduced distribution .\u201d \n \nFinding 4: Websites repeate dly sharing misinformation had their Facebook engagement per article \nreduced in 2019 \u20132021.  \n \nThe implementation of Facebook\u2019s repeat offender policy was tested on groups above and on pages by \nTh\u00e9ro & Vincent (2022), but it has not been verified on websites yet. We used BuzzSumo to retrieve the \nFacebook engagement per article for a given website. The Condor dataset (Messing et al., 2021) lists URLs \nshared more than 100 times that were flagged as false by one of Facebook\u2019s fact -checking partners. A \nwebsite was  considered a repeat offender when fact -checkers marked at least two of its articles as false \nwithin a 90 -days period (Figure  5, top panel).  \nThe median engagement per article for the 275 websites is 505 during the repeat offender periods, \nand 1,133 during the normal periods. We calculated the percent change in engagement between the \nrepeat offender periods and the normal periods for each of the 275 websites that published at least one \narticle during each period. The median percent change is -41%, and a Wilc oxon test indicated that the \nvalues are significantly different from zero, W = 10703, p = 3.7 x 10\u221210 (Figure 5, middle panel). So, we did \nobserve a significant decrease in engagement per article in line with Facebook\u2019s stated policy.  \nTo verify the reproducibility of this result, we used the Science Feedback fact -checking dataset. While \nthe Condor dataset only contains URLs shared at least 100 times on Facebook, the Science Feedback \ndataset contains URLs regardless of their share number , which allowed us to identify websites with a \n\n \n \n \n Facebook\u2019s downranking interventions against groups and websites that repeatedly share misinformation 8 \n \nsmaller audience. The median engagement per article for the 168 newly identified websites was 21 during \nthe repeat offender periods, and 41 during the normal periods. For each website, we calculated the \npercen t change in engagement between the repeat offender and the normal periods. The median percent \nchange is -47%, significantly different from zero, W = 4221, p = 5.2 x 10\u22126 (Figure 5, bottom panel).  \n \n \n \nFigure 5. (Top panel) Facebook engagement per article for one example website. (Middle panels) Change in engagement \nbetween the repeat offender and normal periods for websites  identified using Condor data. (Bottom panels) Same \nrepresentation for websites identified using Science Feedback data.  \n \nFindin g 5: We did not observe a decrease in the overall engagement generated on content shared by repeat \noffenders in the long run.  \n \nTo investigate the long -term impact of Facebook\u2019s policy, we studied the daily total number of \nengagements on the content of repe at offender accounts. For groups, their total number of engagements \ndisplayed no trend throughout 2021 (Figure 6 top panel). This suggests that Facebook\u2019s policy does not \nresult in an overall decrease in engagement on content shared in groups repeatedly sh aring \nmisinformation.  \n\n \n \n \n Vincent; Th\u00e9ro; Shabayek  9 \n \n   \nAlongside Facebook engagement per article, Buzzsumo also provided us with the Twitter shares per \narticle (the number of tweets and retweets sharing the article). The total engagement on posts/tweets \nsharing a link to repeat offender w ebsites displays an increase until mid -2020 and a decrease until the \nend of 2021 (Figure 6, bottom panel). This finding could have suggested the decrease was a consequence \nof Facebook\u2019s policy against misinformation websites; however, the fact that Twitter  engagement data \ndisplayed the same pattern suggests the decrease was caused by another factor, except if the two \nplatforms took similar actions against these websites. This is unlikely , as Twitter does not have a \npartnership with fact checkers , unlike  Facebook.  \n \n \nFigure 6. (Top panel) Daily total Facebook engagement averaged for all repeat offender groups in 2021 (union of \n\u2018CrowdTangle search\u2019 and Science Feedback datasets). (Bottom panel) Daily total Facebook and Twitter engagement \nbetween May 2019 and October 2021 averaged for the websites that shared two or more false articles (union of Condor and \nScience Feedback datasets).  \n \nMethods  \n  \nWorking hypotheses and limitations  \n \nWe used CrowdTangle, a public insights tool owned by Facebook, and BuzzSumo, a commercial database \nthat tracks the volume of user interactions on social media platforms. These two APIs provide access to \nengagement metrics (the number of likes, shares, and comments) but not to the number of views. We \ncalculated the engagement per post/article from CrowdTangle/Buzzsumo by summing the number of \ncomments, shares, and reactions (such as \u201clike,\u201d \u201clove ,\u201d and \u201cangry \u201d reactions ) that each post/article \nreceived. It s hould be noted that CrowdTangle only tracks public content (posts from pages and public \ngroups) but not content from private groups and users, while BuzzSumo aggregates for each media article \nthe engagement metrics from all Facebook accounts, both public a nd private.  \nThe methodology we used to infer the repeat offender periods could only approximately infer the \nperiods when websites or groups should be under an actual repeat offender status because the fact -\n\n \n \n \n Facebook\u2019s downranking interventions against groups and websites that repeatedly share misinformation 10 \n \nchecking datasets we used do not contain all the d ata available to Facebook. Our different methods still \nyielded results that are consistent with previous findings (Th\u00e9ro & Vincent, 2022), but the reduction \namplitudes reported here are likely to underestimate the true effect of Facebook\u2019s reduction \ninterv entions.  \nThe Condor dataset used contains URLs flagged as false between January 2018 and February 2021. \nBecause Facebook only started to visibly apply its reduction policy to groups in late February 2021, Condor \ndata could not be used to identify repeat of fender groups.  \n \nData collection for Facebook groups  \n \nIn the spring of 2021, we observed a Facebook group that shared a screenshot claiming it was under \nreduced distribution and set out to gather other similar groups by searching CrowdTangle for posts \npubli shed after January 1, 2016 , containing the sentence , \u201cYour group's distribution is reduced due to \nfalse information. \u201d We launched the query on December 1, 2021 , and manually opened the resulting 122 \nposts, keeping the ones that met the following criteria ( see Figure 1, top panels  for examples):  \n\u25cf The post message or image contains \u201cYour group's distribution is reduced due to false \ninformation\u201d  \n\u25cf The message is posted in a public group by an admin (as verified in the group\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page)  \n\u25cf The message shows that the notification concerns this group and is not just informative (e.g., we \nexcluded a post saying \u201cFacebook introduces new censorship and punishment measures for \ngroups and their members...\u201d)  \nAfter filtering, 100 posts remained, corresponding to 86 self -reported groups under reduced distribution. \nTo verify the consequences following Facebook notifying these groups, we collected all their posts \npublished in 2020 and 2021 using the \u2018posts\u2019 endpoint of CrowdTangle API. The collection was run on \nJanuary 3, 2022 , on 81 groups as some were deleted or changed to private in the meantime. For the \ngroups that posted multiple messages, all the dates of the posts are displayed on the bottom panel of \nFigure 1, but only the earliest is used to infer the reduced distributi on start date to calculate the percent \nchanges shown in Figure 2.  \nWe also identified groups using Science Feedback data. The dataset was extracted on December 15, \n2021 to obtain the 2,760 URLs flagged as false in 2021; the data is available to scientists s tudying \nmisinformation at  open.feedback.org. We collected from CrowdTangle all the public posts made in a \ngroup that shared one of those links. We identified the groups that spread misinformation the most often, \nselecting the 142 groups that shared at leas t 20 different false URLs. We collected all the posts they \npublished between January 1 and December 15, 2021. Among those groups, four were already present in \nthe previous sample and were excluded from the replication analysis.  \n \nData collection for website s \n \nWe used the June 2021 version of the Condor dataset (aka \u201cFacebook Privacy -Protected Full URLs Data \nSet\u201d), which contains all the URLs shared at least 100 times on the platform between January 1, 2017, and \nFebruary 28, 2021, along with their fact-checking metadata (Messing et al., 2021). We extracted the 7,478 \nURLs that were shared since 2019 and flagged as false, and the country in which it was shared the most \nwas the USA, Canada, Great Britain , or Australia. We listed the 710 websites with a t least two false URLs, \nmanually excluding platforms (e.g., youtube.com) and archive websites (e.g., archive.org) on which we \nunderstand Facebook isn\u2019t enforcing its policy. We used the BuzzSumo API to collect the number of articles \nfrom each website betwe en January 1, 2019, and February 28, 2021, using the \u201carticles \u201d endpoint . We \nexcluded the websites with fewer than 100 articles in total and websites with over 100,000 articles as our \nnumber of calls was limited, which yielded 371 remaining websites whose social media data was collected \n \n \n \n Vincent; Th\u00e9ro; Shabayek  11 \n \n   \nusing the same endpoint. The 275 websites shown in the middle panels of Figure 5 are the websites that \npublished at least one article during the repeat offender and normal periods.  \nScience Feedback data was extracted on Octo ber 21, 2021,  and used to identify the 4,810 URLs flagged \nas false between April 18, 2019 (the date of the first entry), and October 15, 2021, yielding 476 unique \nwebsites with at least two false URLs. As above, we kept the sites that were not platforms an d that had \nbetween 100 and 100,000 articles in BuzzSumo, resulting in 388 websites. We then collected the social \nmedia data of all of their articles from 2020 and 2021. The websites already associated with the Condor \ndataset (shown in Figure 5, middle pane ls) were excluded from the replication analysis (Figure 5, bottom \npanels).  \n \nBibliography  \n \nAlison, T.

We thus used \nnon-parametric statistical methods to estimate the effect of Facebook\u2019s reduction: Wilcoxon tests, and a \nbootstrapping approach to calculate the confidence intervals. As a Wilcoxon te st compares the sums of \nranks, it is less likely than a t -test to spuriously indicate significance because of the presence of outliers \n(Wilcoxon, 1992). The percent change in engagement were calculated using the following formula:  \n \n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61  \ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b  \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51  \u2212 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b  \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b  \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\u00d7100  \n \nPercent changes allowed us to normalize the engagement difference by the accounts\u2019 initial engagement \nlevel, as engagement metrics were vastly heterogeneous. We thus compared percent changes in \nengagement against zero, while paired Wilcoxon tests were used for the rest of the metrics (number of \ndaily posts, proportion of low -quality links, \u2026).  \nComparing engagement during reduced and normal periods might be biased if there is a seasonality \nin engagement data that corresponds with a reduction period. To address this potential confounder, we \nused a simple sensitivity test consistin g in shuffling the reduction date between the 81 groups that have \nshared a message saying they were reduced and re -calculating the percent change in engagement before \nand after this randomized date. In this case, the median percent change is -0.4%, and not  significantly \ndifferent from zero, W = 1504, p = 0.6. This absence of difference supports the understanding that a \nspurious decrease in engagement is not at the origin of the reduction described in Figure 2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Vincent; Th\u00e9ro; Shabayek  15 \n \n   \nAppendix B: Credibility of websi tes \n \nIn order to study the credibility of websites linked to  in posts shared by Facebook groups, we used the Iffy \npublic spreadsheet. This dataset aggregates a list of websites rated as of low or very -low credibility, based \non data pulled from the mediabia sfactcheck.com (MBFC) website. The \u201cMBFC factual reporting\u201d metric is \nbased on a list of failed fact checks  which are displayed on the page dedicated to each website. To \ncompute the proportion of links to low credibility sites for each group (Figure 4), we  summed the total \nnumber of posts containing a domain name that appeared  in the Iffy public spreadsheet during a 30 -day \nperiod before and after the notification date for each group and divided it by the total number of posts \ncontaining a link during the sa me period.  \nThe Iffy public spreadsheet can be found on the Iffy.news website, in the section \u201cIffy Index of \nUnreliable Sources\u201d by clicking on the \u201cpublic spreadsheet\u201d in the subsection \u201cWhere does Iffy get its \ninfo.\u201d  ", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "Measuring the effect of Facebook's downranking interventions against groups and websites that repeatedly share misinformation", "author": ["EM Vincent", "H Th\u00e9ro"], "pub_year": "2022", "venue": "Harvard Kennedy \u2026", "abstract": "Implications The spread of misinformation on online platforms is a growing concern in society,  and experts have increasingly highlighted platforms\u2019 responsibility in addressing the issue"}, "filled": false, "gsrank": 77, "pub_url": "https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vincent_facebooks_downranking_interventions_20220613.pdf", "author_id": ["dJ2vdCQAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?hl=en&q=info:wJOMDI4-a2UJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=76&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3D%2522mediabiasfactcheck.com%26hl%3Den%26start%3D70%26as_sdt%3D0,10&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=wJOMDI4-a2UJ&ei=ELWsaODsNr_SieoPzJnloAQ&json=", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7308003600155579328&as_sdt=40005&sciodt=0,10&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:wJOMDI4-a2UJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22mediabiasfactcheck.com&hl=en&as_sdt=0,10", "eprint_url": "https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vincent_facebooks_downranking_interventions_20220613.pdf"}}, {"title": "Visual literacy, news literacy, and the fight against misinformation", "year": "2018", "pdf_data": " \nJournal of New Librarianship , 3 (2018) pp . 381 -386    10 .21173/newlibs/ 5/22  \n Visual Literacy, News Literacy,  \nand the Fight Against Misinformation   \n  \nDana Statton Thompson   \nMurray State University, Murray, KY   \n  \nAbstract :  \nThis column explores the ways in which the new generation of librarians can position themselves at the \nfront lines of the misinformation and \u201cfake news\u201d crisis by incorporating visual literacy and news \nliteracy into information literacy lessons . \n  \nAuthor Bio :  \nDana Statton  Thompson joined Murray State University as a Research and Instruction librarian in 2016. \nHer research interests include visual literacy and news literacy, student comprehension and \nevaluation, and assessment of library instruction.   \n  \nKeywords : critical evaluation, visual literacy, news literacy, misinformation, \u201cfake news \u201d \n  \n \n \n\u2761 \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 \nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0), which permits unrestricted use, \ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited .  \n  \n  \n\n \nJournal of New Librarianship , 3 (2018) pp . 381 -386    10 .21173/newlibs/ 5/22  381 \n The internet is perhaps the greatest technological breakthrough since the Industr ial \nRevolution. Although the internet is no longer a new phenomenon, unprecedented challenges \ncontinue to arise in the form of rampant misinformation and the inescapable and slippery defined \n\u201cfake news,\u201d most notoriously influencing the 2016 U.S. President ial election. The internet has become \nan inescapable part of our lives. This has consequences; perhaps none so dire as the need to evaluate \nthe massive amount of information available to us, which is increasingly becoming easier to access \nwith very little effort.  \nIn this climate, it is of paramount importance to ask whether our users, and especially those \nwho are students, have the right skills and tools to evaluate this barrage of information, much of which \nis tucked into their \u201cnews\u201d feeds. As users cons ume information, they are making decisions on what to \nread, share, and believe. Without evaluative skills, confirmation bias and the echo chamber effect \nbecome weapons for the purveyors of false, deliberately misleading information intended to influence \npublic opinion or obscure facts.  \nIn the past, librarians knew what their duties entailed: readers\u2019 advisory, collection \ndevelopment, bibliographic instruction, and information literacy instruction. It would be overly \ndismissive to argue that past efforts in teaching information literacy have failed, but new tactics are \nnecessary. For the new generation of librarians, a more proactive approach toward information literacy \nis needed. Within the realm of information literacy, librarians must understand and teach visual \nliteracy and news literacy skills. This is necessary, because today\u2019s information onslaught is \ncharacterized by its highly visual content (e.g. photographs, videos, gifs, memes, infographics, etc.) as \nwell as its packaging by mainstream news outlets , many of which have forsaken any semblance of \nobjectivity and have instead turned to \u201ctalking heads\u201d and opinion pieces in order to boost ratings. \n \nJournal of New Librarianship , 3 (2018) pp . 381 -386    10 .21173/newlibs/ 5/22  382 \n Librarians must position themselves at the front lines of this battle, combating disinformation, \nmisinformat ion, hoaxes, and propaganda.  \nThe new generation of librarians is complex. Most, if not all, grew up with a computer and \naccess to the internet, knew someone who did, or had access through their school or local library. \nDespite this familiarity, many of th ese librarians do not blindly trust the technology at their fingertips \nlike many college students do today. Librarians recognize that search engines like Google, Bing, and \nYahoo are not the end -all, be -all, and one -stop -shop for finding information that is  accurate, current, \nand verified. The question becomes \u201chow do we impart that same knowledge to our users and \nstudents?\u201d  \nTeaching library users and students to evaluate the visual information and news stories they \nfind online is one solution. According to  the Pew Research Center, roughly nine -in-ten (93%) adults get \ntheir news online. Two -thirds (67%) of Americans reported that they get at least some of their news on \nsocial media, with two -in-ten doing so frequently (Pew Research Center, August 2017). For those \nAmericans 50 or under, 78% get their news from social media sites, as do 55% of those who are older \nthan 50. Social media sites like Twitter, YouTube, and Snapchat all experienced a significant increase of \nusers who get news on their sites (an averag e of 12.6 percentage points) while sites like Reddit, \nFacebook, Tumblr, Instagram, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp reported a more modest change (an average of \n3.2 percentage points). Out of the 66% of adults who use Facebook, 45% reported getting news on the \nsite.  For the younger population (aged 18 -29), 25% of Facebook\u2019s users, 28% of Twitter\u2019s users, 36% of \nYouTube\u2019s users, 51% of Instagram\u2019s users, and a whopping 82% of Snapchat\u2019s users get their news \nfrom these social media sites.  \n \nJournal of New Librarianship , 3 (2018) pp . 381 -386    10 .21173/newlibs/ 5/22  383 \n An interesting aspect of these  statistics is that two of the sites experiencing significant \nincreases (YouTube and Snapchat) are almost exclusively visual in nature; visual information on the \ninternet and use in social media seems to be only increasing.  For example, more than 1 billion  YouTube \nusers watch an average of 1 billion hours of video content during a single day (YouTube, 2017), and it is \npredicted that consumers will take 1.2 trillion digital photographs in the year 2017 alone (Cakebread, \n2017). Kane and Pear (2016) state that  \u201cMany of the successful recent entrants into the social media \nspace, such as Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, Vine, Periscope, and Meerkat, emphasize visual media. \nPlatforms that did not originate as chiefly visual \u2014Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter \u2014are trans itioning \nfocus to emphasize the prominence and importance of visual content\u201d (paragraph 3). It is undeniable, \nthen, that social media sites either already have, or are in the process of, embracing visual content at \nan increasing pace.  \nSince the use of vis uals, in tandem with the consumption of news on social media, is becoming \nmore and more prominent, it is vital that the new generation of librarians incorporate the evaluation of \nthese two types of content into their information literacy lessons. This can be done by starting with \nevaluative criteria for those specific types of information, moving past the CRAAP (Currency, Relevancy, \nAccuracy, Authority, and Purpose) test, and deliberately discussing visual information and news stories \nwith users and student s.  \nAlthough the CRAAP test is a well -used and much -cited method for evaluating information \nonline, there are better ways to evaluate news stories. Instead of encouraging students to ask \nquestions that dive deep into a specific news piece or check off a se ries of boxes,  a la the CRAAP test, \nlibrarians should instead encourage users and students to evaluate the information laterally to fight \nagainst falling for misinformation (Caulfield, 2017).  \n \nJournal of New Librarianship , 3 (2018) pp . 381 -386    10 .21173/newlibs/ 5/22  384 \n What does it mean to \u201cevaluate laterally\u201d? The idea is to open additional tabs to search for \ninformation about, and contained in, the original news story. As an example, users and students should \nresearch to see if other news outlets are reporting on a given story. If so, how do those reports differ? \nAre reputable new s sources reporting on the story? This question facilitates another: \u201cHow does one \ndetermine what a \u2018reputable source\u2019 is?\u201d which is a great opportunity to teach students about potential \nmedia bias and journalistic integrity. Directing students to resource s like MediaBiasFactCheck.com, or \ndoing an activity where you \u201cpin the source of the spectrum\u201d (Gervasio, 2017), provide excellent \nstarting points. Additionally, users and students should always read the author\u2019s biographic \ninformation or, if there is none  included, do a search to find out more information about the author, \nsuch as searching for the author\u2019s affiliations and credentials or even previous writings on the topic. \nThis additional information provides context about the author and can uncover pote ntial bias or \nconflicts of interest. It is also useful to check the validity of a story through fact -checking websites (e.g. \nSnopes.com, FactCheck.org, or PolitiFact.com) to see if the story has already been debunked.  \nMany news stories are now accompanied by visuals, which also need to be evaluated as pieces \nof information. For visuals that are incorporated into news stories, tools like reverse image searching \ncan help identify the original source of photographs, memes, and profile pictures. Two of the best  \nresources for this are Google Reverse Image Search ( https://reverse.photos ) and TinEye Reverse Image \nSearch ( https://www.tineye.com ). These tools can indicate where the image appears on the web while \ndirecting users to similar images.  \nFinding the original image is the first step. Even more importantly,  users need to understand \nwhat they are viewing. This is explained by standards Three and Four of the Association of College and \nResearch Libraries (ACRL) Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education . Standard Three \n \nJournal of New Librarianship , 3 (2018) pp . 381 -386    10 .21173/newlibs/ 5/22  385 \n states: \u201cThe visually liter ate student interprets and analyzes the meanings of images and visual media\u201d \n(ACRL, 2011). This involves identifying information relevant to an image\u2019s meaning, including captions, \nmetadata, or any accompanying text and situating an image in its cultural, social, and historical \ncontext. By identifying relevant information and understanding the context of an image, users begin to \nunderstand the image as a whole. Standard Four states: \u201cThe visually literate student evaluates images \nand their sources\u201d (ACRL, 2 011). Specifically, this would move from identifying to evaluating. This \nprocess includes evaluating the effectiveness and reliability of an image as a visual form of \ncommunication, evaluating the aesthetic characteristics of an image as well as the textua l information, \nand making judgments about the reliability and accuracy of the images.  \nBy incorporating news literacy and visual literacy into information literacy lessons, and by \nguiding students through specific tasks in order to evaluate each, the new g eneration of librarians can \nposition themselves at the front lines of the battle against misinformation. Integrating conversations \nabout news stories and images will only reinforce student\u2019s existing evaluative and critical thinking \nskills, further strengt hening their ability to fight \u201cfake news\u201d and misinformation.  \n \nReferences  \nAssociation of College and Research Libraries.

Horne,*Sibel Adal\u0131*\nTechnical University of Denmarky, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute*\njepno@dtu.dk, horneb@rpi.edu, adalis@rpi.edu\nAbstract\nIn this paper, we present a dataset of 713k articles collected\nbetween 02/2018-11/2018. These articles are collected di-\nrectly from 194 news and media outlets including main-\nstream, hyper-partisan, and conspiracy sources. We incor-\nporate ground truth ratings of the sources from 8 differ-\nent assessment sites covering multiple dimensions of ve-\nracity, including reliability, bias, transparency, adherence to\njournalistic standards, and consumer trust. The NELA-GT-\n2018 dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/\nULHLCB.\n1 Introduction\nOne of the main gaps in the study of misinformation is \ufb01nd-\ning broad labelled datasets, which this data set aims to \ufb01ll.\nThere are a number of published misinformation datasets\nwith ground truth, but they are often small, event speci\ufb01c,\nengagement speci\ufb01c, or incomplete. As a result, they are not\nsuf\ufb01cient for answering a wide-range of research questions.\nFirst, for many studies, particularly those involving ma-\nchine learning methods, a large dataset with ground truth la-\nbels is necessary. Article-level ground truth (i.e. true/false)\nfor such datasets can be infeasible, as fact-checking requires\nexperts conducting a slow and labor-intensive process. Fur-\nthermore, the slow speed of fact-checking makes datasets\nquickly out-of-date. One solution that has been proposed to\nmitigate problems with article level labels is to use higher\nlevel labels, such as source reliability over an extended pe-\nriod of time (Horne et al. 2018; Baly et al. 2018).\nSecondly, fact-checkers tend to concentrate their efforts\non articles that receive a lot of attention, making datasets\nwith fact-checked labels engagement-driven. Engagement-\ndriven news datasets (for example those based on social me-\ndia mentions), are very useful in engagement-driven studies,\nbut may not provide a complete picture of attention to mali-\ncious news sources. For example, The Drudge Report, a site\nknown for spreading mixed-veracity information, is 41st in\nUnited States in terms of the amount of Internet traf\ufb01c, mak-\ning it a highly in\ufb02uential source. Readers spend a long time\non the site, averaging 25 minutes with about 11 clicks pages\nper visit. However, readers only reach the site using social-\nmedia links 4% of the time, while 83% of the time they reach\nCopyright c\r2019, Association for the Advancement of Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.it through direct links1. As a result, we argue that there is a\nneed for datasets collected independent of social media in\norder to understand the full impact of and tactics used by\nmisleading and hyper-partisan news producers.\nLastly, news, particularly state-sponsored propaganda,\ncan misinform through methods other than explicitly fabri-\ncated claims (Zannettou et al. 2018). Hence, fact-checking\nlabels may not capture all types of misinformation. This\nleads to labeling mechanisms that account for other fac-\ntors, such as whether the sources have bias in their reporting\nor how much they adhere to journalistic standards. There-\nfore, we argue that datasets should contain multiple types of\nground truth at the source-level in order to perform complete\nstudies of misinformation.\nThe dataset presented in this paper is and engagement-\nindependent collection of news articles with multiple\ntypes of source-level ground truths. Our dataset contains\n713,534 articles from 194 news outlets collected between\n01/02/2018-30/11/2018. These articles are collected directly\nfrom each news producers\u2019 websites, independent of social\nmedia. We corroborate ground truth labels from eight differ-\nent assessment sites covering multiple dimensions of verac-\nity, including reliability, bias, transparency, and consumer\ntrust. The dataset sources are from both mainstream media\nand alternative media across multiple countries. The dataset\ncan be found at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ULHLCB. In\nthis paper, we outline dataset collection, ground-truth cor-\nroboration, and provide a few use cases.\n2 Related Work\nThere are many recent news datasets focused on misinfor-\nmation, each with different focus in labelling. Labels include\nvarious dimensions of reliability and various dimensions of\nbias. BuzzfeedNews2is a small dataset of news articles that\nhad high Facebook engagement during the 2016 U.S. Presi-\ndential Election. The dataset contains 1627 articles that are\nfact-checked by 5 Buzzfeed journalists. The dataset labels\ninclude if the article is false or true, along with the political\nleaning of the source that produced the article. FakeNews-\nCorpus3is a dataset containing nearly 10M articles labeled\n1source: similarweb.com, consulted on 13/01/2019\n2github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check\n3github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus\n630\nusing opensources.co. OpenSources is a list of sources la-\nbeled by experts. These labels include 13 different labels\nrelated to the reliability of the source. FakeNewsNet is a\ncollection of datasets containing news articles and tweets.\nThe dataset includes rich metadata including social features\nand spatiotemporal information (Shu et al. 2018). While this\ndataset is described in a paper on arxiv.com, to the best of\nour knowledge, the data has not been completely released to\nthe public at this time4.\nMany other misinformation datasets have focused on in-\ndividual claims rather than complete news articles. While\nclaims can be extracted from news articles, most of these\ndatasets use claims made on social media or by political \ufb01g-\nures in speeches. LIAR is a fake claim benchmark dataset\nthat has 12.8K fact-check short statements from politifact.\ncom (Wang 2017). The claims in the dataset are from social\nmedia posts and political speeches. CREDBANK is a dataset\nof 60M tweets between 2015 and 2016. Each tweet is associ-\nated to a news event and is labeled with credibility by Ama-\nzon Mechanical Turkers (Mitra and Gilbert 2015). Again,\nthis dataset only contains claims/tweets, not complete news\narticles. PHEME is a dataset of 330 tweet threads anno-\ntated by journalist. Each tweet is associated with a news\nstory (Zubiaga et al. 2016). FacebookHoax is a dataset con-\ntaining 15K Facebook posts about science news. The posts\nare labeled as \u201choax\u201d or \u201cnon-hoax\u201d and come from 32 dif-\nferent Facebook pages (Tacchini et al. 2017). These datasets\nare highly related to the smaller tweet credibility datasets\ncreated in the last decade (Castillo, Mendoza, and Poblete\n2011).\nThere are also several recent unlabelled news datasets,\nwhich are much larger than most of the labeled datasets.\nNELA2017 is a political news article dataset that contains\n136K articles from 92 media sources in 2017 (Horne, Khedr,\nand Adal\u0131 2018). The dataset includes sources from main-\nstream, hyper-partisan, conspiracy, and satire media sources.\nAlong with the news articles, the dataset includes a rich set\nof natural language features on each news article, and the\ncorresponding Facebook engagement statistics. The dataset\ncontains nearly all of the articles published by the 92 sources\nduring the 7 month period. GDELT is an open database of\nevent-based news articles with temporal and location fea-\ntures. It is said to be one of the most comprehensive event-\nbased news datasets. However, GDELT does not explicitly\ncontain maliciously fake or hyper-partisan news sources,\nneeded for misinformation studies.\nWhile all of these datasets are useful, there are several\nlimitations we address with the dataset presented int his pa-\nper:\n1. Small number of sources and articles - With the excep-\ntion of FakeNewsCorpus and the NELA2017 dataset, the\ncurrent publicly available datasets are either small in the\nnumber of media sources they contain, small in the num-\nber of articles, or both. Furthermore, many of the larger\ndatasets do not contain multiple types of sources. In com-\nparison to FakeNewsCorpus, our dataset covers a wider\nrange of news, in particular more mainstream news. In\n4github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNetaddition, our dataset is collected over a longer and more\nconsistent period of time, where as the many of alterna-\ntive news sources in FakeNewsCorpus no longer exists\nand the time frame of FakeNewsCorpus is unknown.\n2. Engagement-driven - The majority of the current\ndatasets, both for news articles and claims, contain only\ndata has been highly engaged with on social media or\nhas received attention from fact-checking organizations.\nWhile understanding the engagement of misinformation\nis an important task, engagement driven news datasets\nfail to show the complete picture of misinforming news.\nBoth malicious fake news producers and hyper-partisan\nmedia produce hundreds, sometimes thousands of articles\nin a year, most of which are never seen on social media\nor fact-checkers. Questions about when fake news tactics\nwork or do not work remain unanswered.\n3. Lack of ground truth labels - All of the current large-\nscale news article datasets do not have any form of label-\ning for misinformation research, with exception of Fak-\neNewsCorpus. While some contain a mix of reliable and\nunreliable sources, it is not necessarily clear to what ex-\ntent each source is reliable or what dimensions of cred-\nibility should be used to assess the sources. For exam-\nple, a news article can spread misinformation (or disin-\nformation) in many ways other than false statements. A\nnews article may use partially false information, decon-\ntextualized information, or information misrepresented\nby hyper-partisan language. For both machine learning\nand comparative studies, having well de\ufb01ned labels about\nmultiple dimensions of veracity is important in under-\nstand what signals a machine learning model is learning\nor why discovered patterns exist in news data.\nThus, our goal with the NELA-GT-2018 dataset is to cre-\nate a large, veracity-labeled news article dataset that in inde-\npendent of social media engagement and speci\ufb01c events.\n3 Dataset Creation\nWe created this dataset, with the following steps:\n1. We gathered a wide variety of news sources from vary-\ning levels of veracity, including many well-studied mis-\ninforming sources and other less well-known sources.\n2. We scraped article data from the gathered sources\u2019 RSS\nfeeds twice a day for 10 months in 2018.\n3. We combine and corroborated source-level veracity la-\nbels from 8 independent assessments, some of which are\nused in the misinformation literature, others that are not.\nThese labels provide multiple and complementary ground\ntruth allowing for many different ways to characterize the\nsources.\nThrough this process, we provide 713,534 articles from\n194 news and media producers . Along with these arti-\ncles, we provide multiple labels from 8 independent as-\nsessments for each source. The \ufb01nal set of article data is ar-\nranged in an sqlite data, with date, source, title, and cleaned\ntext content for each article. The labels are provided in CSV\nformat, with rows being sources and columns being each la-\nbel gathered from all the assessment sites. The set of labels\n631\ncan also be found in Table 3 and Table 4. Speci\ufb01cs on the\n\ufb01le-formats can be found in the documentation given with\nthe dataset. We describe the collection process and ground\ntruth in detail below.\nNews Article Data\nTo collect our dataset, we scraped the RSS feeds of each\nsource twice a day starting on 02/02/2018 using the Python\nlibraries feedparser and goose. Our starting point for source\nselection was mainstream outlets and alternative sources that\nare mentioned in other studies or high pro\ufb01le cases of false\nnews coverage. An initial subset of 92 sources was avail-\nable in NELA2017 dataset (Horne, Khedr, and Adal\u0131 2018),\nwhich already covered a wide array of media types. We then\ncontinued to expand this source set using the same criteria,\nas well as by automated Google searches to \ufb01nd other outlets\nthat published similar articles as those already in our dataset.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we queried the Google Search API with the ti-\ntles of the news articles that were previously collected. If\na news source that was not in our source collection list ap-\npeared in the top 10 pages of the Google search, we added it\nto our source collection list. Note, we do not include small\nlocal news sources or sources that did not have operational\nRSS feeds, which signi\ufb01cantly reduces the size of the ex-\npected source set. Furthermore, this Google expansion pro-\ncess was ran in July 2018, which caused a large increase in\nunlabeled news sources, as shown in Figure 1.\nBy the end of the collection process (30/11/2018) we had\n713K articles from 194 news and media producers. These\nsources come from a variety of countries, but are all articles\nare in English. In Tables 3, 4, and 5 we write the date of the\n\ufb01rst scraped article from each source. After these dates, we\nhave near complete data from the respective sources RSS-\nfeeds. In Figure 1 we show the number of articles collected\nover time.\nGround Truth Data\nA number of organizations and platforms have developed\nmethods for assessing reliability and bias of news sources.\nThese organizations come from both the research commu-\nnity and from practitioner communities. While each of these\norganizations and platforms provide useful assessments on\ntheir own, each uses different criteria and methods to make\ntheir assessments, and most of these assessments cover rel-\natively few sources. Thus, in order to create a large, central-\nized set of veracity labels, we collected ground truth (GT)\ndata from eight different sites, which all attempt to assess\nthe reliability and/or the bias of news.\nThese assessment sites are:\n1. NewsGuard\n2. Pew Research Center\n3. Wikipedia\n4. OpenSources\n5. Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)\n6. AllSides\n7. BuzzFeed News\n8. Politifact\nWe gather data from all these sites, using html-scraping\nand GUI-automation, and combine their labels to create acentralized set of veracity ground truth labels. Of the 194\nsources in our data set, 154 sources have GT labels from\nat least one of the assessment sites, while the remaining 40\nsources remain unlabelled. Tables 3 and 4 show the com-\nbined labels, while Table 5 lists the sources where no label\ninformation was found. Table 2 provide a detailed described\nof each assessment and Table 1 lists urls for the assessment\nsites.\nNewsGuard uses a group of trained journalists to assess\ncredibility and transparency of news websites. They empha-\nsizes the use of trained people rather than algorithms to de-\ntermine credibility of sources. They allows respective news\noutlets comment on their verdict before publishing it. They\nprovide extensions for major browsers to inform users of the\ncredibility of the sites they visit. They also display icons on\nsearch results in search engines like Google and Duck Duck\nGo. Their analysis produces 9 granular, binary labels for\neach site, with assigned point scores that sums to 100. Based\non the sum of points the sites get an overall label for credibil-\nity - green for good score, red for bad score. Three additional\noverall labels exist for satire, user-produced content and sites\nwith un\ufb01nished analysis. Table 2 describes the granular la-\nbels. NewsGuard is transparent about their methodology and\npublish a policy for ethics and con\ufb02icts of interest. Their full\nstaff is listed with names online and their ratings are free.\nPew Research Center published an article entitled \u201dPolit-\nical Polarization & Media Habits\u201d which analysed trust in\nspeci\ufb01c news sources by liberals and conservatives. This\nanalysis used 5 groups of people, ranging from liberals to\nconservatives, and each group provided a rating of how\nmuch they trust each source. The ratings are aggregated to\nshow whether readers with different political leanings pre-\ndominantly trust or distrust a speci\ufb01c source. We provide\nthis trust label for each source and political leaning, as a la-\nbel for congruency between bias a readership (rather than a\nfact-checking label).\nWikipedia published a list of fake news websites, which\nthey de\ufb01ne as sites that \u201d intentionally, but not necessarily\nsolely, publish hoaxes and disinformation for purposes other\nthan news satire \u201d. The page has more than 500 edits, 162\ncited references and has been in existence since 18/11/2016.\nThere is no information on how the sites were selected, but\nfor each source there are references to other sites which has\nreported their bad behaviour. We provide a fake-news tag for\nsources on the list.\nOpen Sources describes itself as a \u201d curated resource for as-\nsessing online information sources, available for public use \u201d\nand its analysis are done by its own team of experts. The\ncriteria is published online in detail. This list has also been\nused in several academic studies (Horne and Adali 2017;\nHorne et al. 2018; Baly et al. 2018). Unfortunately, last\nrepository commit was 2 years ago and many of the labeled\nsources no longer exist. The site provides a list of sources\nwith 1-3 tags per source (See Table 2).\nMedia Bias/Fact Check is a platform that analyzes news\n632\n010002000300040005000# articlesReliability\nUnreliable\nReliable\nNot determined\nUnknown source\n01/02/2018 01/03/2018 01/04/2018 01/05/2018 01/06/2018 01/07/2018 01/08/2018 01/09/2018 01/10/2018 01/11/2018\nDate010002000300040005000# articlesBias\nLeft\nRight\nNot determined\nUnknown sourceFigure 1: Number of articles in the dataset over time.

According to its published methodology, the site nu-\nmerically evaluates each news outlet in 4 categories; biased\nwording/headlines ,factual/sourcing ,story choices andpo-\nlitical af\ufb01liation , and uses the mean of these for a \ufb01nal ver-\ndict. As of January 2019, we were unfortunately not able\nto \ufb01nd the numerical categories for the sources. We were\nable to \ufb01nd a factual reporting label, which is derived from\nthe previously mentioned scores. Many sources also had de-\nscriptive labels, some of which were related to reliability and\nsome of which were related to bias. All these labels are de-\nscribed in Table 2.\nAllsides takes a very idealistic approach to assessing bias of\nsites and is mainly data-driven. They emphasize that news\nare inherently biased, that a mixed news \u201ddiet\u201d is the true\ngoal for newsreaders and that bias can be hidden and un-\nconscious. This site creates data through a set of methods,\neach of which are noted for the sources. It conducts blindsurveys on material in the public as well as in an editorial\nboard, use third party data and assessment, conducts inter-\nnal research on sources if needed, and also has a community\nfeedback function for all bias assessments. In the commu-\nnity feedback, users can vote to agree or disagree with All-\nsides assessment of a source. They note that the community\nfeedback is not normalized with respect to bias, and should\nmore be used as a \ufb02ag for their own use on whether their\nassessments are off and needs updating. We include their\nbias label and feedback numbers (votes agreeing and votes\ndisagreeing) for each source. The feedback number are not\nshown in the paper, but can be found in the dataset.\nBuzzFeed News published an article \u201dInside The Partisan\nFight For Your News Feed\u201d on 08/08/2017 which describes\na study conducted by them on how partisan websites and\nFacebook pages have been created in increasing numbers.\nThey publish an associated dataset with news sources and\ntheir political leaning (left and right), which we include.\nPolitiFact is a well-known fact-checking organization\nwhich investigates claims and evaluates the truthfulness of\nthose claims. The statements can be from any public per-\n633\nson or simply rumours that gain enough attention. Politi-\nFact\u2019s data is very different from the rest of our labelling\nsites, as their assessment is on article/statement level and not\nsource level. They also aggregate the statements and their la-\nbels for the sources that published the statements. We have\ncounted the types of statements coming from each source,\nwhich could be used to indicate their truthfulness. However\nthe data is not well normalized, as some sites have many\nnoted statements, while some have none, due to the origin of\nthe statements and the amount of attention each source has.\nAmazon\u2019s Alexa provides a ranking of nearly all websites\nbased on frequency of visits, to which they provide free ac-\ncess to the top 1M. We include the position of the sources\nin this rating in the dataset based on our access to Alexa on\n13th of January 2019. Note, this data comes from the free\nportion of Alexa\u2019s data, not the paid portion. Furthermore,\nthese rankings will change over time.\n4 Use Cases\nThere are many threads of misinformation research that this\ndataset can bene\ufb01t. We argue that our dataset can especially\nbene\ufb01t automated news veracity methods, which need large\nlabelled datasets, and qualitative studies that focus on the\ntactics used by malicious and hyper-partisan news produc-\ners. We discuss a few examples below.\nDistant Supervised Learning\nMuch research in news has been focused on automated\nmethods for detecting misinformation (Kumar and Shah\n2018). For machine learning systems, this analysis gener-\nally requires article-level labelling (i.e. false/bias labels of\nindividual articles). One problem with this approach is that\nlabelling individual articles requires a lot of resources and\nis often times not possible. For many machine learning al-\ngorithms the minimum requirement of labelled samples is\nin the thousands. Furthermore, verifying articles will com-\nmonly require considerable time from an expert. A second\nproblem is that the veri\ufb01cation of statements in articles can\nrequire a lot of time. This can make available labelled ar-\nticles outdated for analyzing contemporary articles, due to\nshifts in topics and news cycle.\nAn alternative approach to creating labels is through dis-\ntant supervision (or weak supervision), where labels are cre-\nated at the source-level and used as proxies for article-level\nlabels. One advantage of the approach is that it reduces the\nworkload of labelling. Additionally, labels are known instan-\ntaneously for articles from known sources allowing real time\nupdate of parameters and analysis of news. This approach\nhas been shown promising in recent misinformation detec-\ntion work (Horne et al. 2018; Baly et al. 2018). The NELA-\nGT-2018 dataset can be used out-of-the-box for this type of\nmachine learning study.\nSemi-Supervised Learning\nAnother commonly debated issue in misinformation re-\nsearch is handling new articles from mixed-veracity (par-\ntial truths, benign or malicious) sources or handling articlesfrom newly emerging sources during events (such as elec-\ntions). One potential way to address these problems is us-\ning semi-supervised learning, in which these uncertain ve-\nracity news sources are included as unlabelled data. This\napproach can improve stability and increase the working\ndomain for automated systems. In fact, it has been shown\nthat, with some assumptions, semi-supervised approaches\ncan improve performance over fully supervised approaches,\nwhere unlabelled samples enables classi\ufb01ers to reduce risk\nexponentially with the number of labelled samples (Castelli\nand Cover 1996). Depending on the problem, this dataset\nprovides consistent labels of 100+ sources, veri\ufb01ed by mul-\ntiple assessment sites. Remaining sources are either com-\npletely unknown, or are sparsely labelled, but can be utilized\nwith semi-supervised methods.\nMixed-Method Studies\nThere are unanswered research questions about the tactics\nused by news producers publishing false, misleading, or pro-\npaganda news. These questions cannot be answered through\nmachine learning studies, but rather require mix-method as-\nsessments in order to be answered. For example, recent\nwork has focused on content sharing by alternative media\nsources (Starbird et al. 2018). This work sheds light on the\ntactics employed by state-sponsored news to create alterna-\ntive narratives around an event, but can continue to be im-\nproved with data that is more complete and independent of\nsocial media. Other question include: how do false news pro-\nducers change with events? Do they keep consistent ideolo-\ngies? or do they adapt with the given event? Many of these\npotential tactics are unknown. This dataset provides news\nover many major events, which can be easily extracted for\nspeci\ufb01c studies. For qualitative researchers, the data can pro-\nvide a \u201chead-start\u201d on exploring the data, as the veracity of\neach source is known.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present a labelled news dataset for the study\nof misinformation. We argue that the research community\nlacks large labelled datasets for use in both mixed-method\nand machine learning studies. To address this need, we pro-\nvide a large dataset of news articles (713K articles), col-\nlected over many sources (194), over a long period of time\n02/2018-11/2018. The articles are independent of engage-\nment from online communities, and re\ufb02ect the publish pat-\nterns of the news producers. We have furthermore gathered\nlabels for these sources from 8 different assessment sites,\neach of which seeks to assess the reliability and bias of\nsources and claims. Combined they provide a detailed and\nnear-complete labelling of sources, which can be used for\npredictive analysis and qualitative studies of the news land-\nscape.\nA Appendix\n634\nSection Description (NewsGuard points) Coloring\nNewsGuard 1.

It uses a unique dataset of online right-wing media content  that is both broad\nand narrow. It is broad in the sense that it includes every online article (n=399,266) published by\nFox News,  Breitbart, Newsmax, The Da ily Caller, The Daily Wire, Western Journal, the National\nReview, The Washington Times, The Washington Examiner, The Blaze, The Federalist and\nHannity.com in 2021. It is narrow in th e sense that it also includes Facebook interactions data\n(n=1,752,585,920), which allows me to sift through mass content and focus on the articles that\ngenerated user engagement on Facebook.  \nThere are three key findings. First, compared to the mainstream media, right-wing media were\nsignificantly less likely to use \u201cinsurrection\u201d in the article headlines when covering the attack on\nthe US Capitol. Instead, they used words such as attack, incursion, protest, or riot.  \nSecond, co mpared t o the mainstream m edia, right-wing media were significantly more likely to\ncover 1) media reaction to the attack \u2013 especially social media crackdown on Trump supporters; 2)\ninvestigation includ ing the Jan. 6 select committee; 3) Trump and his political allies being\ntargeted by the investigation; and 4) individuals that were arrested or charged.  \nThird, 200 most p opular right-wing media articles generated more than half of all user\nengagement for right-wing media\u2019s cove rage of Jan. 6 on Facebook. Three majo r themes emerged\nfrom these 200 arti cles: 1) politicians ( Democrats in particular) politicized the Jan. 6 attack; 2)\nTrump supporters were persecuted; and 3) left-wing agitators, includi ng BLM activists,\nparticipated in the attack. Many popu lar articles contained disinformation. Some even spread\nRussia propaganda.  For example, one Western Journal article was titled \u201cPutin rips detention of\nJan. 6 protesters, accuses US Government of assassinating Ashli Babbitt.\u201d[1]\nContent supply\nThe 1 2 right-wing m edia sites produced 399,266 articles in 2021. Among these articles, 6905 (1.7%)\ncontained the word \u201cCapitol,\u201d \u201cJanuary 6,\u201d or \u201cJan. 6\u201d in the headline.[2] An analysis of a random\nsample of  100 articles shows that mor e than 90% were about the January 6 attack on the US\nCapitol.[3] Figure 1 shows the volume of articles about the attack on the Capitol. Figure 2 shows\nthe time series plot of right-wing media\u2019s coverage of the attack.\n[1] https://www.westernjournal.com/putin-rips-detention-jan-6-protesters-accuses-us-government-assassinating-\nashli-babbitt/\n[2] The percentage is comparable to that of the mainstream media, which produced 10561 articles (1.6%)\ncontaining the word \u201cCapitol\u201d out of 652,556 articles in total.\n[3] The other 10% included articles that are not directly related to the January 6 attack \u2013 for example, articles\nabout fencing surrounding the Capitol ahead of rallies in September 2021. \nFigure 1: Article volume about the attack on the US Capitol (January \u2013 December 2021).\nAs Figure 1 shows, Breitbart gave the most coverage to the event, followed by the Washington\nTimes, Fox News, and the Washington Examiner. These four outlets combined produced more\nthan half of the corpus. There is perhaps little surprise that these four outlets dominated the\ncoverage: they tend to produce more articles in general: in 2021, fox.com produced 66891 articles,\nwashingtionexaminer.com produced 32033, washingtontimes.com produced 76416, and\nbreitbart.com produced 109048 articles.\n[4] Two proportions Z test in R returns a p value smaller than .001.Figure 2: Time series plot of right-wing media\u2019s coverage of the attack.\nFigure 2 shows that right-wing media\u2019s coverage of the event declined in 2021. However, there was\na noticeable bump in July when the House Select Committee was formed.  \n      \nF r a m i n g  t h e  a t t a c k\nAmong 6833 right-wing media articles about the attack, only 72 (1%) used the word \u201cinsurrection.\u201d\nHowever, among 10220 mainstream media articles about the attack, 341 (3.3%) included\n\u201cinsurrection.\u201d The difference is statistically significant.[4] That is to say, right-wing media\narticles are statistically significantly less likely to use the word \u201cinsurrection\u201d in the headlines\nthan mainstream media articles.\nT o p i c s\nStructural topic modeling (See Data & Methods for details) was used to uncover topics from the\ncorpus. For comparison, I also included all the articles published by 12 mainstream media that\ncontained the word \u201cCapitol,\u201d \u201cJan. 6,\u201d or \u201cJanuary 6\u201d. Hence, the combined corpus has 6905\narticles from right-wing media and 10561 articles from the mainstream media.\nTable 1 shows the topics as well as the top words associated with them. The third column shows\nwhether right-wing media covered the topic significantly (statistically) more or less than the\nmainstream media. Topic 3 and 8 are not directly related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol.  \nTable 1: Top 10 topics in media coverage of January 6  \n(January \u2013 December 2021)\nCompared with the mainstream media, right-wing media devoted significantly more coverage to\nthe following topics: \u201cmedia reaction to riot,\u201d \u201cinvestigation/Jan. 6 committee,\u201d \u201cTrump and allies,\u201d\nand \u201carrest.\u201d They devoted significantly less coverage to two topics, namely \u201criot\u201d and \u201cvideo\nreport.\u201d Table 2 shows the top right-wing media article headlines for topics that attracted\nsignificantly more coverage from right-wing media.\nTable 2: Top article headlines from right-wing media\nIn addition, although some topics attracted similar amount of coverage from right-wing media\nand the mainstream media, they were framed differently. Figure 3 shows the words that right-\nwing media and the mainstream media used when discussing the topic \u201cdeath\u201d. Right-wing media\nfocused on the death of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was shot by the US Capitol Police; the\nmainstream media, however, focused on the death of Brian Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer\nwho died of two strokes the day after he responded to the attack on the Capitol.\nFigure 3: Top words used by right-wing media and the mainstream media in Topic 6 \u201cdeath.\u201d\nP o p u l a r  a r t i c l e s  o n  F a c e b o o k\nPopularity on Facebook is measured by the number of interactions, including likes, shares,\ncomments, and reactions. The 6905 articles from right-wing media outlets had 7324 interactions on\naverage whereas articles published by right-wing media in general only had 4389 interactions on\naverage.[5]\nRight-wing media content\u2019s popularity followed a pattern of concentration: most user interactions\nconcentrated on just a few hundred articles. The top 600 most popular articles accounted for\napproximately 80% of all user interactions for the 6905 articles. And the top 200 most popular\narticles accounted for more than half of all user interactions. The following analysis focuses on the\ntop 200 articles.\n[5] The mainstream media\u2019s articles about the attack were also popular on Facebook. The 10561 articles from\nthe mainstream media attracted 17735 interactions on average whereas articles published by the mainstream\nmedia in general only had 2344 interactions on average.\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of the 200 articles over different right-wing media outlets. Daily\nWire, Fox News, and Western Journal were especially good at making their articles popular on\nFacebook. By contrast, although the Washington Times and the Washington Examiner produced\nmany articles about the Jan. 6 attack (See Figure 1), few of their articles made it to the top 200.  \nFigure 4: The distribution of the most popular 200 articles over right-wing media outlets\nI manually coded each headline for the 200 articles in terms of themes. Three major themes\nemerged from the analysis. The most common theme is that politicians (Democrats in particular)\npoliticized or used dramatic language to describe the January 6 attack (23%). For example, many\narticles reported that Chuck Schumer compared the attack to Pearl Harbor, that Biden declared\nJan. 6 the worst attack since the Civil War, and that Clinton floated the conspiracy theory that\nTrump worked with Putin to plan the attack. The second most common theme is that Trump\nsupporters were persecuted in the wake of the attack (12.5%). For example, many articles repeated\nTucker Carlson\u2019s comment that the Capitol attack is being used to strip Americans of their rights.\nThe third most common theme is that left-wing agitators participated in the attack on the US\nCapitol (9%). For example, many articles claimed that Democrats were among those arrested, that\nBLM activists were involved in the attack, and that NBC and CNN paid leftists to participate in the\nriot. Table 3 below shows a few examples for each major theme.\nTable 3: Examples of most popular right-wing media articles on Facebook\nD a t a  &  M e t h o d s\nI d e n t i f y i n g  m a j o r  r i g h t - w i n g  m e d i a  s i t e s\nThis study focuses on the top right-wing media sites with the largest online traffic and the largest\nengagement on Facebook.

Then, I aggregated the\narticle engagement at the media outlet level and ranked media outlets by engagement. Last, I\nidentified the top 20 right-wing media sites using the partisan classification from\nmediabiasfactcheck.com.\nThe following 12 right-wing media sites ranked among top 20 both in terms of web traffic and\nengagement on Facebook. They are the Daily Wire, Fox News, Breitbart, Western Journal, the\nBlaze, Newsmax, the Washington Times, the Daily Caller, the Washington Examiner, the\nFederalist, Hannity.com and the National Review.\nFor comparison, I also collected the articles published by 12 mainstream media outlets in 2021. To\nidentify major mainstream media outlets, I consulted Pew Research\u2019s 2020 study on Americans\u2019\nnews consumption.[6] The 12 mainstream media outlets are NBC News, ABC News, CBS News,\nCNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, NPR, PBS,\nTime, and Newsweek.\n[6] https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/01/24/media-polarization-methodology/#fn-78243-4\nA p p l y i n g  s t r u c t u r a l  t o p i c  m o d e l s\nI applied a Structural Topic Model (STM) to a corpus including articles published by right-wing\nmedia (n=6905) and articles published by the mainstream media (n=10561). STM is a variant of\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models, which automatically identify topics in a corpus of\ntexts. The corpus includes each article\u2019s headline as well as its first paragraph. Each topic model\nincludes the lean of the media outlet (rightwing vs mainstream) and month as covariates to\ninfluence topic proportions. The word threshold in the topic was set to 10, which means that a\nword needs to appear in more than ten article headlines and/or first paragraphs to be included in\nthe model. The number of topics was set at 10, and each topic was manually validated by\ninspecting the top words and top articles associated with each topic.\n ", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "Right-wing media's coverage of the attack on the US Capitol on January 6", "author": ["Y Yang"], "pub_year": "2022", "venue": "Institute for Data, Democracy & Politics", "abstract": "This white paper examines 12 major right-wing media\u2019s coverage of the attack on the US  Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Classification: Social Sciences, Social Sciences; Physical Sciences, Computer Sciences Keywords: Source credibility, infodemic, propaganda \n2 This PDF file includes: Main Text Figures 1 to 4    \n3 Abstract On February 2, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 social media \u201cinfodemic\u201d, with special attention to misinformation \u2013 frequently understood as false claims. To understand the infodemic\u2019s scope and scale, we analyzed over 500 million posts from Twitter and Facebook about COVID-19 and other health topics, between March 8 and May 1, 2020. Following prior work (Lazer et al., 2019), we assumed URL source credibility is a proxy for false content, but we also tested this assumption. Contrary to expectations, we found that messages about COVID-19 were more likely to contain links to more credible sources. Additionally, messages linking to government sources, and to news with intermediate credibility, were shared more often, on average, than links to non-credible sources. These results suggest that more ambiguous forms of misinformation about COVID-19 may be more likely to be disseminated through credible sources when compared to other health topics. Furthermore, the assumption that credibility is an adequate proxy for false content may overestimate the prevalence of false content online: less than 25% of posts linking to the least credible sources contained false content. Our results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between explicit falsehoods and more ambiguous forms of misinformation due to the search for meaning in an environment of scientific uncertainty.  Significance Statement Vast quantities of online misinformation about COVID-19 could undermine pandemic containment efforts. We analyzed hundreds of millions of social media posts to determine if the COVID-19 posts pointed to lower-credibility sources compared to other health content. We found that messages about COVID-19 contained proportionally more links to credible sources, with links to government websites and intermediate credibility sources more likely to go viral.  Most content from the least credible sources was not explicitly false. Beyond fact-checking efforts, our findings highlight the need to address non-falsifiable content when responding to the COVID-19 infodemic.       \n4 Main Text  Introduction  COVID-19, an illness caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus, is a potentially fatal disease that was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). On February 2, 2020, as the pandemic was still emerging and worldwide attention became focused on the outbreak, the World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 social media \u201cinfodemic\u201d \u2013 \u201can overabundance of information\u2014some accurate and some not\u2014that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it\u201d (1). Significant quantities of untrustworthy content shared online can hamper an effective public health response and create confusion and distrust among people, ultimately leading to significant loss of life. This concern led to a recent joint statement by the WHO and the United Nations (https://www.who.int/news/item/23-09-2020-managing-the-covid-19-infodemic-promoting-healthy-behaviours-and-mitigating-the-harm-from-misinformation-and-disinformation), and several other characterizing this infodemic by its propensity to propagate misinformation. Other high profile sources (2\u20134) have emphasized the spread of conspiracy theories, scams, and other explicit falsehoods that might lead to unhealthy behaviors and loss of life. The infodemic has thus been characterized as a \u201cmisinfodemic\u201d (11).  To our knowledge, no systematic evidence has been proffered to support the claim that COVID-19 is more likely to spread false content than other topics. We therefore seek to characterize the infodemic\u2019s scale and scope. Furthermore, if the infodemic is indeed characterized by false content, one might expect a higher proportion of this content to come primarily from sources that \u201clack the news media\u2019s editorial norms and processes for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of information\u201d (12). This should be especially true when comparing COVID-19 social media samples to equivalent samples pertaining to other topics. Prior estimates of the prevalence of credible content about COVID-19 (13\u201316) both vary widely and have not been compared to equivalent samples from other time periods, or other topics. Cross-platform comparisons are few in number (16). Thus, our first question is:  (1) Are posts about COVID-19 more likely to contain links to low-credibility sources when compared to other health topics?  To answer this question, we analyzed hundreds of millions of posts shared on the two largest social media platforms in the USA \u2013 Facebook and Twitter \u2013 and examined the volume and source credibility of URLs shared in these posts.  Beyond the sheer volume of links shared, one might define an \u201cinfodemic\u201d by the likelihood that a particular type of post might go viral. Thus, our second question is: (2) When it comes to COVID-19, were links to low-credibility news sources more likely to go viral? Like prior work (12, 14, 16\u201319), our analysis draws upon a widespread simplifying assumption: that \u201cthe attribution of \u2018fakeness\u2019 is \u2026 not at the level of the story but at that of the publisher.\u201d (17). This assumption is attractive because it is scalable, allowing researchers to analyze vast quantities of posts by characterizing their sources. If this assumption is true, we would expect most content from low-credibility sources to contain false claims. Thus, our third question is: (3) When it comes to COVID-19, did most links to low-credibility news sources contain false claims? There is significant variability within the broad category of misinformation, ranging from blatantly false conspiracy theories to claims that were once considered plausible but have been disproven. To better understand how source credibility varies with topic, we consider two COVID-19 misinformation topics: 1) the conspiracy theory that 5G wireless technologies cause COVID-19 \u2013 a conspiracy theory selected because it has no basis in scientific fact (https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1062362); 2) the claim that hydroxychloroquine is an effective COVID-19 treatment \u2013 selected because it reflected a case of genuine scientific uncertainty during the time period of our study (March \u2013 May, 2020), when leaders within the \n5 scientific community expressed caution, but no clinical trials had yet been conducted (20, 21). (Clinical trials have so far failed to demonstrate hydroxychloroquine\u2019s efficacy; https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-halts-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine. Nevertheless, WHO \u201cmythbusters\u201d currently states that \u201cmore decisive research is needed to assess [hydroxychloroquine\u2019s] value in patients with mild disease or as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.\u201d; https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus-covid-19/mythbusters).(22, 23).  Thus, our fourth question is: (4) When it comes to specific COVID-19 narratives pertaining to 5G wireless and hydroxychloroquine, which types of sources were more likely to spread which types of misinformative content? Beyond source credibility, several reports have alleged that state-sponsored actors used the infodemic to promote narratives advancing their geopolitical interests (6\u20138). If so, we would expect to see a relative increase in the number of links to state-sponsored propaganda outlets. Thus, our fifth question is:   (5) Was the proportion of links to state-sponsored sources larger for COVID-19 than for other health topics?   Results Dataset Statistics. We identified 599,745,125 posts on Twitter, Facebook Pages, and Facebook Groups containing keywords pertaining to COVID-19, vaccine-preventable illnesses, and other health conditions. These posts contained 169,201,404 URLs including 762,669 unique top-level domains (TLDs; see Table S1). 16,614 (2%) of these TLDs were assigned a credibility rating using NewsGuard or MediaBiasFactCheck scores, these TLDs accounted for 48% of all URLs shared after removing in-platform links (i.e., retweets and shares; Figure 1). An additional 80,539 (11%) TLDs were unrated but assigned a category by WebShrinker. More than 90% of URLs pointed to one of these categorized or rated TLDs.   Posts about COVID-19 are more likely to contain links to high-credibility sources when compared to other health topics. Across all datasets, quantities of \u201cMore Credible\u201d domains exceeded \u201cLess Credible\u201d and \u201cNot Credible\u201d domains combined.  Furthermore, compared to other health topics, COVID-19 datasets contained the highest proportions of rated URLs and, among these, the highest proportions of \u201cMore Credible\u201d URLs (all p<0.001; Table S2, Figure 2).  The least credible posts are not the most viral. In all COVID-19 datasets, posts containing URLs linking to \u201cnot credible news\u201d were never the most viral category. Compared to these posts, Government Website URLs were more viral on Twitter, B=0.51, p<0.001, and Facebook Pages, B=0.07, p<0.001. Additionally, middle range \u201cless credible\u201d news sources were shared significantly more than \u201cnot credible\u201d news sources on both Twitter, B=0.14, p<0.001, and in Facebook Groups, B=0.45, p<0.001 (Table S3).  A minority of posts to the least credible sources contained false content. Most claims from \u201cnot credible news\u201d sources were not false, although these claims were more likely to contain explicit falsehoods when compared to other categories (Figure S3). In a hand-annotated stratified random sample of 3000 posts, only 303 posts (10%) contained a reference to a false claim. However, among those with \u201cnot credible\u201d URLs, 145 (24%) contained false claims, a significantly higher rate, c2(1)=159.72, p<0.001. Results replicated when restricting analysis to 791 posts labeled as \u201cInformation/News\u201d, c2(1)=12.78, p<0.001.  More credible sources. In general, sources rated as more credible shared news and government announcements. Content was rarely political, although users posting links to these sources sometimes editorialized, often with liberal bias. Here, misinformation reported on, and potentially amplified, questionable content, such as explaining the 5G conspiracy theory or reporting on claims that bleach cures COVID.  Similarly, \u201cMore Credible\u201d URLs make up the plurality of links with posts containing keywords about hydroxychloroquine, although rates of \u201cless credible\u201d and \u201cnot credible\u201d URLs were also elevated (Figure 3; p<0.001 in all cases, see Table S3).  Some \n6 content also expressed uncertainty around COVID-19 science, pointing out limitations of data and models, and acknowledging major questions could not yet be answered.  Less credible sources. This intermediate category contained a variety of content (see Figure S4). Non-US politics were common, especially from Indian, Chinese, and European sources. Misinformation in this category included some political conspiracy theories, but also more subtle falsehoods including suggesting COVID is less severe than flu, promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure, or claiming that \u201clockdowns\u201d are an overreaction. This category also includes posts that attempted to debunk, but may have also amplified, false content.  Not credible sources. These sources contained the largest proportion of false content.  Common themes included: blaming China for the virus, questioning its origins, rejecting vaccines, and framing COVID as undermining President Trump. Here, content emphasizing scientific uncertainty suggested that response measures were unjustified or that science was distorted for political ends. Propaganda narratives often extolled Russian and Chinese COVID responses, but also reported on other news events. In general, logistic regression results showed that these sources, B=1.12, p<0.001, sources containing conservative politics in general, B=1.37, p<0.001, and sources emphasizing scientific uncertainty, B=2.82, p<0.001, were more likely to contain false content. Unrated and in platform sources. Figure 1 shows that the majority of URLs in any dataset were either unrated or links to other posts within the same social media platform. Inductive analysis shows that unrated and in platform content was similar, although unrated content included more links to businesses or online marketplaces (Figure S4).  In both categories, lifestyle updates included event cancellations, travel restrictions, or updated business information. General discussion content included first person COVID-19 narratives, and personal opinions about news and politics. Although the overall prevalence of misinformation in these categories is low (Figure 2), both categories included opportunistic posts using the COVID-19 narrative to sell products \u2013 especially putative COVID treatments or cures \u2013 or promote events. Finally, some posts shared conspiracist content linking to more detailed information. For example, Figure 4 shows that the plurality of URLs in posts discussing 5G were unrated (p<0.001 in all cases; see Table S3). Many of these URLs linked to other social media platforms, \u201carts & entertainment\u201d sites (especially podcasts) and \u201cunknown\u201d domains. Notably, the proportion of \u201cnot credible\u201d URLs discussing 5G increased compared to other COVID-19 data, whereas the proportion of \u201cmore credible\u201d and \u201cless credible\u201d URLs decreased. Tweets about COVID-19 were more likely to link to state-sponsored sources. On Twitter, 12 (60%) state-sponsored domains showed elevated levels of COVID content compared to health and vaccine content, of which 7 (58%) were scored as \u201cnot credible\u201d or \u201cless credible\u201d (see Table S5). These domains also had larger shares of the COVID dataset relative to both the health and vaccine datasets, when compared to the top non-state-sponsored domains (F(1,84)=26.21, p<0.001 for health, and F(1,84)=16.18, p<0.001, for vaccines). A significant two-way interaction showed that non-credible state-sponsored sources (in our dataset, from Russia, Iran, and China) also had larger shares of the COVID dataset than the vaccine dataset, F(2,83)=4.27, p=0.02, even though \u201cnot credible\u201d URLs made up a smaller share of the COVID-19 dataset overall, F(2,83)=4.00, p=0.03 and F(2,83)=6.67, p=0.003 compared to health and vaccines, respectively. These results did not replicate across other platforms (Figure 4; see Table S6).  Discussion  We are the first to compare the COVID-19 infodemic to other health topics across platforms. Like previous studies (14, 15, 18), we find that there is indeed an overwhelming amount of content pertaining to COVID-19 online. Although the COVID-19 \u201cinfodemic\u201d has been widely characterized as a vector for false content from low credibility sources, we found that links to credible sources were more widespread for COVID-19 than for other health topics. Furthermore, links to government sources were more viral than links to non-credible sources on both Twitter and Facebook. Finally, the majority of posts linking to non-credible sources were not false (although posts in this category were more likely to contain falsehoods than posts in other categories). This implies that attempts to characterize the information environment using low-credibility sources as a proxy for false claims may overestimate the prevalence of these claims. When combined with the finding that sources rated as \u201cnot credible\u201d were less likely to appear in \n7 the COVID-19 datasets, our results suggest that attempts to combat misinformation using \u201cmythbusters\u201d (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) or otherwise debunking false claims possibly may address only a small sliver of the infodemic.  Beyond explicitly false claims, our results suggest a large role for ambiguity, uncertainty, and attention in the infodemic. For example, credible news sources with large audiences may drive attention to misinformative content, as demonstrated by the fact that the plurality of URLs in posts discussing hydroxychloroquine \u2013 a putative cure for COVID-19 that WHO has labeled a \u201cbusted myth\u201d (https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus-covid-19/mythbusters#block-hydroxychloroquine) \u2013 pointed to more credible news sources. This is, in part, due to scientific uncertainty around this topic. Preliminary results seemed to support hydroxychloroquine\u2019s efficacy (20, 21), whereas later, more rigorous, trials did not (23, 28). Thus, according to some definitions (29), stories about hydroxychloroquine\u2019s efficacy were not, strictly speaking, misinformation at the time our data were gathered. Nevertheless, several sources promoted anecdotal evidence overstating its efficacy (likely associated with elevated rates of lower-credibility URLs), whereas others, including major political figures, promoted hydroxychloroquine as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d drawing extensive media attention and attempts to debunk this claim. In reporting on this topic, mainstream news sources may have amplified a claim that was ultimately proven false (30), but which social media platforms would have had difficulty defending as misinformative at the time.  This illustrates how discussion of misinformative content may spread through credible channels. these sources may intend to debunk, fact-check, or otherwise validate this content, inadvertently driving attention to it (30).  The role of ambiguity is further underscored by our finding that URLs with intermediate credibility scores were most viral on Twitter and in Facebook Groups. Content from this category was generally factual, yet presented in an opinionated manner, making it difficult for users to distinguish between fact, opinion, misinformation, and satire. Additionally, dubious claims may frequently arise from outside the news ecosystem. Several URLs \u2013 including the plurality of those discussing a conspiracy about 5G wireless technologies and COVID-19 \u2013 pointed to user-generated content (social media platforms and podcasts), which cannot be assigned a credibility score. Neither credibility ratings nor fact-checkers can be deployed at the scale required to assess all such content. Furthermore, there is no legitimate expectation that user-generated content is subject to journalistic fact-checking standards or academic peer review.   State-sponsored propaganda also appears to trade on this ambiguity: COVID-19 tweets were more likely to contain links to lower-credibility state-sponsored media, which prior authors have associated with harmful propaganda (5, 31).  Clearly, COVID-19 was of more importance to some governments than were other health topics, consistent with previous work showing how states weaponize true and false information to promote geopolitical aims  . These sources often shared content that was not, strictly speaking, factually inaccurate, although it may have promoted a narrative with geopolitical overtones (e.g., that the US is a declining power, or by critiquing flaws in Western societies).  Notably, these results seem localized to Twitter. One possible explanation for this difference may be the extent to which Twitter affords artificial amplification compared to Facebook (30).  Although credibility ratings are important tools for characterizing the information environment, several sources remain to be categorized, highlighting the fact that misinformation often travels through channels outside of the news ecosystem. The swiftly-evolving online environment with significant user-generated content therefore calls into question the coverage of automated techniques based solely on source (31). Even among news sources, several non-Western, and especially African, websites were unrated, reflecting an opportunity for rating systems to expand to new media markets.   Limitations Measures of URL prevalence are an indicator of information availability rather than information consumption. Thus, we cannot claim that data from social media are representative of the general public. Indeed, news sources may be more likely to be shared by automated accounts (\u201cbots\u201d) than other types of tweets, especially when those bots serve as news aggregators (13). Furthermore, our study does not account for the fact that links to low credibility sources may \n8 sometimes be shared insincerely or sarcastically. However, to the extent that this may occur, these posts may have inadvertently amplified these sources, contributing to the overall confusion of the infodemic. Our inclusion criteria for social media data are based on keywords associated with COVID-19, vaccine-preventable illnesses, and other health conditions. This collection procedure might introduce some noise in our dataset, for example if online actors exploited the virality of the COVID-19 hashtags/keywords to promote their content. However, these opportunistic posts are a key feature of the \u201cinfodemic\u201d. Indeed, our inclusion criteria are consistent with the very definition of the infodemic. For example, a WHO/PAHO fact sheet from May 1, 2020 (https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/52052/Factsheet-infodemic_eng.pdf?sequence=14&isAllowed=y), defines the \u201cinfodemic\u201d using keyword search terms that are similar to ours. Other studies of the \u201cinfodemic\u201d have taken the same approach (15, 18). This approach will necessarily contain content that is not, strictly speaking, health information, it does meet WHO\u2019s definition of \u201ca large increase in the volume of information associated with a specific topic and whose growth can occur exponentially in a short period of time due to a specific incident, such as the current pandemic. In this situation, misinformation and rumors appear on the scene, along with manipulation of information with doubtful intent.\u201d (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/52052). Nevertheless, to address this point, we included an \u201copportunistic\u201d category in our annotation scheme. Our results show that this opportunistic content made up only a small percentage of overall content, with opportunistic links primarily found within the \u201cin platform\u201d and \u201cunrated\u201d categories, as expected. More broadly, this finding speaks to the difficulty of automatically rating all URLs.   Conclusions Explicitly false claims about health appear a small, yet significant, feature of online health conversations. However, our results reflect a complex information environment that can\u2019t be characterized by simple \u201cfalse\u201d vs. \u201ctrue\u201d dichotomy of online content (32, 33). Although prior work has shown that the proportion of information from low credibility sources is quite small, our results demonstrate that these proportions are even smaller for COVID-19 tweets. Thus, attempts to combat misinformation that focus on low credibility sources may be missing the larger body of misinformation that is factually mixed, or even true, yet out of context, or that has changed significantly over time. Under pandemic conditions, source credibility may be a false signal of misinformative content. Beyond these considerations, we find that most content is unrated. Even if we were able to rate all sources according to meaningful credibility metrics, news aggregation sites or social media platforms that disseminate user-generated content do not employ fact-checkers at the scale required to provide credibility assessments for all of their content. Furthermore, there is no legitimate expectation that user-generated content is subject to the same fact-checking standards as journalistic, government, or academic sources. Nevertheless, this content is overwhelming in scope and varied in style, making it difficult for users to distinguish between fact, opinion, misinformation, and satire. This further underscores the importance of distinguishing between disinformation -- content that is generated for malicious purposes by non-credible actors -- and misinformation that may come about due to the search for meaning in a legitimately uncertain environment.  During an emerging pandemic, scientific findings lag public demand for answers. As perceptions of what is true change, there is an urgent need to manage expectations that public health recommendations may change without eroding trust. In contrast, fact-checkers and \u201cmythbusters\u201d tend to address settled knowledge and clear falsehoods. Although these tools are an important component of the scientific community\u2019s response to the pandemic, they appear not to address some of the most viral content that trades on uncertainty and ambiguity.  Although some may expect social media platforms to filter out or downrank misinformation our work shows that current methods based solely on credibility ratings may remove factual content and miss false content. Furthermore, platforms may not be equipped to respond to content that trades on uncertainty, since they evade rationales for removing explicit falsehoods. Thus, addressing the spread of misinformation during an infodemic cannot be the sole provenance of social media platforms; rather, it requires a coordinated effort between platforms, responsible news providers, public health officials, and government spokespeople. Our research points to the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computational \n9 scientists, and health, social, and communication scholars, to solve the problem of providing gists (34) \u2013 informed, contextualized human insights \u2013  to the public at Internet scale during a pandemic.     Materials and Methods  Data Collection. We collected English language tweets from Twitter matching keywords pertaining to COVID-19 (35), generalized health topics (36), and vaccine-preventable illnesses between March 7, 2020 and May 1, 2020 (37) (see Supplementary Material for keywords). Health and vaccine tweets were collected for the same dates in 2019, yielding 5 datasets overall. We next collected comparable data from Facebook Pages, and Facebook Groups for the same dates using CrowdTangle (38), yielding 10 more datasets. COVID-19 Facebook posts were collected on June 2, 2020, and Facebook posts for vaccine and health keywords were collected on July 13-14, 2020.   Credibility Categorization. We extracted all Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) in each post. We identified each URL\u2019s top-level domain (TLD; (39)), unshortening links (e.g., \"bit.ly/x11234b\") if necessary (40). We enumerated the frequency of each TLD in each dataset. Next, we assigned each TLD a credibility rating between 0-100 using data collected July 5, 2020 from the NewsGuard database (https://www.NewsGuardTech.com/) and the MediaBiasFactCheck website (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) averaging these scores if a TLD was rated by both. TLDs with credibility scores of 66.67 or higher were rated as \u201cMore Credible\u201d, whereas those scored 33.33 or lower were rated as \u201cNot Credible\u201d. Government (e.g., .gov) and academic (e.g., .edu) websites were assigned to the \u201cMore Credible\u201d category and sites rated by MediaBiasFactCheck as \u201cQuestionable\u201d were rated as \u201cNot Credible\u201d if they did not have a numerical rating. TLDs  scoring between 33.33 and 66.67 were rated as \u201cless credible\u201d. The remaining TLDs were marked as \u201cunrated\u201d. Among these unrated TLDs, we labeled digital platforms (e.g., YouTube) and satire websites as such, and used the Webshrinker Category API (https://docs.webshrinker.com/) to assign the remaining domains into discrete content categories until at least 90% of all URLs were assigned a label (not counting in-platform URLs: e.g., links to facebook.com from Facebook or twitter.com from Twitter). The remaining domains were labeled as \u201cNot categorized\u201d.   Virality Analysis. We conducted negative binomial regressions for each COVID dataset to predict the number of shares or retweets for each post (Facebook and Twitter share counts were current as of June 2, 2020, and May 31, 2020, respectively). Retweets were removed, since retweets report the retweet count of the original tweet. We used subcategories of TLD within the same credibility category (e.g., government vs. more credible news) as predictors since our sample size enabled us to differentiate between them. Facebook posts could have at most one URL each, but Twitter posts could have multiple URLs (although the modal post only had one URL, see Supplementary Material). We thus assigned each tweet to the credibility category of its least credible URL (see Supplementary Material).   Qualitative Analysis. To determine the content of each credibility category, we developed a codebook (see Supplementary Material) to assess the presence of false claims, scientific uncertainty, partisan bias, and one of five inductively-inferred content categories (politics, opportunistic, lifestyle/social, information/news, and general discussion). We next randomly selected 200 posts from each COVID-19 dataset for each credibility category (More, Less, and Not Credible, and Unrated). We also annotated 200 posts with in-platform links as a baseline for each platform, yielding a total of 3000 posts. Three authors (DK, FF, and AMJ) manually labeled batches of 100 posts each until annotators achieved high interrater reliability (Krippendorff\u2019s a>0.8, see Supplementary Materials), which we obtained on the second round (a=0.811). Disagreements were resolved by majority and ties adjudicated by a fourth author (DAB).  The remaining 2400 posts were then split equally between all three annotators. We also generated qualitative descriptions for each credibility category. We examined the prevalence of false claims \n10 and scientific uncertainty in each credibility category using distribution-free chi-square tests and logistic regressions (see Table S4).  Analysis of Hydroxychloroquine and 5G Posts. For each topic, we calculated the proportion of all URLs in each credibility category and compared these proportions to all remaining URLs in the COVID-19 datasets using distribution-free chi-square tests.  Analysis of State-Sponsored Propaganda. We examined whether state-sponsored propaganda was more likely to be shared in the context of COVID-19 when compared to other health topics. We used the NewsGuard database to identified the TLDs of 37 state-sponsored news outlets, representing 13 different nations. We also generated a comparator dataset of 51 non-state-sponsored news TLDs that were among the top ten most frequently shared TLDs in at least one of the three credibility rating categories for the three COVID datasets. (3 government public health websites also appeared in the top ten \u201cmore credible\u201d TLDs, but were excluded because they were not news sites). For each TLD, we computed a log odds ratio capturing how much more likely a TLD was to be represented in a platform\u2019s COVID-19 dataset compared to the corresponding health and vaccine datasets (see Supplementary Material).  We next used distribution-free chi-square tests to determine if URLs from state-sponsored sources made up a larger share of the COVID-19 datasets compared to other datasets. To rule out the possibility that these differences were due to increased reporting on COVID-19 overall, we conducted two-way ANOVAs to determine how these log-odds ratios varied with state-sponsorship (compared to top non-state-sponsored news) and credibility category.

We suggest to break the\nbroad policy frames suggested by Boydstun\net al., 2014 into \ufb01ne-grained subframes which\ncan capture differences in political ideology\nin a better way. We evaluate the suggested\nsubframes and their embedding, learned us-\ning minimal supervision, over three topics,\nnamely, immigration, gun-control and abor-\ntion. We demonstrate the ability of the sub-\nframes to capture ideological differences and\nanalyze political discourse in news media.\n1 Introduction\nAs the political climate and the news media in\nthe United States become increasingly polar-\nized (Prior, 2013; Pew Research Center, 2018),\nit is important to understand the perspectives\nunderlying the political divisions and analyze\ntheir differences. Political framing, studied by\npolitical scientists (Entman, 1993; Chong and\nDruckman, 2007), provides the means to study\nthese perspectives. It is a nuanced political strategy,\nused to bias the discussion on an issue towards a\nspeci\ufb01c stance by emphasizing speci\ufb01c aspects\nthat prime the reader to accept that stance. To help\nclarify this de\ufb01nition, consider two articles on the\nhighly polarized immigration issue.\nExample 1: Different Perspectives on Immigration\nAdapted from Alternet (Left)\nEmployees-many of whom are undocumented immigrants\nfrom Mexico, Ecuador and elsewhere-toil seven days a\nweek for less than minimum wage, with no overtime pay.\nAdapted from Breitbart (Right )\nMass immigration has come at the expense of America\u2019s\nworking and middle class, which suffered from poor job\ngrowth, stagnant wages, and increased public costs.The two articles capture opposite political per-\nspectives, liberal (top) and conservative (bottom).\nThey do not directly contradict each other, instead\nthey focus the discussion on different aspects help-\ning them argue their case. The \ufb01rst emphasiz-\ning the deprivation of minimum wage for immi-\ngrants, and the second emphasizing implication on\nwages for U.S. workers. This process is known as\nframing . Our goal is to de\ufb01ne, and automatically\nidentify, relevant framing dimensions in politically-\nmotivated coverage of news events to the extent\nthey can capture and explain the differences in per-\nspectives across the conservative-liberal ideologi-\ncal divide (Ellis and Stimson, 2012; Preo t \u00b8iuc-Pietro\net al., 2017). We focus on three divisive topics \u2013\nimmigration, gun-control and abortion.\nPrevious work by Boydstun et al. (2014) stud-\nied policy issue framing on news media and sug-\ngested 15 broad frames to analyze how issues are\nframed, which include economic, morality andse-\ncurity , among others. These framing dimensions\ncan help capture ideological splits (Johnson et al.,\n2017b). For example, by framing the immigration\nissue using the morality frame or using the security\nframe, the reader is primed to accept the liberal or\nconservative perspectives, respectively. However,\nas shown in Example 1, in some cases this analysis\nis too coarse grained, as both articles frame the\nissue using the economic frame, suggesting that a\n\ufb01ner grained analysis is needed to capture the dif-\nferences in perspective. To help resolve this issue,\nwe suggest a data-driven re\ufb01nement, trained with\nminimal supervision effort.\nOur approach works in three steps. First, we con-\nstruct topic-speci\ufb01c lexicons capturing the way the\nframes are instantiated in each topic. In the second\nstep, we identify repeating expressions used in the\ncontext of the different frames, and group them to\nform subframes which separate between different\nusages of the same frame to express different po-arXiv:2009.09609v1  [cs.CL]  21 Sep 2020\nlitical perspectives. In Example 1, Minimum Wage\nEconomy andSalary Stagnation are both subframes\nof the Economy frame, which capture the ideologi-\ncal differences in the two articles. We use external\nknowledge sources to identify relevant subframes\nfor each topic and rely on human judgements to\nmatch the repeating expressions with these sub-\nframes. Finally, we exploit this resource to train\nan embedding model, which represents in the same\nspace the subframes labels, the lexicon containing\nsubframes indicator expressions and paragraphs ex-\ntracted from news articles containing these expres-\nsions. The embedding model captures the context\nin which subframe appear, and as a result can gen-\neralize and capture subframe usage in new texts.\nOur approach can be viewed as a middle ground\nbetween event-speci\ufb01c frames, emerging from the\ndata and capturing properties unique to the given\ntopic (Tsur et al., 2015; Demszky et al., 2019), and\ngeneral issue frames (Boydstun et al., 2014; Card\net al., 2015b; Johnson et al., 2017a; Field et al.,\n2018; Hartmann et al., 2019) that use the same set\nof framing dimensions for all topics. On the one\nhand, it can capture nuanced, topic-speci\ufb01c sub-\nframes, while on the other, it maps these subframes\ninto general framing dimensions. In the above ex-\nample, it allows us to identify that the economy\nframe is important for both the liberal and conser-\nvative perspectives on immigration, despite the fact\nthat it is instantiated using a different subframe.\nWe evaluate the quality of the learned model in\nseveral ways, by applying it politically-motivated\nnews article coverage of divisive topics. First, we\nshow that the lexicon we developed and the induced\nsub-frames can effectively separate between ideo-\nlogical standpoints expressed in the articles. Sec-\nond, we evaluate the quality of the learned model,\nshowing that subframe labels assigned to new para-\ngraphs correlate well with human judgements. Fi-\nnally, we use the model to analyze the different\nperspectives in left and right leaning news cover-\nage, and their change over time.\n2 Related Work\nUnderstanding and analyzing political perspectives\nin news coverage has gathered signi\ufb01cant interest\nin recent years (Lin et al., 2006; Greene and Resnik,\n2009; Iyyer et al., 2014; Li and Goldwasser, 2019;\nFan et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019; Hanawa et al.,\n2019), broadly related to analysis of bias or parti-\nsanship and expressions of implicit sentiment (Re-casens et al., 2013; Baumer et al., 2015; Field et al.,\n2018; Gentzkow et al., 2016; Monroe et al., 2008;\nAn et al., 2019; Menini et al., 2017). In addition\nto predicting the underlying perspective, our work\nfocuses on explaining the perspectives underlying\nthe ideological coverage of news events. We build\nspeci\ufb01cally on issue-frames (Boydstun et al., 2014),\nhowever our work is related to framing and agenda\nsetting analysis work more broadly (Tsur et al.,\n2015; Baumer et al., 2015; Fulgoni et al., 2016;\nField et al., 2018; Demszky et al., 2019).\n3 Data Collection\nWe collected 21;645 news articles on three po-\nlitically polarized topics, abortion, immigration\nand gun control . We used the hyper-partisan\nnews dataset (Kiesel et al., 2019) and we crawled\nadditional news articles on the topics from\nsources with known political bias provided by\nmediabiasfactcheck.com , where the articles are\ncategorized based on their topics on the websites of\nthe sources. All the news articles are U.S. politics\nbased and written in English. We identify the topic\nof news articles in the hyper-partisan news dataset\nby looking at presence of certain keywords in the\ntitles and urls of news articles. For example, \u2018abor-\ntion\u2019 for topic abortion ; \u2018migrant\u2019, \u2018migration\u2019 for\ntopic immigration ; \u2018gun\u2019 for topic gun control . In\ncase of absence of any of the keywords in the title or\nurl, we annotate the article with the corresponding\ntopic if the keywords appear at least 3times in the\narticle text. The hyper-partisan news dataset pro-\nvides bias-labels of the news articles and we labeled\nour crawled news articles based on their source bias\naccording to mediabiasfactcheck.com . We con-\nsider only the left and right biased news articles.\nThe dataset is summarized in Table 1.\nAbortion Immigration Gun Control\n# of News Articles 6,476 8,516 6,653\n# of Left Articles 3,437 3,496 3,198\n# of Right Articles 3,039 5,020 3,455\n# of Paragraphs 106,931 135,479 95,872\nSpan of Year 1984-2019 2000-2019 1996-2019\n>80%-Articles Since 2010 2016 2011\nTable 1: Dataset Summary. (Articles are split into para-\ngraphs by newline character.)\n4 Modeling Political Framing\nOur goal in this paper is to identify framing di-\nmensions that can be used to capture difference\nbetween the two ideological polarities. The frames\nused for this analysis could be issue speci\ufb01c, or\nas suggested by Boydstun et al. (2014), general-\nize over several policy issues, using a \ufb01xed set of\nframing dimensions. In many cases, as we show\nin this paper, the general policy frames do not cap-\nture the nuanced aspects of the issue highlighted\nby each side to bias the discussion. In Example 1,\nboth sides use the economy frame, however it is\ninstantiated in different ways, to promote opposite\nviews. To help combat this issue, we suggest a mid-\ndle ground between generalized policy frames and\nevent-speci\ufb01c frames, by constructing a hierarchy\nof frames and sub-frames, the \ufb01rst derived from the\nde\ufb01nitions and data of media frames corpus (Card\net al., 2015a), and the second emerging from the\ndata directly, by tracking the differences in the vo-\ncabulary used when these frames are instantiated in\ndifferent topics, and grouping them to sub-frames.\nThis process takes place in three steps. First,\nwe create a lexicon of topic speci\ufb01c phrases cap-\nturing how the frame is invoked in each policy is-\nsue. Second, we manually group these phrases into\nsubframes. Finally, we embed the sub-frames us-\ning weak-supervision, allowing us to associate sub-\nframes with new text, beyond the extracted phrases.\nThe following subsections explain each step.\n4.1 Extending Frame Lexicon\nStep 1: Annotate news article paragraphs\nwith policy frames. We follow the procedure\nsuggested and validated by Field et al. (2018), and\nuse the media frame corpus to derive a unigram\nlexicon for each of the 15policy frames (Boydstun\net al. (2014)) based on their Pointwise Mutual\nInformation (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990).\nWe use the 250top-PMI words for each of the\nframes. We discard unigrams which occur in less\nthan 0:5%of the documents and more than 98%\nof the documents, the same thresholds used by\nField et al. (2018). We de\ufb01ne these unigrams as\nframe indicators , and use them to annotate our\ndata. We break the articles in our dataset into\nparagraphs, and annotate them by ranking frames\nusing the number of lexicon matches. We use the\ntop2frames per paragraph. Since news articles\ncan cover a topic from multiple angles, we identify\nframes in paragraph level instead of article level.\nStep 2: Building Topic-speci\ufb01c Lexicons. We\nhypothesize that the frame-level analysis cannot\ncapture nuanced talking points. In Example 1, bothtexts use the Economic frame using same unigram\nindicator (\u2018wage\u2019). However, other words in the\ntext can help identify the nuanced talking points\n(e.g., \u2018minimum wage\u2019 in case of left and \u2018stag-\nnant wages\u2019 in case of right). We follow this in-\ntuition, and extend the frame-level dictionary to\ntopic-speci\ufb01c frame lexicon, using bi-gram and\ntri-gram phrases extracted from the annotated para-\ngraphs with frames in Step 1. For an n-gram gwe\ncalculate the PMI with frame f,I(g;f), as follows:\nI(g;f) = logP(gjf)\nP(g)\nWhereP(gjf)is computed by taking all para-\ngraphs annotated with frame fand computing\ncount (g)\ncount (allngrams )and similarly, P(g)is computed\nby counting n-gram gover the whole corpus. We\nassign each n-gram to the frame with highest PMI\nscore and build an n-gram lexicon for each frame.\nWe did not consider bi-grams or tri-grams appear-\ning in more than 50% of the paragraphs and less\nthan0:02% of the paragraphs. The process is topic-\nspeci\ufb01c, resulting in three lexicons, one for each\ntopic we study in this paper. Following this proce-\ndure we found 4;116bigrams and 1;787trigrams\nfor the topic abortion ,3;293bigrams and 1;451\ntrigrams for the topic gun control ,3;743bigrams\nand1;385trigrams for the topic immigration . We\nde\ufb01ne these n-grams as subframe indicators .\nStep 3: Lexicon Validation. We hypothesize\nthat the topic-speci\ufb01c subframe indicators capture\npolitical perspective better than the frame indica-\ntors. To validate this claim we compare the corre-\nlation between the usage of frame and subframe\nindicators in left and right biased news articles. We\nbreak the dataset into left and right biased docu-\nments. Each group is associated with a ranked list\nof frames and sub-frames indicators, based on their\naveraged tf-idf scores in all documents with the\nsame political bias. Then we compare the ranks us-\ning Spearman\u2019s Rank Correlation Coef\ufb01cient (Zar,\n2005) where coef\ufb01cient 1means perfect correla-\ntion. Table 2 validates our claim. It shows that the\nframe indicator lists have a much higher correlation\ncompared to subframe indicators, indicating their\nusage by both sides with similar importance.\nWe investigate the expressivity of the two in-\ndicator groups by using them as one-hot features\nwhen classifying the political bias of documents\nusing a simple logistic regression classi\ufb01er. The re-\nsults in Table 3 shows that the subframe indicators\nTOPICSFRAME INDICATORS\nRANK CORR. COEF.SUBFRAME INDICATORS\nRANK CORR.

We also in-\ncluded two strong contextualized feature represen-\ntation: BERT (base-uncased) (Devlin et al., 2018)\nand hierarchical-LSTM (HLSTM) (Hochreiter and\nSchmidhuber, 1997). BERT used the \ufb01rst 512to-\nkens of each article. In HLSTM, we run a biLSTM\nover the 300dGLOVE (Pennington et al., 2014)\nwords embeddings in each paragraph, and average\ntheir hidden states to repreent the paragraph, a sec-\nond bidirectional LSTM was used to create the \ufb01-\nnal representation for the news article in 300d. The\nsubframe indicator feature outperforms HLSTM in\nall three topics and BERT in case of immigration.\n4.2 Identi\ufb01cation of Subframes\nOur next step is to identify the nuanced subframes\ncaptured by the subframe indicators lexicon we\nextracted. We use human knowledge to guide this\nprocess, such that each general frame can be decom-\nposed into multiple sub-frames, by grouping repeat-\ning subframe indicators (i.e. n-grams associated\nwith each frame) to known political talking points.\nFor example, in case of abortion , the phrases\n\u2018Hobby Lobby\u2019, \u2018freedom restoration act\u2019 discuss a\nsimilar issue and can be grouped together to form\na subframe (which we denoted as \u2018Hobby Lobby\u2019).\nWe extracted the talking points from Wikipedia\nandontheissues.com , which maintains political\nperspectives on these issues. We did not consider\nthe frames \u2018Political\u2019 and \u2018Others\u2019 categories, as\nall of the three topics are political. We only fo-\ncused on frames relevant for our three topics. For\nexample, \u2018Security and Defense\u2019 is not related tothe topic abortion . Table 4, shows all the identi\ufb01ed\nsubframes, their parent frames.

The indicators\ncan be used for annotating the text directly, as sug-\ngested by (Field et al., 2018), however we note that\nthey only cover 16:03%,11:51% and11:22% of\nthe paragraphs in the topics abortion, immigration\nand gun control respectively. Instead we use the\nindicators as a seed set for a weakly-supervised\nlearning process, which intends to generalize the\nsubframe analysis to new text that does not con-\ntain the seed subframe indicators, by capturing the\nrelevant context in which these indicators appear.\nTo identify subframes in paragraphs that do not\ncontain a subframe indicator, we embed the news\narticles, broken into paragraphs, the complete sub-\nframe indicator lexicon and the subframe labels in\na common embedding space. The embedding space\nis shaped by following two objectives: (1) the simi-\nlarity between the embedding of a paragraph and a\nsubframe indicator is maximized if it appears in the\nparagraph, (2) the similarity between the embed-\nding of a subframe indicator and its corresponding\nsubframe is maximized. We brie\ufb02y describe the\nembedding learning objective as follows. Given\nan instanceo, a positive example mpand a nega-\ntive example mn, whereois needed to be closer to\nmpand far from mnin the embedding space, the\nembedding loss is de\ufb01ned:\nEr(o;mp;mn) =l(sim(o;mp);sim(o;mn))\nHere,Erde\ufb01nes the embedding loss for objective\ntyper(paragraph to subframe indicator or sub-\nframe indicator to subframe label). Our goal is\nto maximize the similarity of a node embedding\nwith a positive example and minimize the similar-\nity with a negative example. We call a subframe\nindicator a positive example for a paragraph, if the\nparagraph contains the subframe indicator. Sim-\nilarly, a subframe label is a positive example for\na subframe indicator, if it is an indicator of the\nsubframe. We randomly sample 5negative exam-\nples for each positive example from the subset of\nsubframe indicator not present in a paragraph and\ndo the same in case of the subframe indicator to\nsubframe label objective. As, a similarity function\n(sim()) we use dot product and l()is cross-entropy\nloss which is de\ufb01ned as follow.\nl(p;n) =\u0000log(esim(o;mp)\nesim(o;mp)+esim(o;mn))\nNow, for all kind of objectives we can minimize the\nsummed lossP\nr2R\u0015rEr, whereRis the set of all\nkind of objective functions and \u0015ris the weight of\nloss for objective function of type r. We initialized\n\u0015r= 1, for both objectives.\nWe initialize the embeddings of subframe in-\ndicators and subframe labels randomly and the\nparagraph embeddings are obtained by running\na bidirectional-LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhu-\nber, 1997) over the Glove (Pennington et al., 2014)\nword embeddings of the words of the paragraph.\nWe concatenated the hidden states of the two oppo-\nsite directional LSTMs to get representation over\none time-stamp and average the representations\nof all time-stamps to get a single representation\nof the paragraph. All the embeddings are initial-\nized in a 300dspace. We train this bidirectional-\nLSTM jointly with the embedding learning. We\nstop learning if the embeddings learning loss does\nnot decrease for 10epochs or reach at 100epochs.\nDataset and codes can be found at https://\ngithub.com/ShamikRoy/Subframe-PredictionAfter the embeddings learning we can get a dis-\ntribution over all of the subframe labels for each\nparagraph which is based on the cosine similarity\nbetween the embeddings of the paragraph and sub-\nframe labels. Thus our model combined with the\nlabeled n-grams have the ability to expand the sub-\nframe labels to unlabeled text from other domains\nof the same topics without any human evaluation.\nEvaluating the Embedding Space. We evaluate\nthe resulting embedding in two ways. First, we in-\nterpret the correctness of the subframe representa-\ntionin the embedding space by evaluating whether\nthe paragraphs most similar to it, actually express\nthat subframe based on human judgement. In the\nsecond evaluation, we randomly sample articles\nand use the embedding space similarity to predict\nrelevant subframes. In both cases we intentionally\nuse instances that do not include explicit subframe\nindicators, in order to evaluate the model\u2019s ability\nto generalize beyond the lexicon. We compare our\nembedding space to topic-model baseline, using\nthe same subframe indicators as a seed set.\nTopic Model Baseline. We compare our model\nwith guided LDA (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012), a vari-\nant of LDA (Blei et al., 2003) where topics can\nbe guided based on world knowledge. Traditional\nLDA assigns uniform Dirichlet prior to each word\nover all topics. Guided LDA assigns more bias\nto the seed words of a topic which are believed\nto be true representatives of the topic. Consider-\ning each subframe as a topic, we used the anno-\ntated indicators as the seed phrases. We learn the\nguided LDA model over stemmed unigrams, bi-\ngrams and trigrams. To omit out stop words and\nrarely used words we discarded phrases occurring\nin less than 0:005% and more than 80% of the para-\ngraphs. Now, we compare our model with guided\nLDA in the following two ways.\n(1) Subframe Prediction Evaluation. We eval-\nuate our model\u2019s performance when identifying\nsubframes in new paragraphs compared to guided\nLDA. We take top 20most similar paragraphs un-\nder each subframe identi\ufb01ed by each model and\nask human annotators to evaluate if the content\nof the paragraphs match with the subframe label.\nWe chose the paragraphs which did not have the\nseed n-grams in their content, so we take the para-\ngraphs that are newly identi\ufb01ed. For abortion, im-\nmigration and gun control, it resulted in 400,440\nand380such examples respectively. We shuf\ufb02ed\nthe paragraphs identi\ufb01ed by the two models while\npresenting to the annotators. We asked 2gradu-\nate students individually to perform the task by\nproviding them with the subframe descriptions (in\nAppendix C). We found the Cohen\u2019s kappa (Co-\nhen, 1960) score between the annotators to be 0:83\nimplying almost perfect agreement. In case of a\ndisagreement, we asked a 3rd annotator to break\nthe tie who is a researcher in Computational Social\nScience. Based on the majority voting our model\noutperforms guided LDA (Table 5).\nMODELS ABORT . I MM.

We take the av-\nerage distribution of all the paragraphs and output\ntop-kmost probable subframes as summary of the\nnews article. To reduce noise, we restrict the value\nofkto3. Similarly, we get the top- 3subframes for\neach news article using the guided LDA model. We\nrandomly sampled 10articles from each side (left,\nright) for each topic resulting in 60articles, and\nidenti\ufb01ed their top- 3subframes using our model\nand guided LDA. We asked 2graduate students to\nannotate individually which set of subframes best\ndescribe the talking point of the news article. We\nfound the Cohen\u2019s kappa score of 0:63which im-\nplies substantial agreement. In case of a tie, we\nbreak the tie by the 3rd annotator. While selecting\nthe news articles, we considered news articles not\nhaving any of the seed indicators and having at\nleast 300and at most 500words. Based on major-\nity voting, In case of abortion, immigration and gun\ncontrol respectively 16,18and15news articles are\nbetter described using our model than guided LDA\nout of 20in each topic. In case of Immigration, 1\nnews article had the same top 3subframes by both\nof the models.\n5 Analyzing Polarization on News Media\nIn this section we show how our model can be used\nto analyze polarization on news media.

The ranking scores are obtained by taking the\nnormalized rank of the frames and subframes where the\nhighest ranked instance get a score of 1. The rankings\nare over all news articles in the topic Abortion.\nand our subframe approach. Similar to the previous\nsection, we identify the top 3 subframes in a news\narticle using the embedding model. To compare\nwith frame usage, we identify the top 3frames for\neach news article by following the same process\nused by Field et al. (2018), counting the number of\nword occurrences in an article from a frame lexicon\nand taking the most frequent 3as predicted frames.\n5.1 Overall Frame and Subframe Usage\nTo compare frame and subframe usage between and\nwithin ideologies, we create a ranked list of frames\nand subframes based on their occurrence frequency\nin articles identi\ufb01ed with each ideology. We create\nranked list for each year, and calculate the average\ncorrelation between the lists each year, between\nideologies to capture how similar are the framing\ndimensions, and within ideologies by calculating\nthe correlation between pairs of consecutive years\nwithin the same ideology, measuring the change in\nperspectives over time in each ideological camp.\nWe use Spearman\u2019s Rank Correlation Coef\ufb01cient\nto measure the agreement between rankings.

Subframes used\nless than 20% of the time in context are rounded down to zero for a cleaner representation purpose.\n6 show the correlations averaged over years 2014 -\n2019 . We take this time frame as it accounts for\nthe majority of news articles in all 3topics (Table\n1). Less agreement between ideologies in subframe\nusage than frame usage shows that subframe anal-\nysis can better capture the polarization. Figure 1\nshows this polarity for the topic abortion . Sub-\nframes related to the fetus life is more used by the\nright while reproduction rights related subframes\n(Roe V . Wade, Women Freedom) are more focused\nby the left. In frame usage the parties are almost\nidentical. This \ufb01gure also shows that frames like\n\u2018Security and Defense\u2019 are least used by each ide-\nology which supports our claim in the subframe\ncreation step that some frames are irrelevant to cer-\ntain topics. Polarization graph for other two topics\nare shown in Appendix G. Less agreement in sub-\nframe usage than frame usage within parties over\nyears (in Table 6) implies that parties use different\nsubframes at different times, possibly in response\nto events occurred at that time. This hypothesis is\nfurther qualitatively analyzed in Section 5.3.\n5.2 Subframes Instantiation Differences\nTo help get a better understanding of how sub-\nframes are used by each side, we analyze their\nco-occurrence. We represent this information us-\ning heatmaps. Each row in the heatmap captures\nthe association strength between a given subframe\n(y-axis) and all the other subframes. The heatmap\ncell colors represents the percentage of times the\ntwo subframes appear in the same context.\nThe heatmaps for abortion are shown in Fig-ure 2 for both of the sides, and demonstrates how\nsubframes are used differently by each side. For\nexample, when the left talks about \u2018Women Free-\ndom\u2019, it is used in the context of \u2018Reproduction\nRight\u2019 and \u2018Health Care\u2019, implying the association\nbetween concepts. On the other hand, the right\nuses \u2018Sanctity of Life\u2019, \u2018Life Protection\u2019 in the con-\ntext of \u2018Women Freedom\u2019, implying they counter\nthe issue of women freedom with the necessity of\nprotecting lives of the unborn babies. In case of\ndiscussing \u2018Hobby Lobby\u2019, the left relates it with\n\u2018Roe V . Wade\u2019, possibly their con\ufb02icts, while the\nright relates \u2018Hobby Lobby\u2019 with life protection\nissues more. Heatmaps for other two topics are\nshown in Appendix F.\n5.3 Differences in Event News Coverage\nTo investigate how event news coverage differs\nacross ideological lines, we pick 3de\ufb01ning events,\none in each topic, and investigate the usage of\nframes and subframes by either side around the\ntime of those events. The events are as follows1.\n\u000fAbortion Event: Undercover videos released\non July 14, 2015 showing an of\ufb01cial at\nPlanned Parenthood discussing how to abort\na fetus and preserve the organs and the costs\nassociated with sharing that tissue with sci-\nentists. These videos and the defunding of\nPlanned Parenthood came in presidential can-\ndidates\u2019 debates.

Articles on topic Abortion are taken from 6 months period from the planned\nparenthood video leaking; on topic Immigration from Jul 1, 2018 to Jan 31, 2018; on topic Gun Control 1 month\nperiod from the shooting date. In case of Abortion, we don\u2019t consider the subframes \u2019pro-life\u2019, \u2019anti-abortion\u2019 and\n\u2019pro-choice\u2019 while ranking as they capture addressing framing.\nPlanned Parenthood health center in Colorado\nby a shooter.\n\u000fImmigration Event: In the 2018 US\nmidterm elections (Nov 6, 2018), 40seats\n\ufb02ipped from Republican to Democratic con-\ntrol. The election had a huge anti-immigration\nrhetoric. Following the election the longest\ngovernment shutdown in US history occurred\n(Dec 22, 2018 - Jan 25, 2019), caused by a\ndispute over the funding amount for an expan-\nsion of the US-Mexico border barrier.\n\u000fGun Control Event: On February 14, 2018,\na gunman opened \ufb01re with a semi-automatic\nri\ufb02e at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High\nSchool in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 peo-\nple and injuring 17 others. The shooter was\na former student of the same school who is\nethnically white.\nThe usage of frames and subframes in response\nto these events are summarized in Table 7. It\nshows that frames usage by both parties overlaps,\nalthough with varying importance, and as a result\noffers limited insight. Analyzing subframes usage\nshows that some subframes are unique to each side\nin the context of the analyzed event. For example,\nthe Abortion event analysis shows that \u2018Sale of Fe-\ntal Tissue\u2019, \u2018Planned Parenthood\u2019 and \u2018Abortion\nProviders Economy\u2019 are used by both sides, as they\nare very relevant to the event. However, \u2018Women\nfreedom\u2019, and \u2019Sanctity of human life\u2019 are unique\nto each side.Figure 3 captures the change in framing behavior\nas a response to the event by comparing subframe\nusage before and after the event. It shows a spike\nin event related subframes by both sides, showing\nthey respond to the speci\ufb01cs of the event. That\nsupports our claim in Section 5.1 that the left and\nright react to events by using event related sub-\nframes. In topic Abortion, apart from the event\nrelated subframes, the left used \u2018Abortion Funding\u2019\nand \u2018Women Freedom\u2019, and the right used sub-\nframes related to saving the life of the unborn. In\nthe case of immigration, the left responded to the\ndebates related to \u2018Border Protection\u2019 by framing it\nas \u2018Family Separation Policy\u2019, \u2018Racism and Xeno-\nphobia\u2019, while the right framed it as a \u2018Refugee\u2019\nissue. Around the school shooting event, the left\ntalked about the \u2018White Identity\u2019 of the shooter,\nwhile the right framed it as a \u2018Mental Health\u2019 issue,\na \ufb01nding consistent with the claim by Demszky\net al. (2019) that the shooter\u2019s race plays a role in\nframe usage after a mass shooting event.\nWe take a closer look at the difference between\nthe usage of the same subframe by both sides by\ncomparing the words used by each side. We look\nat the top 5high PMI words in the context of those\nsubframes for each party2shown in the right-most\ntwo columns of Table 7. Interestingly, in context of\n\u2018Sale of Fetal Tissue\u2019, the left used words like sting,\ndonation, deceptively ; suggesting they framed it\nas a propaganda ploy, while the right used words\nlikeorgan, harvesting, human, money ; indicating a\n2PMI calculation details is in Appendix E.\n6 months period \nprior to event6 months period \nafter the event102030405060% of Articles Using SubframeLeft\nPlanned Parent.\nSale of Fetal Tiss.\nAbort. prov. econ.Abor. fund.\nWomen free.\n6 months period \nprior to event6 months period \nafter the event102030405060 Right\nSale of Fetal Tiss.\nAbort. prov. econ.\nPlanned Parent.Sanc. of Life\nRight of Hum.

In case of \u2018Border Protec-\ntion\u2019, the left used words like crisis , while the right\nused illegal, secure . This analysis indicates again\nthat even when the sides use similar event-speci\ufb01c\nsubframes, their intent is different.\n6 Summary\nWe study the news media coverage of 3politically\npolarized topics - abortion, immigration , and gun\ncontrol ; by breaking the high level policy frames\ninto more \ufb01ne grained, and topic-speci\ufb01c, sub-\nframes. We demonstrate that the subframes can\naccount better for the way issues are framed in\nthe news by both sides to in\ufb02uence their readers.\nWe propose a novel embedding-based model ex-\ntending our subframe lexicon to new text, allowingus to perform analysis more broadly. Our study\nserves as a starting point for additional work on hi-\nerarchical framing classi\ufb01cation that can combine\nissue-speci\ufb01c or event-speci\ufb01c framing analysis\nwith generalized framing dimensions that are com-\nparable across different events and issues. To assist\nthis effort, and improve reproducibility we provide\nadditional details in Appendix H.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge Abida Sanjana She-\nmonti for helping in human evaluation and the\nanonymous reviewers for their insightful com-\nments.\nReferences\nJisun An, Haewoon Kwak, Oliver Posegga, and An-\ndreas Jungherr. 2019.

of\ufb01cial at Planned Par-\nenthood discussing how to abort a fetus and\npreserve the organs and the costs associated\nwith sharing that tissue with scientists3. These\nvideos and defunding of Planned Parenthood\ncame in presidential candidates\u2019 debates. Fol-\nlowing this event, on Nov 27, 2015, three peo-\nple were murdered at a Planned Parenthood\nhealth center in Colorado by a shooter4.\n\u000fTopic: Immigration:\nEvent: In the 2018 US midterm elections\n(Nov 6, 2018), 40seats \ufb02ipped from Republi-\ncan to Democratic control5. The election had\na huge anti-immigration rhetoric. Following\nthe election the longest government shutdown\nin US history occurred (Dec 22, 2018 - Jan 25,\n2019)6, caused by a dispute over the funding\namount for an expansion of the US-Mexico\nborder barrier.\n\u000fTopic: Gun Control:\nEvent: On February 14, 2018, a gunman\nopened \ufb01re with a semi-automatic ri\ufb02e at Mar-\njory Stoneman Douglas High School in Park-\nland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring\n17 others. The shooter was a former student\nof the same school who is ethnically white7.\nE Detection of Top- 5Highest PMI Words\nin the Context of Subframes by for\nEach Party\nTo detect the top PMI words for each party label\n(left, right) in the context of a subframe, s, we\n3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nPlanned_Parenthood_2015_undercover_\nvideos_controversy\n4https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nColorado_Springs_Planned_Parenthood_\nshooting\n5https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_\nUnited_States_elections\n6https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%\nE2%80%9319_United_States_federal_\ngovernment_shutdown\n7https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nStoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting\nfollow the following procedure. If a news article\nis detected to have a subframe, s, in its top 3sub-\nframes, we take only the paragraphs from that news\narticle which have the highest probability as hav-\ning the subframe, s, over all the subframes and\nalso belongs to the top- 500nearest paragraphs of\nthe subframe, s, in the embeddings space. This\ntop-500list is created based on cosine similarity\nbetween the embedding of the subframe, s, and the\nembedding of all paragraphs on the topic. Now we\ntokenize the subset of paragraphs having subframe,\ns. To remove stopwords and very rarely occurring\nwords we consider only the words appearing in\nless than 5%of the paragraphs and more than 60%\nof the paragraphs. For a word wwe calculate the\npointwise mutual information (PMI) with label l,\nI(w;l)using the following formula.\nI(w;l) = logP(wjl)\nP(w)\nWhereP(wjl)is computed by taking all para-\ngraphs with label land computingcount (w)\ncount (allwords )\nand similarly, P(w)is computed by counting word\nwover the set of paragraphs combining both left\nand right biased ones. Now, we rank words for\neach label (left, right) based on their PMI scores.\nF Usage of Subframes in Context of\nOther Subframes\nThe heatmaps showing usage of a subframe in the\ncontext of other subframes for the topics immigra-\ntion and gun control are showed in Figure 4.\nG Polarization in Frame and Subframe\nUsage\nFigure 5 and 6 shows the polarization in usage of\nframes and subframes by each party for the topics\nImmigration and Gun Control respectively.\nH Reproducibility\nMachine Used We used a Nvidia GeForce GTX\n1080 Ti, 12 GB memory GPU in a machine with\nIntel(R) 12 Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz\nand a RAM of 64GB to run all the experiments.\nLibraries Used For implementation of HLSTM,\nBERT and the embedding learning we used Py-\nTorch. To implement the guided LDA we used\nPython guidedlda library.Guided LDA Hyper-parameters We ran the\nguided LDA models for 100iterations with a ran-\ndom state of 7. This threshold was set by looking\nat the log-likelihood of the model. For all of the\ntopics at 100th iteration the log-likelihood became\nstable. We used seed con\ufb01dence of 1each time\nwhich means the seed n-grams had 100% prior\nprobability of being in the corresponding topics i.e.\nsubframes.\nText Classi\ufb01cation Baseline For the text clas-\nsi\ufb01cation baseline, HLSTM, we used validation\naccuracy as a stopping criteria. If the validation\naccuracy didn\u2019t increase for 10 epochs we stopped\ntraining. 10% of the news articles from the training\nset was used as validation set. This training took\non average 10minutes for each fold for all of the\ntopics. In BERT training using a batch size of 4and\nlearning rate of 5e\u00005yielded the best performance.\nJoint learning of paragraphs and subframe la-\nbel embeddings While initializing the embed-\ndings randomly we used a random seed of 1234 .\nEach learning epoch took on average 67seconds\nfor Abortion and Gun Control and 122seconds for\nImmigration . We trained the model for at most\n100epochs or stopped learning if the embedding\nlearning loss didn\u2019t decrease for 10consecutive\nepochs.\nABORTION\nFRAME SUBFRAME SHORT DESCRIPTION\nEconomic Health Care Affordable Care Act, healthcare facilities, health insurance, their coverage etc.\nAbort.
