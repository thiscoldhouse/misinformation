Taylor1\u2020, Wei Wang1\n1Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles\n{ataylor2, weiwang}@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nSocial networks have become ideal vehicles\nfor news dissemination because posted content\nis easily able to reach users beyond a news\noutlet\u2019s direct audience. Understanding how\ninformation is transmitted among communities\nof users is a critical step towards understand-\ning the impact social networks have on real-\nworld events. Two significant barriers in this\nvein of work are identifying user clusters and\nmeaningfully characterizing these communi-\nties. Thus, we propose the PGNSC benchmark,\nwhich builds information pathways based on\nthe audiences of influential news sources and\nuses their content to characterize the commu-\nnities. We present methods of aggregating\nthese news-source-centric communities and for\nconstructing the community feature representa-\ntions that are used sequentially to construct in-\nformation pathway prediction pipelines. Lastly,\nwe perform extensive experiments to demon-\nstrate the performance of baseline pipeline con-\nstructions and to highlight the possibilities for\nfuture work. Our code and data can be found\nhere: https://github.com/ataylor24/PGNSC.\n1 Introduction\nSocial media platforms have become a crucial part\nof the information dissemination ecosystem. By\nallowing users to choose whom they share their so-\ncalled \u201ccontent feeds\" with, these platforms have\ncreated an environment in which the reach of infor-\nmation is amplified.\nPew Research (Forman-Katz, 2022) reported\nthat roughly half of American adults regularly con-\nsume news through social media and that 13% pre-\nfer to get their news through social media, which\nincreases to 33% for adults under 30. Further sur-\nveying suggests that adults under 30 place as much\ntrust in news gathered from social media as from\n\u2020Corresponding author: Alexander K. Taylor {atay-\nlor2@cs.ucla.edu}traditional news outlets (Liedke, 2022). Because of\nthis, traditionally \"offline\" news sources now have\ndedicated social media accounts that seek to propa-\ngate their content to the growing demographic of\nadults using social media for news consumption.\nGiven the relevance of this problem, we seek to\nestablish a benchmark that will establish a founda-\ntion which future work may use to develop methods\nto identify the audiences of influential news sources\nand predict the flow of information. Because so-\ncial media users rarely explicitly disclose which\nnews sources they get information from, we must\nidentify the audience, or community, of each news\nsource we consider. We will focus on two bene-\nfits of aggregating users into communities (Zhang\net al., 2019a; Lancichinetti et al., 2008).\nThe first benefit of community aggregation is\nthat it allows us to leverage the structure present in\nthe data to predict the behavior of a set of closely\nconnected users (Lancichinetti et al., 2008). Using\nthis principle, we are able to circumvent the low-\nresource setting of user-level prediction caused by\ninconsistent user posting schedules by predicting\nthe behavior of communities of users as demon-\nstrated in prior work (Li et al., 2022; Taylor et al.,\n2023). The second benefit is that we can leverage\ninductive bias to improve the representation of the\ncommunity; for instance, members of communi-\nties centered around a given news outlet will likely\nshare that outlet\u2019s political leaning (Liedke, 2022)\nand are likely to have their views influenced by that\noutlet\u2019s content. This motivates the construction\nof community representations that incorporate as\nmuch additional information as possible (to inform\ncommunity representation).\nWe seek to take the first step in establishing a\nbenchmark for information pathway prediction at\nthe community level, which we title Prominent\nGlobal NewsSources for Covid-19, hereafter re-\nferred to as PGNSC .PGNSC is a novel, human-\nvalidated dataset built using the most influential15787\nglobal news sources for COVID-19 ( PGNSC ). The\ndataset consists of instances of news articles being\nposted to social media and the resulting interac-\ntions between news organization communities. We\nalso provide a general sequential framework for\nbuilding pipelines to perform information pathway\nprediction and define baseline methods for each\npipeline stage.\nFor the community aggregation stage, we in-\nclude several methods of aggregating communi-\nties based on prior work (Taylor et al., 2023; Ko-\nmorowski et al., 2018; Romero et al., 2010) and\nshow their impact on information pathway predic-\ntion performance. To construct community feature\nrepresentations, we seek to leverage the recent ad-\nvances in large language models (LLMs) and their\nuse in enhancing graph representations by using\nLLMs to summarize and encode of each organiza-\ntion\u2019s content (He et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b).\nBecause news content often includes images, we\nalso incorporate a jointly-trained image-text en-\ncoder into the set of community node feature gen-\neration pipelines (Radford et al., 2021).\nThe appeal of PGNSC goes beyond providing\ndata that can be used for analysis of patterns of\ninformation propagation as well as graph represen-\ntation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first work to establish benchmark for infor-\nmation pathway prediction using heterogeneous\ngraphs and and to use SOTA LLMs to enhance\nnode feature representations to improve predicitons.\nWe believe PGNSC is well positioned to serve as\na vehicle for exploring how LLMs and graph data\ncan be used in concert to make predictions.\n2 Dynamic Graph Benchmarks\nThe development of graph representations has re-\ncently undergone a renaissance with the develop-\nment and application of graph neural networks that\nbenefit from data richness and complexity (Huang\net al., 2023; noa; Gravina and Bacciu, 2023). This\nevolution has underscored the critical need for ro-\nbust benchmarks in both static and dynamic graph\ndomains, divided into real-world and synthetic\ndatasets. Our focus herein is on dynamic graphs,\nwhich are pivotal for modeling time-evolving rela-\ntionships in numerous applications.\n2.1 Real-world Dynamic Graph Benchmarks\nHigh-quality, real-world datasets are considered\nthe gold standard for benchmarking because theyclosely simulate the application of models in prac-\ntical scenarios. However, such data can be costly to\nmunge and often presents issues related to missing\nvalues or other quality control measures. There are\nmany available datasets built from real-world data\nand described in prior works as shown in 1 (please\nsee Appendix 8 for a full list) (Poursafaei et al.;\nHuang et al., 2023; Gravina and Bacciu, 2023; Ho-\nrawalavithana et al., 2022). While these bench-\nmarks encompass a broad range of spatial attributes\nand temporal granularity, they are overwhelmingly\nskewed towards homogeneous graphs with some\nexceptions (Poursafaei et al.; Huang et al., 2023;\nGravina and Bacciu, 2023). These works, however,\nhave not fully exploited the potential of dynamic,\nheterogeneous datasets nor embraced the advance-\nments in large language models (LLMs) for multi-\nmodal representation. Our benchmark aims to fill\nthis gap by integrating LLM-enhanced multimodal\ndata, setting a new stage for information pathway\nprediction research.\n2.2 Synthetic Dynamic Graph Benchmarks\nTo bypass the limitations of real-world data, some\nwork has investigated synthetic datasets designed\nto replicate real-world data distributions (Greene\net al., 2010; Ammar and \u00d6zsu, 2014; Lancichinetti\net al., 2008; Rossetti, 2017). Synthetic benchmarks,\nwhile valuable for their controllability and repro-\nducibility, often lack the unpredictability and intri-\ncate variability found in natural datasets, especially\nin domains like information propagation. They may\nnot fully capture the complexities and nuances of\nreal-world scenarios, and thus cannot provide the\nsame value as empirical data. Our benchmark con-\ntributes a significant, large-scale real-world dataset,\naiming to provide a comprehensive tool for devel-\noping more generalizable and robust GNNs.\n3 PGNSC Benchmark\nIn this section, we discuss the construction of the\nPGNSC benchmark. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst publicly available benchmark in which mul-\ntimodal information cascades (structure, text, and\nimage data) have been aggregated into community-\nbased information pathways.\n3.1 News Data Collection\nPrior to selecting the news organizations whose\npathways are included in the PGNSC dataset, we\nidentified countries from which to choose news or-15788\nTable 1: Statistics of sampled social-media-oriented dynamic-graph datasets (Hom. denotes homogeneous and Het.\ndenotes heterogeneous).

We identified the 15 countries with the\nhighest aggregate number of COVID-19 cases from\nMay 15, 2020 to April 11, 2021. We then used\nthe Digital News Report from the Reuters Insti-\ntute as our primary source in determining the most\nprominent online news organizations for each coun-\ntry, and we supplemented with additional sources\nwhen the report did not cover a given country or\nrequired further justification. A full list of the coun-\ntries and news sources identified for each country\nis available in the appendix. We then used the\naforementioned URLs to query Google News for\nthe data associated with the article link using the\nopen-source package GNews . The data retrieved\ncontained the article title, article text content, and\nthe URLs for images embedded in the article, as\nshown in Table 4.\nTwitter Data\nNumber of Tweets 304k\nNumber of Distinct Users 1.01M\nNumber of Articles 34k\nAvg.

From this\nwindow, we identified roughly 53 million tweets\ncontaining article URLs (hereafter referred to as\nsource tweets) from the selected news sources (see\nAppendix for data breakdown). We performed\nweighted random sampling based on the number\nof article links present in each day, which yielded\nroughly 304k source tweets. We then scraped all\nretweets and reply tweets (hereafter referred to\nas response tweets) for each source tweet as well\nas the metadata and content of each tweet (both\nsource and reply)0. Each source tweet and the sub-\nsequent response tweets were used to construct a\nUser-Level Information Cascade.\n3.3 Information Pathway Mapping\nWe define communities as sets of users ag-\ngregated around the news sources defined in\nPGNSC (Taylor et al., 2023). Community aggre-\ngations were performed using the engagement met-\nrics and user interactions drawn from the user-level\ninformation pathways according to methods de-\nscribed in detail in a later section. Each user-level\ninformation pathway was mapped to a community-\nlevel information pathway by replacing each user\nwith the community it was assigned to (no self-\nedges) as shown in Figure 2.\nWe define a set of node and edge types that are\nused to construct the graph representation in Ta-\nble 5, following the format of prior work (Taylor\n0We want to note that while engagement metrics (num-\nber of favorites, retweets, and replies) were present for all\nsource tweets, each value was defaulted to 0 for many re-\nsponse tweets.15789\nFigure 1: User-Level Information Cascade Example\nFigure 2: User-Level Information Pathway to\nCommunity-Level Information Pathway example\net al., 2023). We generalize the naming conven-\ntions for connections at the community level be-\nyond Twitter for ease of future application to other\nsocial media platforms.\n3.4 Community Aggregation Methods\nIn this section, we describe the aggregation meth-\nods that we used to assign users to communities\ncentered around the aforementioned news sources.\nWhile there are many methods for unstructured\ncommunity identification, we found that the major-\nity of methods do not scale to the size of our graph\nfor the user-level network we have constructed\n(Zhang et al., 2019a; Zeng and Yu, 2018; Sattar\nand Arifuzzaman, 2022). We have selected three\nheuristic-based methods. Each community aggre-\ngation method was performed using the same set of\ncommunity centers and applied to the same set of\nuser-level information cascades. The general for-\nmat for the aggregation methods presented in this\nwork is generating community scores sfor eachTable 5: Definitions of Community-Level Information\nPathways.\nNode Types\nInformation Source An article written by a selected\nnews source.\nCommunity The set of users aggregated\naround selected news sources.\nEdge Types\nWritten_by Information Source \u2192Commu-\nnity: Indicates the community\nthat is the original author of the\nInformation Source.\nMentioned_by Information Source \u2192Commu-\nnity: Indicates that a community\nauthored a message containing an\nInformation Source, starting an\nInformation Pathway (IP).\nCommunicated_to Community \u2192Community : Rep-\nresents a user from one commu-\nnity interacting with a message\nauthored by a user in a different\ncommunity.\nuser, and then assigning the user to the commu-\nnity for which it has the highest score, as shown in\nFigure 3.\nFigure 3: Illustration of community assignment. For\neach user, a score is generated for all communities that\nthe user interacts with; the user is then assigned to the\ncommunity for which they have the highest score.\nComm.

This community aggregation\nmethod is designed to assign users to the commu-15790\nnity for which their posts have the most engage-\nment and uses collected engagement metrics: the\nnumber of favorites, retweets, replies, user IDs\nmentioned in the tweet, and the most recent Fol-\nlowing/Follower ratio. Users are assigned to only\nthe community for which they have the highest\nEngagement score with ties broken randomly.\n3.4.2 Interaction\nFollowing prior work in community aggregation in\nTwitter data (Komorowski et al., 2018), we com-\npute the Interaction score for each user with re-\nspect to each community center (Our formulation\nis modified to include the number of replies). This\ncommunity aggregation method is designed to as-\nsign each user to the community for which it has\nthe highest relative importance, as determined by\nthe impact of its interactions with other users. We\nfirst construct super-graphs of the User-Level In-\nformation Pathway Instances associated with each\ncommunity center. The Interaction score is used as\nthe edge weight for an interaction from user pand\nuserq.\nThe PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) is\nthen applied to each community center\u2019s super-\ngraph and produces a ranking of the relative impor-\ntance of each user with respect to that community\ncenter. urepresents the user whose rank we wish\nto calculate and Eurepresents the set of users that\nhave interactions with u.dis a damping factor, and\nL(p)is the number of links from page p. Users\nare assigned to only the community for which they\nhave the highest Interaction score, with ties broken\nrandomly.\n3.4.3 Influence-Passivity\nThe last community aggregation method that we\nconsider follows prior work that measured the\nrelative influence of nodes in social networks\n(Romero et al., 2010). This community aggrega-\ntion method is designed to measure the influence\nthat a given node exerts on its neighborhood (in-\nfluence) and vice versa (passivity). For each user\nin a given community, we retrieve the number of\nURLs they posted and their one-hop neighborhood\nof in and outgoing interactions, which results a\ndirected super-graph for each community. This\ninformation allows us to perform the Influence-\nPassivity algorithm (Romero et al., 2010) which\nyields a 2-dimensional influence-passivity vector,\n[influence _score, passivity _score ]. We assign\neach user to the community for which they have thehighest l2-norm of the influence-passivity vector.\n3.5 Random\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the community ag-\ngregation methods, we include two random settings,\nbiased-random and unbiased-random.\nBiased-random. The biased-random commu-\nnity selection method samples from the commu-\nnities whose articles a given user has interacted\nwith. We include this setting to compare randomly\nselecting from a user\u2019s engagement history with\nusing the bias described by the methods described\nin previous sections.\nUnbiased-random. The unbiased-random com-\nmunity selection method randomly assigns each\nuser to one of any community. This is the tradi-\ntional random baseline and is included to evaluate\nthe information compression properties of commu-\nnity assignment.\n3.6 Comparison to Similar Benchmarks\nWe include a selected list of several dynamic het-\nerogeneous graph benchmarks in Table 1. FB-\nForum, FB-Covid19, Reddit, Reddit Hyperlink Net-\nwork, Twitter-Tennis and tgbn-reddit, while rich\nstructurally, do not incorporate node attributes be-\nyond structural embeddings, and only FB-Covid19\nand Reddit incorporate edge attributes in the form\nof LIWC encodings (Opsahl, 2011; Kumar et al.,\n2018; Panagopoulos et al., 2021; B\u00e9res et al., 2018;\nHuang et al., 2023). As mentioned in 1, to our\nknowledge, Expert is not publicly available for\ncomparison. PGNSC is a publicly available, het-\nerogeneous graph benchmark that incorporates\nLLM-enhanced multimodal graph attributes.\n4 Feature Initialization Pipelines\nIn this section, we describe the pipelines used to\ngenerate node feature embeddings for each commu-\nnity. We explore the efficacy of three approaches to\npipeline construction: single-stage, two-stage, and\nzero-shot.\n4.1 Single-Stage Pipeline (Lightning)\nThe single-stage pipeline formulation (Lightning)\nillustrated in (Taylor et al., 2023) applies an\nencoder-only model to text that represents each\ncommunity center. Lightning applies the encoder-\nonly model, Longformer, to the concatenation of\ntext from sampled articles to construct a represen-\ntation of each community center (Beltagy et al.,\n2020; Taylor et al., 2023). The text we use consists15791\nFigure 4: Illustration of the general baseline pipeline\nframework.\nof the concatenations of article titles and article\ncontents (illustrated in Figure 4). The embeddings\ngenerated through this process are used directly as\nthe node feature representation of the community\ncenter to which they pertain.\n4.2 Two-Stage Pipelines\nRecent works have made strides in multi-document\nSummarization (MDS) (Xiao et al., 2022; Zhang\net al., 2019b), and we seek to incorporate this into\nour baseline pipeline formulation. We chose to in-\ncorporate the state-of-the-art multi-document sum-\nmary model, PRIMERA (Xiao et al., 2022), into\nthe node feature embeddings generation process.\nThis is accomplished by randomly sampling karti-\ncles from the aggregated articles available for each\ncommunity to use as input to PRIMERA, which\nproduces a text-based summary. We treat this sum-\nmary as an encapsulation of the community\u2019s con-\ntent and encode it using BERT to serve as the com-\nmunity\u2019s node features (Devlin et al., 2019; Taylor\net al., 2023). We title this node feature genera-\ntion pipeline PRIMERA-BERT. We also seek to\nexplore the impacts of incorporating multi-modal\ndata into the information pathway prediction task.\nThus, we also include a pipeline that encodes the\nPRIMERA-generated text summary with the CLIP\nmodel (Radford et al., 2021), which is a joint text-\nimage encoder. The process is similar to that of the\nPRIMERA-BERT pipeline: we randomly sample k\narticles and their accompanying images and simul-\ntaneously encode the PRIMERA-generated sum-\nmary and relevant images using CLIP. We title thisnode feature generation pipeline PRIMERA-CLIP.\nWe include samples of the generated summaries in\nthe Appendix.\n4.3 Zero-Shot Pipelines\nModern LLMs have made dramatic progress in the\nrecent past and are often able to outperform fine-\ntuned models in low-resource settings. Thus, we\nalso test pipelines in which we leverage the vast\ncontext of LLMs to generate zero-shot text sum-\nmaries of each community using manual prompt-\ntuning to achieve high-quality results. The gener-\nated text summaries are encoded using both BERT\nand CLIP, similar to the pipelines described above.\nWe use two of the standard LLMs, Llama-2 and\nGPT-4, to perform these tasks and follow the nam-\ning convention established above for their respec-\ntive pipelines.\n5 Experimental Results\nIn this section, we discuss the logistical settings\nof our experiments and discuss the performance of\nour baseline models on PGNSC.\n5.1 Experimental Setup\nData splits. We divide the data according to an\n80:10:10 split for the training, validation, and test-\ning sets, respectively. Each experimental number\nshown is the averaged result of 10 experiments.\nEvaluation metrics. We use the GMAUC metric\n(geometric mean of AUC and AUPR) as the pri-\nmary evaluation metric in our work to more aptly\ncapture performance on both positive and negative\nedge predictions, as shown in prior work (Pour-\nsafaei et al.). We also follow the conventions set by\nprior link prediction tasks and include AUPR and\nAUC as our evaluation metric (You et al., 2020;\nKumar et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2022), which are\navailable in the Appendix.\nExperiments. We perform a grid search across\nthe performances of five community aggregation\nmethods and seven node embedding methods to\ninvestigate the impact of our proposed node repre-\nsentation methods and its interaction with com-\nmunity formulation. The five community ag-\ngregation methods are Biased-Random assign-\nment, Unbiased-Random assignment, Engagement\n(Taylor et al., 2023), Interaction (Komorowski\net al., 2018), and Influence-Passivity (Romero15792\net al., 2010). The seven node feature repre-\nsentation pipelines are Longformer, PRIMERA-\nBERT, GPT4-BERT, Llama2-BERT, PRIMERA-\nCLIP, GPT4-CLIP, and Llama2-CLIP.\n5.2 Link Prediction Model\nFor the dynamic link prediction module, we use\nHTGNN (Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural\nNetwork) (Fan et al., 2021) as it is a state-of-the-art\nmodel for dynamic link prediction in a heteroge-\nneous setting. HTGNN consists of multiple het-\nerogeneous temporal aggregation layers, each em-\nploying hierarchical aggregation mechanisms that\nare combined to yield the spatio-temporal embed-\nding for each node: intra-relation aggregation, inter-\nrelation aggregation, and across-time aggregation.\nIntra-relation Aggregation For each node vwith\ntype\u03d5(v)at timestamp t, the feature vector xt\nvis\nprojected into a unified feature space:\nht,l\nv,r=intra/circleplusdisplay\nu\u2208Ntr(v)/parenleft\uf8ecig\nht,l\u22121\nu;\u0398intra/parenright\uf8ecig\n, (1)\nht,l\nv,R=inter/circleplusdisplay\nr\u2208R(v)/parenleft\uf8ecig\nht,l\nv,r;\u0398inter/parenright\uf8ecig\n, (2)\nht,l\nv,ST=across/circleplusdisplay\n1\u2264t\u2032\u2264T/parenleft\uf8ecig\nht\u2032,l\nv,R;\u0398across/parenright\uf8ecig\n.

We observe that feature initialization\npipelines (FI) show improvements of 6.55 to 10.98\non pathways mapped to communities constructed\nusing the Influence-Passivity (IP) heuristic. We\nbelieve that IP benefits from factoring in both the\ninfluence exerted on outgoing edges and receptiv-\nity of users to incoming edges as opposed to In-\nteraction and Engagement scores, which simply\ncompare the relative influence exertion of users.\nWe also find that the Engagement community\naggregation methods yields similar results to Bi-\nased Random community assignment, which in-\ndicates that heuristics relying on user-level net-\nwork structure (Interaction and IP) are able to more\nmeaningfully characterize communities than can\nengagement metrics. These results support the as-\nsertion that relying on the frequency of interactions\nprovides more insight into user behavior than ag-\ngregated user engagement metrics (Romero et al.,\n2010).\nFeature Initialization Method Comparison re-\nsults. We observe that FI pipelines encoded by\nBERT offer an average 1.1 point improvement over\nthose using CLIP across all community aggregation\nmethods; this further increases to 1.6 point average\nimprovement when considering the non-random\naggregation heuristics. The two-stage FI pipelines\nprovide an average improvement of 5.4 points over\none-stage FI pipelines across all community heuris-\ntics, which increases to 6.2 points when excluding\nrandomized community heuristics. We believe the\nreason behind the discrepancy between the effec-\ntiveness of BERT encodings and multimodal CLIP\nencodings is two-fold. First, CLIP embeddings are\nsmaller due to model output parameters. Second, a\nmanual investigation yields that, while images en-\nhance the representation of articles they accompany,\nthey may not aid in differentiating one community\nfrom another (See Appendix for example).\nWe also observe a slight trend in Llama-2 sum-\nmary modules outperforming those using Primera\nand GPT4-based summary modules, and Llama-\n2 has an average 1.2 point improvement over\nPRIMERA under non-random community aggre-\ngation heuristics. However, this difference shrinks\nto 0.8 points when random settings are included,\nand the average relative differences in performance\nbetween Llama-2 and GPT4 and between GPT4\nand PRIMERA are similarly insignificant.15793\nFigure 5: Overall Results. We provide the performance results of our baseline pipelines (GMAUC). Please see\nAppendix (Table 10) for full tabular representation including AUC and AUPR.\n6 Related Works\n6.1 Community-based Information\nPropagation Prediction on Social\nNetworks\nThere are many existing methods designed to im-\nprove the performance of link prediction over social\nmedia network representations (Daud et al., 2020;\nKumar et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2022; Haghani and\nKeyvanpour, 2019; Toprak et al., 2023). Several re-\ncent works have framed the link prediction problem\nas predictions of information propagation (Taylor\net al., 2023; Jin et al., 2023). These works both\ndefine information pathways as the trajectory of\nindividual pieces of information through communi-\nties of users.\nPrior work made use of Reddit data, equating\nuser participation in Subreddits with community\nmembership and predicting information propaga-\ntion (Jin et al., 2023). Many social networks that\ngenerate information cascades do not have explicit\ncommunities, thus Taylor et al. developed the En-\ngagement heuristic to identify implicit communi-\nties using engagement metrics (Favorites, Retweets,\netc.) on Twitter COVID-19 data (Taylor et al.,2023). Using this heuristic, Taylor et al. showed\nthat using collections of articles to construct the fea-\nture representations of these communities yielded\nbetter static link prediction results over using tweet\nhistories to represent individual users.\nOur work continues in this vein and uses four\ndistinct community construction methodologies (in-\ncluding the Engagement heuristic) and novel LLM-\nenhanced node feature generation methods for com-\nmunity feature representations (Taylor et al., 2023).\n6.2 Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph\nRepresentations\nMulti-modal graph representations have recently re-\nceived increased attention because they more fully\nrepresent problems and lead to improved perfor-\nmance on downstream tasks (Peng et al., 2023;\nLiang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2019; Ektefaie et al., 2023). These improvements\nhave been observed in diverse applications, from\nmisinformation detection to transport systems (Ab-\ndali, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2022;\nRahmani et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2023; Chen et al.,\n2023a).\nThe recent revolution of LLMs has inspired re-15794\ncent work to investigate the potential benefits of in-\ncorporating LLMs into graph neural networks (He\net al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b). Further works has\nshown that it is possible to use zero-shot LLM sum-\nmarization in concert with graph embeddings to\npredict the news consumption habits of individual\nusers (Chen et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023). These\nsuccesses inspired prior work to use a longform\ntext encoder to construct the node feature repre-\nsentations of communities based on collections of\narticles to predict information propagation (Taylor\net al., 2023; Beltagy et al., 2020).\nOur work furthers this direction by using SOTA\nLLMs to generate and encode community embed-\ndings of a highly-curated, novel dataset. We demon-\nstrate that downstream link-prediction performance\nbenefits significantly from LLM-enhanced com-\nmunity summarization and outperforms prior ap-\nproaches on our dataset.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we present a novel benchmark for dy-\nnamic link prediction on heterogeneous graphs in\nthe novel application domain of information path-\nway prediction. We consider 5 community aggre-\ngation heuristics and 7 different feature initializa-\ntion pipeline constructions, all of which show the\nimprovement that LLM-enhanced feature represen-\ntations can have on downstram link prediction. We\nalso show that the community construction method\nsignificantly impacts overall performance, and our\nresults support prior assertions of the benefits of\nconsidering interaction network structure (Romero\net al., 2010).\nIt is our hope that PGNSC will make LLM-\nenhanced graph tasks more accessible, fill the ne-\ncessity for a large dynamic heterogeneous graph\ndataset, and last, but not least, offer a challenging\nsetting for incorporating community aggregation\ninto information propagation prediction tasks.\nLimitations\nThis work presents a novel benchmark, 5 commu-\nnity aggregation heuristics, and 7 feature initial-\nization pipelines. While we mentioned scalability\nissues of existing methodologies, we acknowledge\nthe simplicity of the community aggregation heuris-\ntics included in this work. We also acknowledge the\nlimitations of our data: as mentioned in the main\npaper, many response tweets are missing engage-\nment metrics, meaning that the Engagement andInteractions scores are being computed over incom-\nplete data. Lastly, we have included the sources\nused to determine prominent global news sources,\nbut acknowledge the bias inherent in the process of\ndeciding whether to include news sources as com-\nmunities or when excluding countries from data\ncollection.\nEthics Statement\nOur benchmark is intended to encourage explo-\nration in the information propagation domain while\navoiding any leakage of private information. The\ndata we use in this work has been fully de-identified\nand only uses numerical codes to refer to users.\nThough it is very difficult to reconstruct protected\npersonal information from such data, there remains\nsome small risk that future models may be able to\ndo so. The dataset we intend to release contains\nonly de-identified user identification numbers to\ndenote community membership and edges contain\nthe engagement metrics of the associated tweet; no\nother metadata has not been retrieved. We have\ntaken all known steps to prevent private informa-\ntion leakage.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported in part by the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n(DARPA) under grant numbers HR00112290103\nand HR0011260656.\nWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to Maximillian\nSloan, Alvyn Wang, Xiaofu Ding, Nuan Wen, and\nJiaying Li for their contributions to the implemen-\ntation of our methods.

We select the best\nepoch based on the highest GMAUC score of the\nlink prediction task on the validation set.\nFrameworks. Our entire codebase is imple-\nmented in PyTorch.1The implementations of the\ntransformer-based models are extended from the\nHuggingface2codebase ( ?).\n8.2 Experiment Details\nWe report the median result for ten runs with dif-\nferent random seeds (by default). All the models in\nthis work are trained on NVIDIA A100 GPUs on a\nUbuntu 20.04.2 operating system.\n8.3 LLM Community Summaries and Prompt\nJustification\nWe performed a manual tuning of 20 distinct\nprompt candidates and selected the prompt tem-\nplate that yielded the best results across the set of\ncommunity summaries (150), which was a small\nenough set to manually validate.\nBelow is an example of the GPT4 response to\nthe following prompt :\"Summarize past content of\nNPR with respect to COVID-19 (Do not tell me\nyou\u2019re an AI)\"\n1https://pytorch.org/\n2https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\"NPR has provided comprehensive coverage of\nCOVID-19 since the early beginnings of the pan-\ndemic. Its content has ranged from daily updates\non the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and\nprogress on vaccines to in-depth features and anal-\nyses. They\u2019ve frequently reported on the impact of\nthe virus on businesses and the economy, as well as\non daily life, education, and mental health issues.\nNPR has regularly reported on the response of\nfederal, state, and local governments to the pan-\ndemic, including policies put in place and financial\nrelief measures. This has also included coverage\nof controversy around stay-at-home orders, mask\nmandates, and businesses re-openings.\nThey\u2019ve conducted numerous interviews with\npublic health officials, researchers, doctors, and\nindividuals affected by the pandemic. They\u2019ve also\nwidely covered the development of COVID-19 vac-\ncines, including the process, distribution issues,\nand public perception.\nSpecifically, there have been stories on the ef-\nfect of the pandemic on marginalized communi-\nties, including racial disparities in healthcare and\nits impact. NPR also looked at international as-\npects of the pandemic, from the initial outbreak in\nWuhan, China to comparisons with other countries\u2019\nresponses and strategies.\nNPR\u2019s COVID-19 coverage tends to focus on\nfactual reporting and sharing human stories and\nincludes input from experts in multiple fields.\nThey\u2019ve encouraged listeners to practice safety\nmeasures and have made an attempt to dispel myths\naround COVID-19. The tone of the coverage,\nthough serious, often brings in elements of em-\npathy, humanity, and sometimes humor to lighten\nthe heavy subject matter.\"\n8.4 Overall Model Results Table\nPlease see Table 10 for the full tabular representa-\ntion of the experiments shown in Figure 5.\n8.5 Image Relevance Discussion\nTo provide an example included in our manual\nerror analysis, we consider the following article\nfrom Hindustan Times. The article concerns beach\ncrowds during a time of heightened infections, but\nthe images are only of \u2019beach crowds\u2019. Further\nwork in gauging image relevance is necessary to ex-\nplore the full benefits of incorporating multimodal\narticle information into the feature initialization\npipeline.15798\nTable 8: Full collection of sampled graph benchmarks.\nName #Nodes #Edges Seq. len.

Reducing content visibility, aka shadow\nbanning , may help limit harmful content; however, it can also\nbe used to suppress dissenting voices. This prompts the need for\ngreater transparency and a better understanding of this practice.\nIn this paper, we investigate the presence of visibility al-\nterations through a large-scale quantitative analysis of two\nTwitter/X datasets comprising over 40 million tweets from more\nthan 9 million users, focused on discussions surrounding the\nUkraine\u2013Russia conflict and the 2024 US Presidential Elections.\nWe use view counts to detect patterns of reduced or inflated\nvisibility and examine how these correlate with user opinions,\nsocial roles, and narrative framings. Our analysis shows that\nthe algorithm systematically penalizes tweets containing links\nto external resources, reducing their visibility by up to a\nfactor of eight, regardless of the ideological stance or source\nreliability. Rather, content visibility may be penalized or favored\ndepending on the specific accounts producing it, as observed when\ncomparing tweets from the Kyiv Independent and RT.com or\ntweets by Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Overall, our work\nhighlights the importance of transparency in content moderation\nand recommendation systems to protect the integrity of public\ndiscourse and ensure equitable access to online platforms.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nDigital spaces play a critical role in shaping today\u2019s infor-\nmation environment. Across the world, users rely on social\nplatforms to access information on a wide range of topics,\nfrom personal interests to issues of societal importance. Within\nthis ecosystem, recommendation algorithms are pivotal in\ngoverning the visibility and circulation of content. These\nalgorithms suggest or outright select content for users based on\ninterests inferred from, e.g., their interactions and connections,\nas well as the content they create or engage with.\nCrucially, recommendation algorithms can also limit the\nvisibility of some content, e.g., hashtags related to dangerous\nor inappropriate topics or information that may encourage\nharmful behaviors [36]. This is known as \u201c shadow banning ,\u201d\n\u201cvisibility alteration,\u201d or \u201creduction,\u201d and typically aims to\nmoderate online discussions, promote the dissemination of\nreliable content, and minimize the likelihood of toxic inter-\nactions to foster a healthier information ecosystem [25]. In\npractice, shadow banning and, in general, algorithmic alter-\nation aimed at reducing the visibility of a user/their content\nmight occur to control platform dynamics and for a number of\n\u2217To Appear in the Proceedings of the 33rd Network and Distributed System\nSecurity Symposium (NDSS 2026).reasons, ranging from mitigating spam/bot activity, algorithmic\ncleaning (e.g., throttling low-performing, repetitive, or self-\npromotional content), to prioritizing user retention (e.g., by\npenalizing posts linking to competing platforms).\nAlas, the details of how shadow banning works and the\nrationale behind penalizing procedures remain mostly opaque.\nIn some cases, altering visibility may be a deliberate action by\na platform\u2019s moderation team [38, 44]; in others, it could result\nfrom certain types of content being automatically flagged [16].\nWhether humans or automated systems make these decisions,\nthe lack of transparency surrounding shadow banning may\nintroduce a certain degree of arbitrariness, real or perceived,\nas users often have little or no way of determining whether\ntheir content has been subject to visibility restrictions [24].\nThis opacity also encourages doubts as to whether or not\nshadow banning may be used to suppress specific viewpoints\nor communities [38]. The difficulty in detecting it, compared\nto more visible actions like account suspensions or bans,\nfurther exacerbates these concerns. Users may remain unaware\nthat their content is being deliberately suppressed, which can\nlead to accusations of bias or censorship [29]. For example,\njournalists have reported internal mechanisms on platforms\nlike Twitter (now X) and Facebook that reduce the visibility\nof certain types of content without notifying users [39].\nWhile Twitter/X previously denied engaging in shadow\nbanning [29], the platform\u2019s updates to its terms of service\nin 2024 began to acknowledge the use of such practices [42].\nThis has fueled debates about the fairness and transparency of\ncontent moderation. The ability to shape or manipulate online\ndebates to serve corporate or political interests arguably poses\na significant threat to democratic discourse. Moreover, some\nhave criticized the potential for platforms to silence political or\nideological views under the guise of content moderation [11]\n\u2013 for instance, Elon Musk claimed that Twitter previously\npenalized conservative viewpoints, asserting that the so-called\n\u201cTwitter Files\u201d suggested algorithmic interventions biased\nagainst certain ideologies [37].\nBeyond anecdotal evidence, researchers have begun looking\ninto shadow banning through technical and statistical analyses\n(see Section II). Overall, prior work suggests that shadow\nbanning is relatively widespread across social media plat-\nforms [7, 29]. However, the lack of transparency in applying\nthese techniques raises serious concerns. This prompts the\nneed for systematic techniques to detect and measure visibil-\nity alterations and assess whether platforms employ shadowarXiv:2410.17390v3  [cs.SI]  4 Aug 2025\nbanning to favor specific narratives, limit dissenting voices, or\nprioritize corporate interests.\nTechnical Roadmap. Prior work has investigated shadow ban-\nning by analyzing search results or auditing recommendation\nalgorithms, revealing potentially systematic penalization of\nspecific users or content. However, these methods have not\nbeen able to determine whether content is penalized based on\nspecific features (e.g., the presence of URLs), particularly at\nthe debate level or across different topics.\nIn this paper, we aim to address this gap and evaluate the\npresence of visibility alterations in the wild using view counts,\na largely underexplored metric in related work introduced\non Twitter in 2022 and once available through the now\nmostly defunct API. As academic access to the API has\nbeen restricted since June 2023 [22, 34], we turn to two\npublicly available datasets that include view counts: 1) almost\n35M tweets related to the 2024 US Presidential Election,\nreleased by Balasubramanian et al. [4], and 2) over 17M tweets\nrelated to military aid in the Ukraine-Russia war, released by\nBaqir et al. [5].1Our methodology relies on data analysis\nand network science techniques to uncover traces of shadow\nbanning at the content, user, and network levels, shedding\nlight on visibility alterations. Although the inaccessibility of\nthe platform\u2019s recommendation algorithm prevents us from\nestablishing an explicit causal link to algorithmic design,\nour findings provide reasonable evidence in support of this\nhypothesis. While alternative explanations are possible, we\ndiscuss why they are unlikely to hold in Section VI.\nResearch Questions. Overall, we identify and address the\nfollowing research questions:\n\u2022RQ1. Does the visibility of content depend on the char-\nacteristics of the information it contains? Our analysis\nexamines how various content features, including the\npresence of external links, political bias, factuality of the\nsources, and ideological stance, may influence visibility.\n\u2022RQ2. Do users experience different levels of visibility?\nWe analyze the activities of prominent accounts to detect\nsystematic variations in individual content visibility, i.e.,\nwhether some users\u2019 content consistently receives less\nexposure.\n\u2022RQ3. Does visibility vary across different communities?\nSocial media users tend to form ideologically homoge-\nneous communities through repeated interactions; thus,\nwe investigate whether the content generated within these\ncommunities exhibits varying levels of visibility.\nMain Findings. We introduce and use a new metric that\naccounts for author popularity when evaluating content visi-\nbility, called p-score , testing its dependence on content, users,\nand community characteristics. We find that visibility can\nvary substantially depending on content characteristics, both\nfor content related to the Ukraine-Russia War and the 2024\nUS Elections. Even users with comparable profiles experience\n1As Twitter rebranded to X in July 2023, tweets are now called posts. Since\none of our datasets was collected before the rebranding and one after, to ease\npresentation, in the rest of the paper, we stick to \u201ctweets.\u201ddrastic differences in visibility\u2014sometimes differing by orders\nof magnitude.\nAmong other things, we emphasize the following findings:\n1) At the content level (RQ1), tweets containing links to\nexternal websites have a significantly lower median p-\nscore than those without links\u2014respectively, approxi-\nmately eight times for Ukraine-Russia and four times\nfor the US Elections dataset.\n2) From the point of view of user-level visibility (RQ2),\naccounts that frequently post URLs and automated\naccounts are further penalized. Furthermore, in the\nUkraine-Russia dataset, two prominent news outlets with\ncomparable popularity (namely, RT.com and The Kyiv\nIndependent) exhibit a median p-score differing by one\norder of magnitude (0.0069 vs. 0.084). A similar trend\nemerges in the US Elections dataset, where Donald\nTrump\u2019s median p-score is approximately four times\nhigher than that of Kamala Harris (0.132 vs. 0.030).\n3) Analyzing visibility variations at the community level\n(RQ3), using retweet and reply information, does not\nreveal systematic penalization of specific groups.\nThese discrepancies support the hypothesis that algorith-\nmic interventions like shadow banning may be occurring, as\nTwitter/X\u2019s recommendation algorithm systematically favors\ntweets without external URLs. Although we do not find\nevidence that specific topics, viewpoints, or communities are\nsystematically penalized, interesting individual-level discrep-\nancies do emerge, e.g., in the cases of The Kyiv Independent\nvs. RT.com and Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris.\nOverall, our work introduces a data-driven methodology\nusing view counts and data science tools for detecting alter-\nations in content exposure across different contexts. It also\nfurther highlights the importance of accessing information\nabout content exposure to enhance transparency in social\nmedia algorithms and promote fairness and trustworthiness in\nonline information ecosystems.\nDisclaimer: Throughout the paper, we refer to systematic\nsuppression, penalization, etc., in a broad sense, also to en-\ncompass selective content treatment. That is, we do not imply\nthat suppression is necessarily ideologically motivated.\nII. R ELATED WORK\nIn recent years, researchers have begun to work on identify-\ning and categorizing various types of algorithmic moderation\ntechniques, examining their consequences on the dynamics of\ninformation environments, and exploring their broader societal\nimpact. Several studies highlight how algorithmic moderation\nshapes the visibility of content and influences public discourse.\nFor instance, Zannettou et al. [45] present a large-scale anal-\nysis of Twitter, identifying content suppression instances, par-\nticularly in political debates, where specific hashtags were sys-\ntematically downranked, limiting their reach. Jiang et al. [26]\nexplore the impact of political bias in comment moderation on\nYouTube, finding that the likelihood of comment removal is\nindependent of the political leanings of the video, even though\nother potential biases may persist in moderation practices.\nPrior work has also examined the effects of algorithmic\ncuration on users\u2019 exposure to diverse content. Algorithms\nhave been shown to influence what users see on Twitter [7],\nFacebook [3], TikTok [41], YouTube [21], and Google [35].\nBakshy et al. [3] analyze how Facebook\u2019s algorithm reduces\nexposure to ideologically diverse news, contributing to filter\nbubbles and echo chambers [9]. On TikTok, V ombatkere et\nal. [41] find that the recommendation system primarily favors\ncontent based on likes and friendship relations, potentially\ncontributing to users\u2019 segregation.\nIn an effort to improve transparency, some platforms may\noffer explanations for why they remove content. However,\nthese are often implausible or misleading, as observed by\nMousavi et al. [31] for TikTok. Whereas, Jhaver et al. [23]\ndemonstrate that providing users with meaningful explanations\nfor content moderation decisions on Reddit reduces the likeli-\nhood of future post removals, indicating that transparency can\npositively influence user behavior.\nSpecifically related to shadow banning, Le Merrer et al. [29]\ninvestigate different algorithmic interventions on Twitter aimed\nto reduce the visibility of certain content or accounts without\noutright removal. Their findings highlight the widespread\npresence of traces of visibility interventions across various user\ngroups and communities. Compared to our work, their study\nfocuses on account-level interventions based on appearances\nin suggestions, search results, or discussion cascades, without\nconsidering alterations at the content level.\nBeyond technical analysis, scholars have also examined\nthe broader implications of algorithmic moderation, particu-\nlarly its impact on free speech, public discourse, and user\ntrust. Gillespie [16] argues that content recommendation itself\nfunctions as a form of moderation, emphasizing the lack\nof transparency in how platforms manage visibility. This\nopacity can obscure biases in content curation and contribute\nto inequities among different communities, eroding trust in\nthese systems. Others have explored societal and political\nconsequences. For example, DeVito [10] analyzes the limited\ninformation released about Facebook\u2019s News Feed algorithm,\nuncovering the underlying values that shape its decisions and\ncalling for greater regulatory oversight.\nOverall, previous studies analyzing the presence of shadow\nbanning and biases in algorithmic suggestion systems have\nmostly relied on bots [21], developed auditing models [31, 35],\nor examined algorithmic interventions by analyzing search\nquery results [29]. However, algorithmic interventions that\nshape content visibility exist at different levels and in various\nforms, ranging from downranking in suggestion systems to\ncomplete hiding in search results. In this paper, we approach\nthis issue from a broader perspective, leveraging the number\nof times a piece of content has been viewed to detect the\npresence of shadow banning. This allows us to capture the\neffects of multiple types of interventions without being limited\nto a specific form of algorithmic action.III. D ATASET\nWe now present the datasets analyzed in our study, specif-\nically, two sets of Twitter/X posts that include view counts,\ni.e., the total number of times they have been viewed.\nUkraine-Russia War Dataset. In 2023, Baqir et al. [5]\ncollected tweets related to military aid in the Ukraine-Russia\nwar through the Academic API.2More precisely, they used the\nfollowing set of keywords: \u2018military aid,\u2019 \u2018military support,\u2019\n\u2018tanks,\u2019 \u2018Abrams,\u2019 \u2018Leopard,\u2019 \u2018Challenger,\u2019 \u2018jet,\u2019 \u2018aircraft,\u2019 \u2018mu-\nnitions,\u2019 \u2018HIMARS,\u2019 \u2018rockets,\u2019 and \u2018missile.\u2019 In addition to\ntweet metadata typically found in other datasets, this dataset\nalso includes view counts for each piece of content.\nOverall, the Ukraine-Russia war dataset includes over 17\nmillion tweets from more than 5.2 million users, posted be-\ntween November 22, 2022, and March 1, 2023, and collected\nin April 2023. The temporal gap between tweet creation and\ncollection ensures that engagement and view metrics have\nstabilized, thus enabling robust analysis [33] and providing a\nmeaningful snapshot of the discourse surrounding the Ukraine-\nRussia conflict on Twitter [5].\n2024 US Elections. The second dataset was collected by\nBalasubramanian et al. [4] using a custom-built scraper.3The\nauthors curated a list of 44 keywords related to the 2024\nUS Elections, including \u20182024 Elections,\u2019 \u2018Donald Trump,\u2019\n\u2018letsgobrandon,\u2019 \u2018ultramaga,\u2019 etc. Following retrieval, we filter\nthe data as discussed in Section IV-A and obtain approximately\n35 million tweets with valid view counts by 3.8 million users.\nArguably, these two datasets are well-suited to the purpose\nof our analysis, i.e., studying the occurrence and characteristics\nof shadow banning. More precisely, the topic of the Ukraine-\nRussia war has polarized public opinion into supporters and\nopponents with clearly distinct stances [28]. This allows us\nto identify the factions involved in the debate and evaluate\nwhether Twitter/X has been altering the visibility of specific\nnarratives. Similarly, discourse around US Elections is inher-\nently polarized; thus, Balasubramanian\u2019s dataset [4] lends itself\nto identifying opposing factions (i.e., supporters of different\npolitical candidates) and enables the analysis of visibility\nalterations at the community level.\nAs we apply several transformations to the datasets through-\nout the different stages of our analysis (see Section IV), we\nprovide summary statistics for the datasets used in the main\nsteps of this study in Table I.\nIV.

The influencers are then used to infer users\u2019 ideolog-\nical stances and analyze visibility variations with respect to\nideology. In this section, we discuss these actions in detail.\nA. Pre-Processing\nFor a sample of tweets, we manually verify that the view\ncounts in our datasets are broadly consistent with those dis-\nplayed on the Twitter/X platform. While we observe minor\ndiscrepancies, these are likely due to the interval between data\ncollection and manual verification, during which view counts\nmay have slightly changed. Overall, our sanity check confirms\nthe reasonable reliability of the datasets from [4, 5].\nWe also perform a filtering procedure to remove potentially\ninconsistent records, specifically, content for which the view\ncount is unavailable and content for which the number of\ninteractions (i.e., likes, comments, retweets, or quotes) exceeds\nthe recorded number of views, as users must view the content\nbefore engaging with it.\nB. Factuality and Political Bias Estimation\nTo test the dependence of visibility variations on content-\nlevel features like political bias and factuality (cf. RQ1 in\nSection I), we rely on third-party classifications to infer the\npolitical bias and factuality of the news sources referenced\nin the debate. More precisely, we use a dataset obtained\nfrom Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), an independent fact-\nchecking organization that categorizes news outlets based\non their factuality and political bias.4This includes 2,190\ndifferent news outlets, along with their domain names, political\nleaning, and factuality, and classifies outlets across the political\nspectrum, from \u201cextreme left\u201d to \u201cextreme right.\u201d Additionally,\nsome outlets are labeled as \u201cquestionable\u201d or \u201cconspiracy-\npseudoscience\u201d if they frequently publish misinformation,\nfalse content, or endorse conspiracy theories.\nWe use the MBFC dataset to assign factuality (from \u2018Very\nHigh\u2019 to \u2018Very Low\u2019) and political bias (\u2018Extreme Right\u2019 to\n\u2018Extreme Left\u2019) to tweets based on the domain referenced.\nFor example, a tweet linking to a CNN article is classified as\n\u2018Mostly Factual\u2019 with a \u2018Left-Center\u2019 bias, and one linking to\nRT News has a \u2018Very Low\u2019 factuality with a right-center bias.\n4https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/.C. Influencers Selection\nStudying the relationship between variations in visibility and\nindividual features like ideological stance (cf. RQ2) requires\nus to infer users\u2019 opinions. To this end, we use Latent Ideology\nEstimation [15], a flexible and powerful method for inferring\nusers\u2019 ideological stances that relies on the identification of a\nset of influential accounts actively engaged in the debate. This\ngroup of users, referred to as influencers, must encompass\nseveral subcategories and represent a broad range of opinions\nacross the ideological spectrum.\nFor the Ukraine-Russia dataset, we follow the procedure\nexplained in [5] and build a network using retweet interactions,\nranking accounts based on their in-degree, i.e., the number of\nunique users who retweeted them. We then manually select a\nset of prominent accounts representing both sides of the de-\nbate, prioritizing those with the highest in-degree. This initial\nset serves as a seed, and we expand it by utilizing Twitter\u2019s\n\u201cWho to follow\u201d recommendations from the selected accounts\u2019\nprofiles. We repeat this process until no new relevant accounts\nare suggested. The selection is then refined by excluding\naccounts with an in-degree below 100 or those whose content\nwas unrelated to the Ukrainian conflict. Ultimately, this yields\na final set of 204 influencers, representing both supporters and\nopponents of military support to Ukraine.\nFor the 2024 US Elections dataset, retweet interactions\nare not sufficiently rich to enable a reliable estimation of\nusers\u2019 opinions, as the dataset contains only a few hundred\nretweets. Therefore, we use reply interactions to reconstruct\nthe interaction network, which, although noisier, still allows\nus to distinguish between the two groups. We identify the most\nreplied-to users and manually extract the top 100 accounts\nexhibiting a clear stance, either supporting or opposing Trump.\nThis allows us to select a balanced set of influencers repre-\nsenting both pro- and anti-Trump positions. Using Hartigan\u2019s\ndip test of unimodality [19], we confirm the bimodal nature\nof the latent ideological estimation distribution for users and\ninfluencers in both datasets (Ukraine-Russia War: D = 0.027,\np-value <2.2e\u221216for users and D = 0.074, p-value\n= 5.078e\u221206for influencers; US Elections: D = 0.012, p-\nvalue <2.2e\u221216for users and D = 0.106, p-value <2.2e\u221216\nfor influencers). This result highlights the polarized nature of\nthe debate, as well as the reliability of our inference [15].\nD. Users\u2019 Ideological Stance Estimation\nLatent Ideology Estimation is a proven method for reliably\nestimating user ideology in diverse contexts [6, 13, 15]. Using\nthe set of accounts identified using the methodology described\nabove, we apply this algorithm to the Ukraine-Russia war and\nthe US 2024 Elections debates to infer users\u2019 stances and\ncontribute to answering RQ2. Crucially, this algorithm depends\non identifying a subset of key influencers, as their selection\nsignificantly affects the accuracy of the ideology estimation.\nOnce the influencer set is identified, we apply the Cor-\nrespondence Analysis algorithm [17], performing three main\nsteps: 1) constructing an interaction matrix, 2) normalizing it,\nand 3) performing singular value decomposition (SVD). More\nprecisely, in the first step, we build the matrix A, where each\nelement Aijrepresents the number of interactions (retweets\nfor Ukraine-Russia, replies for US 2024 elections) that user\nidirects to influencer j. We then normalize Aby dividing\nit by the total number of interactions, yielding P=AP\nijAij.\nUsing the following quantities: r=P1,c=1TP,Dr=\ndiag(r), and Dc=diag(c), we normalize further to obtain\nS=D\u22121/2\nr(P\u2212rc)D\u22121/2\nc . In the third step, we perform\nsingular value decomposition of S, such that S=U\u03a3VT,\nwhere UandVare orthogonal matrices and \u03a3is a diagonal\nmatrix of singular values. We estimate user ideological leaning\nby taking the subspace associated with the first singular value\nof the decomposition. Specifically, the latent ideology of user\niis the i-th entry in the first column of the matrix U, while\nthe ideology of each influencer is estimated as the median\nideology score of their retweeters/repliers.\nE. Claim Detection and Tracking\nTo get a more nuanced understanding of the different\ntypes of textual content and visibility patterns associated with\nthem, we focus on claim-level analysis of tweets. This is\nan additional vantage point to help us answer RQ1, with an\nemphasis on the claims being spread around different topics.\nTo this end, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\nLearning to Rank (LTR) techniques to group tweets into a\ncoherent structure of claims.\nFirst, we use the claim extraction pipeline from Lam-\nbretta [32] to extract claims from tweets that make an objective\nclaim and are candidates for being tracked through down-\nstream keyword extraction or semantic search methodologies.\nThese claims are structurally similar to those manually curated\nby fact-checking organizations like Snopes or PolitiFact.5. We\nsample 1,000 unique tweets sorted by several different criteria\nof engagement: 1) Retweet count, 2) Reply count, 3) Like\ncount, 4) Quote count, and 5) Views count. This sampling\ngives us a set of tweets that have a higher likelihood of\ncontaining a claim (and thus garnered the level of interaction\non Twitter), rather than sampling tweets randomly. We then\nuse ClaimSpotter [20] to identify tweets that contain a claim:\nClaimSpotter returns a score between 0 and 1, representing\nhow \u201ccheck-worthy\u201d an input text is. Consistent with [32], we\n5See www.snopes.com, https://www.politifact.com/select 0.5 as the threshold for classifying tweets containing\na claim. For the filtered tweets containing a claim, we use\nLambretta\u2019s keyword identification component to extract the\nbest set of keywords representing the claim. Finally, we\nretrieve similar tweets that make the same claim as the seed\nset using the extracted set of keywords and use these subsets\nof tweets to analyze different visibility patterns.\nSince the tweets in the datasets span longitudinally and\ncontain a multitude of events (both related to the Ukraine-\nRussia war and the 2024 US Elections), we further label the\nclaims identified in the seed set of tweets to different themes.\nThis makes the analysis tractable while allowing us to achieve\nthe granular content level analysis. We use the unsupervised\ntopic modeling library BertTopic [18] to identify coherent\ntopics within the seed set of claims. We select a laxer threshold\n(number of documents in a topic, and similarity measure for\ntwo claims to be assigned the same topic), resulting in a\nlarger number of initial topics. These topics are then manually\ncleaned for noise (artifacts of keywords used in the initial data\nsampling process) and iteratively assigned to themes. This\nway, we have a hierarchy of themes within the seed set of\nclaims and a subset of tweets across themes whose visibility\npatterns can be compared.\nF . P-score\nAs mentioned earlier, we use the \u201cview count\u201d metric to\nexamine differences in visibility across the Ukraine-Russia\nWar and the 2024 US Elections datasets. We do so as shadow\nbanning essentially is the act of reducing the visibility of\nspecific profiles or content through various techniques [16, 29].\nThus, view counts are an appropriate proxy for quantifying\nvisibility. However, directly comparing the visibility of users\nmay prompt some challenges \u2013 more precisely, content visi-\nbility on social networks heavily depends on the popularity of\nthe author, as social media algorithms use follower-following\nrelationships to suggest content [41].\nAs a result, we introduce and use a metric denoted as p-\nscore , which accounts for the author\u2019s popularity as follows:\np-score =view count\nnumber of followers(1)\nIn other words, the p-score of a tweet quantifies the ratio\nbetween the number of views it receives and the number of\nfollowers of its author. Hence, a higher p-score indicates that\ncontent receives more views per follower, while lower values\nsuggest more limited circulation.\nV. D ETECTING VISIBILITY VARIATIONS\nIn this section, we set out to answer our three research\nquestions (cf. Section I) related to studying the occurrence\nof shadow banning at content, user, and network levels.\nA. RQ1: Content Level\nTo analyze the occurrence of shadow banning at the content\nlevel, we examine whether the p-scores of the tweets depend\non the type of information they convey. To ensure a fair com-\nparison and avoid possible confounding factors, we exclude\n0.000.020.040.06\n1e\u221204 1e\u221201 1e+02 1e+05\nP\u2212scoreFraction of Tweets(a)Ukraine-Russia War\n0.000.020.040.06\n1e\u221205 1e\u221202 1e+01 1e+04\nP\u2212scoreFraction of Tweets (b)2024 US Elections\nFig. 1: P-score distributions of original content for the Ukraine-Russia War and the 2024 US Elections datasets.

The colors represent the disparity in users\u2019 contributions to each interval as per the Gini\nindex. Higher values indicate that a small number of users generate most of the content within the interval, while lower values suggest a\nmore uniform distribution. Red lines mark the median of the distribution for each category.\nreplies, retweets, and quotes from the analysis, ending up with\n1.8M tweets for the Ukraine-Russia dataset and 7.2M tweets\nfor the 2024 US Elections dataset.\nWe classify tweets based on the domain they refer to using\nthe MBFC dataset (see Section IV-B), dividing them into five\ncategories: \u201cNews Outlets,\u201d \u201cNo Domain,\u201d \u201cOther,\u201d \u201cOther\nSocial,\u201d and \u201cTwitter.\u201d These refer, respectively, to tweets that\ncontain a link to a news outlet, no link, a link to an unclassified\nwebsite, a link to another social platform, and quoting a tweet.\nContent P-Score Distributions. We begin by examining\nwhether tweets, categorized by the type or absence of external\nURLs, exhibit differences in p-score distributions. In Figure 1,\nwe plot the distribution of the p-scores for all original content\n(i.e., without considering replies, retweets, and quotes) for\neach category of content. For both datasets, the distribution\nhas a log-normal shape, even though the categories contribute\ndifferently to the distribution density. For instance, the \u201cOther\u201d\nand \u201cNews Outlets\u201d categories contribute more to lower val-\nues, while \u201cNo Domain\u201d appears to be skewed toward higher\nvalues. Also, the spectrum of this distribution can vary widely,\nspanning nine orders of magnitude.\nAlthough the wide range of p-scores can be explained\nby the typical dynamics of social networks, whereby some\ncontent goes viral, some is ignored, and the majority receives\na few interactions, the spectrum\u2019s unbalanced and asymmetric\nconstitution suggests the presence of different visibility levels\nfor different categories. Tweets that do not link to otherContent Ukraine-Russia US Elections\nNews Outlet 252,046 1,564,923\nNo Domain 796,673 4,317,988\nOther 730,078 851,246\nOther Social 65,025 483,346\nTwitter 1,463 24,509\nTABLE II: Tweets by content type for distributions from Figure 2.\ndomains seem favored over others in both datasets. However,\nthis difference seems to be considerably more pronounced in\nthe Ukraine-Russia dataset than for the 2024 US Elections.\nThis may suggest a varying degree of intervention over time,\nwhile also highlighting the algorithm\u2019s systematic promotion\nof content without external URLs.\nArtifacts in Content Visibility Distributions. We also ob-\nserve the presence of peaks in certain intervals of the distri-\nbutions in the Ukraine-Russia dataset. This may depend on\nthe systematic penalization of specific users or the algorithm\ndetecting inappropriate content and limiting its circulation.\nWe analyze the distribution of user contributions within each\ninterval to better understand the causes of these outliers and the\nrole of users in shaping them. To do so, we use the Gini index,\na common metric to measure the inequality of distributions,\ncomputing it on the distribution of the number of tweets per\ninterval for each author [43]. In our case, if all users contribute\nto the population of an interval with approximately the same\nnumber of tweets, the Gini index is close to 0, whereas if a\nsignificant disparity exists, with some users generating most\ntweets in the interval, the index approaches 1.\nIn Figure 2, we present the distribution of p-scores across\ntweet categories for both datasets (also see Table II). In both\ncases, the median p-score (marked by the red line) for the \u201cNo\nDomain\u201d category is higher than for all others, confirming\nobservations from Figure 1. Specifically, tweets from news\noutlets exhibit the lowest median p-scores (0.033 for Ukraine-\nRussia, 0.012 for US Elections), while \u201cNo Domain\u201d content\nshows significantly higher medians (Ukraine-Russia: 0.246;\nUS Elections: 0.056). This further supports the hypothesis\nthat Twitter\u2019s algorithm favors content that does not contain\nexternal URLs. Interestingly, tweets linking to unclassified\nwebsites have median p-scores close to those of news outlets\n(Ukraine-Russia: 0.036; US Elections: 0.014), whereas tweets\nquoting other tweets or linking to other social platforms are\nslightly less penalized (median p-scores of 0.097 and 0.150\nfor Ukraine-Russia and 0.029 and 0.024 for US Elections). To\nvalidate these observations, we perform a Mann-Whitney U\ntest between all pairs of content categories to assess whether\nthe values in one group tend to be greater than those in\nanother [30]. The Mann-Whitney U test does not assume\nnormality and instead evaluates whether there is a statistically\nsignificant shift between distributions. In our case, a low p-\nvalue indicates strong evidence that the values from one group\nare systematically higher than those from another. For both\nthe Ukraine-Russia and US Elections datasets, the tests con-\nfirm that the \u201cNo Domain\u201d category statistically significantly\ndominates all others (p-value <2.2e\u221216for all comparisons).\nFor the Ukraine-Russia dataset, the peaks in the \u201cOther\u201d\ndistribution correspond to the intervals with the highest Gini\nscores, indicating the presence of users with a high volume\nof tweets who receive a similar level of visibility. Indeed,\nmost of the content populating these intervals belongs to a\nfew accounts explicitly labeled as automated by the platform,\nsuggesting that the algorithm may be limiting the visibility of\ntheir content. A similar behavior, although less pronounced,\nemerges in the 2024 US Elections dataset. The highest level\nof imbalance appears in the left tail of the \u201cOther\u201d category\ndistribution, where a substantial portion of tweets comes from\na few highly active accounts that primarily discuss news by\nfrequently linking to external websites. For instance, the most\nrepresented account in the bins with the highest disparity\nvalues has an average activity of 38 tweets per day, with\n97.5% of its content linking to external websites, suggesting\nthat the algorithm may further penalize very active users who\nfrequently post URLs.\nOverall, these artifacts in the distributions of content vis-\nibility reflect an unbalanced contribution by users for both\ndatasets, pointing to interventions aimed at reducing the vis-\nibility of specific accounts. These patterns also confirm the\nconsistent application of such practices over time.\nPolitical Bias and Factuality. Next, we analyze the depen-\ndence of visibility on the political bias and factuality of thecontent being shared. We apply the same methodology to\nassess whether visibility varies based on the political bias and\nfactuality of the sources referenced in tweets, for both the\nUkraine-Russia War (Figure 3a\u20133b) and the 2024 US Elections\n(Figure 3c\u20133d) debates (also see Table III). For both datasets,\nthe results show a relatively contained variation in visibility\nacross both political bias (Ukraine-Russia: min 0.019, max\n0.05; US Elections: min 0.0081, max 0.015) and factuality\n(Ukraine-Russia: min 0.018, max 0.04; US Elections: min\n0.0086, max 0.024), suggesting that the algorithm does not\nsystematically penalize content based on these attributes. This\nis also confirmed via the Mann-Whitney U test, which did not\nfind a dominant category for political leaning in the Ukraine-\nRussia dataset (all categories exhibit p-values >0.05 in at\nleast one comparison). As for factuality, the tests highlight\nthat the \u201cMixed\u201d and \u201cLow\u201d categories tend to be penalized\n(maximum p-values <2.2e\u221216and 0.0019, respectively), but\nreject the hypothesis that \u201cVery Low\u201d content is consistently\noutperformed by \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cVery High\u201d categories. Similarly,\nin the US Elections dataset, there is no evidence of clear\ndominance among political leanings (all categories have p-\nvalues >0.05 in at least one comparison), although the tests\ndetect the lower performance of the \u201cLeft\u201d category (p-value\n<2.2e\u221216). Interestingly, for factuality, \u201cVery High\u201d content\noutperforms all other categories (p-values <2.2e\u221216in\nall comparisons), while no clear dominance emerges among\nthe remaining classes. However, the number of tweets in the\n\u201cVery High\u201d category is considerably smaller than in others\n(see Table III), suggesting an occasional rather than systematic\nconsumption of highly factual content in the US Elections\ndebate.\nNotably, the \u201cRight-Center\u201d and \u201cMixed\u201d categories in\nthe Ukraine-Russia dataset exhibit a higher Gini index in\nsome lower p-score bins, suggesting the possible presence of\npenalized domains belonging to those categories. For the US\nElections dataset, this effect is less pronounced, with only\nthe \u201cRight-Center\u201d category showing minor anomalies with\nslightly higher Gini indices. Additionally, the latter displays\ngreater variation in the Gini index across the distribution, with\nlower p-score bins having higher Gini values. However, this\nbehavior appears to affect all categories of political bias and\nfactuality \u2013 except \u201cVery High,\u201d which has considerably fewer\nobservations \u2013 and thus does not suggest targeted interventions\nto limit the visibility of specific categories. Overall, the\nanalysis of content features and their influence on visibility\nhighlights that content circulation on Twitter is influenced\nprimarily by the presence of external URLs, rather than by\nthe political stance or factuality of the information conveyed,\nwith tweets containing links to external sources systematically\npenalized by the recommendation algorithm.\nTopics. Next, we use the textual content of tweets to investi-\ngate whether the different topics being discussed experienced\nvarying levels of visibility.

Keyword extraction\nand the subsequent matching procedure return 151,697 tweets\ndiscussing claims related to the seed topics.

A similar pattern is observed in the US Elections\ndataset, where the highest median p-score corresponds to the\n\u201cInternational Conflicts & Electoral Impact\u201d theme (0.0561),\nwhile the lowest to the \u201cPolicy Debates & Issues\u201d theme\n(0.0349). Taken together, these results suggest the lack of any\ntopic-oriented intervention on the algorithm\u2019s part.\nB. RQ2: User Level\nBesides content-level visibility, reductions can also affect\nindividual accounts, regardless of what they post. Hence, we\nanalyze whether users experience different levels of visibility\nbased on their role in the debate and their ideological stance,\nspecifically, their support for or opposition to military aid to\nUkraine as well as support for or opposition to Donald Trump\nin the lead-up to the 2024 US Elections.\nInferring Users\u2019 Ideology. To perform account-level analysis,\nwe first need to infer users\u2019 attributes, such as their stance on\nthe debated issue. To this end, we use latent ideology estima-\ntion (see Section IV-D) to classify users\u2019 ideological stances.\nGiven a set of prominent accounts known as influencers (see\n0.000.020.040.06\n1e\u221202 1e+01 1e+04\nP\u2212scoreFraction of TweetsTweet theme\nCriticism of US Military Support to Ukraine\nEurope/NATO Military Support to Ukraine\nPro\u2212Russian Sentiment\nUS Military Support to Ukraine\nWar Related Reporting and Events(a)Ukraine-Russia War\n0.000.010.020.03\n1e\u221204 1e\u221201 1e+02 1e+05\nP\u2212scoreFraction of TweetsTweet theme\nAnti\u2212Trump Campaign Messaging\nInternational Conflicts & Electoral Impact\nPolicy Debates & Issues\nPro\u2212Trump Campaign Messaging\nPublic Reaction & Media Coverage\nScandals, Conspiracies & Legal Controversies (b)2024 US Elections\nFig. 4: P-score distributions of original content with colors representing the different themes of tweets, highlighting the contributions of each\ntheme depending on the p-score.\nWar Related Reporting and EventsUS Military Support to UkrainePro\u2212Russian SentimentEurope/NATO Military Support to UkraineCriticism of US Military Support to Ukraine\n10\u221221011040.000.010.020.030.04\n0.000.010.020.030.040.05\n0.000.010.020.030.04\n0.000.010.020.030.04\n0.000.010.020.030.04\nP\u2212scoreTweet count\n(a)Ukraine-Russia War\nScandals, Conspiracies & Legal ControversiesPublic Reaction & Media CoveragePro\u2212Trump Campaign MessagingPolicy Debates & IssuesInternational Conflicts & Electoral ImpactAnti\u2212Trump Campaign Messaging\n10\u2212410\u221211021050.0000.0050.0100.0150.0200.025\n0.0000.0050.0100.0150.0200.025\n0.000.010.02\n0.000.010.02\n0.0000.0050.0100.0150.0200.025\n0.000.010.02\nP\u2212scoreTweet count (b)2024 US Elections\nFig. 5: P-score distributions by category with colors representing the disparity in users\u2019 contributions to each interval as per the Gini index.\nHigher values indicate that a small number of users generate most of the content within the interval, lower values a more uniform distribution.\nRed lines mark the median of the distribution for each theme.\nSection IV-C), this technique allows us to infer users\u2019 stances\nbased on interaction information. Matrix decomposition maps\nusers who interacted with a similar set of influencers close to\neach other in a real space, while users with fewer common\ninfluencers are positioned farther apart.\nDue to the absence of retweet statistics for the 2024 US\nElections dataset, we estimate latent ideology using retweet\ninteractions for the Ukraine-Russia and reply interactions for\nthe US Elections datasets. As mentioned, we do so as the latter\nonly includes a few hundred retweets that did not have a valid\nview count. Although users\u2019 estimaton results a bit noisier,\nthe use of replies does not affect the overall ability to infer\naccounts\u2019 stances as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, where we\ncan still distinguish between influencers pro/against aid and\npro/against Trump. Both datasets exhibit two communities\npositioned at opposite ends of the [\u22121,1]space, revealing\npolarized debates with bimodal opinion distributions, as also\nhighlighted by Baqir et al. [5] in the context of the Ukraine-\nRussia war and by the Dip test as reported in Section IV-C.\nIn each debate, we categorize accounts into two stances:\nsupporters (ideology score <0) or opponents of military aid\n(ideology score >0), and supporters (ideology score >0)\nor opponents of Donald Trump (ideology score <0). We\nthen calculate the average p-score for users and influencers\nin our dataset. To ensure the robustness of our results, we\nonly consider accounts with more than five original tweets.Visibility vs Ideology. After inferring user opinions, we\nanalyze whether the visibility of the account is influenced by\nthe ideology they support. Figure 8 illustrates the distributions\nof the average p-score for users and influencers representing\nopposing ideological stances in the two debates. Influencers\ntend to have higher average p-scores than users in both debates,\nlikely due to their prominent role and greater popularity. How-\never, there is little difference between the p-score distributions\nof users and influencers when comparing ideological stances\nin both the Ukraine-Russia and US Elections datasets. For\nthe Ukraine-Russia dataset, the median p-scores are 0.118 for\nsupporters vs. 0.136 for opponents among users, and 0.479 for\nsupporters vs. 0.499 for opponents among influencers. For the\nUS Elections dataset, the median p-scores are 0.049 for Trump\nsupporters vs. 0.048 for opponents among users, and 0.280 for\nTrump supporters vs. 0.358 for opponents among influencers.\nThese results are confirmed by the Mann-Whitney U test,\nwhich shows significantly higher performance for influencers\ncompared to users (p-value <0.0005 for both supporter and\nopponent influencers versus users; p-value <1.30e\u221207for\npro- and anti-Trump influencers versus users). The test also\nreveals comparable visibility between users and influencers of\ndifferent stances (p-value >0.07 for the Ukraine-Russia case\nand p-value >0.29 for the US elections).\nInfluences p-score distributions.

This is suggested by\nthe presence of outliers among influencers in Figure 8, which\nmay indicate accounts experiencing either reduced or increased\ncontent circulation due to algorithmic visibility adjustments.\nTo investigate the presence of algorithmic interventions and\nto mitigate the influence of potential confounding factors, we\nexclusively focus on influencers and divide them based on\ntheir popularity in different tiers, as done in recent work [40].\nFigure 7 displays the p-score distribution for the accounts\nused as influencers in the analysis of the two debates that\nposted more than five original pieces of content, with accounts\ngrouped according to the popularity tier they belong to.\nFor both datasets, within the same group, influencers tend to\nexhibit distributions with similar shapes but different medians,\nreinforcing the possibility of algorithmic intervention at the\nindividual level. We also observe that some influencers exhibit\nmultiple peaks in their p-score distributions. This pattern could\nbe attributed to the use of different types of content, each\nachieving varying levels of visibility, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nAlternatively, it may reflect temporal fluctuations in visibility\ndue to adjustments in the suggestion algorithm. Notably,\nin the Ukraine-Russia war debate, mfa russia and RT com\n(accounts associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a\nRussian state-sponsored news outlet, respectively) significantly\nunderperform relative to other accounts within the same tier.\nIn the US Elections debate, the accounts linked to Joe Biden\nand Kamala Harris exhibit p-score distributions skewed lower\nthan that of Donald Trump.\nCase Studies. To shed light on the individual differences\nobserved earlier, we select pairs of users with comparable\nroles in the two debates and analyze the distribution of their\np-scores. In the case of the Ukraine-Russia war debate, we\nanalyze RT com and compare it to KyivIndependent, a news\noutlet supporting Ukraine. We select these accounts as they\nhave comparable levels of popularity and belong to news\nagencies representing opposing factions, thereby minimizing\npotential confounding factors that could influence visibility.\nFor the 2024 US Elections, we select the final candidates from\nthe two major parties, i.e., Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\nOne might argue that the circulation of content also depends\non how much other users engage with it; thus, a more active\nuser base could enhance the diffusion of the author\u2019s content.\nTo assess this, Figure 9 presents a 2-D density plot of the p-\n0.0010.0100.1001.000\n3\u00d710\u2212410\u221233\u00d710\u22123\nRetweet Count/View CountP\u2212score\nKyivIndependent RT_com(a)Ukraine-Russia War\n0.0010.0100.1001.000\n10\u221233\u00d710\u2212310\u22122\nRetweet Count/View CountP\u2212score\nDonald J.

This ratio serves\nas a proxy for quantifying how actively consumers re-share\ncontent after being exposed to it. In particular, Figure 9a\nreveals that RT com and KyivIndependent have rather similar\nuser bases in terms of active sharing, as highlighted by\nthe top marginal distribution (Mann-Whitney U test p-value:\n0.093). However, they display significant differences in their\np-score distributions (Mann-Whitney U test p-value: <2.2e\u2212\n16, median p-score: KyivIndependent=0.084, RT com=0.007).\nGiven the similarities across various dimensions, these findings\nstrongly support the hypothesis that content from RT com has\nbeen subject to visibility reduction.\nIn the case of the US Elections, the separation between\nTrump-Harris distributions is less clear (Figure 9b), as the\ntwo 2D densities overlap in some areas. Nevertheless, their\nmarginal distributions differ significantly along both dimen-\nsions. Specifically, the distribution of retweet count over view\ncount reveals that Donald Trump\u2019s audience is less prone to\nexplicitly endorse his content through active engagement com-\npared to Kamala Harris\u2019s audience (median retweets/views:\n0.0025 for Trump, 0.0043 for Harris, Trump vs Harris Mann-\nWhitney U test p-value=1, Harris vs Trump Mann-Whitney U\ntest p-value = 4.543e\u221215). However, the p-score marginal\ndistributions show that most of the content produced by\n(a)Ukraine-Russia War\n (b)2024 US Elections\nFig. 10: Joint density distribution of account p-scores versus the average p-score of the account that interacted with them, categorized by\ndifferent stances and types of accounts. For the Ukraine-Russia war, the interaction network was constructed using retweets, while, for the\nUS Elections, we used replies.\nDonald Trump achieves greater visibility than that produced\nby Kamala Harris (p-score median: 0.13 Trump, 0.03 Harris,\nTrump vs Harris Mann-Whitney U test p-value <2.2e\u221216).\nHence, despite having a less active user base, Donald Trump\u2019s\ncontent experienced increased visibility, suggesting the possi-\nble influence of algorithmic intervention.\nC. RQ3: Network Level\nLast but not least, to answer RQ3, we build retweet and\nreply interaction networks and study whether users interacting\nwith each other experience similar visibility. We compute the\njoint density of the p-score for each account with respect to the\naverage p-score of the accounts that interacted with it, as illus-\ntrated in Figure 10. To avoid potential conflating factors related\nto different roles, we compute separate density distributions for\ninfluencers and users based on their ideological stance. For the\nUkraine-Russia war (Figure 10a), we use retweet information\nto capture interaction, while, for US Elections (Figure 10b),\nwe employ replies to build the interaction network due to the\nunavailability of retweets.\nThe analysis indicates an absence of correlation between\nindividual p-scores and the average p-scores of retweet-\ners/repliers across both account classes and ideological stances\nfor both datasets. Thus, users who interacted with accounts\nwith reduced visibility do not necessarily experience decreased\nvisibility themselves, regardless of account type, stance, or\ndebate. This is further supported by Pearson\u2019s correlation test,\nwhich yielded a maximum correlation value of 0.13 for the\nInfluencer-Supporter case in the Ukraine-Russia dataset and a\nvalue of 0.094 in the US elections debate.VI. D ISCUSSION\nThe visibility of content online is inherently shaped by\nrecommendation algorithms, as these determine what users see\nbased on various engagement metrics and platform-specific\ngoals [26]. Many platforms report reducing visibility as part\nof their moderation strategies to limit the spread of harmful\nor borderline content, purportedly to safeguard public dis-\ncourse [16]. However, algorithmic visibility reduction may\noccur for several reasons, for instance, to penalize low-\nperforming content or to prioritize user retention.\nRegardless, the lack of transparency around these interven-\ntions contributes to a growing distrust towards platforms [36].\nMoreover, while interventions can reduce the spread of harm-\nful content or limit the influence of problematic users (includ-\ning bots or coordinated disinformation campaigns), there is no\nguarantee that the same mechanisms are not used to silence\nminority voices or suppress narratives contrary to corporate\ninterests. These interventions are subtle, far less noticeable\nthan bans or content removal, and users may remain unaware\nthat the reach of their posts is being reduced [16].\nOur work investigated visibility reduction in the context\nof two Twitter datasets related to two polarized topics (the\nUkraine-Russia war and the 2024 US Elections) using the\ncontent views metric. This allowed us to directly observe the\neffects of algorithmic interventions and assess how visibility\nreductions vary based on several factors. In doing so, we\nanalyze both the behavior of recommendation algorithms at\na granular level and how views can help identify otherwise\nunnoticed visibility suppression.\nData availability. Practices like shadow banning can signifi-\ncantly influence online debates and shape public opinion. As\na result, the ability to study these interventions is crucial.\nHowever, while data availability is essential in doing so,\nin recent years, access to social media data for research\npurposes has become increasingly restricted [27], exacerbating\nthe opacity of platforms and further eroding public trust.\nFor instance, there is growing concern that social media\ncompanies could reduce content visibility to reduce the spread\nof misinformation, but may be choosing not to do so [1].\nIndeed, our study reveals that Twitter did not systematically\napply visibility reduction techniques to limit the spread of\nunreliable sources both in the Ukraine-Russia war and the\n2024 US Presidential Elections debates. Instead, interventions\nappear to target specific accounts flagged as problematic,\nwhile all content containing external links has been penalized,\nregardless of the credibility of the information shared.\nLongitudinal analysis. The comparison between multiple\ndatasets collected during different periods and on different\ntopics also helped us highlight the evolution of visibility\ndepending on the context considered. For example, although\nthe algorithm tends to reduce the visibility of tweets containing\nURLs, the strength of such interventions appears to differ be-\ntween the two cases. Similarly, the differences in the visibility\nanalysis at the individual level may result from variations in\nthe behavior of the recommendation algorithm.\nAdditional factors. Finally, other factors influencing content\nvisibility, including coordinated behaviors, user engagement\nstrategies, and the topic under discussion, should also be taken\ninto consideration. While these factors can exploit algorithmic\ndesign to boost visibility, our methodology proves effective\nin detecting visibility disparities between types of content\nand user behavior independently from the origin of these\ndifferences. In other words, alternative explanations for our\nfindings are, arguably, far less likely.\nFor instance, one possible reason for visibility alteration\ncould be related to bots, however, our visibility metric adjusts\nfor follower count to account for potential bot-driven infla-\ntion. Furthermore, our network analysis is designed to detect\nclusters of users with altered visibility, including those that\nmay be the result of coordinated behavior. Since no penalized\ncommunities were identified, such groups, if they exist, either\nevade detection or do not benefit from increased visibility,\nmaking coordinated manipulation an unlikely explanation. At\nthe user level, we include retweets to capture engagement-\ndriven visibility; nevertheless, users with similar roles and\nactivity levels still exhibit significant differences in visibility,\nwhich suggests that user-level factors alone cannot explain\nthe observed penalization. Lastly, the systematic reduction\nin visibility of content containing URLs in both debates,\nregardless of the type of resource referenced, strongly suggests\nalgorithmic intervention rather than varying user interest.\nEthics Considerations. Our work relies on publicly available\ndata obtained from other studies [4, 5], retrieved using the\nTwitter public API or by scraping public data, and augmentedwith publicly available tools. As such, it is not considered\nhuman subject research by our institutions. We acknowledge\nthat one of our datasets was collected by [4] using a custom\nscraper, which may potentially contravene Twitter\u2019s terms of\nservice (ToS). However, we believe our research to be in the\npublic interest, as studying platform manipulation arguably\noutweighs ToS concerns, in a manner not dissimilar to, e.g.,\nviolating robots.txt when crawling cybercrime forums [8]. In\ngeneral, ethics researchers have made the case that ethics\nmight not depend on breaking the ToS of the platforms [14].\nFurthermore, to preserve anonymity, we do not report any\ninformation about the users in the dataset other than those\nof public entities like news organizations. For accounts that\nplay an important role in the debate (i.e., influencers), we\nanonymize those with fewer than 50,000 followers, aligning\nwith previous research [13]. Overall, we believe that our work\naligns with the Menlo Report [2]\u2019s principles of Beneficence,\nRespect for Persons, and Public Interest.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nThis paper examined differences in content visibility on\nTwitter/X \u2013 at content, user, and network levels \u2013 in the context\nof the Ukraine-Russia war and the 2024 US Presidential\nElections. We relied on view counts, a largely unexplored\nfeature of Twitter/X posts, to estimate content circulation and\ndetect forms of visibility penalization that are not captured\nby techniques previously used in the literature. We found\nevidence that Twitter/X consistently favors tweets that do not\ncontain links to external websites. While the platform does not\nsystematically alter content visibility based on political views,\nthe factuality of the referenced sources, or ideological stances,\nwe do find evidence of visibility alterations at the individual\naccount level, as illustrated by the cases of RT.com versus\nThe Kyiv Independent and Donald Trump versus Kamala\nHarris. Our work demonstrates how visibility alterations can\nbe detected using engagement metrics like view counts, an\nunderexplored and often unavailable metric.\nAs mentioned, our work mainly focuses on algorithmic pe-\nnalization in a broad sense, while we do not aim to determine\nwhether/how this may be ideologically motivated.\nRecommendations. We believe that the methods proposed in\nthis paper can help researchers and civil society alike improve\ntransparency by uncovering penalization practices adopted\nby social media platforms, especially if they might end up\ninfringing on free speech. Concretely, non-profits, research\noutfits, and fact-checkers can leverage our methods to raise\nawareness and increase transparency by publishing dashboards\nof content, keywords, and domains that are anomalously\npenalized, and record historical information about potential\nchanges in visibility dynamics in public reports.\nLimitations. Our study revolves around two datasets covering\ntwo different topics and collected using different methods,\ni.e., the Academic API and Web scraping. This may result in\nvarying levels of representativeness of the debate. To mitigate\nthis potential issue, we pre-processed the data to ensure strong\ncoherence and minimize the likelihood of any artifacts influ-\nencing our results. Also, although our methodology proved\neffective in detecting visibility alterations, future and/or more\nsophisticated strategies may still go undetected.\nFinally, going forward, concerns about the limited avail-\nability of social network data for researchers cast doubts\non the feasibility of conducting at-scale audits and studies\nof algorithmic behavior and practices adopted by platforms.\nWithout data, ensuring accountability and maintaining trust in\nthese platforms will remain an uphill battle. Initiatives like\nthe Digital Services Act (DSA) [12] aim to enforce greater\ntransparency, however, the real-world implementation of these\nlaws may prove challenging.\nFuture Work. Our work could be enhanced in several ways.\nIntegrating other factors \u2013 e.g., the influence of bots and\ncoordinated accounts \u2013 could provide a more thorough un-\nderstanding of how these elements affect visibility and how\nthe algorithm responds to their presence. Also, as part of our\ndata was retrieved using official APIs, we acknowledge that\nplatforms may influence the data they provide to mask in-\ntervention patterns. While we took several integrity-enhancing\nactions to ensure the reliability of the data, one could combine\nAPI-based and scraping techniques to collect the same dataset\nto offer even more robust and nuanced insights.\nMoreover, a comparison across additional datasets covering\nadditional topics over extended periods could help identify\nchanges in algorithmic behavior. Finally, comparing visibility\npatterns across other platforms would tease out unique traits\nof Twitter\u2019s recommendation algorithm while also studying\npractices shared with other systems.\nAcknowledgments.

This bias can be inferred from how dif-\nferent media sources portray di\u000berent subjects or topics.\nIn this paper, we model visual political bias in contem-\nporary media sources at scale, using webly supervised\ndata. We collect a dataset of over one million unique\nimages and associated news articles from left- and right-\nleaning news sources, and develop a method to predict\nthe image's political leaning. This problem is particu-\nlarly challenging because of the enormous intra-class\nvisual and semantic diversity of our data. We propose\ntwo stages of training to tackle this problem. In the\n\frst stage, the model is forced to learn relevant visual\nconcepts that, when joined with document embeddings\ncomputed from articles paired with the images, enable\nthe model to predict bias. In the second stage, we remove\nthe requirement of the text domain and train a visual\nclassi\fer from the features of the former model. We show\nthis two-stage approach that relies on an auxiliary task\nleveraging text, facilitates learning and outperforms sev-\neral strong baselines. We present extensive quantitative\nand qualitative results analyzing our dataset. Our results\nreveal disparities in how di\u000berent sides of the political\nspectrum portray individuals, groups, and topics.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Na-\ntional Science Foundation under Grant Numbers 1566270 and\n1718262.

The same\nissue can be presented from multiple perspectives, both\nin terms of the text written, and the visual content cho-\nsen to illustrate the article. For example, when speak-\ning of immigration, left-leaning sources might show-\ncase the struggles of well-meaning immigrants, while\nright-leaning sources might portray the misdeeds of law-\nbreaking immigrants. The topics portrayed are also a\nstrong cue for the left or right bias of the source media|\nfor example, tradition is primarily seen as a value on\nthe right, and diversity on the left (Edsall, 2012).\nIn this paper, we present a method for recognizing\nthe political bias of an image, which we de\fne as whether\nthe image came from a left- or right-leaning media source.\nThis requires understanding: 1) what visual concepts\nto look for in images, and 2) how these visual concepts\nare portrayed across the spectrum. Note that this is\na very challenging task because many of the concepts\nthat we aim to learn show serious visual variability\nwithin the left and right. For example, the concept\nof \\immigration\" can be illustrated with a photo of a\nborder wall, children crying behind bars while detained,\nimmigration agents, protests and demonstrations about\nthe issue, politicians giving speeches, etc. Human viewers\naccount for such within-class variance by generalizing\nwhat they see into broader semantic concepts or themes\nusing prior knowledge, deduction, and reasoning.\nOn the other hand, modern convolutional architec-\ntures learn by discovering recurring textures or edges\nrepresenting objects in the images through backpropa-\ngation. However, the same objects might appear and be\ndiscussed across the political spectrum, meaning that\nthe simple presence or absence of objects is not a good\nindicator of the politics of an image. Thus, model train-\ning may fall into poor local minima due to the lack of a\nrecurring discriminative signal. Further, it is not merely\nthe presence or absence of objects that matters, but\nrather how they are portrayed, often in subtle ways.\nIn order to capture the visual concepts necessary to\npredict the politics of an image, we propose a method\nwhich uses an auxiliary channel at training time, namely\nthe article text that the image is paired with. Our\nmethod contains two stages, as shown in Fig. 1. In\nthe \frst one, we learn a document embedding on the\narticles, then train a model to predict the bias of the\nimage, given the image and the paired document embed-\nding. To be successful on this task, the model learns to\nrecognize visual cues which complement the text embed-\nding and suggest the politics of the image-text pair. The\ntext serves as privileged information to guide learning.\nAt test time, we want to recognize bias from images\nalone, without any article text. Thus, in the secondtraining stage, we use the \frst stage model as a feature\nextractor and train a linear bias classi\fer on top.\nSince recognizing the right semantic and visual con-\ncepts amidst intra-class variance requires large amounts\nof data, we train our approach on webly supervised data:\nthe only labels are in the form of the political leaning\nof the source that the image came from. However, for\ntesting purposes, we collect human annotations of bias\n(political leaning) and test on images where annota-\ntors agreed on the label. We experimentally show that\nour method outperforms numerous baselines on both a\nlarge held-out webly supervised test set, and the set of\nhuman-annotated images.\nWe present many qualitative results, studying di\u000ber-\nent types of bias inherent within our dataset, including\nboth visual and text bias. Our results show di\u000berent po-\nlitical groups present di\u000berent subjects (incl. politicians,\npolitical groups, individuals, etc. ) in signi\fcantly dis-\nparate ways. We also present generative results in which\nwe explicitly model, and then generate, faces exhibiting\nthe disparities our method captures.\nEthical rami\fcations. We believe that recognizing the\npolitical bias of a photograph is an important step to-\nwards building computer vision systems that are aware\nof matters of social importance. Such awareness is nec-\nessary if we hope to use computer vision systems to au-\ntomatically tag or describe images in a socially sensible\nmanner (e.g. for the visually impaired) or to summa-\nrize large collections of potentially biased visual content.\nSocial media companies or search engines may deploy\nsuch techniques to automatically identify the political\nbent of images or news articles being spread or linked\nto. This can be used to create a more balanced presen-\ntation of news. Progress in understanding political bias\nhas already been made in this space in domains other\nthan images. For example, Facebook automatically de-\ntermines users' political leanings from site activity and\npages liked (Merrill, 2016). Other works have studied\npredicting political a\u000eliation from text (Conover et al.,\n2011; Wong et al., 2016; Volkova et al., 2014) or even\nMRI scans (Schreiber et al., 2013). However, visual bias\nunderstanding has been greatly underexplored. While\nsome work examines visual persuasion (Joo et al., 2014;\nHussain et al., 2017) or how political \fgures are por-\ntrayed in the media (Peng, 2018; Messing et al., 2016),\nnone analyze predicting the political leaning of general\nimages as we do.\nThe goal of our work is not to enable or further dis-\ncrimination or reinforce stereotypes about individuals or\ngroups. Rather, our work seeks to use machine learning\ntechniques to reveal disparities in visual media which\nalready exist. By raising awareness, we hope individual\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 3\nconsumers of media are better able to approach ma-\nterial they are presented with (with a more skeptical\neye) and question whether the portrayal of a subject\nthey are seeing is politically skewed. Our work can also\nbe used to combat, rather than reinforce, bias. One of\nmany possibilities is a \\balanced\" image search engine,\nwhere our method is used to predict the political bias\nfor each image returned. Studies (Noble, 2018) show\nthat search engine algorithms may perpetuate bias. The\nbias score accompanying each image could be directly\npresented to the user. Another possible option would\nbe to explicitly present users with images from both\nsides of the political spectrum, allowing the user to get\na broader view of the subject. By returning images from\nacross the political spectrum and/or explicitly revealing\nthe inherent bias of images, we can help users be more\ninformed consumers of visual media.\nTo summarize, our contributions are as follows:\n{We collect and make available2a very large dataset\nof biased images with paired text, and a large amount\nof diverse annotations regarding political bias.\n{We propose a novel weakly supervised method for\npredicting the political leaning of an image by using\nnoisy auxiliary textual data at training time.\n{We perform detailed experimental analysis of our\nmethod on both webly-supervised and human-annotated\ndata, and demonstrate the factors humans use to\npredict bias in images.\n2 Related Work\nOur work relates to a number of sub\felds of machine\nlearning, including weakly supervised learning, learning\nwith privileged information, and curriculum learning.\nWe brie\ry describe some relevant work below.\nWeakly supervised learning. Recently, weakly supervised\napproaches have been proposed for classic topics such\nas object detection (Oquab et al., 2015; Cinbis et al.,\n2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2019),\naction localization (Wang et al., 2017a; Richard et al.,\n2017), etc. Researchers have also developed techniques\nfor learning from potentially noisy web data, e.g. (Chen\nand Gupta, 2015). Also related is work in unsupervised\ndiscovery of patterns and topic modeling. For example,\nSingh et al. (2012); Zhou et al. (2010) use an iterative\nclustering-detection pipeline to discover patterns that\noccur frequently but are discriminative. Li et al. (2018,\n2017) and Sicre et al. (2017) leverage deep networks\nto mine discriminative patterns. Jae Lee et al. (2013)\n2Our dataset, code, and additional materials are available\nhere: http://www.cs.pitt.edu/ \u0018chris/politicsand Doersch et al. (2012) discover patterns informa-\ntive for the architectural style of a city or the evolving\ndesign of cars over the decades. Both of these rely on\n\fnding clusters of image patches that are compact in\nterms of the top-level weak label (e.g. \\Paris\" or \\1950s\ncar\"), i.e. clusters that primarily contain samples from a\ngiven label, and ignore clusters with near-uniform label\ndistribution.\nOur work is in the weakly supervised discovery set-\nting, in the sense that other than noisy left/right labels,\nour method does not receive information about what\nmakes an image left- or right-leaning. In contrast to\nthese works, our problem exhibits much larger within-\nclass variance (with left and right being the classes of\ninterest). Unlike objects and styles, the di\u000berences be-\ntween left and right live in semantic space as much as\nthey do in visual space, thus these methods do not guar-\nantee success. Nevertheless, we borrow intuitions from\nthese methods and help our methods by focusing them\non the higher-level semantics of the problem.\nCurriculum learning. Also relevant are self-paced and\ncurriculum learning approaches (Jiang et al., 2015; Pentina\net al., 2015; Zamir et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Jiang\net al., 2018). These attempt to simplify learning by \fnd-\ning \\easy\" examples to learn with \frst. We too employ a\ntype of curriculum learning. We \frst train a multi-modal\nclassi\fer to predict bias, using the assumption that the\nrelation between text and bias is more direct. We then\nleverage this model as a feature extractor by adding an\nimage-only politics classi\fer on top. Thus, our method\nfocuses the model on relevant visual concepts using text.\nWe compare against several methods which use a\ncurriculum-based approach in our experiments: Joo et al.\n(2014) and Gomez et al. (2017) both learn relevant se-\nmantic concepts on a separate, auxiliary training task,\nwhich aid the classi\fer in performing inference on the\ntarget task. Because prior work (Orr, 1997; He et al.,\n2019) has shown that using a larger-batch size improves\nclassi\fcation performance on noisy data by smooth-\ning the gradient, we thus compare against a baseline\ncurriculum-learning approach designed to alleviate the\nproblem of noisy minibatches. We freeze the lower-layers\nof the model after training and then perform a second\nstage of training of just the classi\fer using all features\nin the train set for optimization, which we show slightly\nimproves performance.\nPrivileged information. Our method exploits a similar\nintuition as privileged information methods (Vapnik\nand Izmailov, 2015; Sharmanska et al., 2013; Ho\u000bman\net al., 2016; Motiian et al., 2016; Elliott and K\u0013 ad\u0013 ar,\n2017; Gomez et al., 2017; Borghi et al., 2018; Lambert\n4 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\net al., 2018) that use an extra feature input at training\ntime. These approaches use tied weights (Borghi et al.,\n2018) or multitask training (Elliott and K\u0013 ad\u0013 ar, 2017), or\ncompute summary statistics (Sharmanska et al., 2013;\nLambert et al., 2018), to guide learning. The closest\nsuch method to ours is Gomez et al. (2017) which uses\nan approach trained to predict text embeddings from\nimages. The model's predicted features are then applied\non visual-only data for image classi\fcation by training\na linear SVM. However, directly predicting text em-\nbeddings from images is much more challenging on our\ndata because of the many-to-many relationship of im-\nages with topics (e.g. image of the White House can be\npaired with text about Trump's children, border control,\nLGBT rights, etc.). We compare against Gomez et al.\n(2017)'s approach in Section 5.2.\nConnecting images and text. Predicting text from im-\nages has received sustained attention (Vinyals et al.,\n2015; Donahue et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2016; Venu-\ngopalan et al., 2017; Pedersoli et al., 2017; Chen et al.,\n2017; Dai et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018; Eisenschtat\nand Wolf, 2017; Ye et al., 2019). Common approaches\nfor connecting image and text include projecting im-\nages and text to a common feature space (Faghri et al.,\n2018; Kiros et al., 2015; Eisenschtat and Wolf, 2017;\nYe and Kovashka, 2018; Thomas and Kovashka, 2020;\nAlayrac et al., 2020). Attention and co-attention, where\na method discovers which parts of a sentence refer to\nwhich parts of an image in an unsupervised way, have\nalso been shown to help in vision-language tasks (Lu\net al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2017). Recently, researchers\nhave leveraged transformer architectures to devise joint\nimage-text embeddings that perform well on a variety of\nvisual reasoning tasks (Lu et al., 2019; Tan and Bansal,\n2019; Chen et al., 2020).\nTo learn the political bias of images, we use an aux-\niliary pre-training task where images and corresponding\ntext cooperate. However, our domain is unique from the\nabove settings in that articles that are paired with our\nimages are orders of magnitude longer. We include a\nnumber of results which analyze the image-text connec-\ntion in this work, including \fnding the most visually\nconsistent words, predicting individual words for images,\nand discovering concepts and training visual prediction\nmodels using webly supervised data for those concepts.\nVisual rhetoric. Our work also belongs to a recent trend\nof developing algorithms to analyze visual media and\nthe strategies that a media creator uses to convey a\nmessage. Joo et al. (2014, 2015); Yoon et al. (2020)\nanalyze the skills and characteristics that a politician is\nimplied to have through a photo, e.g. \\competent\"; weadapt their method as a baseline in our setting. Peng\n(2018) study di\u000berences in facial portrayals between\npresidential candidates, and Wang et al. (2017b, 2016)\nexamine visual di\u000berences between supporters of the\nleft or right. We learn to generate faces from the left\nand right. Further, we examine di\u000berences in general\nimages rather than just faces. Hussain et al. (2017)\nand Ye et al. (2019) predict the persuasive messages\nof advertisements, but persuasion in political images is\nmore subtle: there is usually no slogan telling the viewer\nwhat to do or believe. These works are based on careful\nand expensive human annotations, while we aim to\ndiscover facets of bias in a weakly supervised way. Also\nrelated is work showing how to infer personal political\nbeliefs from images of the subject's face (Kosinski, 2021),\nand how politicians are portrayed in racially biased ways\n(Messing et al., 2016), however these only exploit facial\nfeatures. Most related to our work is Xi et al. (2020) but\nthis work comes from sources with more clear agenda\n(social media accounts of well-known politicians), and\nonly uses visual features, while we leverage metadata\n(text) in a privileged information learning setting at\ntraining time.\nBias prediction in language. Prior work in NLP has\ndiscovered indicators of biased language and political\nframing (i.e. presenting an event or person in a posi-\ntive or negative light) (Recasens et al., 2013; Baumer\net al., 2015; Card et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019; Aky\u007f urek\net al., 2020). For example, Recasens et al. (2013) and\nBaumer et al. (2015) use carefully designed dictionary,\nlexical, grammatical and content features to detect bi-\nased language, using supervision over short phrases. We\nleverage Recasens et al. (2013)'s technique to discover\nbiased word usage in our dataset. However, it is not\nclear what \\lexicon\" of biased content to use for images.\nOthers in NLP have studied predicting political a\u000elia-\ntion from text (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Cohen\nand Ruths, 2013; Colleoni et al., 2014; Conover et al.,\n2011; Wong et al., 2016; Volkova et al., 2014), mainly in\nthe context of social media, and conducted misinforma-\ntion analysis (Baly et al., 2018; Karimi and Tang, 2019;\nPotthast et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2016; Khattar et al.,\n2019). However, work on visual framing is signi\fcantly\nmore limited.\nFairness in machine learning. We investigate the bias\nin how events, topics, and people are portrayed in the\nmedia. This type of bias is directly related to bias in\nhuman perceptions that people of a particular group\n(demographic, political, etc.) have certain qualities or\nbeliefs. This bias over human qualities is evident in data\nthat can be used to train machine learning algorithms,\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 5\nand has thus been tackled in a few prior works (Burns\net al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2017; Ryu et al., 2017; Bechavod\nand Ligett, 2017; Bolukbasi et al., 2016). For example,\nBurns et al. (2018) ensure that the same classi\fer is\nequally likely to \fre on images of men and women when\nthe relevant property (e.g. \\snowboarding\") is present.\nIn contrast, rather than debiasing models, we aim to\nmodel and predict the type of political bias.\nOther works (Sen et al., 2015; Olteanu et al., 2019;\nNguyen et al., 2014; Eickho\u000b, 2018) have analyzed the\nbias inherent in human annotated data introduced by\ncrowdsourcing annotations. Otterbacher et al. (2018)\nshow that sexist workers are less likely to \fnd image\nsearch results biased. Dong et al. (2012) show that dif-\nferent ethinic groups tend to label the same images\ndi\u000berently. In contrast to these works, we show how me-\ndia sources already believed to be politically biased then\nexhibit that bias, both in terms of the visual content\nthey choose to accompany article text and in terms of\nthe text of the article itself. We also explicitly ask our\nworkers to provide their rationale for their predictions\nand then leverage the stereotypical and biased notions\nused by the workers to model bias in visual media.\nComparison with our prior work. This paper is a signif-\nicant expansion of Thomas and Kovashka (2019). We\ncompare against new baselines on the task of politi-\ncal bias prediction: Zhang et al. (2019); Gomez et al.\n(2017), a curriculum method and OCR-based method.\nWe also include a new method and show new results for\npredicting the politics of faces rather than full images.\nWe include a \fner-grained quantitative analysis of dif-\nferences in facial portrayals across left/right than was\npresent in our earlier work. We provide extensive new\nanalysis of the connection between image and article\ntext, e.g. discovering visually consistent words, predict-\ning words from images, discovering words indicative\nof bias, the impact on humans' prediction of bias be-\nfore/after seeing text, and predicting whether images\nand text are correctly paired. We also explain the ethical\nuses of our work and better position our work in the\ncontext of related work.\n3 Dataset\nBecause no dataset exists for this problem, we assem-\nbled a large dataset of images and text about contempo-\nrary politically-charged topics. We got a list of \\biased\"\nsources from mediabiasfactcheck.com which places\nnews media on a spectrum from extreme left to extreme\nright. We used a list of current \\hot topics\" e.g. immigra-\ntion, LGBT rights, welfare, terrorism, the environment,\netc. from Peck and Boutelier (2018). We crawled themedia sources that were labeled left/right or extreme\nleft/right for images using each of these topics as queries.\nAfter identifying images associated with each keyword\nand the pages they were on, we used Peters and Lecocq\n(2013)'s method to extract articles. The method splits\nwebpages into a sequence of blocks based on the docu-\nment structure and then predicts for each block whether\nit is part of the main article set using features such as\nlink and word density. We use the publicly available im-\nplementation3. We obtained 1,861,336 images total and\n1,559,004 articles total. We manually removed some boil-\nerplate text (headers, copyrights, etc.) which leaked into\nsome articles. However, because of the large diversity\nof HTML formats across the media sources, boilerplate\ntext could not be completely removed in all cases.\n3.1 Data deduplication\nBecause sources cover the same events, some images\nare published multiple times. To prevent models from\n\\cheating\" by memorization, all experiments are per-\nformed on a \\deduplicated\" subset of our data. We\nextract features from a Resnet (He et al., 2016) model\nfor all images. Because computing distances between\nall pairs is intractable, we use (Malkov and Yashunin,\n2016) for approximate kNN search ( k= 200). We set a\nthreshold on neighbors' distances to \fnd duplicates and\nnear-duplicates. We determine the threshold empirically\nby examining hundreds of kNN matches to ensure all\nnear-duplicates are detected. From each set of dupli-\ncates, we select one image (and its associated article) to\nremain in our \\deduplicated\" dataset while excluding\nall others. If the same image appeared in both left and\nright media sources, we keep it on the side where it\nwas more common, e.g. one left source and three right\nsources would result in preserving one of the image-text\npairs from the right sources. We break ties randomly,\ni.e. if an image appears equally on the left and right, we\nrandomly assign it to either the left or right by choosing\none of the image-text pairs with the randomly chosen\nlabel. By including such examples, our model is forced to\nexplicitly learn in the presence of subjectivity and noise\nby, for example, making its predictions less con\fdent\non such examples. This may help our classi\fer achieve\na more realistic model of the subjective aspects of bias\nthan it would by only training on data with objective,\nobvious bias. After removing duplicates, we are left with\n1,079,588 unique images and paired text on which the\nremainder of this paper is based.\n3https://github.com/dragnet-org/dragnet\n6 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nMajority Agree No Consensus Unanimous\nFig. 2 We asked workers to predict the political leaning of images. We show examples here where all annotators agree, the\nmajority agree, and where there was no consensus.\n3.2 Crowdsourcing annotations\nWe treat the problem of predicting bias as a weakly\nsupervised task. For training, we assume all image-text\npairs have the political leaning of the source they come\nfrom. In Sec. 5.3, we show that this assumption is reason-\nable by leveraging human labels, though it is certainly\nnot correct for all images/text, e.g. a left-leaning source\nmay publish a right-leaning image to critique it, or a\nphoto in a biased source may contain no bias at all\n(e.g. an image of a cat). In order to better explore the\nviability of the weak labels, and understand human\nconceptions of bias, we ran a large-scale crowdsourc-\ning study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We\nasked workers to guess the political leaning of images\nby indicating whether the image favored the left, right,\nor was unclear. In total, we showed 3,237 images to at\nleast three workers each. We show examples of di\u000berent\nlevels of agreement in Fig. 2. In total, 993 were labeled\nwith a clear left/right label by at least a majority. The\nremaining images were labeled as some combination of\n\\Unclear\" labels with \\Left\"/\\Right\" labels, e.g. \\UUL\"\nor \\ULR\".\nWe also asked our annotators what image features\nthey used to make their guess. The features workers\ncould choose (and the count of each agreed upon) was:\ncloseup-90 (closeup of speci\fc person's face), known\nperson-409 (portrays public \fgure in politically-relevant\nway), multiple people-237 (group or class of people),\nno people-81 (scenes or objects associated with parties,\ne.g. windmill/left, gun/right), symbols-104 (e.g. swastika,\npride \rag), non-photographic-130 (cartoons, charts, etc.),\nlogos-77 (logo of e.g. CNN, FOX, etc.), and text in image-\n267 (e.g. text on protest signs, captions, etc.). We also\nasked workers to provide a free-form text explanation\nof their political bias prediction for a small number\nof images. We extracted semantic concepts from these\nexplanations and later used them to train one of our\nbaseline methods (Sec. 5.1). Humans often mentioned us-\ning the positive/negative portrayal of public \fgures andthe gender, race and ethnicity of photo subjects. We pro-\nvide a demonstration of di\u000berences in portrayal across\nleft/right in Sec. 5.4. Absent these cues, workers used\nstereotypical notions of what issues the left/right discuss\nor their values. For example, for images of protests or\ncollege women, annotators might guess \\left\".\nWe next showed workers the image's article and\nasked a series of questions about the image-text pair,\nsuch as the political leaning of the pair (as opposed to\nimage only), the topic (e.g. terrorism, LGBT) the pair\nis related to, and which part of the article text is best\naligned with the image. We computed agreement scores\nand found that 2.45 out 3 annotators agreed on the bias\nlabel of an image on average (including the \\unclear\"\nlabel), while 1.71 out of 3 agreed on topic, on average.\nTo ensure quality, we used validation images with\nobvious bias to disqualify careless workers. We restricted\nour task to US workers who passed a quali\fcation test\nverifying familiarity with recent news and persons in\nthe news, who had \u001598% approval rate, and who had\ncompleted\u00151,000 HITs. In total, we collected 14,327\nsets of annotations (each containing image bias label,\nimage-text pair bias label, topic, etc.) at a cost of $4,771.\nWe include a number of experimental results on this\nhuman annotated set of images in Sec. 5.3.\nNote that we did not take into account the anno-\ntators' personal political bias. The correlation between\npersonal bias and bias labels could be explored in future\nwork. However, in this project, we wanted to minimize\nmaking bias data collection uncomfortable due to asking\npersonal questions and potentially violating privacy.\n3.3 Relation of weak and human annotations\nIn order to ensure that our weakly-supervised labels\nare actually capturing a meaningful signal which ap-\nproximates human understandings of political bias, we\nperform the following test of weak-to-human label corre-\nlation. We evaluated the impact of text on humans' bias\npredictions. To do so, we compared how humans changed\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 7\nTable 1 Counts of how many users labeled an image Left/Right/Unclear. Rows show the label of the human on the image alone,\nwhile columns show the label after seeing the text. We further divide the table into two larger columns, which represent images\nwith a weak (source-derived) label of Left/Right. Our results show the text helps annotators, and that our weakly-supervised\nlabels are meaningful. We shade rows and columns corresponding to the \\correct\" (aligned with source) label.\nWeakly Supervised = Left Weakly Supervised = Right\nHuman Label After Seeing Image + Text\nLeft Right Unclear SUM Left Right Unclear SUMHuman\nLabel\nOn\nImage\nOnlyLeft 67 2 13 82 28 20 6 54\nRight 17 22 10 49 9 25 2 36\nUnclear 95 8 207 310 37 47 121 205\nSUM 179 32 230 441 74 92 129 295\ntheir predictions (made originally using the image only)\nafter they saw the text paired with the image.\nWe found that when workers picked a left/right la-\nbel, the label was strongly correlated with the weakly\nsupervised label. Moreover, after seeing the text, hu-\nmans became even more correct with respect to the\nnoisy labels, switching many \\unclear\" predictions to\nthe \\correct\" label (i.e. the noisy label). Speci\fcally, in\nTable 1, we show the number of images labeled left/right\nbefore/after showing the worker the text paired with the\nimage. Rows represent the image-only label of humans,\nand the columns represent the label after seeing both\nthe image and the paired text. Any o\u000b-diagonal num-\nber represents a change in labeling between seeing the\nimage only and seeing the image and text. We highlight\nthe weak label in blue for left, and red for right. The\nrow/column of blue in the left of the table, and the\nrow/column of red in the right of the table, shows hu-\nman annotations that agreed with the weak label, after\nseeing the image or both image and text. Red shading\non the left, and blue shading on the right, shows the\nsum of \\incorrect\" votes (where human and weak labels\ndisagree) in the setting of humans seeing either just the\nimage, or both image and text. As a whole, we see that\nalignment between human and weak labels is strong,\nespecially when humans see both images and text. In\nthis setting, weak and human labels agree on 179 images\non the left (with only 32 labels being of opposite value),\nand 92 on the right (with 74 being of opposite value).\nWhen the weakly supervised label is Left, for ex-\nample, we can see that of the 82 people who initially\nvoted Left, 67 kept their initial vote after seeing the\ntext, with only 15 changing their vote (\\incorrectly,\" i.e.\ndiverging from the weak, source-derived bias). Of the\n49 who voted Right initially (diverging from the weak\nlabel), only 22 kept their initial (\\incorrect\") vote, while\na signi\fcant 17 changed their vote to Left (\\correct\"),\nwhile 10 changed it to Unclear. Finally, for the 310 who\ninitially voted an image was Unclear, 95 changed their\nvote to Left (\\correct\") after seeing the text, and 8\nchanged it to Right. When the weak label is Left, wesee that while 82 initially voted left, after seeing the\ntext 179 voted left. When the weak label is Right, 36\nagreed with the weak label before, and 92 after seeing\nthe text. In other words, we can conclude that after\nseeing the (disambiguating) text, annotators do in fact\nalign more with the weak label of the image, which\nindicates that the weakly supervised label captures a\nmeaningful notion of bias.\nOverall, this analysis indicates that: 1) our noisy\nlabels are a good approximation of the true bias of the\nimages (and thus can be used for training a method);\nand 2) the paired text is useful for predicting bias (a\nresult also later borne out by our experiments).\n4 Approach\nWe hypothesize that the complementary text domain\nprovides a useful cue to guide the training of our visual\nbias classi\fer. Some aspects of bias could be semantic\nor textual (e.g. presence/absence of the word \\dona-\ntions\"), while other aspects of bias are more visual. The\ntext of the articles includes words that semantically\ncorrelate with political bias, e.g. \\unite\", \\medicaid\",\n\\donations\", \\homosexuality\", \\Putin\", \\Antifa\" and\n\\brutality\" strongly correlate with left bias according to\nour model, while \\defend\", \\retired\", \\NRA\", \\minister\"\nand \\cooperation\" strongly correlate with right bias.\nHowever, our method will ultimately be used to clas-\nsify bias from images alone. We encourage it to capture\nthe more visual aspects of bias, by factoring out these\nsemantic concepts into the auxiliary text domain, and\nmaking it unnecessary to capture concepts which the\ntextual channel captures. We thus enable our model to\nlearn complementary visual cues.\nWe use information from the visual pipeline, and fuse\nit with the document embedding as an auxiliary source\nof information. Because we are primarily interested in\nvisual political bias, we next remove our model's reliance\non text features, but keep all convolutional layers \fxed.\nWe train a linear bias classi\fer on top of the \frst model,\nusing it as a feature extractor. Thus, at test time, our\n8 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nResnet\n500 D\nFusionStage 1 \u2013Feature LearningPaired textBlack lives \nmatter \nprotestors \nmarched\u2026\n\ud835\udc30t\u2212k\ud835\udc30t+k\u2026\ud835\udc1dMLP\ud835\udc30t\nDocument \nEmbeddingModelLR\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc3f\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf03\nClassification\nLossStage 2 \u2013Train Classifier\nFeaturesPretrained\nmodelRemove fusion\nLayers \nfrozen\nNo text used\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc3f\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf03\nFeatures\nClassifierLRTrain classifier using extracted features\nClassification\nLoss\n123\n4\n5\nFig. 3 We propose a two-stage approach. In stage 1, we learn visual features jointly with paired text for bias classi\fcation. In\nparticular, we (1) learn a document embedding, then using this embedding model, we extact a representation for the text in\nour political articles, (2) pass an image from the article through a ResNet, then (3) train a model based on both the text and\nimage inputs. In stage 2, we remove the text dependency by training a classi\fer on top of our prior model using purely visual\nfeatures. In particular, we (4) extract visual features from the two-input stage-1 model, and (5) train a simple bias classi\fer\nbased on these features. We show that this approach signi\fcantly outperforms directly training a model to predict bias.\nmodel predicts the bias of an image without using any\ntext. We illustrate our method in Fig. 3.\n4.1 Method details\nWe capture the implicit semantics of an image by lever-\naging the association between images and text. Let\nD=fxi;ai;yigN\ni=1 (1)\ndenote our dataset D, where xirepresents image i,ai,\nrepresents the textual article associated with the ith\nimage, and yirepresents the political leaning of the\nimage. In the \frst stage of our method, we seek the\nfollowing function:\nf\u0012(xi;\n(ai)) =yi (2)\nwhere\n(:)represents transforming the article text\ninto a latent feature space. We train Doc2Vec (Le and\nMikolov, 2014) o\u000fine on our train set of articles to\nparameterize \n.

We use hierarchical softmax (Morin\nand Bengio, 2005) to compute p. We train Doc2Vec onour corpus of news articles, and observe more intuitive\nembeddings than from a pretrained model.\nWe show examples of the learned Doc2Vec space in\nTable 2. In the top row of the table, we show several\nquery words which we embed using our model. We then\ncompute the distance from each query word to all other\nlearned words in our dataset's vocabulary and rank the\nwords in order of increasing distance. Thus, retrieved\nwords near the top are more closely related to the query\nword in the learned space than words below. We ob-\nserve meaningful relationships within the space which\nare model can potentially exploit. For example, for the\ntopic \\Stoneman\" (a school shooting), the model learned\nthat \\Parkland\" (another school shooting), \\NRA\" (the\nNational Ri\re Association which protested gun mea-\nsures following the shooting), \\gunman\", and \\shooter\"\nall relate to the broader topic of school shootings and\nviolence in general. By providing this semantic supervi-\nsion to our model, we wish to discover relevant visual\ncues which relate to the broader subject matter, and\nwhich are predictive of the politics of the image.\nAfter training, we compute \nfor a given article aby\n\fnding the embedding dthat maximizes Eq. 3. \nthus\nprojects each article into a space where the resulting\nvector captures the overall latent context and topic of\nthe article. We provide \n(a)to our model's fusion layer\nfor each train image. The fusion layer is a linear layer\nwhich receives concatenated image and text features and\nlearns to project them into a multimodal image-text\nembedding space which is \fnally used by the classi\fer.\nThe formulation of f\u0012(:) described above requires\nthat the ground-truth text be available at test time and\nalso does not ensure that our model is learning visual\nbias (i.e. the classi\fer may be relying primarily on text\nfeatures and ignoring the visual channel completely).

Becausef\u0012's\nconvolutional layers have already been trained jointly\nwith text features, they have already learned to extract\nvisual features which complemented the text domain; we\nnow learn to use those features alone for bias prediction,\nas shown in Fig. 3.\n4.2 Additional method for faces\nWe next explore whether the same people were shown\nin disparate ways across the political spectrum. We\nthus began by detecting faces in our dataset using the\nregularly updated DLIB library's (King, 2009) CNN-\nbased face detector4. The detector consists of a three\nlayer convolutional network which runs over a spatial\npyramid using a sliding window approach to predict\nwhether a face is present in each window. We use the\npre-trained model publicly released by DLIB. Obser-\nvationally, we found there is strong visual variability\nin the faces that left/right-leaning sources choose for\npopular \fgures, such as Donald Trump, Barack Obama\nand Hillary Clinton. We later provide quantitative and\nqualitative demonstrations in Sec. 5.4.\nWe also seek to capture the semantics behind these\ndi\u000berences in facial portrayals. To do so, we leverage\nexisting datasets containing labeled facial attributes\nand expressions. We train two residual networks on the\ndatasets of Liu et al. (2015) and Mollahosseini et al.\n(2017), and use them to predict facial attributes and\nexpressions for every image in our dataset. After detect-\ning faces in our dataset, we recognize faces of known\npolitical \fgures because we expect popular political \fg-\nures to recur throughout the dataset and be indicative\n4http://dlib.net/dnn_mmod_face_detection_ex.cpp.\nhtmlof bias. In order to decide which \fgures to recognize, we\nleverage the text paired with images. We ran Honnibal\nand Montani (2017)'s named entity recognizer on our\ntext articles and narrowed the list of detected \\Person\"\nentities to the 96 most frequent politicians (and other\ncelebrities) to form a vocabulary of \\known\" faces. We\ndownloaded images for each face and used Schro\u000b et al.\n(2015) to perform face recognition on the detected faces.\nFormally, let fa,fe,frbe our facial attribute, ex-\npression, and recognition networks, respectively. For\neach image in our dataset, xi, we obtain automatically\npredicted 40 attributes, 8 expression labels, and one-hot\nidentity labels as follows:\n\b\nxi;fa\u0000\nxi\u0001\n;fe\u0000\nxi\u0001\n;fr\u0000\nxi\u0001\tN\ni=1: (5)\nWe later use these predicted facial attribute and expres-\nsion features for analysis and as input for our baseline\nnetworks for predicting the bias of faces.\nIn addition to \\Person\" entities detected by our\nnamed entity recognizer in the text, we also examine\nthe nationalities, religious, and political groups (NORP)\nentities detected by our recognizer. As we did with per-\nson entities, we use the detected vocabulary of NORPs\nand download visual data for each of the top 200 NORPs\nfrom Google Image Search. We train a separate resid-\nual network (He et al., 2016) to perform image clas-\nsi\fcation on this train set. We then use this model\nto provide predictions of each concept on each image\nin our dataset: P(njjxi) denotes the probability that\nimage xiexhibits NORP nj. We then use the prob-\nability of each predicted concept, as a feature vector\nxi= [P(n1jxi);P(n2jxi);:::;P (njNjjxi)], whereNis\nour vocabulary of NORPs. We later use these predic-\ntions for analyzing how di\u000berent sides of the political\nspectrum portray di\u000berent NORPs.\nNote that we do not use demographic information\nto predict bias . Instead, we use it to show that some\ndemographic factors (e.g. certain ethnic groups) are\nportrayed in notably di\u000berent ways on the left and right\nin our crawled dataset. We believe this observation about\nportrayals in the media indicates a problem with the\n10 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nmedia, and our goal is to point out the problem so it\nmay eventually be addressed.\n4.3 Implementation details\nAll methods use the Resnet-50 (He et al., 2016) archi-\ntecture and are initialized with a pretrained Imagenet\nmodel. We train all models using Adam (Kingma and\nBa, 2015), with learning rate of 1.0e-4 and minibatch\nsize of 64 images. We use cross-entropy loss and apply\nclass-weight balancing to correct for slight data imbal-\nance between L/R. We use an image size of 224x224 and\nrandom horizontal \ripping as data augmentation. We\nuse Xavier initialization (Glorot and Bengio, 2010) for\nnon-pretrained layers. We use PyTorch (Paszke et al.,\n2017) to train all image models. For our text embedding,\nwe use \u0014Reh\u0017 u\u0014 rek and Sojka (2010), with d2R200\u00021and\ntrain using distributed memory (Le and Mikolov, 2014)\nfor 20 epochs with window size k= 20, ignoring words\nwhich appear less than 20 times.\n5 Experiments\nWe present experimental results on a number of tasks.\nWe introduce the baselines we compare against for poli-\ntics prediction, in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, we present\nour results for predicting left/right bias on full images\nfor a variety of methods, and perform a detailed analysis\nof factors the model uses for prediction. We test on a\nlarge held-out test set from our dataset, whose left/right\nlabels come from the leaning of the news source contain-\ning the image. We also perform ablations of our method\nusing weakly-supervised labels to test the soundness of\nour method and experimental design for politics predic-\ntion. Next, in Section 5.3 we test our methods using the\nper-image labels provided by humans. We show results\non test images for which a majority of human annotators\nagreed on the bias. We discuss the relationship between\nour weakly-supervised and human labels and analyze\nhow humans reason about visual bias.\nBecause we \fnd humans strongly relied on identi-\nfying public \fgures and how people were portrayed in\nguessing the politics of an image, we then perform an\nanalysis of faces alone, in Section 5.4. We \frst train\nmodels to predict the bias of faces. We show results for\nboth well-known politicians and for faces in general. We\nthen analyze the di\u000berences in facial portrayals across\nthe left/right for a variety of facial features. We present\nresults showing that faces are portrayed signi\fcantly dif-\nferent for popular \fgures and ethnic groups on opposite\nends of the political spectrum.In Section 5.5, we perform a similar analysis of the\ntext paired with images, to discover how the text itself\nmanifests political bias. We note political \fgures and\nsome ethnic groups that appear disproportionately on\none side vs. the other. Similarly, we leverage existing\ntechniques for discovering biased word usage in language\nto analyze our dataset.\nIn Section 5.6, we present several results exploring\nthe relationship between image and text. We show the\nmost \\visually consistent\" words in our dataset (i.e. the\nwords where the paired image content is more consistent\nacross images which the word was paired with). We\nalso show results for directly predicting the words that\nappeared in the article given an image.\nFinally, in Section 5.7, we examine the topic annota-\ntions (e.g. abortion, gun rights, etc.) within our dataset.\nWe also show visual consistency across topics, with some\nvisually grounded topics (e.g. gun rights) being more\nconsistent in visual space than abstract topics, illustrat-\ning the challenging semantic nature of the problem of\nmodeling visual political bias.\n5.1 Methods compared\nWe show the accuracy of each method on predicting\nleft/right bias. Note that we apply some baselines to\neither full images or faces. For example, \\facial semantics\"\nonly applies to faces. Similarly, OCR is not applicable\nto faces. We compare against the following baselines:\n{Resnet (He et al., 2016) - A standard 50-layer clas-\nsi\fcation Resnet, trained for left/right classi\fcation.\n{Curric - Our approach is a two-stage curriculum\nmethod, which \frst learns visual features coupled with\ntext features and then learns to predict bias without\nthe text. We wanted to see whether a standard Resnet\ntrained in the same way but without text inputs,\nwould gain any bene\ft. We thus \frst train a Resnet\non our task. We then freeze the lower layers and\ntrain only the classi\fer on all train features in the\nsecond stage. Optimizing over all train features at\nonce vs. minibatches can mitigate noisy gradients\nfrom our diverse data (Orr, 1997; He et al., 2019).\n{Joo (Joo et al., 2014) - Adaptation of Joo et al.'s\nmethod for our task. We use Joo et al. (2014)'s dataset\nto train predictors for 15 attributes and nine \\intents\"\n(qualities the photo subject is estimated to have, e.g.\ntrustworthiness, competence). We then use the pre-\ndictions for these attributes and intents on images\nfrom our dataset as additional features to a Resnet\nto predict a left/right leaning.\n{HumConc - We use the manually extracted vocab-\nulary of bias-related concepts (e.g. \\confederate\",\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 11\nTable 3 Accuracy on weakly-supervised labels with the best visual-only prediction method in bold, and second-best in italics.\nThese results are computed on full images, hence face-speci\fc methods are excluded.\nMethod Resnet Curric Joo HumConc OCR Gomez Zhang Ours Text Words Im+Text\nAccuracy 0.678 0.687 0.670 0.675 0.686 0.547 0.566 0.712 0.825 0.626 0.803\n\\African-American\") from the human-provided expla-\nnations (Sec. 3.2) and download data for each from\nGoogle Image Search. We train a separate Resnet to\npredict concepts, and use it on each image in our\ndataset:p(cjjxi) denotes the probability that image\nxiexhibits concept cj. We use the con\fdence of each\nconcept, as a feature vector to predict bias.\n{OCR - We use (Minghui Liao and Bai, 2018) to\nrecognize free-form scene text in images. Because im-\nages contain words not found in the default lexicon\n(e.g. \\Manafort\"), we create our own lexicon from\nthe 100k most common words in our articles. We use\nGarbe (2019) for spelling correction. We represent\neach recognized word as its learned word embedding,\ndenoted w0\ni, weighed by the con\fdence of the recog-\nnitionp(w0\ni)as provided by the recognition model.\nThe feature is thus given by1\nnPn\ni=1p(w0\ni)w0\ni.\n{Gomez (Gomez et al., 2017) - Similar to our method,\nGomez leverages text to guide the learning process,\nwithout requiring text at test time. Gomez \frst trains\na Resnet to predict the text embedding of the article\npaired with the image, from the image alone. Note\nthat in our case, we do not predict the text embedding,\nbut rather use it as a source of auxiliary information.\nIn the second stage, a classi\fer is trained to predict\nthe left/right label from the model's features.\n{Zhang (Zhang et al., 2019) - We leverage neighbors'\nfeatures to assist in inferring the political label. The\nintuition is that images in our dataset are ambiguous,\nhence neighbors may make the learning task easier.\nWe compute nearest neighbors for each image in vi-\nsual space and formulate the inference problem as a\ngraph. We compute attention using the features of\nneighboring images from the last Resnet layer.\n{FacialSem - We predicted facial attributes, expres-\nsions, and identities for every face in our dataset (see\nSec. 4.2). We create a feature vector by appending the\npredicted identity of the portrayed person to the facial\nattributes and expressions, resulting in the following\nvector which is fused with Resnet image features:\nxi= [fa(a1jxi);:::;fa(amjxi);fe(e1jxi);:::;\nfe(enjxi);fr(p1jxi);:::;fr(pojxi)], wherefa(aj) and\nfe(ej) denote the con\fdence of attribute/expression\najorejbeing present in image xi. Further,fr(pkjxi)\nis a 1 or 0 depending on whether person identity\nmarkerpkis predicted in xi.For reference, we also show three methods which use\nthe ground truth text paired with the images at test\ntime. We thus consider them upper-bounds to the task\nof visual-only prediction.\n{Text uses the document embeddings computed from\nthe text paired with the image, without using the\nimage at test time.\n{Words is a two-stage topic-based method. We train\na Resnet to predict, for the 1000 most visually con-\nsistent words (see Sec. 5.6), which words appeared in\nthe \frst two sentences of the image's paired article.\nTo make the task easier, we also condition the model\non the Doc2Vec vector of the article text. We then\ntrain a second model using just the predicted words\nto predict the left/right label for the image.\n{Im+Text uses the text paired with the images (to\ncompute a document embedding), in addition to the\nimage. It is the same as the \frst stage of our approach\n(see Fig. 3, left), without the addition of the image\nclassi\fer layer in step 2.\nAll methods use the same residual network architec-\nture. For methods relying on additional features, we use\nthe fusion architecture in Fig. 3.\n5.2 Evaluating on weakly-supervised labels\nIn this section, we present our results for predicting the\npolitical leaning of visual media. In Table 3, we show\nthe results of evaluating our methods on 75,148 held-out\nimages with weakly-supervised labels. Our method per-\nforms best overall. The top two performing methods rely\non semantics discovered in the text domain ( Ours and\nOCR ).OCR is unique in that it is able to explicitly use\ntext information at test time, by discovering text within\nthe image and then using word embeddings. Ours im-\nproves over OCR by 2.6%. The improvement of Ours\noverResnet is 3.4%. This amounts to classifying an\nadditional\u00182,555 images correctly. We also observe that\nCurric performs nearly 1% better than Resnet . One\nreason for this is because of the high visual diversity of\nour dataset. A classi\fer that is being trained while the\nlower layers of the model continue to change (the model\nkeeps shifting features because it is unable to settle on\nconsistent patters) must continually readjust itself to\nthe changing features. However, by freezing the lower\nlayers of the model, we allow the classi\fer to optimize\nfor a stationary set of visual features over the entire\n12 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nTable 4 Accuracy on human consensus labels with the best visual-only prediction method in bold, and second-best in italics.\nThe results are computed on full images grouped into eight categories by our human annotators.\nFeature/Method Resnet Curric Joo HumConc OCR Ours Text Im+Text # Ims\nCloseup 0.567 0.589 0.544 0.622 0.578 0.656 0.667 0.578 90\nKnown Person 0.567 0.558 0.550 0.570 0.560 0.521 0.558 0.575 409\nMultiple People 0.722 0.738 0.671 0.688 0.730 0.768 0.709 0.705 237\nNo People 0.556 0.531 0.605 0.494 0.580 0.593 0.642 0.667 81\nSymbols 0.558 0.587 0.596 0.548 0.577 0.606 0.625 0.587 104\nNon-Photographic 0.577 0.585 0.569 0.584 0.577 0.585 0.631 0.654 130\nLogos 0.545 0.636 0.584 0.597 0.662 0.623 0.546 0.584 77\nText in Image 0.629 0.652 0.625 0.596 0.637 0.607 0.648 0.659 267\nAverage 0.590 0.610 0.593 0.587 0.613 0.620 0.628 0.626\ndataset. The classi\fer is thus able to obtain a better\nand more stable classi\fcation, resulting in a slight gain\nin performance, but still worse than our method.\nWe observe that Joo, which leverages features learned\non an external dataset, performs worse than Resnet .\nThis is likely because Joo et al. (2014)'s data mainly fea-\ntures closeups of politicians, while ours contains a much\nbroader image range, thus the predicted features are not\nuseful in our setting. Further, relying on the concepts\nhumans identi\fed ( HumConc ) actually slightly hurt\nperformance compared to Resnet . This may be because\nof a disconnect between humans' preconceived notions\nabout left/right and those required by the dataset.\nIn addition, we note that Gomez performs much\nworse than our method, even though both try to exploit\ninformation in the paired text domain as a source of\nprivileged information. We believe one reason for this\nis the many-to-many relationship of images with topics\n(e.g. image of the White House can be paired with text\nabout Trump's children, border control, LGBT rights,\netc.). Thus, it is much harder to predict the document\nembedding paired with the image since the text could be\nabout many di\u000berent issues, hence the Gomez model's\nfeatures are not discriminative of politics. We observe\nthatZhang , which relies on nearest neighbors computed\nin image space, also performs poorly. One reason for this\nis because our problem lies highly in semantic, rather\nthan visual space. Thus, visual nearest neighbors are\nnot necessarily indicative of the politics of an image.\nQuantitative ablations: To test the soundness of our\nmethod and experimental design, we performed several\nablations. We \frst tested the importance of the second\nstage of our method (right side of Fig. 3). We used\nIm+Text , the result of the \frst stage, and instead of\nperforming stage 2, we removed the dependency on text\nby zeroing out all text embedding weights in the fusion\nlayer. We evaluated on our weakly-supervised test set\nand obtained 0.677, a result signi\fcantly worse than\nour full method, underscoring the importance of stage\n2. We next tested how the performance of our methodvaried given the length of the article text. We trained\nour method with the \frst ksentences and obtained these\nresults:k= 1!0:672,k= 2!0:669,k= 5!0:668,\nk= 10!0:669. All choices of kperformed worse\nthan using the full article (0.712). We \fnally examined\nhow reliant our method was on training images from\na particular media source (i.e. to test if the model was\nlearning non-generalizable, source-speci\fc features). We\nexperimented with leaving out all training data har-\nvested from a few popular sources. The result was (be-\nfore!after excluding): CNN (0.873 !0.866), TheBlaze\n(0.746!0.742), DailyCaller (0.703 !0.667), Democratic-\nUnderground (0.713 !0.700), NewsMax (0.685 !0.628),\nCommonDreams (0.647 !0.636), Breitbart (0.607 !0.566).\nWe observed only a slight decrease for most sources, sug-\ngesting our method is not dependent on seeing the source\nat train time.\n5.3 Evaluating on human labels\nWe next tested our methods on test images which at\nleast a majority of MTurkers labeled as having the same\nbias, i.e. those that humans agreed had a particular\nleft/right label. We described this dataset in Sec. 3.2.\nBecause workers also labeled images with what features\nthey used to make their prediction, we break down each\nmethod's performance by feature. We show the result in\nTable 4. We only include the competitive methods from\nTable 3 (those with at least 65% accuracy) for brevity.\nOurs performs best on average across all categories\nand performs best (or ties) on four out of eight cat-\negories. Categories where Ours is outperformed are\nreasonable: OCR performs best or second-best when\ntext can be relied on in the image, i.e. \\logos\" and \\text\nin image\". We note that while the overall result for OCR\napproaches Ours ,Ours works better on a broader set\nof images than OCR and is thus a more general method\nfor predicting visual bias. Ours is also outperformed\nbyHumConc when humans relied on a known face\n(politician, celebrity, etc.). This may be because Hum-\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 13\nConc relies on external training data (Sec. 5.1) which\nfeature many known individuals, e.g. \\rappers\" and\n\\founding fathers\". Perhaps counterintuitively, Joo out-\nperforms our method when the prediction depends on\nscene context (\\no people\"), but note that some of the at-\ntributes that Joo uses do capture the scene/background\n(e.g. indoor, background, national \rag, etc.). Further, un-\nlikeOurs , this method uses an external human-labeled\ndataset to learn features, including the scene attributes.\nCurric improves upon Resnet (whose features it uses\nin its second stage of training) in nearly every cate-\ngory and performs best or ties in two categories. This\nresult suggests that label noise and high visual diver-\nsity within minibatches may prevent the classi\fer from\nconverging on the best local minima for a given set of\nfeatures. By \fxing the model's layers and optimizing\nthe classi\fer layer across the entire train set at once, the\nclassi\fer converges on a better solution. This technique\ncan be applied to any method to potentially improve\ntheir performance as well.\nIn terms of the \\upper bound\" methods, we note\nthatIm+Text performs signi\fcantly worse on human\nlabels vs. weakly-supervised labels. This is likely because\nsome words in text point to a speci\fc bias (e.g. abortion\nvs. pro-choice), which the model may be over-relying on\nto predict the bias of the image. In contrast, the rela-\ntionship between image features and bias is often more\nambiguous. Further, because of the noisy data collection,\nIm+Text may have learned to exploit dataset-speci\fc\nfeatures (e.g. author names, header text, etc.) for pre-\ndiction, which does not actually translate into humans'\ncommonsense understanding of political bias. This also\nexplains why Im+Text does not improve upon Text\nalone on average (but it does for \fve of eight categories).\nWe next test whether our assumption that all images\nharvested from a right- or left-leaning source exhibit\nthat type of bias is reasonable. Several results computed\nfrom our ground-truth human study suggest that our\nweb labels are a reasonable approximation of bias. First,\nwe observe that the relative performance of the methods\nacross Table 3 and 4 is roughly maintained; Ours is\nbest, followed by OCR andCurric essentially tied.\nThe results are also sound, e.g. when humans used text,\nOCR tends to do better, which indicates the model's\nconcept of bias correlates with humans'. Earlier, in Ta-\nble 1, we showed that human labels agree with our\nweak labels more, when text information is presented\nto disambiguate the image's bias.\nHuman label consensus's e\u000bect on performance: In an\nadditional experiment, we explored the di\u000berence be-\ntween the performance of our method on images on\nwhich the majority of humans agreed vs. those on whichhumans unanimously agreed. We found that our method\nworked better when humans unanimously labeled the\nimages vs. simple majority (gain of 4.8%). This suggests\nthat as humans become more certain of bias, our model\n(trained on noisy data) also performs better.\nDetecting images with ambiguous bias: Our result in\nTable 1, showed that humans become more correct with\nrespect to our weakly-supervised labels after seeing the\ntext. Next, we learn to predict whether a human will\nchange their political label of the image after seeing\nthe text . Thus, we model whether the politics of the\nimage is predictable without the text (i.e. unambiguous).\nWe use the F1score rather than accuracy due to class\nimbalance. We \fnd that our model is fairly accurate\nat predicting whether images are unambiguous (0.731),\nbut less accurate at detecting ambiguous images (0.308),\ni.e. images that humans change their label on. In other\nwords, given an image and the text paired with the\nimage, our model is able to accurately able to predict\nwhen the human label of the image will not change after\nhumans see the text. These are likely simpler cases where\nthe image has more apparent political bias. However, the\nmodel performs worse at predicting when the human\nlabel of the image willchange, after seeing the text.\nFor example, if the model suspects the image has a\nright bias, but suspects the text has a left bias, it is\ndi\u000ecult for the model to decide whether humans will\nrely more on the image (unambiguous label) or the text\n(ambiguous label) to make their \fnal decision for the\nimage. These cases are likely more semantically complex\n(and therefore more di\u000ecult to model) and require one\nto reconsider what the image is intended to portray in\nthe context of the text.\nPolitically discriminative words: Given the strong per-\nformance of models relying on text and the fact that\nworkers became more con\fdent after seeing the text, we\nwanted to discover words in the text which are indicative\nthat the image-text pair leans left or right. We used the\nclassi\fer from the Words model. In Table 5, we show\nwords for both the left and the right that had the high-\nest predictive weight (i.e. the word's appearance caused\nthe classi\fer to be more likely to predict that category).\nWe note several interesting results: \\bob\" (likely from\nRobert Mueller's name) and \\unite\" (from the Unite\nThe Right protest) are among the strongest predictors\nof \\left\", while \\teresa\" (likely from Teresa May) and\n\\immigration\" strongly indicate right. Many of the words\nused by the model suggest topics frequently mentioned\nby their respective sides, but which are not mentioned\nby the other side, possibly because they are politically\ndamaging/advantageous to one side. For example, \\irs\",\n14 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nTable 5 Words for both the left and the right that had the highest predictive weight (i.e. the word's appearance caused the\nclassi\fer to be more likely to predict that category).\nLeft\nbob television unite views speakers irs medicaid putin\nhomosexuality outlets gary enforce donations doj opposition broadcast\nspeaks antifa adhere westminster lobby achievements networks pelosi\nreactions labour venezuela supporter meeting memoir warrant outlet\nbrutality misleading hall sharon prominent illegal angela referring\nraped absurd berkeley spoke donald qaeda karl rejected\nbrad quit roe intelligence candidate evan hosted comedian\nRight\nteresa defend hopeful survivor indicted immigration colleagues retired\ntheresa refuse political roger caucus nba bipartisan williams\nrand nra withdraw trump minister racist ratings longtime\nsexually fox joins cruz deputy unilaterally sentenced denial\ndana pleaded declaring exposing victories planned ballot hannity\nrussians juan guests hashtag cooperation establishment chancellor network\nsarah recording blaming deportation roy supporting don erdogan\nTable 6 For a subset of methods, we show the accuracy of predicting the politics of just faces detected in our images and\nevaluate on weakly-supervised labels.

In sum, this result\nallows us to see disparities in the issues covered in left\nvs. right articles, as well as the di\u000berent words used by\nthe articles which are politically discriminative.\nVisual explanations: We wanted to see whether we could\ninterpret how our model learned to perform bias classi-\n\fcation. We used Grad-CAM++ (Chattopadhay et al.,\n2018) to compute attention maps on images that humans\nannotated. We show the result in Fig. 4. We observe\nthat our model pays the most attention to logos and\nfaces of public \fgures. We see the model only focuses\non the \\PBS\" logo in the \frst row, but pays attention\nto both the \\Fox News\" logo and the face of the well-\nknown commentator in the second row. We believe that\nbecause our model was trained with the topic infor-\nmation provided via the text embedding during stage\none, the visual component of the model learned to focus\non learning visual features that complemented the text\n(such as logos and faces). Ultimately these features work\nbetter than those found by the standard ResNet model.\n5.4 Evaluating on faces\nMany workers noted how politicians were portrayed in\nmaking their decision (Sec. 3.2). We thus analyze how\nwell our methods could do at predicting the politics\nIMAGEHEATMAP OVERLAY HEATMAP OVERLAY\nOURS RESNETFig. 4 We show visual explanations using Chattopadhay et al.\n(2018). We note that our model looks to logos and faces of\npublic \fgures, while the baseline uses objects (e.g. microphone)\nand scene type (e.g. city in background).\nof faces alone, in the absence of any context from the\nimage. We thus trained models to predict the political\nbias of the faces we detected in our images (see Sec. 4.2).\nWe assume all detected faces in an image have the same\npolitical bias as the image itself (e.g. a right leaning\nimage with 10 detected faces results in 10 individual\nsamples all with the \\right\" weakly supervised label).\nPredicting the bias of all faces: We present our results in\nTable 6 for a subset of the previously evaluated baselines\nas well as the face-speci\fc method FacialSem which\nrelies on predicted facial attributes, expressions, and\nidentity. Note that the OCR model is inapplicable to\ncropped faces because those do not contain text. We\nobserve that FacialSem substantially improves over\nother baselines and achieves the strongest performance\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 15\nOriginal Reconst .

We show the\nmodel's \\reconstruction\" of each face next to the original sample, followed by the sample transformed to the far left and right.\n(0.607). We also observe that Ours performs on par\nwith (slightly better than) Resnet andJoo.\nOne possible reason for the lack of performance gain\nof our main method on faces is the lack of context from\nwhich the model can learn. In the full image setting,\nour method has a complete view of the image and the\ntext (in stage 1) and is thus able to learn how the\nconcepts in the image complement the text. However, in\nthe face setting, our model has no visual context and is\nunable to learn relevant visual features to complement\nthe shared text embedding. We note that even though\nthe model sees no context outside of the cropped face,\ntheFacialSem model is able to predict the political\nleaning of the face with 60.7% accuracy, which suggests\nthat faces are portrayed in a biased manner which the\nmodels are capturing.\nPredicting the bias of well-known vs. lesser-known faces:\nWe next show the accuracy of predicting the bias of a me-\ndia source, based on of di\u000berent types of faces, in Table 7.\nWe wanted to test whether well-known public \fgures are\nportrayed in a substantially di\u000berent way compared to\nlesser-known or unknown \fgures. We show our model's\naccuracy at predicting the politics of Obama/Trump\nfaces (most well known), then on a much larger set of 96\npoliticians we detected in text as described in Sec. 4.2\n(less well-known), then faces that were classi\fed as being\none of 196 nationalities, religions or groups (NORPs)\n(unknown person other than a known category or nation-\nality), and \fnally all faces (most unknown). We observe\nour model is remarkably accurate for known political\n\fgures and that performance decreases as the face in\nquestion becomes less well known. Our results strongly\nsuggest that public \fgures, and to a lesser extent, nation-\nalities, religious, and political groups, are portrayed in\npolitically biased ways. This is sensible because content\ncreators may attempt to disparage or elevate political\n\fgures and groups of people who are politically opposed\nor aligned to their position.Modeling facial di\u000berences across politics: So far we\nhave seen strong evidence that faces are presented in\nsubstantially di\u000berent ways across the political spec-\ntrum, particularly political \fgures. We next seek to\nactually visualize the di\u000berences in how well-known\nindividuals are portrayed within our dataset. To this\nend, we trained a generative model to modify a given\nTrump/Clinton/Obama face, and make it appear as\nif it came from a left/right leaning source. We use a\nvariation of the autoencoder-based model from Thomas\nand Kovashka (2018), which learns a distribution of\nfacial attributes and latent features on ads, not political\nimages. We train the model using the features from\nthe original method on faces of Trump/Clinton/Obama\ndetected in our dataset. To modify an image, we con-\ndition the generator on the image's embedding and\nmodify the distribution of attributes/expressions for\nthe image to match that person's average portrayal on\nthe left/right, following Thomas and Kovashka (2018)'s\ntechnique. We show the results in Fig. 5. Observe that\nTrump and Clinton appear angry on the far-left/right\n(respectively) end of the spectrum. In contrast, all three\nappear happy/benevolent in sources supporting their\nown party. We also observe Clinton appears younger in\nfar-left sources. In far-right sources, Obama appears con-\nfused or embarrassed. These results further underscore\nthat our weakly supervised labels are accurate enough\nto extract a meaningful signal.\nDiscovering biased features for public \fgures: We next\nshow in Table 8 which features are quantitatively di\u000ber-\nent for which politicians, using a subset of all features.\nWe predicted facial attributes and expressions for the\nmost frequent politicians which appeared in our dataset.\nWe then performed a per-feature T-test to discover\nwhich attributes and expressions are portrayed di\u000ber-\nently across the left and the right for each politician.\nWe highlight cells in blue whose feature di\u000berences in\nportrayal are signi\fcant ( p\u00140:05) across the political\n16 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nTable 8 Facial attributes and expressions which signi\fcantly di\u000bered (shown in blue) across the left/right per politician.\nFacial Attributes\nBarack Obama Chuck Schumer Donald Trump Hillary Clinton Mitch Mcconnell Nancy Pelosi Paul Ryan\n5 o'Clock Shadow\nAttractive\nBags Under Eyes\nBald\nBig Lips\nBig Nose\nChubby\nDouble Chin\nGray Hair\nHeavy Makeup\nHigh Cheekbones\nMouth Slightly Open\nMustache\nNarrow Eyes\nNo Beard\nPointy Nose\nReceding Hairline\nRosy Cheeks\nSmiling\nYoung\nFacial Expressions\nAnger\nContempt\nDisgust\nFear\nHappy\nNeutral\nSad\nSurprise\nArousal\nValence\nTable 9 Frequently detected NORP's facial semantic attributes and their di\u000berences in portrayal across the left/right.\nFacial Attributes and Expressions\nAfrican\nAmericanArab Asian Muslim Mexican Hispanic White\nMedian p-val. 0.000 0.003 0.018 0.071 0.099 0.185 0.370\nspectrum.

We observe similar\nattribute patterns for Obama and Trump, with Obama\nand Trump likewise being portrayed di\u000berently in terms\nof their age (\\young\") and attractiveness (e.g. \\5 o'clock\nshadow\", \\bags under eyes\"). For facial expressions, we\nsee Obama, Trump, and Clinton all di\u000ber in the \\anger\"\n\\happy\", and \\sad\" facial attributes, as well as their\nfacial expressions' arousal and valence scores. As was\nshown from our generation results, negative expressions\n(e.g. \\anger\", \\disgust\", etc.) are used to portray \fgures\nfrom the opposite side of the spectrum, while positive\nexpressions (e.g. \\happy\") are used for political \fgures\non the same side. Interestingly, we also note signi\fcant\ndi\u000berences in both the arousal and valence scores forseveral politicians. Arousal is a measure of the inten-\nsity of a given facial expression and measures whether a\ngiven face is exciting/agitating vs. calm/soothing, while\nvalence is a measure of the \\pleasantness\" of the face\n(Mollahosseini et al., 2017). Thus, our results suggest\nthat not only are the expressions themselves di\u000berent,\nbut the degree to which those expressions are shown is\nalso di\u000berent (i.e. through their arousal) as well as the\noverall pleasantness of the face.\nDiscovering biased features for NORPs: We next ex-\npand the analysis that we performed in Table 8, to faces\ndetected to be NORPs by our classi\fer described in\nSection 4.2. We predict facial attribute and expression\nvalues on each face and discover features which signif-\nicantly di\u000ber in their portrayal across left/right. We\nfound many NORPs had features which signi\fcantly dif-\nfered. We thus show a condensed version of the table for\na subset of NORPs which were most commonly detected\nin our dataset. In Table 9, we show the median p-values\nof the features (we found that the average p-value was\ntoo strongly in\ruenced by several features with large\np-values). We highlight signi\fcant di\u000berences ( p\u00140:05)\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 17\nTable 10 Top-15 names across the left/right which were\nmentioned most on one side, relative to the other side.\nLeft Right\nRichard Spencer Brett Kavanaugh\nMilo Yiannopoulos Justin Trudeau\nScott Pruitt Jesus Christ\nMichael Flynn Nancy Pelosi\nAlex Jones George Soros\nKarl Marx Joe Biden\nRichard Bertrand Spencer Rush Limbaugh\nMoon Jae In Barack Obama\nColin Kaepernick Pope Francis\nSteve Bannon Al Gore\nJared Kushner Jeremy Corbyn\nBetsy Devos Bill Clinton\nAdolf Hitler Ronald Reagan\nMichael Cohen Chuck Schumer\nDoug Jones Ron Paul\nin bold. We see that \\African American\", \\Arab\" and\n\\Asian\" all have median p-values which are signi\fcant,\nindicating at least half of the features signi\fcantly dif-\nfer across the left and the right. We observe that the\nmost signi\fcant di\u000berences occur with \\African Amer-\nican\" and the least signi\fcant p-value occurs for the\n\\White\" category, which implies this category's portrayal\nis most uniform across left/right. This result shows that\ngroups of people, primarily minority groups, are por-\ntrayed in signi\fcantly di\u000berent ways in left vs. right\nmedia sources. While this result is expected, it does\nquantitatively demonstrate a problem.\n5.5 Bias in text\nIn this section, we extend our analysis of political bias\nto the text paired with each image, without considering\nthe image. We observe in Table 3 that the Text model\nis highly accurate at predicting bias, suggesting that the\ntext contains a highly discriminative signal. We thus\nwish to understand precisely how the text is biased,\nboth in terms of disparities in the frequency in which\ncertain subject matter is discussed, as well as the choice\nof words to discuss those subjects. We \frst consider\nwhat political \fgures are mentioned disproportionately\non each side of the political spectrum. We then consider\nthe use of language by each side known to be biased\nfrom prior research.\nPublic \fgures with disproportionate mentions in text:\nIn Section 4.2, we described how we performed named\nentity recognition on our text dataset and discovered\nfrequently mentioned names which we then used to train\na face recognition model. We also wanted to discoverwhat names were lopsided in their frequency of occur-\nrence on each side of the spectrum. We counted the\nnumber of occurrences for each name on the left vs. the\nright. Because of data imbalance between the left and\nthe right, we normalized the number of occurrences of\na name on each side by the total number of names men-\ntioned on that side. In Table 10 we show the names\nwith the largest di\u000berence between sides. We observe\nextreme and polarizing \fgures are mentioned dispropor-\ntionately, e.g. Richard Spencer, Alex Jones, Adolf Hitler\nare mentioned much more on the left vs. the right. In\ncontrast Brett Kavanaugh, Rush Limbaugh, Bill Clin-\nton, etc. are mentioned more on the right relative to\nthe left. These results are sensible. For example, biased\nsources on the left may attempt to smear the right with\nRichard Spencer (a neo-Nazi), Milo Yiannopoulos (an\nalt-right \fgure), and Alex Jones (a conspiracy theorist).\nDiscussing these \fgures disproportionately on one side\nsuggests that relatively obscure public \fgures are being\noveremphasized for potentially politically biased reasons.\nSimilarly, the right more frequently mentions Brett Ka-\nvanaugh (a Supreme Court justice accused of sexual\nmisconduct) and George Soros (a large donor to polit-\nical causes on the left). For Kavanaugh, right sources\nwere likely trying to rally support behind his nomina-\ntion to the Supreme Court. Right sources have also\nfrequently attacked Soros's funding of leftist political\ncauses with conspiracy theories (Vogel et al., 2018).\nImbalanced biased word usage: Recasens et al. (2013)\nstudies the problem of detecting bias in text. The au-\nthors consider edits to Wikipedia made to remove biased\nlanguage and develop a lexicon of words which suggest\na biased or non-neutral point of view (e.g. McMansion\nvs. large home, murder vs. kill, pro-life vs. anti-abortion,\netc.). We count the number of times words appearing\nin the biased word lexicon were used by both the left\nand the right in our dataset. We then show the \\bi-\nased\" words that are used most by one political side\nrelative to the other. The most skewed words across\nthe left/right were \\report\" (for the left), most likely in\nconnection to the Mueller Report, while \\tax\" is used\nmost by the right. On the left, we observe words which\nindicate potentially biased characterizations, e.g. revo-\nlution, movement, struggle, fascist, racist, nationalist,\netc. On the right, we observe biased language about a\ndi\u000berent set of issues, e.g. lie, migration, illegal, abortion,\nterrorist, etc. Collectively, our results presented in Table\n10-11 reveal that each side of the political spectrum has\na set of \\hot-button\" issues which they use to either\ngalvanize their audience for their cause or which they\nuse to attack the opposite side.\n18 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nTable 11 Most disproportionately used known biased words from Recasens et al.

We thus seek to better understand\nthe relationship between our images and text. We \frst\ndiscover and illustrate words whose visual representation\nis most consistent throughout our dataset. We then\nfurther examine the Words method (described above\nin Section 5.1), which directly predicts words from an\nimage and discover which words the model is able to\npredict best. Finally, we study whether we can directly\nmodel the complex relationship between images and\ntext within our dataset by training a model to predict\nwhether a given image-text pair is properly aligned.\nModeling word-level visual consistency: We have ar-\ngued that one of the challenges of modeling political\nbias in images is that the relationship between images\nand semantic topics and text is highly complex. For\nexample, an image of the White House could be paired\nwith an article about immigration or one about the US-\nAfghanistan war. Thus, unlike traditional image cap-\ntioning tasks where the text directly describes the literal\ncontent of the image, the visual grounding of the text\nin the image is non-literal and consequently more chal-\nlenging for a model to grasp. However, because we are\nexploiting our text to guide training of our models, we\nwished to discover the most \\visually consistent\" words\nin our dataset, that is, words whose visual expression\nin the image is most consistent across di\u000berent images.\nOur goal is similar to Hessel et al. (2018), which seeks\nto model the visual concreteness of topics within mul-\ntimodal data. To discover the most visually consistentwords in our dataset, we \frst performed tokenization\nusing Spacy (Honnibal and Montani, 2017). Then, for\neach word, we created a list of images in which that\nword appeared in the \frst two sentences. Next, again\nfor each word, we performed k\u0000means clustering, with\nk= 5, which we determined worked well empirically.\nThe intuition behind performing k\u0000means in our case\nis that many words may appear visually inconsistent\nif one simply takes the average distance between all\npairs of images for a given word, because their visual\ngrounding could be multimodal. We compute the visual\nconsistency vfor wordwas:\nvw=Pk\nj=1Pnj\ni=1kxj\ni\u0000cjk2\nPk\nj=1nj(6)\nwherekis the number of clusters, njis the number of\nimages in cluster j,xj\niare image features which have\nbeen assigned to cluster jbyk-means and cjis the\ncentroid of cluster j. Equation 6 essentially measures\nhow tightly the visual features for a given word \ft\nthe 5-modal distribtion induced by our clustering. We\ncompute this metric for the 10,000 most common words.\nWe show the most visually consistent words in Ta-\nble 12. We observe that news organizations, political\ngroups, and candidates dominate: FOX, CNN, GOP, Re-\npublican, Donald, Clinton, Trump, Barack, etc. Several\npolitical topics also emerge as visually consistent, e.g.\nimmigration, immigrants, abortion. We next wanted to\nsee what did our visually consistent images for each word\nactually look like. For six of our most visually consistent\nwords, we sample images from the top-2 tightest visual\nclusters computed for each word and present them in\nFigure 6. We observe that three of the top four (FOX,\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 19\nRepublican\nFig. 6 Most visually consistent words and image examples from the two tightest visual clusters computed for each word.\nTable 13 Per-word F1scores of a model trained to predict whether each word is/is not present in the image's article given the\nimage and text embedding.

We note that the most\nvisually similar images are not necessarily semantically\nsimilar, as the news broadcasts are presenting a variety\nof unrelated topics. The tightest clusters for the word\n\\GOP\" feature portrait shots of political \fgures on the\nright (from top to bottom: Donald Trump, Mike Pom-\npeo, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ted Cruz). For the last two\nwords (\\Republican\" and \\Donald\"), we observe that\nthe model has placed cartoons and illustrations closest\ntogether, in addition to clusters of political \fgures.\nPredicting visually-consistent words from images: We\nnext wanted to see how well a model could exploit this\nword-level visual consistency. We previously used the\npredictions from this model to train a word-based poli-\ntics predictor in Table 3 (the Words model). We show\ntheF1score of predicting words from an image on our\ntest set in Table 13. We choose F1score because multi-\nple words can be paired with each image. We observe\nthat our model performs better at predicting visually\nconsistent words on average vs. non-consistent words.\nWe observe numerous words which appeared in Table\n12 have relatively higher F1scores relative to other\nwords, with all the highest scoring words appearing in\nthe table as being visually consistent. For example, wesee \\president\" : 0.434, \\trump\" : 0.590, \\donald\" :\n0.413, \\immigration\" : 0.497, and \\abortion\" : 0.534.\nHowever, we observe that the visual consistency of im-\nages associated with a single word does not guarantee\ndiscriminativity. In other words, just because images\nassociated with a word all share similar visual content,\ndoes not imply that all images with that type of visual\ncontent are exclusively associated with that particular\nword. For example, we observe relatively poor perfor-\nmance at predicting the word \\CNN\" and \\FOX\", even\nthough these words have visually consistent images. This\nis likely because the model has trouble di\u000berentiating be-\ntween many di\u000berent news programs, given their similar\nvisual content: the model may recognize a newsanchor\nat a desk, but then become confused as to whether the\nimage is from CNN, FOX, MSNBC, ABC, etc.\nHigh-response images for visually consistent words: In\nFig. 7, we show examples of images that were among the\ntop-100 strongest predictions for that word. We observe,\nfor example, that the model strongly predicts \\antifa\"\nfor black-clad protestors and protestors holding banners.\nThe model predicts \\brutality\" for images with African\nAmerican protestors and for police scenes. The model\npredicts the word \\immigrant\" for images containing a\n20 Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka\nLGBT\n Immigrant\n Antifa\n Brutality\nFig. 7 We train a model to predict words from images. The model learns relevant visual cues for each word, demonstrating\nthe utility of exploiting text (in this case, as an extra input).\nTable 14 F1score of predicting the political topics of an\nimage-text pair on human annotations. Note that the same\nimage-text pair can be labeled with multiple issues.\nTopic F1 Topic F1\nAbortion 0.688 ISIS 0.555\nAnimal Rights 0.540 LGBT 0.540\nBlack Lives Matter 0.426 Minimum Wage 0.504\nBlue Lives Matter 0.053 Racism 0.526\nBorder Security 0.465 Religion 0.547\nClimate Change 0.480 Terrorism 0.544\nFracking 0.455 Unemployment 0.511\nGun Control 0.627 Vaccines 0.596\nHomelessness 0.527 War On Drugs 0.545\nImmigration 0.578 Welfare 0.192\nAverage 0.534\nborder wall and Hispanic individuals, and \\LGBT\" for\npride \rags and rainbow like banners.\n5.7 Visual variability across political topics\nEach image in our dataset is also labeled with the po-\nlitical topic (e.g. abortion) that the media source was\nqueried with when the image was scraped. We now ex-\nplore the topic annotations on our dataset. We \frst\npresent results on predicting the political topic of an\nimage. We then discover topics which are most visually\nconsistent in their portrayal across images. Finally, we\nillustrate the di\u000eculty of classifying images as left/right,\nby showing images which are closest in visual space from\neach political side within each topic.\nPredicting political topics from images: We trained\na model to predict the weak political topic label for\neach image in our training set (assuming each image\nexempli\fes the topic of the parent article), given the\nimage and the document embedding of the text. To\nensure that the weakly supervised topic labels were\nactually capturing the real political issue of the images,\nwe evaluated our model on our set of human annotated\ndata. Each image can be labeled as being related to\nmultiple topics, so we compute F 1score rather than\naccuracy. We present the results in Table 14. We \fndthat our model is able to predict most topics fairly\naccurately. For example, we observe that our model is\nmost accurate at predicting images of \\abortion\" and\n\\gun control\". This makes sense because images about\nthese topics share common scenes and objects: images\nabout abortion often feature protest scenes or images of\nbabies, while gun control images often feature \frearms.\nVisually consistent topics: We next analyze which top-\nics had the most consistent purely visual expression\ni.e. without considering the text. We computed the 20\nnearest neighbors in visual space for several hundred\nrandomly chosen images from our dataset. We then\ncomputed the entropy of the topic distribution of the\nretrieved neighboring images and sorted the results in\norder of increasing entropy. We show the result in Figure\n8, with the \frst row showing the query image and the\nnext three rows showing the top-3 closest images to the\nquery in visual space. We see the left two columns all\nfeature feature \frearms. The retrieved neighbors in the\n\frst two columns are extremely consistent in their topic\nannotations and are almost all labeled \\gun control\".\nThe third column also features military/law enforcement\nholding \frearms, but are much more di\u000buse in terms of\nthe neighbors' topics (e.g. ISIS, foreign policy, terrorism,\netc.). The queries and their neighbors to the right are\neven more di\u000buse in terms of topics, e.g. the protest\nimages (second to last column) all feature protests (or\npolitical rallies), but are about a number of disparate\ntopics from welfare to immigration, even though they\nare close in visual space. Thus, predicting the political\ntopic of an image is complex in that it requires not\nonly recognizing the objects and scene type of an image\n(e.g. protest), but actually reasoning how the objects\nand individuals relate in more nuanced ways.\n6 Conclusion\nWe assembled a large dataset of biased images and\npaired articles and presented a weakly supervised ap-\nproach for inferring the political bias of images. Our\nmethod leverages the image's paired text to guide the\nPredicting Visual Political Bias using Webly Supervised Data and an Auxiliary Task 21\nQuery\n Nearest Neighbors\nFig. 8 Images where neighbors in visual space are most consistent in terms of their topic.

Our\nmethod demonstrates the potential of using an auxiliary\nsemantic space, e.g. for abstract tasks such as video\nsummarization and visual commonsense reasoning. We\ndemonstrate the contribution of our method and dataset\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively, including on a\nlarge crowdsourced dataset. We performed a detailed\nexperimental analysis demonstrating how bias in the\nmedia is expressed both visually and textually.\nOur work has several broader contributions. First,\nwe believe studying and recognizing visual bias in im-\nages is an important step in building socially-informed\nmachine learning systems. By recognizing how data is\nbiased, researchers can actively work to combat biased\nportrayals learned by their models. Further, by auto-\nmatically recognizing biased depictions, we can actively\ncombat bias within the media. Our work can be used\nto expose and make users aware of discrimination and\nstereotypical portrayals of individuals or groups. For\nexample, one possible solution is to automatically \rag\ncontent for users so that they can become more informed\nthat the perspective they are being presented with is\nnon-neutral. Similarly, our work can be used to quan-\ntify not only what media sources (through the images\nthey publish) are biased, but the types of bias that each\nmedia sources purvey. Our work has implications for\nsocial media companies which may seek to prevent the\nspread of discriminatory content on their platforms. By\nrevealing bias within content presented to users, we ulti-\nmately hope to help both users and publishers become\nmore informed consumers of visual media.References\nAky\u007f urek AF, Guo L, Elanwar R, Ishwar P, Betke M,\nWijaya DT (2020) Multi-label and multilingual news\nframing analysis.

It did so by asking \nwhich narratives were  constructed about the EU, how these narratives evolved over \ntime in different member states and how t hese narratives were  related.  Using an \ninterpretivist stance, this project builds  on a theory that sees the media as playing a \nlarge role in the public perception. U sing a simple definition of narrative structure \nbased on actors and events  combined with a temporal aspect , the project identifies \nnarratives about the EU in the two largest newspapers  in the UK and Ireland : The Sun  \nand the Irish Independent  respectively . Using qualitative content analysis, a method \nof classifying data into analytical categories, twenty -one core -narratives have been \nfound to exist in the newspaper coverage. The project identifies seven major core -\nnarratives, six medium core -narratives, and eight minor core -narratives. These core -\nnarratives  are found  rang ing from issues such as , migration  as seen in  the core -\nnarratives  Migration issues are solved by the EU , Brexit  as seen in The UK will benefit \nfrom Brexit , to issues of EU rules and regulatio ns as seen in The EU acts as a standard \nsette r, and development in member states  as seen in We benefit from EU funded \ndevelopment . The project finds that the frequency of these narratives has changed over \ntime, with some being present throughout the entire  time frame, and some only \nappearing in parts of it.  The project also found  how some narratives are more present \nin one or the other country. It found six completely unique narratives, three in either \nstate. Additionally, it showed that there were more tot al narratives found in  the Irish \nIndependent , but the narratives found in The Sun  occurred more frequently. It has \nalso found differences in how the EU is portrayed in the different member states, \nconcluding that coverage of the EU is generally more positi ve in Ireland than in the \nUK. This was shown to be closely related to how the EU was constituted and \ncharacterised as an actor.  Further, by looking at the relationships between narratives, \nit has been  found that some narratives exist in binary relationship s where they \ninfluence each other. Overall, the project concludes  with the finding of a narrative \nlandscape that in many ways continuously evolves, while anchored around key \nsubjects, which are continuously replicated.   \nLars

Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  4 of 93 \n 1.0  Introduction  \nThe European Union (EU) is, to many people, an abstract entity which they will only \nencounter in very specific instances of their lives. However, the impact upon the lives \nof these people by the EU should not be underestimated. Today, the EU is a crucial \npart of the internal workings of Europe, governing, advising , and judicating on a \nwide variety of European issues, in fields as diverse as agriculture, migration , and \nforeign p olicy.  \nWhen Europeans do engage with the EU it is often through the media. We hear about \nthe newest measures from Brussels through our national medias whether this be \nfines to big companies, or the extension of sanctions on Russian individuals. The \nestabl ished media channels thereby become the relay station between the citizens \nand the EU.  \nIn this relay function, the presentation of the EU in the national media becomes \nquite important. The media could be argued to be crucial to the way in which citizens \nlive the experience of the EU that is to say, the way in which the citizens perceive the \nactions of a, to them, abstract entity far away from their homes.   \nWhether we subscribe to the theory that the news media sets the agenda of public \nopinion, as suggest ed by Statham (2010, p. 126), or the theory that the media is \ninfluenced by the public to whom it is beholden, as suggested by Glynn, Herbst, \nLindeman, O'Keefe and Shapiro (2018, p. 333 -334), there is no doubt that the \nconcepts of public opinion and news m edia are closely linked.  \nIn the words of Glynn et al., citing Walter Lipmann 1922 book Public Opinion,  \npeople rely on indirect representations of their environments: instead of the \n\u2018world outside,\u2019 we react to \u2018the pictures in our heads.\u2019 Media sources \nprodigiously supply those pictures, providing images and stories about events, \nissues, personalities, social situations, and other things that we will likely never \nencounter \u2018live\u2019 on our own (p. 334) . \nAt the same time, Glynn et al. also argue that,  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  5 of 93 \n Media o utlets are competing for an audience; their decisions about what to \ncover are shaped by their perceptions of what people will read or watch and \nwhat the audience will think of it (p. 335) . \nTherefore, it would be only natural that the way in which events, i nstitutions, and \npeople are portrayed in the media will impact the way in which these are seen by the \npublic and vice versa.  \nGiven the wide variety of countries, people and customs making up the EU, it cannot \nsurprise us that there are differences in how the EU is seen. The EU itself conducts \nbiannual surveys of the European populace, asking a large assortment of questions \non several  issues. One of the recurring questions is whether the participants are \noptimistic or pessimistic about the future of the EU (European Commission, 2018, p. \n31). The 2018 report showed that in the fall of 2009 , 66 percent of respondents were \noptimistic about the future of the EU, while 27 percent were not. These numbers had \ndrastically changed by the spring of 2013, where only 49  percent of respondents were \noptimistic, and 46 percent pessimistic about the future of the EU . Since then, \noptimism has returned, and the latest survey showed 61 percent optimistic, 34 \npessimistic respondents (p. 30). Further, the report also showed that there are huge \nregional differences. Using the same question as before, but this time accounting for \nthe individual member states, Irish respondents were the most optimistic about the \nfuture of the EU, with 88 percent. The UK was at the pessimistic end of the scale , \nwith only 51 percent of respondents being optimistic about the future, while 45 \npercent were pessimistic (p. 31).  Taking this into consideration, Ireland and the UK \nprovide an excellent pair of subjects for our project. They share a common langu age \nand a common border , both have a similar length of attachment to the EU, and they \nhave traits of a shared common cultural heritage.  \nConsidering the above, the differences  and similarities in the perception of the  EU\u2019s \nfuture, c oupled with the realisation that there seems to be an intricate link between \nthe role and reporting of the mass media and public opinion, leads us to the question \nof how the European Union is portrayed in different types of news media \nin the UK and Ireland ? Specifically, which narratives are constructed \nabout the EU , and how have these narratives evolved over time and in \ndifferent member states?  Additionally, how are these narratives related?  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  6 of 93 \n  \n2.0 Research Design  \nTo lay the theoretical foundations for the resea rch, our theory section will explain the \ncore concepts of the media\u2019s role and understanding public opinion. To understand \nthe relationship between these entities,  the section on  narrative structure explore s \nand conceptualise s narrative structure in mass m edia to provide an understanding of \ndifferent stories and strands within newspaper articles and stories. By using a \nconcept of narrative structure, it is possible to analyse how newspapers  cover the EU. \nHaving established the conceptual foundations of narr ative structure, this allows us \nto outline the methodological bearing of the research paper. These rely on the \nframework of Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA), a method championed by Phillipp \nMayring (2001)  and Graham Gi bbs (2007) , amongst others. QCA is essentially a \ncollection of techniques for the systematic analysis of texts, which enables us as \nresearchers to deconstruct news media stories in a structured manner, to identify \nand a nalyse narratives based on the narrative structures. Based on QCA \nmethodology, the analysis will be undertaken, with the help of the Computer Assisted \nQualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) NVivo. The subject of analysis will be \na wide range of newspa per articles from two EU member states , the UK and Ireland,  \nthroughout a period of five years . From 2014, a year before the European Migrant \ncrisis and two years before the Brexit -referendum, to, and including, 2018 (we use \nthe years of 2014 -2016 -2018 to c reate our analysis). Within this time span, two \nweeks in May have been selected in order to create a concentrated window allowing \nfor the observation of narratives. We chose the two first weeks of May every year (1. -\n14.) because these weeks were leading up  to the EU election of 2014. This was done \nbecause it increased the probability to encounter EU specific narratives in newspaper \ncoverage.  The material is sourced using  the most popular newspaper and cross -\nmedia platform in each country  (The Sun  in the UK  and the Irish Independent  in \nIreland) , creating a data -archive from which to work. Our coding regime, developed \nusing  QCA methodology and structured around the conceptualisation of narrative \nstructure, helps break down these source materials into strands of narratives, or \nstories, which in turn will then be used for the comparison and discussion of \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  7 of 93 \n different narratives across states and time whilst also allowing us to explore the \nactors understanding of the EU. Finally, the findings will recapture the core -\nnarratives and their development, contributing to the identification of consistent \nnarratives about the EU in news media coverage.  \n \n3.0 Theoretical Considerations  \nOur theoretical considerations are divided into two levels; a level of core assumptions \nthat create the foundation of the research, as well as a level of operational theory, the \nnarrative structure . The operational theory  will be used as the basis for carrying out \nthe research itself. In a way, the core assumptions constitute the toolbox itself, whilst \nthe operational theory is the tool that is used in the research.  \n3.1 Core Assumptions  \nThe epistemological stance of interpret ivism places great importance on the \nunderstanding of the subjective nature of human behaviour (Della Porta & Keating, \n2008, pp. 24 -25; Lamont, 2015, pp. 18 -20). We believe that to be able to understa nd \nthe norms of narratives in the media, as well as the culture surrounding the \nrelationship between the media and the public, we need to accept that these are \nsubjective and created in the interactions between humans. As Lamont suggests \ninterpretivist res earch agendas seek to understand identities, ideas, norms, and \nculture  (2015, p. 19) . Ontologically, the research is placed squarely within the \nconstructionist paradigm (Bryman, 2016, p. 29) . Constructionism views the structure \nof social actors and institutions as constructed through interaction, meaning that \nthese do not exists as separate, external constructs, but rather as an outcome of \nsocial interaction (p. 29 -30). The researc h concerns itself with the portrayal of the \nEU in the media, specifically which and how narratives about the EU are created, \nreinforced, and evolve in the media.  \nThe Media  is an ambiguous concept today. Traditionally, the media is meant to be \nunderstood a s the printed media, such as the news media. However, changes in the \nmedia landscape, such as the emergence of social media and the general shift \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  8 of 93 \n towards online media, has fundamentally changed the overall composition and \naction of media providers.  \nAt the  very core, media is communication. The Oxford Dictionary of Media and \nCommunication (Chandler & Munday, 2011)  defines mass media  as the various \ntechnological means of producing and disseminating messages and cultural forms \n(not ably news, information, entertainment, and advertising) . This media has a \nfunction, defined by Chandler and Munday (2011) as (1) The key roles that the mass \nmedia, a particular medium of communication, or specific kinds of media content \nare seen as playing  from the perspective of society , and (2) The basic human needs \nwhich the mass media, a single medium, a media genre, or specific media content, \nserve for individuals . Essentially, the media plays a role in society, both on a large \nscale as well as on a sm aller individual scale. As Walter Lipmann pointed out in his \nPublic Opinion  (as cited in Glynn et al., 2018, p. 334), the media provides pictures \nand stories of realities that we are never likely to experience on our own, thereby \ninfluencing how we perceiv e these events. Thereby, the role of the media as a \nprovider of information, as well as an analyst of information provided becomes clear. \nGiven these considerations, we define the medias function as being a) informative , \nproviding information and analysis for the reader, and b) conducive/reflective , being \na reflective conduit for the readers opinions.    \nIn the role of analyst, the media acts as a filter for how events, institutions, actors, \netc. are represented and perceived. The EU is a prime example of a n institution that \nis primarily experienced by the public through media exposure. Previously, we spoke \nof the EU as an \u2018abstract entity\u2019, one with which most people have no personal \nexperience. This view is reinforced by a journalist interviewed by Paul St atham \n(2010, p. 132)  who states [European politics is] too complex to become popular. It is \na complex process of institutionalisation that escapes most people\u2019s understanding . \nThis statement also points towards a fundamental issue in media communication, \nthe question of supply and demand. Media providers are enterprises that rely on the \nconsumption of their product by the public. Statham states Journalists writing for \nnational and regional audiences felt that their  readerships lag behind in their \nunderstanding of the importance of European politics. For them, readerships\u2019 \ndemand produces few incentives for covering Europe  (2010, p. 132, our \nemphasis). Interestingly, looking at Danish coverage of the EU versus the na tional \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  9 of 93 \n political scene, there are 160 journalists covering the Danish parliament (S\u00f8gaard, \n2018)  whilst there are 14 correspondents covering EU politics (Udenrigsministeriet, \nn.d.) .  \nThis leads us t o conclude that whilst the media certainly plays a role in the shaping of \npublic perception surrounding certain issues, by being the provider of information \non these issues, it is also to a certain degree dependent on a public that continues to \n\u2018buy\u2019 the i nformation. A circular motion could therefore be envisaged, where public \nopinion is informed by the media\u2019s coverage, and this coverage in turn is shaped by \npublic opinion.  \n3.2 Structures of Narratives   \nNarratives are a way people make sense of the world arou nd them (Gibbs G. , 2011, p. \n56). Joy L. Hart describes narratives thus, we make sense of our lives by weaving \nstories, making discrete experiences into functioning wholes. That is, knowledge is \nnarratively configured \u2014we i nterpret our experiences and describe them to others \nthrough stories  (2013, p. 591) . Thus, narratives become the way to understand and \nexplain, not only our perception of the world around us, but also how we perce ive \nourselves as individuals. Hart explains individuals come to understand and describe \nthemselves to others through stories  (2013, p. 591). Walther R. Fisher (as cited in \nHart, 2013, p. 591) argues that we experience and comprehend life as a series of \nongoing narratives, as conflicts, characters, beginnings, middles, and ends .  \nEstablishing the importance of narratives as a fundamental tool for perception of our \nreality does, however, not explain what a narrative is, nor how we can identify these \nnarratives. Most of the time people do it without thinking about it, we implicitly \nunderstand the stories that we are being told. However, the analysis of narratives \nrequires a definition of the criteria involved in the creation of narratives. This task is  \ncomplicated by the plethora of definitions and classifications of what constitutes a \nnarrative and how it can be analysed. One of the schools of thought within narrative \nanalysis is the school of structuralists, encompassing many different styles and \nappr oaches that all share one basic premise: structure  (Freed -Thall, 2018, p. 61) . \nThis concept of structure relates to the belief by structuralists that narratives can be \nanalysed by finding the underlying structure and the e lements of which the narrative \nis composed.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  10 of 93 \n Christian Metz argues that narratives are defined by having a beginning and an \nending as well as a temporal aspect, which is to say that narratives have already \nhappened  (this temporal aspect will be discussed i n relation to policy narratives \nlater ) (Metz, 2000, pp. 86 -87). Due to the closed, temporal sequence of narratives, \nall narratives are discourse; they are created by someone and not naturally occurring \n(p. 88). Metz\u2019 de finition of a narrative can be illustrated like this,  \nFigure 1 - Metz' Narrative Definition  \n    \nJust like a sentence, a narrative has a beginning and an end. However, having a \nbeginning and an end does not explain what the sentenc e says, neither does it, in the \ncase of the narrative, explain what it is about. Opening up Metz\u2019 temporal aspect  is \ntherefore a vital step in the understanding of a narrative. Mieke Bal (2000)  posits \nthat a story is def ined by the actors involved and the event experienced or caused (p. \n82-83). For Bal, actors are agents that perform actions  (p. 83), events are \ntransitions from one state to another state  (p. 83) and acting is defined by actors \ncausing or experiencing even ts. In Bal\u2019s narrat ive definition , actors are given \ncharacteristics making them distinct, the places where events happen are given \ncharacteristics making them distinct, and events are arranged in a chronological \nsequence that does not need to correspond to  reality (p. 84). Bal, along the same line \nas Fisher, argues that with which the narrative text is concerned, the \u2018contents\u2019, is a \nseries of connected events cause or experienced by actors  (2000, p. 85). Bal\u2019s \nconcepts are illustrated below,  BeginningTemporal \naspectEnd\nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  11 of 93 \n Figure 2 - Bal's Story Construction (Temporal Aspect)  \n  \nAn example of this story construction could be  The German chancellor visited Paris \nyesterday, after repeated invitations , here an actor is very clearly the chancellor , \nwho is given the characteristic of being German . There is evidence of another \nimplicit actor; the one that has issued repeated invitations. The place of the event is \ncharacterised as Paris  and the event is visiting  (experienced by the German \nchancellor).  The chronological sequencing of the event does not correspond to \n\u2018reality\u2019, as it describes the event before describing the reason for it. This shows the \nability of narratives to change the chronological sequencing while still making sense. \nAt its very co re, Bal\u2019s concept of a story can be reduced to actor(s) and event(s). For \ninstance, someone  did (something) , here the actor and action are reduced to the \nminimum necessary for a story. Whether explicit or not, acting necessitates someone \nacting and someone  being acted upon. This automatically creates a minimum of two \nactors (implicitly or explicitly). The characteristics are not necessary, and the place of \nthe event is implied in the story. The chronological order is still there. These are the \nelements that  constitute a \u2018bare -bone\u2019 story. The logical conclusion of this is that our \nnarratives will have a least two actors, either explicit or implicit.  \nAnother dimension in this regard is the question of agency. Agency  (Horowitz, 2014)  \nis defined here as the will and ability to act. As defined above, we have a minimum of \ntwo actors, one of which is the agent. The agent is the initiator of the acting, whereas \nthe other actor is the recipient of the action.

This combined narr ative model is illustrated below,  \nFigure 3 - Combined Narrative Model  \n \nIn Metz\u2019 model, the temporal aspect is defined through the narration of events post -\nfactum. However, there are types of narratives, such as policy narratives, where the \noutcome of the policy in question takes place in the future (Gad, 2010, pp. 70 -71). If \nthe objective of the narrative analysis therefore was to analyse the policy  narrative , \nwhere the outcome of the policy is uncertain, this would necessitate an opening of \nthe temporal aspect to allow such ongoing narratives. We are interested in the way in \nwhich the EU is portrayed in narratives, as such we are interested in how the EU is \nspoken about in relation with policy changes, not in the policy change itself. Even \nthough the outcome of the policy has yet to become known, the portrayal of the \nproposed policy changes has taken place, having ended with the publication of the \nnewspaper. M etz\u2019 requirement of post -factuality is therefore fulfilled.  \nThis holds true for Bal\u2019s story construction too; the chronological order places a story \nin the temporal dimension. Thus, the continuity of Metz\u2019 models is kept whilst \nincorporating the detailed story aspect of Bal.  \nThe combined model serves to facilitate the exploration of narratives in our research. \nThrough use of this model we can identify and describe narratives in newspaper \ncoverage of the EU. By keeping the model relatively simple, we enable ourselves to \nidentif y narratives, even if these narratives only consist of few elements. However, \nthe very basic requirements of this structure also include narratives that are not \nrelevant to our research.  \nA necessary step, to focus on narratives pertaining to our research question, is the \nestablishment of a framework for the identification of said narratives. Here, we \nreturn to delve into the concept of actors. An actor, as previously defined, is an agent BeginningStory \n(Narrative)End\nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  13 of 93 \n that is capable of action. For the purpose of examining narratives in  relation to the \nEU, agents therefore have to be able to interact with the EU in some way. This means \nthat an actor can either be the EU or someone that interacts with the EU, such as a \nnation state, organisation, or person. To understand how other actors interact with \nthe EU, it is necessary to identify the relationship between these actors and the EU. \nThis relationship depends on how actors constitute other actors around them. By \nidentifying the relationship between the actors, we can better understand th e context \nof the identified narratives.  \nThe relationship between actors, as posited above, is dependent on how actors \nperceive each other. In other words, how they identify the other actor(s). Identity is a \nsocial construction that emerges through social interaction and that only exists in \nrelationship to binaries  (Tindall, 2013) . This binary relationship is also alluded to by \nW\u00e6ver (2000)  in his examination of French and German discourses re lated to \nEurope. This binary relationship manifests itself in the idea of  self/other . If someone \n(be it a state, a group, or a single person) cannot be identified to be equal to us it \nmust be them . Each of us creates our self through self -identification wi th numerous \ngroups that are constantly reaffirmed by collective recreation (W\u00e6ver, 2000, p. 290) . \nTranslating this into the project, actors can relate to each other by either identifying \nanother actor as part of us/self  or as part of them/other .  \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65\u2261 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66 \u2192 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60 \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65 \u2260 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66\u2192\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a \nThis comparison can be continued until no more new actors are present . For our \nidentification of actor relationship one of the following equations must be true,  \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65\u2261 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48 \u2192 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60 \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65 \u2260 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48\u2192\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a \nThereby, the EU is either a part of the self or a part of the other. Again, this process \ncan be repeated in relation to other actors as well, provided that the relationship to \nthe E U is established  first. This examination of inter -actor relationships makes it \npossible to construct a context for the narrative.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  14 of 93 \n Essentially, you either identify with someone or against someone, in our case that \nsomeone is the EU. Therefore, we can expec t actors to either identify with the EU or \nagainst the EU.  \nOf the found narratives, we choose the narratives that in some shape or form engage \nwith the EU , either as an actor or non -actor,  and disregard the narratives which do \nnot. Essentially, we use nar ratives where the EU fulfils one or more of the elements \n(actor, event, characteristic). Additionally, as we are interested in the EU as a \npolitical entity, we only engage with narratives that display a political dimension.  \nThe following method  section ex pounds the methodical considerations underpinning \nthe research. It attempts to operationalise the theoretical concepts discussed in this \nsection.  \n \n4.0 Method s \nThe aim of method  is the operationalisation of  the theoretical concepts that frame \nthe research. In our case, this meant finding a way to analyse data in such a way that \nit allowed us to answer our initial research questions.  \nBelow we introduce the overall method of content analysis and why this is a viab le \napproach in the research. Then, we introduce Qualitative Content Analysis as an \naspect of content analysis that allows us to engage with our sources and find \nnarratives, their patterns and how they change. To this end, we also introduce the \nuse of compu ter assisted tools (CAQDAS), specifically NVivo, and explain how this \ntool eases the indexation of sources and data collection. Finally, we explain our \nchoice of data, why we chose newspapers, what those newspapers allow us to find \nout, and how we collecte d the data.  \n4.1 Content Analysis  \nGenerally speaking, Content analysis is best defined  as an activity in which \nresearchers examine artefacts of social communication  (Lamont, 2015, p. 89) . \nContent analysis originated as a tech nique for the objective, systematic and \nquantitative description of the manifest content of communication  (Berelson as \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  15 of 93 \n cited in Bryman, 2016, p. 284). The beginnings are to be found in the first half of the \ntwentieth century concurrent with the rise of a b roader media landscape and an \ninterest to understand this newly developing mass media (Schreier, 2014, p. 171) . The \naim, to systematically and quantitatively describe mass communication firmly placed \ncontent analysis in the toolbox of quantitative method . The systematic breakdown of \nmedia communication into analytical categories allowed researchers to find themes \nand recurrences in these communications. However, some critics argued that \nmeaning was often complex, holistic , context dependent  (p. 171) and not apparent \nfrom the quantitative approach. As an alternative to the quantitative approach to \ncontent analysis Siegfried Kracauer, in 1952 (as cited in Schreier, 2014, p. 171) , \nproposed a type of content analysis that did not limit itself only to the apparent \ncontent. Thus, he became the first advocate for what came to be known as qualitative \ncontent analysis.  \nEarly content analysts developed a method to break down mass media into \nnumerical categories alone. This had the o bvious benefit of making vast amounts of \nqualitative data accessible in a relatively easy manner. The researcher could then \nextrapolate from that data and identify trends and tendencies. What the researcher  \ncould not do through this method was identifying the content of these trends. \nEssentially, the researcher  could say how many boxes there were but not really \nwhether the cat was in the box or not.  \nLooking at narratives it is easy to see that in order to say anything about narratives, \nwe need the context.  Therefore, the solution is to analyse texts and data with a focus \non the qualitative content.  \nThe choice of content analysis as the best analytical tool regarding this project rests \non two assumptions. One, by breaking down our research into smaller compa rtments \nof content categories we will be able to see and develop thematic links, trends, and \ntendencies. Two, the categorisation process makes it possible to reduce complex \nqualitative data into numerical data. These two points are intricately linked, it c ould \nbe argued that the development of tendencies and themes rests on the numerical \ndata, or vice versa, the numerical data is only usable in conjunction with qualitative \nthematic categories.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  16 of 93 \n Essentially, by using qualitative material and analysing it in a semi -quantitative way, \nwe can get the best of both worlds.  \n4.2 Qualitative Content Analysis  \nQualitative Content Analysis (QCA) is described as a method for the systematic \ndescription of meaning of qualitative data (Mayring, Kombination und Integration \nqualitativer und quantitativer Analyse, 2000; Schreier, 2014) . According to Mayring \nQCA revolves around four key aspects: (1) the fitting of material into a model of \ncommunication, (2) the step by step analysis of th e material following a set of rules, \n(3) the categories at the centre of the analysis, and (4) the generalisation \nopportunities created through triangulation with other studies. These are by and \nlarge supported by Schreier\u2019s (2014) characteristics of QCA ( p. 170). Schreier argues \nthat the amount of data can be reduced through the application of QCA, due to the \nthematic and overarching categorisation the method facilitates. Where Mayring \nspeaks of fitting material into a model of communication, Schreier argu es for \nthematic categorisation, however, both of these arguments revolve around the same \nidea of applying a set of rules to the data, a set of rules that allows the breakdown of \nthe data into analytical categories. This also ties in with the systematic arg ument, as \nthe analytical categories provide the researcher with a structured system of analysis. \nCrucially, a logical, transparent and structured approach to the content analysis \nallows for the replication of the research. Schreier also identifies the \u2018fle xibility\u2019 of \nQCA as a core concept. By flexibility she means the advantage that the qualitative \ncontent analysis has over its quantitative counterpart through the use of data -driven \ncategories. In short, she argues that the iterative nature of QCA allows a  lot of \nflexibility in the categorisation of data, as the coding frame should always be \nmatched to the data  (Schreier, 2014, p. 171) . This data -driven, or iterative approach, \nis also something championed by both Mayring (2000) , as well as Bryman (2016) , as \na way of developing categories and codes. The main concept of the iterative approach \nis the weaving, back and forth between data and theory  (Bryman, 2016, p. 23). The \niterative approach thereby combines the two common approaches to the handling of \ndata within QCA: deductive and inductive. The deductive approach (illustrated in \nFigure 4), as the name suggests, deduces analytical categories and codes from \ntheoretical considerations, essentially starting the analysis with a set of codes already \ndeduced at the outset. On the other hand, the inductive approach (see Figure 5) can \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  17 of 93 \n be summarised in the mantra of \u2018 letting the data speak for itself \u2019. Her e, the \nresearcher does not pre -ordain analytical categories and codes, but rather creates \nthese throughout the analysis, organically, based on  the source content (Mayring, \nKombination und Integration qualitativer und quantitat iver Analyse, 2000) .  \nFigure 4 - Deductive category application     Figure 5 - Inductive category application \n(Mayring, 2000)  \n \nOften, researchers find themselves using a mix of both approaches, as Schreier \nsuggests (2014, p. 171). This provides the abovementioned flexibility that QCA is \ncapable of.  \nThis research takes advantage of this approach, creating categories both based on  \ntheoretical concepts, but also organically developing categories on the basis of the \ndata, reviewing and revising these categories throughout the analytical process.  \nTo understand why and how these different categories are created we return briefly \nto the  theoretical concept of the narrative. To identify narratives, we have defined a \nset of rules, these being:  \n1) The narrative has a beginning and an end  \n2) In between, there is a story  \n3) This story consists of actors and actions  \n \nUsing these rules, we can identify narratives in our source material. This is \nessentially the starting point of the analysis. We have created one large category with \n\nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  18 of 93 \n all our found narratives. To see trends and tendencies one large category is not \nnecessarily well suited. So, we create categ ories of like -minded narratives. Because \nwe do not know exactly how our narratives look before the beginning of our analysis, \nwe cannot create these thematic categories  deductively , they must be created  \ninductively .  \nThrough this process, we have produced two different levels of categories; deductive \nand inductive categories. Our analytical structure can be portrayed as the following,  \nLevel 1  \u2013 Deductive (Theoretical) categories: large category for all found narratives  \n Level 2  \u2013 Inductive (Organic) categor ies: thematic categories  \nApplying QCA as a methodology requires a certain procedure (Schreier, 2014, pp. \n174-180) , roughly outlined as follows:  \n \n1. Deciding on a research question . The question of how the European \nUnio n is portrayed in the mass media in different member states and, \nspecifically, which narratives are constructed about the EU and how these \nnarratives have evolved over time and in  the UK and Ireland,  is the guiding \nquestion in this research project. Really , these are two separate, but connected \nquestions. Firstly, a question of how the media portrays the EU. Secondly, a \nquestion on the evolution and occurrence of these portrayals across different \nmember states. Both questions are interpretive questions. The se questions are \nconcerned with the explanation of the social meaning behind actions, e.g. \n\u201cwhat is the meaning of a kiss?\u201d or \u201chow is the sudden appearance of a prince \nreceived in the kingdom?\u201d (p. 40). We are looking to understand the social  \nmeaning of t he portrayal of the EU, as well as the how this meaning changes \nthroughout time and geography.  \n \n2. Selecting material . The material selection will be explained in depth further \non, suffice to say that the sort of data used also sets the possible parameters of  \nanalysis. Schreier (2014, p. 174)  argues that because QCA is concerned with \nthe description of meaning in context  transcripts and sources should be \ncomplete and unredacted.  \n \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  19 of 93 \n 3. Building a coding frame . The coding frame is the structure around which \nthe analysis itself is built. It is composed of a main category and subsequent \nsub-categories. The main category is defined by the aspects the researchers \nwish to know more about (Schreier, 2014, p. 174), in our case tha t would be \nhow the EU is portrayed in the media. Our coding frame follows the analytical \nlevels discussed above. By creating a coding frame that is very broad and \nflexible in its initial phase, we allow ourselves the opportunity to shape the \ncoding frame o rganically throughout the research. At the outset  we knew that \nwe would  have two levels, but not exactly how the second level was to  be \ndivided , what themes might be observable.  \n \n4. Segmentation, or creating codes . Schreier (2014) identifies this as a \nseparate step within the process of QCA, although in reality, this is closely \nlinked to the building of a coding frame. Segmentation is the process of \ncreating codes  that can be used to break down the data into analyt ical \ncomponents (p. 175). Codes  are labels applied to different passages or words \nin a text, in order to sum up and categorise the content of that specific passage \nor section in the data. Gibbs (2007, p. 38)  expla ins it thusly, Coding is how \nyou define what the data you are analyzing are about. It involves identifying \nand recording one or more passages of text or other data items [\u2026] that, in \nsome senses, exemplify the same theoretical or descriptive idea [\u2026] they are \nthen linked with a name for that idea \u2013 the code  (p. 38). Taking this back to \nthe idea of segmentation, as proposed by Schreier (2014), the codes are the \nsegmenting devices, enabling the division of data into analytical segments, or \ncategories. Our seg mentation is a two -step process, firstly identifying all the \nrelevant narratives (that is to say, all the narratives that include the EU) and \nsecondly, the coding into thematic categories. Another aim of segmentation is \na consistent division of the source material. This means not only picking out \nthe most \u201cuseful\u201d narratives, but consistently applying the coding frame and \nrules to the text. Thereby, a uniform and consistent coding can be guaranteed.   \n \n5. Main analysis . Having now created our coding frame, bas ed on our research \nquestion and the source material, it is time to engage with the main analysis. \nHere, the actual analytical work is done.   \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  20 of 93 \n Our analysis has the following steps:  \na) Identifying narratives within the newspaper sources.  \nb) Extracting the narratives that use the EU, either as an actor, or \nas a non -actor.  \nc) Thematically coding the narratives into themes with similar \nnarratives.  \nd) Examining and analysing the themes to determine the \nrelationship between the narratives in these themes.  \ne) Looking fo r trends and tendencies in the themes and across the \nthemes, thereby creating the possibility of comparing and \ncontrasting different narratives and themes.  \n \n6. Presenting and interpreting the findings.  The last step is the \npresentation of findings. This marks  the overall conclusion of the analysis.  \n \n4.3 CAQDAS (Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software)  \nToday, researchers have access to a wide array of software tools for their research. \nOne of the many categories of tools is CAQDAS. There are different ways of using this \ntype of software, Gibbs (2014, p. 277)  argues that one of the issues with such software \narises from the problem of distinguishing between CAQDAS as an analytical tool and \nas an analytical method . Gibbs postulates that presenting CAQDAS as an analytical \nmethod suggests that the analysis is done by the software, however he argues that the \nsoftware no more \u2018does\u2019 the analysis than the word processor I am using now \nwrites this chapter for me  (p. 278) . Therefore, using CAQDAS as a purely analytical \ntool, allows the researcher to keep track of the analysis, but does not imply that the \nsoftware does the analysis. That work still squarely rests with the researcher. \nAcknowledging this, we use CAQDAS, more specifically NVivo 12 Pro, to help us \nstructure our analysis and organise our findings. Software usage supports the storing  \nand manipulation of texts or documents and they support the creation and \nmanipulation of codes (Gibbs  G. R., Analyzing Qualitative Data, 2007, p. 114) . It \nallows us to implement complex coding frames with relative ease and resource \nefficiency. This is especially true because of the amount of data of the research. \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  21 of 93 \n Because of the copious amounts of dat a, it would become almost unmanageable to \nkeep track of the data and analysis.  \nThe main benefits of CAQDAS  for this project is the ordering element. By using \nNVivo, we can dispense with printing out our newspaper articles, putting them in \nunruly piles mar ked with a plethora of different coloured markers to see the different \ncodes and themes. All this can be accomplished through the tools that NVivo offers. \nIt is essentially a shortcut to easier data storage. Arguably, this tool is less important \nif you wer e to analyse a smaller amount of data, say ten or fifteen articles. However, \nwe are analysing a dataset of hundreds of  newspaper articles, making NVivo a very \nhandy tool indeed.  \n4.4 Why Newspapers?  \nAs with many aspects of our daily life, news and entertainmen t media have been \nprofoundly affected and influenced by the rise of digitisation. Today, the traditional \nnews media must  contend with social media such as Twitter and Facebook for the \nattention of the consumer. This has led to a rise in online and cross -media news \nplatforms, such as the American sites Buzzfeed and VICE, as well as innumerable \nnews blogs such as fivethirtyeight.com. This has forced the traditional news media to \nadapt, establishing online presences, often vastly more successful than their pri nt \ncounterparts. Through the establishment of these cross -media platforms, the \nnewspapers have managed to create new ways of reaching consumers, no longer \nsolely relying on their paper editions to further their influence (Stra tegic Direction, \n2016, pp. 7 -8). In many ways the traditional media, whilst being challenged, has \nremained a large influence on the way the public perceives the world around them \n(Glynn, Herbst, Lindeman, O'Keefe, & Shapi ro, 2018, p. 330) .  \nConsidering  the above, the question presents itself; how do you engage with media \nrepresentations today? The answer for this project is comprised of two different \nconsiderations. The overall aim has been to create a data archive co ntaining relevant \nmaterial to enable our analysis. This poses two challenges; which media company to \nchoose, and how to engage with them on equal terms.  \nOur solution to the first question has been to look at the comparative sizes of the \ncross -platform med ia companies. To do this, we had to find a neutral way of \ncomparing the companies across borders. This was achieved through the use of an \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  22 of 93 \n online analytics company. The market analytics firm Similarweb.com gathers data on \nwebsite traffic. Through their comp arison tool we found the largest online media \nplatforms in both the UK and Ireland:  \nTable 1 - Overview of Cross Platform Media Companies  \nCountry  Platform  Monthly Visitors  Date  \nUnited Kingdom  The Sun  86,800,000  Jan-19 \nIreland  Irish Independent  20,300,000  Jan-19 \n(Similarweb.com, n.d.; Similarweb.com, n.d.)  \nThese findings were then cross checked with the distribution of newspapers in the \ntwo countries (News B rands Ireland, n.d.; Statista, 2018) . The conclusion : the \nbiggest cross platform media company in the UK was The Sun . In Ireland it was the \nIrish Independent .  \nThe Sun is the most widely distributed daily news media in the UK. First published \nin 1964,  it has become the largest newspaper in the UK, with a circulation of about \n1,5 million copies daily (Statista, 2018) . The Sun is considered a tabloid1 newspaper, \ndefined by the tabloid narrative [eschewing] the \u2018inverted pyram id\u2019 format, \npreferring a \u2018teasing\u2019 introduction, followed by the complete tale, laid out concisely  \n(Bird, 2009) .  \nThe Irish Independent is the most widely distributed daily news media in Ireland. \nFounded in 1905, it has a daily circulation of 83,900 copies (News Brands Ireland, \nn.d.) . The Irish Independent  is not considered a tabloid newspaper.  \nBoth news media get most of their views from internet views. Both news medias are \nalso rated as centre -right/right leaning according to websites such as \nwww.mediabiasfactcheck.com . Both newspapers have trad itionally supported \nconservative policy stances in their editorials.  \nThe question of engaging with these media companies on equal ground still \npresented some challenges. The aim was to find a medium that could be argued to be \nrepresentative of the media c ompany, whilst being easily accessible and not subject \nto change. A natural conclusion of this was to use newspapers. Using newspapers \n                                                   \n1 Tabloid is commonly used to describe a particular kind  of formulaic, colourful narrative, coupled \nwith dramatic visuals, and usually perceived as distinct from standard, \u2018objective\u2019 styles of \njournalism  (Bird, 2009)  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  23 of 93 \n allows us to engage with products of these media companies after publication. \nFurther, it seems logical that newspaper co mpanies will only print articles that reflect \nthe editorial opinion of the papers.  \n \n4.5 Data Archive  \nTo collect a suitable data archive2, we used the electronic journalistic document \ndatabase LexisNexis. This is a database distributed by the company LexisNexis, \nindexing all published materials from a very wide variety of newspapers. Here, we \ncould access the publications of both newspapers and use matching search criteria to \nachieve a similar set of data.  \nAiming at collection a suitable data set, we d evised the following criteria for our data \nsearch.  \n1) The keyword was limited to \u201cEU\u201d. This ensured the possibly broadest \nintercept of material, whilst still being as relevant as possible.  \n2) The date range for collection was decided to be two weeks of May in 2014, \n2016, and 2018. This was chosen for two considerations. Firstly, an election \nfor the European Parliament was taking place in May 2014, making it an \nexcellent point of departure since it could be assumed that narratives \nincluding the EU would at least  be present. Secondly, because we wish to see \nthe evolution of narratives, we believed it necessary to start prior to two \nimportant events that have shaped the last few years of Europe; the migration \ncrisis of 2015 and Brexit. These two choices made May 20 14 a good point of \ndeparture  \n \nUsing these criteria, we collected 666 newspaper articles. These 666 articles \nconstitute the data archive on which this research is based.  A complete overview over \nour data archive is to be found in Appendix A .  \nWe then chose to not include either letters from readers or the sports section of the \nnewspapers. This was done to cut down on the number of sources on one hand, and \non the other to focus on the essential and relevant material. For the same reasons we \n                                                   \n2 A data archive is the entire collected data used in the researc h (Rapley, 2007, pp. 10 -11).  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  24 of 93 \n chose not to engag e with the entertainment section either. This left us with 3 89 \nsources from our initial 666 to which to base our analysis on.   \nDue to the difference of newspaper type, one being a tabloid whereas the other is not, \nwe might expect a difference in narrative structure. As Bird (2009) mentions, tabloid \nnarratives tend to be more concise. At the same time, the choice of a limited time \nframe might also skew the results. By choosing only a few weeks out of every year, we \ngain an advantage in terms of total materia l size. However, we also run the risk of \nmissing narratives that do not occur in that very limited time frame.  We also realise \nthat any project involving qualitative analysis will have some subjective bias if it \nrelies on researchers to interpret the resul ts. We have tried to limit this bias by being \nas transparent as possible and reflective about our process throughout the project.  \nIn the Analysis Process section, the engagement with this data archive is explained in \ndepth.  \n \n5.0 Quantitative Characteristics  \nThe analysis section consists of three different parts. First, the Analysis Process \nsection explains the process of analysis, how the data was used and analysed and \nwhat quantitative tendencies can be seen in the data. Then, our thematic analysis \ngives an in -depth look at the core narratives of our analysis. Finally, we introduce a \ncomparative section where the tendencies of the narratives are compared across time \nintervals and between the UK and Ireland.   \n5.1 Analysis Process  \nTwo different types of categorisati on, categorising EU as  an actor  (see section 5.2) \nand categorising  the narratives  (see section 5.3)  were applied to the data set. The \nfollowing section sets out how we execut ed our analysis, which steps were  taken and \nwhy. Further it gives a breakdown of our analytical categories and suggests \ntendencies that can be seen in the research.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  25 of 93 \n Initially, we set out to find all the narratives in which the EU was involved, within our \nsource material. We found 440 narr atives including the EU across our 389 sources. \nThese 440 narratives were then further divided to create a more accessible data set ; \nTable 2 - Number of sources  \nNumber of Sources  The Sun (222)  Irish Independent (167)  \nTotal (389)  2014  2016  2018  2014  2016  2018  \n22 124 76 39 61 67 \n \n \n5.2 Categorising EU as actor  \nFirst, we divided the narratives into two categories; ones where the EU was either the \nactor or the recipient of action, and ones where the EU was constituted as a third \nparty or not directly involved in the event itself. The first category was defined on the \nback of the story construction within our narrative  structure  (see section 2.2). Here, \nthe EU was either the actor who performed the action, or the direct recipient of \nperformed action. The other category was therefore comprised of narratives in which \nthe EU was a third -party actor.  \nWe divided the narratives into these two categories for two reasons. Firstly, it gave us \nan angle of approach to our large data set; we knew we could find actors in the \nnarratives, so by using them we could get a first inkl ing as to how the narratives are \nstructured . Secondly, the identification of the EU as either a direct or non -direct \nactor was presumed to be indicative of the constitution of the narratives that were \nfound; i.e. if the EU was seen as a direct actor, we co uld presume our formula  \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65\u2261 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48 \u2192 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60 \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65 \u2260 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48\u2192\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a \nwas enough to establish relationship. On the other hand, if the EU was seen as a non -\ndirect actor, we presumed that there would have to be further testing of the \nrelationship between the direct actors and the relationship between the direct actors \nand the EU. Essentially, the relationship between the direct actors is either \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65\u2261\n \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60 or \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65 \u2260 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a.

This member state\u2019s point of view could be expected to be different \nthan the EU, resulting in the EU being constituted as something else, as them . \nHowever, we could also imagine an example where the EU\u2019s actions  enhance the \nmember states, where the wishes and priorities align. Here, the EU would, most \nlikely, be constituted as having the same positions as the  member state, thus being a \npart of us. Here, it should be pointed out that not  all narratives conform to this easily \ndigestible binary dichotomy. When appropriate, this is pointed out.  \nSo, returning to the question of the EU as a direct or non -direct actor, the resulting \nspread of narratives was as follows:  \nTable 3 - Overview of EU as actor categorisation  \nNewspaper Article  The Sun  Irish Indepen dent  Total  \nEU as Actor  39 67 106 \nEU as non -direct actor  215 119 334 \nTotal  254 186 440  \n \nAs we can see from the division, there was a big imbalance in the distribution of \nnarratives between the \u201cEU as direct actor\u201d and \u201cEU as non -direct Actor\u201d. Two \nobservations became very clear. Firstly, only about a quarter of the overall narratives \nconstruc ted the EU as a direct Actor. Secondly, the distribution was vastly more \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  27 of 93 \n skewed in The Sun  than in the Irish Independent , with a ratio of 5 to 1 in The Sun  \nand almost 2 to 1 in Irish Independent .  \nWhen we looked at the distribution of these narratives alon g the time units, we saw \nthe following:  \nTable 4 - Distribution of EU  as actor categorisation over time  \nNewspaper Article  The Sun  Irish Independent  Total  \n2014  2016  2018  2014  2016  2018  \nEU as Actor  3 18 18 13 21 33 106 \nEU as non -direct actor  20 126 69 28 42 49 334 \nTotal  23 144 87 41 63 82 440  \n \nThe ratio in The Sun  remained much higher across the time, with 7 to 1 in 2014, \nwhereas the Irish Independent remained closer to the overall 2 to 1 ratio albeit with a \nslight outlier in 2018.  \nThe overall distribution in time also shows that during 2016 the EU was a much \nbigg er subject of The Sun than in 2014. The UK\u2019s EU -referendum in June 2016 was \nfound to be the most prevalent subject during this time, which points towards the \nextraordinary importance of this referendum for the public. At the same time, the \ndifference in th e amount of narratives with the EU as its subject in the Irish \nIndependent also increased between 2014 and 2016. The main cause of the \nheightened discourse on the EU was seen to be Brexit as well, with much of the focus \non the Irish -UK border.  \nDelving int o the coverage of The Sun  2014, the main subject of this coverage was the \nimmigration to the UK through the EU. The limited amount of coverage of the EU in \ngeneral also suggest that there, prior to 2016, was limited interest in the subject from \nThe Sun .  \n5.3 Categorising narratives  \nThe second type of categorisation was to go back to the 440 found narratives and \ndevelop thematic categories based on the content of the narratives. In total, we found \nthat the narratives conformed to six different thematic categorie s, with an additional \ncategory for the nonconforming narratives - the \u201cOthers\u201d.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  28 of 93 \n These thematic categories all have distinct properties setting them apart from each \nother.

\nThese themes are comprised of narratives that are deemed to have the same, or very \nsimilar, topics. That is to say, these narratives deal with the EU in an international \ncontext  or the potential outcomes of Brexit, etc. Within these themes, we identify \nsome core -narratives , which are different and distinct narrative structures capturing \nthe different aspects of the theme.  \nA consequence of this focus is that  some themes might have similar looking \nnarratives, wh ile the core -narrative is still different. For instance, a migration \nnarrative can be seen to occur in several different themes. It could therefore be \nargued that migration itself should constitute a theme. However, we see the \nunderlying core -narrative as more  important and the migration related narrat ives \nuse migration as a tool to tell an underlying narrative that does not necessarily \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  30 of 93 \n revolve around the theme of migration. The same could be said about the EU as a \nstandard setter, where we see narratives occur across different themes.  \nBased on the num bers in the table above, it is very clear that some of these thematic  \ncategories occur more  than others. For instance, we can see that Brexit plays an \nextraordinarily big role in the coverage. Particularly, considering that Brexit became \na tangible idea d uring 2015 -2016 . It is also evident that narratives regarding the \ngovernance of the EU and its policies are big fields of interest in the coverage of the \nEU. Interestingly, it does not seem as if the relationship of the EU with external third \nparties (i.e.  as an international actor) is given equal importance. This suggests that a \nlarge focus is on intra -EU events.  \nLooking at the narratives distributed between The Sun and the Irish Independent  the \nallocation was the following:  \nTable 6 - Distribution of themes across newspapers  \n The Sun  Irish Independent  Total  \nEU as an international player  2 22 24 \nEU governance  16 80 96 \nCriticism of EU policy  62 25 87 \nPolitical alienation  34 1 35 \nOutcomes of Brexit  95 30 125 \nState of Brexit negotiations  35 19 54 \nOthers  10 9 19 \nTotal  254 186 440  \n \nEvidently, the narrative emphasis is very different in the two newspapers. As we \nmight expect, The Sun  is much more occupied with post -Brexit questions, as well as \nthe state of the negotiations surrounding Brexit. On the other hand, the Irish \nIndependent  focuses much more on the EU in an international context, EU \ngovernance, as well as Irelands place within the EU.  \nFurther subdivision, by time intervals, showed the following:  \nTable 7 - Distribution of themes across newspapers and time  \n The Sun  Irish Independent  Total  2014  2016  2018  2014  2016  2018  \nEU as an international player  0 1 1 3 7 12 24 \nEU governance  4 9 3 26 28 26 96 \nCriticism of EU policy  9 49 4 11 8 6 87 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  31 of 93 \n Political alienation  1 21 12 0 1 0 35 \nOutcomes of Brexit  7 56 32 0 14 16 125 \nState of Brexit  negotiations  1 1 33 0 0 19 54 \nOthers  1 7 2 1 5 3 19 \nTotal  23 144 87 41 63 82 440  \n \nA quick glance shows the evolution of narratives across different time units, as well \nas the formation of new narratives. Logically, the state of Brexit negotiations was \nnever present before the 2016 referendum, but the development of political \nalienation seems to follow the pattern of blooming during the run -up to the \nreferendum and remaining fairly strong in 2018 as well. The narratives surrounding \nthe implication of EU governance, particularly pronounced in the Irish Independent , \nevolves over time stayin g consistent across the time frame. In The Sun , the same \nnarrative seems to be much more in focus in 2016 than in 2018, most likely due to \nthe extra scrutiny the policies of the EU faced in the UK at that time.  \nAs we mentioned previously, one of the stren gths of QCA is the quantitative aspect of \nthe analysis. The quantitative data suggests narrative tendencies that will be \nexpounded in the following sections, where we substantiate our analysis through an \nin-depth look at our themes and the narratives alloc ated within each theme.  \n \n6.0 Thematic Analysis  \nIn the previous section we presented the initial narrative tendencies expressed as \nquantitative tables. Here, we present our thematic analysis, our core narratives, and \nexamine how these are created, relate to ea ch other and how they change over time.  \nAn overview of the sources, including their date of publication can be found in \nAppendix A. In the following sections, citations such as such as II-2018 -08 refer to \nAppendix A. This citation should be read as Irish Independent (II), publication year \n(2018), number of source (08). For The Sun, it would be (TS). In the appendix, the \norder is such that the sources are arranged by year and by newspaper, alphabetically.  \nAdditionally, when there are similar occurrences of narratives in other sources it has \nbeen marked in the footnotes.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  32 of 93 \n As mentioned previously, we found six themes that the core -narratives revolve \naround3. These themes are arranged as following in this analysis,  \n1. EU as an international player  \n2. EU governance  \n3. Criticism of EU policy  \n4. Political alienation  \n5. Outcomes of Brexit  \n6. State of Brexit negotiations  \nThe examination of these themes is followed by a comparative section showing the \nrelationship between different core -narrative strands and themes.  \n6.1 Theme: The EU as  an international player  \nThe theme regarding the EU as an international actor focuses on core -narratives \nportraying the EU in international situations.  We see both the values that the EU \nprojects beyond its own borders  and how the EU is seen in relation to other actors, \nsuch as the US.   \n6.1.1 The EU uses its values to stabilise international politics  \nThis  core -narrative revolves around the portrayal of the EU as a stabilising force in \ninternational politics. One example of th is construction can be found in narratives \nabout  the EU in dealing with president Trumps withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear \nDeal (JCPA). Such can be seen here ;  \nThe EU wants to prevent more instability in the Middle East, not least because \nof the risk of inc reased migration flows as refugees flee conflict and the \npotential higher threat of terror attacks. But Mr Trump's announcement has \ndestabilised EU policy on trade and energy as well. Brussels prides itself on its \ntrade deals. Thanks to EU membership, the bloc argues, it is easier to sell Greek \nfeta cheese, German cars, and French wine around the world  (II-2018 -08)4. \nThe EU is portrayed as attempting to prevent instability using  the great power of the \nEU, the Common Market. Trade is seen to be the EU\u2019s main  power and the way in \nwhich it promotes stability in international contexts.   \n                                                   \n3 The Others  category will not be analysed as it consists of non -conforming narratives.  \n4 See also: II-2018 -18 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  33 of 93 \n Attempts by the EU to stabilise other international situations can also be seen in the \ncondemnation of anti -Semitic remarks of Palestinian leaders by the EU;  \nThe EEAS, the EU's  foreign service, also condemned the remarks as \n\u2018unacceptable\u2019 and said \u2018such rhetoric will only play into the hands of those who \ndo not want a two -state solution, which President Abbas has repeatedly \nadvocated\u2019. With anti -Semitism growing in several corne rs of Europe in \ntandem with the rise of far -right movements, the EEAS described it as a threat \nnot only for Jews \u2018but a fundamental menace to our open and liberal societies\u2019 \nand said it was committed to any attempt \u2018to condone, justify or grossly \ntrivialis e the Holocaust\u2019 (II-2018 -50). \nHere, the values of the EU as an open and liberal society, embodied within the \nframework of the EU, is presented to be  both the tool used to stabilise, as well as the \nvalues being destabilised. Interestingly, this also sugges ts that the actions of the EU \nare seen as somewhat self -serving , since by condemning anti -Semitism abroad, it \nalso condemns anti -Semitism at home.   \nThe narrative also encompasses the EU reacting to situations in neighbourhood \nregions, particularly seen in  regards to the rescuing of refugees in the Mediterranean,  \nexemplified here ;  \nit's highly instructive that one of the most recent EU puffs for Operation Sophia \nputs the rescue of human life first on its list of mission objectives - which is \nwhere it should  be - and only then waffles on about smugglers [\u2026] The purpose \nof the whole EU project, we are told, is to \u2018tackle the root causes \u2019 of the refugee \ntragedy (II-2016 -03).   \nAgain, the values of Human Rights are presented  to be core values to the EU, which \nare used as an argument for the rescuing of migrants in the Mediterranean, thus \nbringing stability to the region. This covers the eastern borders  with Ukraine  too;  \nthe European Union said it would not recognise the result of a referendum on \nself-rule held by  pro-Moscow rebels in east Ukraine yesterday, calling it illegal  \n(II-2014 -34). \nHere, the values of democracy and free elections are  presented  to be the major \ndriving force. It could be argued that the EU does not directly contribute to stability \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  34 of 93 \n by not rec ognising a \u2018 democratic \u2019 vote. However, by not recognising illegal referenda, \nthe EU seems to be defending its core values of liberty and democracy.  \nThis narrative appear s primarily in the Irish Independent , where it is covered from \n2014 till 2018. It sugge sts an Irish interest in the EU\u2019s external policies, particularly \nregarding the values of the EU being projected and defended abroad, as well as being \nused in a stabilising role by the EU.   \n6.1.2  Migration issues are solved by the EU  \nA core -narrative regarding migration also occurs in this theme.  The focus lies mostly \non the external relations of the EU when it comes to actions solving the migration \ncrisis. Illustrated here ;  \nThe European Union also sees Turkey as a crucial partner in stemming the flow \nof refugees who use the country as a transit point to get to Europe. Davutoglu \nwas Ankara's negotiator in the controversial recent migrant deal between \nTurkey and the EU (II-2016 -45)5. \nIt is presented here as if  the EU will struggle to solve the migration crisis  without \nTurkey\u2019s help . However, it also presents the agreement  that would potentially let the \nEU solve the crisis , as controversial .   \nThe narrative also focuses on the potential of Turkish citizen gaining access to the EU \nthrough visa -waiver programmes;  \nTop European Union and German officials made clear yesterday that Turkey \nmust back off from its refusal to change its anti -terror laws if it hopes to  secure \nvisa -free travel to Europe for Turkish citizens (II-2016 -20). \nAs well as ;  \nTurkey is on course to be handed visa -free travel to the European Union for its \n75 million citizens, despite not meeting a series of key targets. Tomorrow, the \nEuropean Comm ission is expected to recommend a radical loosening of travel \nconditions for the country (II-2016 -58).  \n                                                   \n5 See also: II -2016 -03 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  35 of 93 \n In both these instances, the EU is portrayed as using its values, here embodied by the \n\u201canti -terror law\u201d or \u201ckey targets\u201d, as a measurement to regulate the flow of migration \nas well as the relationship between the EU and Turkey.  \nThis narrative occurs only in the Irish Independent, exclusively in 2016.  This is \nshortly after the European migration crisis of 2015  whilst the EU is still struggling to \nallocate  refugees,  which could  explain the heightened focus on migration and \nmigrants.  \n6.1.3  The EU stands up for itself  \nAnother core -narrative within this theme is a narrative focusing on the EU\u2019s refusal \nto cooperate with Trump and \u201cstanding up for itself\u201d. This focu ses primarily on the \nJCPA, as illustrated in the following ;  \nThe European Union can showcase its mettle, stand up to American hegemony \nand show her the way forward by taking other domestic, historical, social, \nreligious and cultural contexts into considera tion (II-2018 -25)6. \nHere, the EU is portrayed in opposition to the US, essentially being tasked with \nstanding up to US foreign policy and defend other cultural and historical contexts. \nThis seems to be in line with the values that the  EU is presented to  embody, \nparticularly its liberal values. The same can also be seen here ; \nThe latest ravings of the American president on the Iran nuclear agreement - \nmercifully, at last, firmly opposed by the EU - obscure the lands of mass graves \nand tunnels in which the Mu slim Middle East now exists (II-2018 -07)7. \nHere, the EU is portrayed as \u2018finally\u2019 standing up for itself  and standing up to the US. \nThis suggests a view where the EU has lacked the courage and willingness to defend \nthe J CPA, as well as suggesting that this lack of courage has had dire consequences \nfor the population of the Middle East.  \nThe narrative also portrays president Trumps foreign policy in direct conflict with \nEU goals, which can be seen here ;  \nEuropean businesses h ave made investments which are now at risk from Mr \nTrump's threat of sanctions on countries \u2018helping\u2019 Iran [\u2026] Iran was also an \n                                                   \n6 See also: TS-2018 -03,  \n7 See also: II-2018 -63 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  36 of 93 \n important part of the EU's strategy to wean itself off Russian gas, which was \nbrutally exposed by the Ukraine crisis. Russian Pr esident Vladimir Putin had \ncut off gas supplies to the EU, the majority of which pass through Ukraine, to \nheap pressure on Kiev and Brussels  (II-2018 -08).   \nThis echoes the previously discussed sentiment of the EU being portrayed  in \nopposition to the US, mo re specifically president Trump\u2019s foreign policy. It also \nseems to suggest that the EU has been in a state of weakness , due to reliance on \nRussian energy,  and by standing by Iran it combats this weakness , essentially \nstanding up for itself.  \nThis  narrative is also primarily found in  Irish coverage and shows a clear focus on the \nEU\u2019s actions during 2018. The narrative suggests that the EU is slow to react to US \nforeign policy, but also that when it reacts there seems to be more than one purpose, \ne.g. the valu es of the EU as well as energy security playing a role.  \n6.1.4  Thematic tendencies  \nA very clear  thread  throughout this theme is the exclusivity with which these \nnarratives occur only  in the Irish Independent . They do, tentatively occur throughout \nthe entire time frame, however much more concentrated in 2018. This suggests both \na general interest in the EU\u2019s role and actions on an international level and that this \ninterest has grown over time. Another tendency is one of portraying  EU foreign \npolicy in opposition to  president Trumps US foreign policy. We can see, several \ninstances, where the US is portrayed as acting to the detriment of the EU and its \ninterests. The EU is found to be portrayed  as a defender of rights and is essentially \nportrayed as a part of the self, whereas the US, specifically president Trump, is \nportrayed as the other . \n6.2 Theme: EU governance  \nThe theme of EU governance is comprised of  narratives that focus on the internal \nworkings of the EU. This relates to the decision -making  processes of the instit utions, \nsuch as the European Commission, but also to the outcomes and consequences of \ndecisions made. For instance, consumer protection would be considered an outcome \nof European Commission governance. Essentially , the theme encompasses  narratives \nof rules  and regulations, or decisions taken regarding the governing of the EU as a \nbloc.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  37 of 93 \n 6.2.1  The EU institutions govern in their own rights  \nA core -narrative to be found within this theme relates to governance by the \ninstitutions. This narrative focuses on the governance of EU institutions governing \nwithin their jurisdictions, such as the European Commission  (EC) , the European \nCourt of Justice  (ECJ) , and others.  \nExamples of this narrative can be seen here ;  \nThe Commission ruled in favour of the four Dublin local  authorities who have \ninvested in the incinerator in a move that edges the project closer to \ncompletion. \u2018The European Commission has found that a series of measures by \nthe Dublin local authorities to participate in the Waste -to-Energy project in \nPoolbeg, Dublin, are in line with the EU state aid rules,\u2019 it said  (II-2014 -09). \nHere, we see the EC being portrayed as the final decision maker in regard to  state -aid \nrules. This falls squarely within the purview of the EC, and this narrative distinctly \nviews the EU rules as unquestionable.  \nThe governance of the EC can also be seen here ; \nThe EU Commission has ruled out taking 'unilateral action' to prevent d airy \nfarmers across Europe facing a massive super levy fine next year (II-2014 -11)8. \nAgain, we can see that the EC is portrayed as a legitimate actor, acting within the \nbounds of its purview.   \nThe ECJ can be seen to be indicated  here ;  \nThe European Union's  highest court has also upheld a tough EU law that will \nstandardise cigarette packs, ban menthol flavouring and restrict e -cigarette \nadvertising, paving the way for its adoption this month and dealing a blow to \nBig Tobacco (II-2016 -12)9. \nThe ECJ is portray ed as a rule setter, governing through the law. In both these \ninstances, the governance of EU institutions impact organisations and businesses. \nHowever, a nother side of these narratives focus on how governance by EU \ninstitutions impacts national government s. This can for example be seen here;  \n                                                   \n8 See also: II-2016 -51, II-2016 -48, TS-2018 -39, II-2018 -35 \n9 See also: II-2016 -19 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  38 of 93 \n The EU bathing water directive forced the Government to make beaches fit for \nswimming and stop untreated sewage flowing into the sea. This helped develop \na seaside economy worth an estimated \u00a33.5billion a year (TS-2016-06). \nIt is clear that the EC is portrayed as positive force  obliging  the UK to comply with a \ndirective that benefitted the UK in the long run. However, the actions of the EC \nrestricted the governance choices of the national government. This can also be s een \nhere ; \nThe European Commission has warned Health Minister Simon Harris that \ncurbs on alcohol advertising appear to break EU laws (II-2018 -05)10. \nAgain, the EC governance is portrayed as restric ting national governments, this time \nto the ( perceived ) detriment of public health in Ireland.   \nAs can be seen from the above, th ese narrative s stretch across both the UK and \nIreland, as well as being present across the  entire  time frame , suggesting a consistent \ninterest in the theme of EU governance . However, it seems that while Irish coverage \nexhibits both aspects of the narrative, The Sun \u2019s coverage is mainly focused on the \nportrayal of EU governance as a limiting factor regarding  the nation state.  \n6.2.2  Consume rs are protected by the EU  \nIn the theme of EU governa nce, a core -narrative concerning the EU\u2019s attempts to \nprotect consumers within the Union can be found. This narrative focuses on how EU \ninstitutions use their powers to protect the citizens of the EU.  \nAn example could be the introduction of the GDPR, as presented here ;  \nThe arrival of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25 is being \nbilled as a prized initiative in helping to protect consumers, particularly after \nthe Facebook data scandal. GDPR's set of laws aims to prevent websites from \ncaptur ing and storing user data (II-208-21). \nThe aim is clearly presented to be to protect consumers from having their data \nabused. This sets the scene for the EC protecting consumers through the powers of \nlegislation.   \n                                                   \n10 See also: II-2014 -03, TS-2014 -01, II-2016 -27, TS-2018 -57, II -2014 -37 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  39 of 93 \n Another example of the EC attempting to p rotect consumers is the prohibition of a \nUK phone merger, on the grounds of anti -competitive rules;  \nA \u00a310.3 billion mobile phone merger between O2 and THREE was blocked \nyesterday over fears it would push up prices. The European Commission said \nthere was a  danger the tie -up would weaken competition [\u2026] EU antitrust chief \nMargrethe Vestager said yesterday: \u2018Allowing Hutchison to take over O2 at the \nterms they proposed would have been bad for UK consumers and bad for the \nUK mobile sector\u2019 (TS-2016 -02)11.  \nHere, the commissioner (Margrethe Vestager) is directly quoted as using consumer \nprotection as a justification to limit business interests. It shows a clear \nrepresentation of the EC as being on the side of consumers, defending them from \nprice gouging.  \nA different view on consumer protection by the EU is presented in relation to the \nnegotiations of the TTIP free trade agreement. Here, the EU is represented as \nwanting to lower consumer protection standards. This can be seen here ;  \nTTIP The Transatlantic Trad e and Investment Partnership (TTIP) discussions \nbetween the EU and US to hammer out a trade agreement have proved \ncontroversial across Europe. It has been claimed leaked documents from \nGreenpeace show TTIP could lower standards in the EU by pressuring it t o \naccept looser regulations on GM foods or harmful pesticides. However, this has \nbeen disputed by the EU Commission, which says it will not lower the level of \nprotection for consumers or the environment (II-2016 -47)12. \nThe narrative presents a suggestion th at the EU might be lowering the food and \nsafety standards to gain good leverage on the proposed trade deal. However, whereas \nthe previous case for the EC to step in and protect consumers was not challenged, \nthese allegations by Greenpeace do not go unchall enged. This seems to suggest that \nthe EC is viewed positively and that challenges to this positive view are received \nsomewhat critically.  \nThis  consumer protection  narrative occurs both in the UK and Irish newspaper  \ncoverage, with the majority of occurrenc es in Ireland. In  the Irish Independent  it \n                                                   \n11 See also: TS -2016 -48, II -2014 -07, II -2014 -17, II -2014 -38, II-2016 -18, II-2018 -55 \n12 See also: II-2014 -21, II-2018 -30 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  40 of 93 \n occurs throughout the entire time frame, suggesting that the narrative consistently \nplays a role in the Irish media. The narrative presents most of  the coverage \nportray ing the EU as a champion of consumer protecti on, and even when there  are \ninstances where the opposite is  alleged, these allegations are received critically . \nOverall, the EU, and its institutions, are seen to be portrayed favourably towards \nconsumers.  \n6.2.3  The EU  acts as  a standard setter  \nA different core -narrative  within the theme  concentrates on EU rules and regulations \nas a golden standard  that other legislation needs to adhere to .  \nThis c an be seen in the following examples ;  \nShadow Environment Secretary Kerry McCarthy said: \u2018Rather than taking \naction t o clean up these beaches so they meet basic EU standards, ministers are \nwashing their hands of the problem\u2019 (TS-2016 -06). \nHere, UK ministers are accused of not living up to the standards set by EU \nlegislation. The EU standards are portrayed  as something very positive. This can also \nbe seen portrayed in the following ; \nVacuum cleaners have got better since their power consumption was slashed by \nEU law two years ago. Many feared the energy restrictions would lead to a \ndrop in cleaning standards , but Which? has found the opposite (TS-2016 -49)13. \nAlthough it seems some had feared a worsening of standards due to regulations, it is \nsaid that the EU standard is actually seen as something positive.  \nThe narrative can also be observed in the following ; \nAs much as \u20ac7bn is needed to bring it in line with EU requirements, and that's \nbefore new plants to serve our growing population are delivered (II-2014 -14)14. \nThe emphasis here is not necessarily portrayed as being on  whether the EU \nregulations are positive  or not, but rather that it is necessary for businesses and \ngovernments alike to adhere to these standards and allocate resources accordingly.   \n                                                   \n13 See also: II-2014 -02, II-2014 -08, II-2018 -49 \n14 See also: II-2016 -16, II-2014 -20, II-2018 -46 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  41 of 93 \n The standard setting  narrative is present both in the UK and Ireland. The Irish  \nIndependent  coverage shows that  the narrative  appears across the  entire  time frame, \nwhile The Sun  coverage is limited to 2016. Common to these narratives is the \ninvocation of EU standards as something to aspire to, something positive . This \nsuggests that the EU is seen as a positive pres ence in terms of regulating these \naspects. This can be seen both in The Sun  and the Irish Independent .  \n6.2.4  We are part of the EU  \nThis core -narrative portrays  member states, in this case Ireland, as doing well in \nrelation to  other EU members, comparing Ireland  to standards and indices across \nthe EU . It suggests  that Ireland is solidly part of the EU.  This is exemplified ;  \nIreland is the fastest growing European market for digital ad spend, new \nindustry figures show. According to IAB Europe's AdEx Benchmark, Ire land \nsaw a 29-pct. rise in digital ad spend in 2015, far outstripping any European \nrivals (II-2016 -29). \nHere, we can see how Ireland is compared to other EU members regarding growth in \ncertain industries. Interestingly, there is talk here of EU rivals, which seems to \nsuggest  competition with other members of the EU. The same can be found to be \nportrayed in the following ;  \nThe last time the unemployment rate was around the current level was in \nNovember 2008, when it stood at 8.1 pc, just two months after the  country \nofficially sank into recession. It is also below the eurozone unemployment rate \nof more than 10pc. Ireland was the first country in the eurozone to slip into \nrecession, but is now its fastest -growing economy (II-2016 -32)15. \nIn both these instances,  the portrayal of Ireland as a part of the EU seems clear. \nThere is no portrayal of the EU as an other , rather focusing on different member \nstates. This can also be seen in the following example ; \nThe European Union opened doors and minds for Ireland. We to ok our place \namong the nations of the world. We travelled. We found new markets and \nsought to make life simpler for citizens and business. We embraced the positive \ninternational identity of Irishness. These changes have had a deep impact on \n                                                   \n15 See also: II-2014 -12, II-2014 -25, II-2014 -29, II-2016 -40, II-2016 -49, II-2018 -47 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  42 of 93 \n our higher educ ation system and continue to do so. Our relationship with our \nnearest neighbour is now very different to almost half a century ago. We are on \na more equal footing and, crucially, there is relative peace on these islands\u201d (II-\n2018 -67). \nQuite clearly, the EU  is portrayed  as something positive and important to Ireland \nand to Irish success.  \nThe narrative is exclusively found in the Irish Independent . Equally present in 2014, \n2016, and 2018, the occurrence might point towards a relatively stable narrative .  \n6.2.5  We b enefit from EU funded development  \nAnother core -narrative found within this theme of EU governance is one of \ndevelopment funded by the EU.  In this narrative, the EU is portrayed  as a benevolent \nentity.  This development refers to EU funded programs, particularly related to \nprogrammes such as the Common Agriculture and Fishery policy of the EU (CAP).  \nEmphasis on the CAP can be seen here ;  \nA set of nine objectives under the new CAP, including climate -relat ed targets, \nwill have to be met to receive direct payments under a Commission proposal \ndue around June 1. Under the new CAP, the EU will monitor climate \ncompliance via mandatory nutrient management plans and will roll out \ncompulsory farm advisory services to encourage precision and digital \nagriculture (II-2018 -17)16.  \nWe see that the EU is portrayed as an ambitious legislator, tying payment to \nambitious climate goals. At the same time, the emphasis on the \u2018mandatory\u2019 and \n\u2018compulsory\u2019 parts of the programme s uggest that the EU is willing to enforce its \npolicies. The stick and carrot approach is solidified by the idea of encouraging \nfarmers towards digital agriculture, something seen as the future of farming.   \nOther occurrence s of this narrative  focus on other  EU development programmes, for \ninstance here,  \n                                                   \n16 See also: II -2016 -14, II -2018 -43 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  43 of 93 \n Rural areas will get \u20ac250m of EU funding up to the end of the decade. The \nfunding is for economic development, job creation, rural tourism, improving \nbroadband and community job projects (II-2014 -01)17. \nThe be nevolence of the EU is clearly portrayed  here. It seems that the aims of this \nprogram are good for the local community as a whole.  \nThis community approach can also be seen here ; \nSpeaking at the launch of Erasmus Plus, European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly \nsaid the programme could \u2018play a huge role\u2019 in the fight against unemployment \nand poor living standards across Europe (II-2014 -32). \nThe Erasmus program is credited with helping fight  unemployment and inequality, \nin line with the values of the EU. This portrays  the EU in a very positive light.  \nThis  development  narrative concerning EU funding is found exclusively in Irish \ncoverage, and while it is to be found across the entire time fra me, it is mostly \nconcentrated on 2014.  This suggests a heightened focus on the issue in that \nparticular time frame.  The focus is also primarily on rural development, whether this \nis by independent development schemes, as seen in II -2014 -01, or later the C AP as \nseen in II -2018 -17. At the same time, the coverage shows that these development \nschemes are portrayed very positively, suggesting that the EU is seen as a positive \ninfluence in this regard.  \n6.2.6  The EU acts in bad faith because of migration  \nA core -narrative focusing on  the governance of  migration can also be found  \nportrayed  in this theme. This can be seen here ;  \nBrussels was blasted yesterday for trying to \"blackmail\" countries into \naccepting migrants. The European Commission threatened to fine EU m ember \nstates \u00a3200,000 for each refugee they decline to house under a new quota \nscheme. Within hours, leaders across eastern Europe had condemned the move  \n(TS-2016 -36). \nHere, the EU is accused of \u2018blackmailing\u2019 member states to accept refugees. Th is \nportray al of the  EU suggests it  is failing to address the migration crisis, resorting to \n                                                   \n17 See also: II -2014 -30, II -2016 -13 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  44 of 93 \n questionable tactics. It portrays the EC as a bad faith actor, very clearly labelled as an \nother .  \nWhilst this narrative does not appear very often in this theme, it is nonet heless \ninteresting that when it does appear it is only in UK coverage, in the time period of \n2016. Potentially, this could be seen in relation to the European migration crisis of \n2015, as well as a general heightened scrutiny of the EU leading up to the Br exit-\nreferendum in June 2016.  \n6.2.7  Thematic tendencies  \nThe theme is very versatile, incorporating many different narratives in it. Taking all \nthe core -narratives together, one of the very visible tendencies is the  primary \noccurrence of these narratives in the Irish Independent . Most of these narratives \ncreate a very positive picture of the EU. This can be seen in the consumer protection \nnarrative, or the standard setting narrative.  It is quite clear that the EU is more often \nthan not seen as a protector of citiz ens, constituted as a part of the self, even over \nnational governments (see TS -2016 -06). The overall positive picture of the EU and \nits institutions presented in the Irish coverage seems to contrast to some extent with \nsome of the coverage in the UK, such as the  \u2018blackmailing\u2019 member states  (see TS -\n2016 -36). This suggests an overall more negative portrayal  of the EU institutions in \nThe Sun \u2019s coverage.     \nThe governance narratives are present across the entire time frame, with the UK \nappearance s coinciding  mostly  with the run -up to the Brexit -referendum. The \ncoverage in Ireland seem particularly focused on the development aspects in  2018, \nthe time where new CAP rules were being negotiated and decided.   \n6.3 Theme: Criticism of EU policy  \nThe theme, Criticism of EU policy, encompasses various core -narratives with the \ncommon denominator of being critical towards actions or outcomes of EU policy. \nThis theme is closely related to the theme of EU governance , as it to a large degree \ndeals with the same subject matter: EU policy.  \n6.3.1  The EU is the cause of migration problems  \nAs we know, the migration crisis of 2015 was one of the central events during that \nyear and has remained a very large influence on the political landscape ever since . \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  45 of 93 \n Therefore, it is not surprising that on e of the most consistent and largest narratives \nwithin this theme concerns migration and the EU\u2019s policies towards migration.  \nHowever, the migration narratives do not only focus on external migration, internal \nEU migration is also the subject of several na rratives.  \nOn the one hand, there is the criticism of the principle of free movement, exemplified \nby the quotes ,  \nMore than 80 EU nationals are being arrested in London each day as Britain's \nopen borders change the face of Britain. The Met held more than 3 0,000 in the \ncapital in each of the past three years (TS-2016 -09). \nThis criticism of the free movement principle is a direct criticism of the EU, as the \nfree movement of people is one of the core tenements of the EU today.  There is also a \nportrayal of chan ge as something negative where the face of Britai n is concerned. \nWhether this is due to a concern for job security, local culture and customs, or a third \nthing we cannot say. However, we see this concern  of other groups reflected in a lot \nof populist rheto ric around the EU. This is also portrayed  in the following quote,  \nMinisters fear EU immigrants now outnumber arrivals from the rest of the \nworld [\u2026] largely from debt -hit south and eastern European states, the number \nof continental newcomers could even top  250,000 for the first time ever  \n(TS-2014 -02). \nAgain, fear of outside influence can be clearly seen  portrayed here . Interestingly, the  \nimmigration from the EU is contrasted with immigration from the rest of the world . \nThis idea can also be seen here,  \nEU m igrants now make up more than one in 20 of the UK population, a report \nrevealed yesterday. The number has soared from 0.9million in 1995 to \n3.3million last year. But a separate report could today reveal 1.3million more \nEU migrants are here than stats sugge st (TS-2016 -04).  \nThe make -up of the UK is portrayed as being  challenged by EU immigrants.  The \nincreased arrivals of EU immigrants are portrayed  as a negative prospect for the UK. \nParticularly, the last part also can be seen to portray  politicians a s not truthful about \nthe effects of migration . This can also be seen portrayed by  Boris Johnson, the \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  46 of 93 \n former foreign minister of the UK, being cited as having said EU policies had driven \nministers to \u2018terrible dishonesty\u2019 on immigration  (TS-2016 -04) 18. \nOn th e other hand, there is a portrayed criticism of the migration policies regarding \nexternal migration, such as migrants and refugees coming into the EU during the \nmigrant crisis. This is seen  here,  \nAlmost 12,000 unaccompanied kids aged 13 or under flooded i nto the EU to \nclaim asylum last year, shock figures have revealed. The spiralling number of \nchildren and teenagers under 18 on the move without their parents is up \nfourfold from 2014  (TS-2016 -05). \nWe see  outrage towards the migration of unaccompanied child ren into the EU  \nportrayed . This portrays the  EU as allowing  a situation that is spiralling , i.e. getting \nout of hand. The same sentiment can also be seen here,   \nThe number of children and teenagers under 18 on the move without their \nparents rose fourfold. Tory rebels said Britain must \"do its bit\" and accept \nmore (TS-2016 -15)19.  \nAlthough, the above reflects the outrage over this trend, it also brands politicians \nsuggesting helping the problem by taking in these children as \u2018 rebels \u2019. The narrative \nalso depicts  the consequences for the UK, for instance in the statement , \n\u2018The biggest problem people will face in the next ten years is illegal \nimmigration.\u2019 Mr Brown said  it put pressure on schools and hospitals in some \nareas. But he added: \u2018The answer is not to leave the EU but help communities \nrun decent social services  (TS-2016 -64)20.  \nHere, we see a former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, argue that the biggest \nproblem for Britain will be related to immigration. This problem is related to illegal \nimmigration, which seems to suggest a failure to restrict or control immigration. It \nalso highlights how migration will affect the UK, with more pressure on local services \nas a result. Interestingly, Mr. Brown does not suggest that this is not the fault of the \nEU, neither suggesting it is.  \n                                                   \n18 See also: TS-2014 -05, TS-2014 -14, TS-2014 -16, TS-2016 -66, TS-2016 -31, TS-2016 -95, TS-2016 -99, \nTS-2016 -100, TS-2016 -111, TS-2016 -112 \n19 See also: TS-2016 -23, TS-2016 -98 \n20 See also: TS-2016 -95, TS-2016 -115 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  47 of 93 \n The migration narrative is almost exclusively present in The Sun , suggesting a high \nfocus in the UK on this topic.  This migration narrat ive differs from other migration \nnarratives because it seems to conflate internal and external migration in a way, \nproblematising both. Other narratives focusing on migration tend to focus on \nproblematic aspects of external migration.  The narrative is pri marily present in the \ncoverage from 2016, although the aspect of inter -EU migration also appears in \ncoverage from 2014. One of the probable causes for the heavy increase in coverage \nbetween 2014 and 2016 is the occurrence of the 2015 European migration cri sis. \nHowever, the occurrence of the narrative previous to 2016 suggests that there was \nsome awareness regarding EU migration before 2015.  \n6.3.2  The EU intrudes on  national policy  \nA different core -narrative  in the theme centres on criticism of the EU intruding o n \nnational policies in member states.  This narrative has different aspects to it, whereas \none centres on criticisms of EU rules and how these restrict the national \ngovernments, the other centres on how the EU uses its power to influence local and \nnational sentiments.   \nThe aspect of it is the criticism of EU rules and regulations, as exemplified by t his \nstatement , \nA crackdown on our cuppa tea and toast are under attack by EU officials who \nwant to ban high powered kettles and toasters. Tough curbs on househol d items \nwill be unveiled in autumn. Britain, which accounts for a third of all EU kettle \nsales, will be hardest hit. It comes as food and drink recalls soared 60 per cent \ndue to \u2018heavy handed\u2019 EU label rules (TS-2016 -11). \nEvidently, the EU is here  depicted  as a controlling  entity, restricting national \ngovernments. Here, it is presented as a direct attack on, arguably, one of the most \niconic British cultural traits, tea drinking. Describing EU regulations as heavy \nhanded  is a very clear criticism of the EU, essentially arguing that this EU policy is \noverly forceful or clumsy. Some of the same sentiments can be seen echoed in \nfollowing,  \nThe project was forced on the landowner by EU laws Britain has had to adopt. \nEstate manager Andrew Blenkiron said: \u2018We just w anted to dig a hole in the \nground but ended up with a phenomenal rigmarole.\u2019 The EU added the newts to \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  48 of 93 \n its protected species list in 1992. Anyone ignoring rules protecting them faces a \nfine of \u00a35,000 for each lost newt (TS-2014 -19)21.  \nAgain, the portrayal of resentment towards EU rules due to a restriction of producers \nand consumers is evident.  This is also further enforced by arguing that the EU has \nforced  member states to adopt this legislation, portraying the EU as oppressive in \nthis regard.  It is also clearly seen that the above -mentioned  sentiment of heavy \nhandedness is again on display.  \nThe other aspect of this core -narrative,  criticising the EU for trying to bias the public \ndebate particularly related to the Brexit -referendum , can be seen h ere;  \nBrexit -backing MPs have written to the European Commission warning it not \nto target British homes with pro -EU leaflets ahead of the referendum. It \naccuses Brussels of interfering in previous referendums in EU states and adds: \n\u2018Any intervention is lik ely to be controversial\u2019 (TS-2016 -87).  \nWarning the EC not to interfere  in the Brexit -referendum is a clear indication of \ncriticism levelled against the EU. The portrayal  seems to be that the EU is abusing its \nposition and power to controversially  influenc e the public sentiment in member \nstates in favour of the EU. Here, we see how the EU is depicted  as an actor with \nsubversive interests, as an other . This accusation of abuse of power to influence \nopinions is also levelled at national governments working in  the EU\u2019s interests. This \ncan be seen in the following,  \nMotorists who renew their car tax online are being bombarded with pro -EU \npropaganda. Thousands more who visit Government websites about tax, \nbenefits, passports or education are also being diverted to  a site telling them \nthe referendum will be on June 23  (TS-2016 -46). \nHere, the national government is depicted as  abusing its position to further the EU\u2019s \nagenda. In the run up to the Brexit -referendum, which is referred to here, it is \nsuggested that influencing voters via governmental institutions is wrong.   \nThis criticism is also portrayed in relation  to other int ernational institutions, i.e. the \nIMF was blasted yesterday for \u2018interfering in democracy\u2019 with an apocalyptic \nBrexit warning  (TS-2016 -71).  \n                                                   \n21 See also: II-2014 -15, II-2016 -57, TS-2014 -17, TS-2016 -54 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  49 of 93 \n Interestingly, there seems to be a conflation of EU politicians and national politicians \n(particularly leaders) of other member states. This phenomenon can be observed \nhere,  \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel secretly controlled David Cameron's EU \nrenegotiation - sabotaging his emergency brake on migrants, it's claimed. \nBrexit -backing former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said she forced the \nPM to axe the key demand less than 24 hours before he was due to unveil it  (TS-\n2016 -44)22.  \nAt the same time, we see accusations of pro -EU bias of national medias  depicted , \nparticularly in the UK;  \nBoris Johnson is silenced - as a row raged over the TV Brexit debate. Vote \nLeave accused ITV of pro -EU bias after the channel said David Cameron will \nface Nigel Farage, left, on June 7 instead of Michael Gove (TS-2016 -22)23.  \nThis portrays the EU and national medias as the same other  based  on their perceived \nbias.  \nThe narrative is very prominent  in coverage by The Sun . The aspect regarding EU \nbias is present only in the 2016 coverage, coinciding with the run -up to the Brexit -\nreferendum in the UK. Although the narrative is tentatively present in 2014, it is very \nclear that the focus on these issues has increased vastly by 2016. Coverage in Ireland \nin relation to the problems of EU regulations are also found, albeit much less than in \nthe UK.  \n6.3.3  The EU prioritises wrongly  \nA different  narrative , focusing on the perceived wrongful prioriti sation of EU policies \ncan also be identified within this theme. This narrative focuses primarily on how the \nprioritisation of EU funds can impact member states. The narrative is less focused on \nportraying direct criticism of EU institutions, seemingly more concerned with \npotential  improvements through changed prioritisation.  \n                                                   \n22 See also: TS -2016 -45, TS -2016 -78 \n23 See also: TS -2016 -85 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  50 of 93 \n One aspect of this narrative is concerned with how the EU prioritises its budget post -\n2020 (after Brexit). Here, the focus is  portrayed  particularly as being on the how this \nbudget will impact Irish farmers,  \nHe said a reduction in the CAP budget post -2020 would be a big blow for Irish \nfarmers. \u2018It is clear that the commission has moved to fill the Brexit gap, but \nthey have prioritised other areas at the expense of the CAP, which is another \nsetback for Irish far mers on foot of the UK decision to leave,\u2019 Mr Healy said\u201d  \n(II-2018 -09). \nAs well as here , \nFarmers' income was a key issue on the election trail with Mr Healy warning \nthat politicians need to \"get serious and recognise there is a real income crisis \non Irish  farms\u2019 (II-2016 -25)24. \nIn both statements  above, we see a concern that wrongful prioritisation on the EU\u2019s \npart has a direct effect on Irish farmers , portrayed . However, as opposed to the \nprevious narrative, we do not see the portrayal of the EU as an oppr essive force. The \nfocus seems more to lie on how the impact on farmers should be a concern for local \nand national politicians as well.  \nAnother aspect of this narrative argues that the EU is focusing on the wrong \napproach towards its policies. This is illus trated here,  \nFaced with these problems, Europe's leaders tend to think of their own national \nelectorates, rather than of the eurozone as a whole. This is because they are \neach elected by national electorates, rather than by Europe. Political incentives \nand economic responsibilities are not aligned in Europe. That needs to change \nif a sufficiently robust structure is to be built to protect the eurozone against the \nnext global crisis (II-2016 -52)25.  \nHere, the criticism is depicted as being  directed at nation al politicians within the EU \nwho think more about their own interests than collective EU interests. There is a lack \nof criticism towards the EU itself, rather focusing on the lack of political alignment \nwithin the Union.  \n                                                   \n24 See also: II -2018 -33, II-2018 -51, II-2018 -54, TS -2016 -08, TS -2016 -24 \n25 See also: II-2014 -31 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  51 of 93 \n The narrative is quite prominent i n Ireland. The aspect of budget prioritisation \nseems to be a large concern considering Brexit. However, the income concern exists \nin 2016 as well, tentatively suggesting that this is a longer issue than purely Brexit \nspeculation.  \n6.3.4  The EU is taking autonomy away from members  \nA core -narrative concerned with the loss of autonomy is also present in the theme. \nThis narrative is based around the belief that the EU is taking away autonomy from \nthe nation state.  \nThe concern regarding this perceived loss of autonomy  is illustrated here,  \nThe EU wants to create a Hitler -style superstate, Boris Johnson claims. He says \nBrussels uses \u2018different methods\u2019 but shares the same aim to unite the continent \nunder one authority. Boris said: \u2018Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried  this out, \nand it ends tragically. What is lacking is there is no underlying loyalty to the \nidea of Europe\u2019  (TS-2016 -53). \nThe portrayal of the EU as a fascist  entity with megalomania is a very indicative of \nhow the EU is constituted as an actor in this sta tement. Clearly, the EU is portrayed \nas an other . The portrayal of autonomy is quite clear here : the EU wants to take over \nall the autonomy from the national governments, which would lead to disaster. The \nfear of the EU having sinister goals, albeit with l ess overt fascism, can also be seen in \nthe following,   \nVoters have seen their democratic power eroded by the ever -expanding \nEuropean superstate. Some feel under siege from mass migration via the EU's \nopen borders. Some have seen their economies wrecked by the Euro \ncatastrophe (TS-2016 -118)26.  \nThe portrayal here implicates  the EU taking sovereignty from member states and \nencroaching on national jurisdiction. At the same time, the EU is heavily criticised \nfor its open borders  policies, as well as the handling  of the financial crisis.  \n                                                   \n26 See also: TS-2016 -84, TS-2016 -69 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  52 of 93 \n Interestingly, this narrative only exists in UK coverage, exclusively in 2016. \nTherefore, it seems to suggest a clear correlation between the Brexit campaign and \nthe question of EU and national sovereignty.   \nA different angle  of this narrative , which centres on the problems Ireland faced due \nto EU regulations regarding bank payments, can also be seen.  This narrative is \ndemonstrated here,  \nBut because Ireland is now part of the Single European Payments Area (SEPA), \nand there were n o interbank transactions in most EU countries yesterday, \nbanks here were unable to process wage payments or pay direct debits  (II-\n2014 -10)27. \nAs well as here,  \nThe mess meant some people had to wait until the close of business yesterday \nbefore they had funds, leaving them facing into the bank holiday weekend \nscrambling to buy groceries and other essentials (II-2014 -16).  \nThis aspect is present in Ireland in 2014.  It occurs after Ireland had to comply with \nECB rules due to financial issues, leading to a large restructuring of the banking \nsector in Ireland  (O'Carroll, 2010) . Clearly, we see the loss of autonomy of the Irish \nbanking syste m having negative consequences for Irish consumers and Ireland  \nportrayed here . \n6.3.5  Thematic tendencies  \nOverall w ithin this theme, the EU is portrayed overwhelmingly negative. This can be \nseen in the way in which the core -narrative on migration depicts other EU  nationals \nas a burden being foisted upon the UK by bad EU rules. Additionally, the image of \nmigrants \u201cflooding\u201d Europe suggests an EU that is unable, or unwilling, to control its \nexternal borders. The EU is also portrayed as a meddling entity, overreachin g both in \nterms of sovereignty, as seen in the narrative on loss of autonomy, and in terms of \nintrusion into the political spheres of member states, as portrayed in the \ncorresponding narrative.  This depiction of the EU as very negative is certainly mostly \npronounced in The Sun. W hilst the depiction of the EU as a negative persists in Irish \ncoverage as well, it is not nearly as pronounced. Here, the narrative on wrong \n                                                   \n27 See also: II -2014 -06, II -2014 -13, II -2018 -48 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  53 of 93 \n prioritisation focuses more on lamenting the issues faced by the European \nCommission in the  face of budget cuts, or the lack of agreement on how to move \nforward. This overall theme  spans all time frames, both in UK as well as Irish \ncoverage. There is a clear trend in UK coverage of pronounced coverage in 2016, \nwhich given the referendum in 2016 is not surprising. The same can be said of the \nnegative portrayal of the EU, which is worst  in 2016 as seen in TS -2016 -53.  \n6.4 Theme: Political alienation  \nThe theme of political alienation encompasses  core -narratives focusing on the lack of \ncredibility of national politicians, as well as political alienation. The narrative takes \ntwo shapes, one is focused more on national politicians and their lack of credibility, \nwith the EU playing less of a direct role. The other is  aimed more at the EU, and the \nlack of political credibility of EU politicians.  \n6.4.1  Our national politicians lack credibility  \nHere, the focus lies on  national politicians having a  lack of political credibility , as \nwell as  a general criticism of the entire political system or the establishment on a \nnational level.  \nWithin the core -narrative different politicians are criticised, however one of the most \nheavily criticised is  former prime minister David Cameron. Examples could  be;  \nDavid Cameron is really scraping the barrel by saying Britain's exit from the \nEU could pave the way for World War Three. What next - a plague of frogs, \nfollowed by boils and locusts? The EU did not stop Tony Blair sending our \nyoung men to fight in th e Middle East with poor equipment and it did not stop \nDavid Cameron trying to get his own war in Syria. The only threat to this \ncountry is from weak politicians (TS -2016 -123) . \nHere, we see how David Cameron\u2019s credibility is heavily questioned. He is portra yed \nas a doomsayer, underscored by the allusion to the biblical plagues. He is also \ndescribed as weak and, by extension, a threat  to the UK. The same lack of credibility \ncan also be seen here,  \nDavid Cameron has enthusiastically championed Turkey joining t he European \nUnion. Turkey - an increasingly authoritarian nation of 75 million Muslims \nthat shares its sieve -like border with Syria, Iraq and Iran. Hey, what's not to \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  54 of 93 \n like? But the Prime Minister can't have it both ways. He can't be a fawning \ncheerleader f or Turkish membership of the EU when it suits him - for example, \nwhen he is making a speech in Ankara - and then tell us that Turkey will not \njoin the EU \u2018for decades\u2019 and so it is not relevant to the referendum of June 23 \n(TS-2016 -41)28. \nNot only is his cr edibility questioned, he is also portrayed as unreliable, or na\u00efve, in \nrelation to the question of Turkey\u2019s ascension to the EU.  \nHowever, i t is not only David Cameron who is seen as lacking credibility . Former \nLabour prime minister Tony Blair is also menti oned in one of the previous quotes. \nAnother quote also shows that Theresa May, the current prime minister, is missing \nthe same credibility;  \nGrassroots Tories have told the PM the party will not be trusted for a \ngeneration if she \u2018fudges\u2019 Brexit. In an ope n letter to Theresa May, they say \ncompromise will frustrate the will of the people (TS-2018 -23).  \nWe see that she is essentially depicted as someone that cannot be trusted, if she does \nnot \u2018deliver\u2019 on Brexit.  \nOther prominent politicians,  on the Remain sid e, are also portrayed with the same \nlack of credibility  during the Brexit referendum, which can be seen here;  \nThe arrogance of David Miliband and his diehard Remainer chums is \nrepugnant.  The banana -waving bighead, famous only for bottling one \nleadership challenge before losing to his little brother and stomping off to New \nYork, now demands we heed his every utterance on Brexit.  And his considered \nview, alongside Nick Clegg and Tory Nicky Morgan, is we shouldn't do it. Sure, \nwe can pretend to leave - but stay in both the customs union and single market, \nsurrendering control of immigration. They call this tired old argument \u2018Soft \nBrexit\u2019. Leaving any part of the EU is \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 now. It is laughable. Who do \nthey imagine would tell 17.4 million people the ir votes were to be ignored? Not \nMiliband, hiding in Manhattan. These Remain ultras are blind to the obvious: \nthat the story has moved on (TS-2018 -61). \n                                                   \n28 See also: TS -2016 -34, TS -2016 -39, TS -2016 -43, TS-2016 -92, TS-2016 -97, TS-2016 -106, TS-2016 -\n110, TS-2016 -115, TS-2016 -118, TS-2016 -124 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  55 of 93 \n Here, David Miliband, a prominent former Labour politician, is essentially ridiculed \nand described as a child, stomping . Further, Miliband\u2019s point of view is described as \nlaughable  and he, together with other Remainers, as out of touch with voters and the \npublic.  \nAnother example of political alienation in a narrative could be the following ;  \nWhitehall Brexi t adviser Olly Robbins has been accused of holding back key \nevidence proving technology can be used to solve the Irish border issue  (TS-\n2018 -41)29. \nHere, a government aide, and by extension the government, is accused of holding \nback critical information. This depicts low credibility in the entire political system, \nwhich is  also to be found in this;  \nThe House of Lords believes we peasants do not understand what is best for us. \nBut unlike people in the past, we live in a democracy and have voted for a \nfuture outside the EU (TS-2018 -30). \nThe House of Lords is here described as out of touch and undemocratic, standing in \nthe way of \u2018the people\u2019 and their will.  \nThis narrative is only to be found  in the UK in 2016 and 2018. This suggest, that the \nmedia coverage in the UK is more concerned with a lack of credibility with the \nnational politicians.  The politicians that are described as lacking credibility are being \nportrayed very negatively, almost a mounting to character assassination. This seems \nto clearly indicate that the politicians in question are certainly not a part of us but \nmost definitely an other . Interestingly, this narrative is primarily present during \n2016, coinciding with the Brexit -referendum. This points towards Brexit, and by \nextension the EU, playing a large role in the perception of politicians and their \ncredibility.  \n6.4.2  The European politicians lack credibility  \nOn the other side of this theme th is core -narrative revolves around politi cal \nalienation with a focus on politicians and institutions within the European system. \n                                                   \n29 See also: TS -2018 -49, TS -2018 -53 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  56 of 93 \n These can be both  Members of the European Parliament (MEP s) as well as the EU as \nan entity .  \nThe largest  aspect  within this narrative is concerned with a lack of credib ility within \nthe EU system . This critical portrayal of the EU can be seen here;  \nWhy does the Remain lobby batter voters with some new apocalypse every \nday? If the positive case for staying in the EU is solid, why not make it without \nthe infantile scares? One answer is that Remain are spooked. Voters just don't \nbelieve them - and the polls are still deadlocked. Millions of sensible, moderate \npeople are considering Brexit. Remain should treat them as adults, maybe even \nconceding a few upsides to going it alo ne (TS-2016 -59). \nAlthough it is couched towards the Remain party within the UK, the inherent \ncriticism of the EU  system  is obvious. The EU is portrayed as lacking the qualities \nand the credibility to convince voters that it is worth staying in the Union. Some of \nthe same sentiment can be found here;  \nThe EU was supposed to be about free trade,\u2019 says Blake. \u2018But what did we get - \na bunch of idiots in Brussels \u2019 (II-2016 -09)30. \nThe EU is depicted as  not having  lived up to its promises, therefore losing the \ncred ibility necessary. Incompetence is implied as well, with \u2018idiots in Brussels\u2019.  \nAnother aspect of the narrative about a lack of credibility is concerned with a lack of \ncredibility with the MEP s. This can be seen here;  \nIn the meantime, MEPs will continue to rake in more than \u00a3200,000 per year, \non average, in salaries, expenses and pensions before UK membership of the \nEU ceases. I bet the legal procedures will be dragged out as long as possible as \nthe gravy train slowly c omes to a stop (TS-2016 -119) . \nEssentially, EU politicians are depicted  as greedy and only interested in the money. \nThis shows political alienation quite clearly. It is further implied that these \npoliticians only attempt to stop Brexit due to self -interest.  \nThe same can be seen here;   \n                                                   \n30 See also: TS-2016 -74, TS-2016 -86 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  57 of 93 \n Two Euro MPs have milked the taxpayer for more than \u00a31million each, The Sun \ncan reveal (TS-2016 -81).  \nHere too, greed is portrayed as being a driving force for these politicians.  \nThis narrative is mainly anchored within the ne wspaper coverage in the UK. \nFurthermore , it is only found in 2016 leading up to the Brexit referendum. This \nsuggests that political alienation and the lack of political credibility played a role in \nthe run up to the referendum.  \n6.4.3  Thematic tendencies  \nOverall , the core -narratives within this theme are only to be found in UK coverage, \nparticularly in the time frame of 2016. This seems to indicate both a heightened \nscrutiny of politicians and their motivations at that time, but also an overall \nweariness of the p olitical class. Interestingly, we see the politicians being portrayed \nvery negatively, with personal attacks being the norm in this narrative. Further, we \ncan also see that the national politicians are singled out, and particularly David \nCameron is clearly  constituted as an other , lacking huge amounts of credibility.   \n6.5 Outcomes of Brexit  \nThe theme Outcomes of Brexit  includes core -narratives concerned with the  \nconsequences of the Brexit referendum in June 2016. The se narratives support one \nof two binary core -narratives, either Brexit has a positive impact on the UK  or Brexit \nhas a negative impact on the UK . These two core -narratives have several aspects to \nthem.  \n6.5.1 The UK will not benefit from Brexit  \nOne aspect of this core -narrative is concerned with the economi c dimension .  The \neconomic dimension  consists of three concerns . One, a concern about  free trade , \nwhich  sees Brexit as something that could lead t o problems for UK development and \ngrowth, as seen here;  \nBritain must stay in the EU for greater access to high -growth Commonwealth \ncountries, warns a business leader. CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn said a Brexit \nwould mean going \u2018back to the drawing board\u2019 on deals  (TS-2016 -47). \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  58 of 93 \n The CBI (a business organisation within the UK) is portrayed as warning that a \nrenegot iation of  all trade deals and access to other countries, even Commonwealth \ncountries, which are historically close to the UK, will impact the economy.  \nThe same  concerns are depicted  here ;  \nThe UK economy could face a \u00a3250bn (\u20ac316bn) hit in lost trade if th e country \nvotes to leave the EU, Remain campaigners have claimed. The 'Britain Stronger \nin Europe' analysis suggests that trade to the EU would be \u00a3224bn (\u20ac283bn) \nlower if there was no deal in place after a Brexit. There would also be a \u00a39bn \n(\u20ac11bn) fall i n trade with the wider European Economic Area and \u00a314bn \n(\u20ac17.5bn) in lost trade with countries which have deals with the EU (II-2016 -\n23)31 \nAgain, trade is portrayed  to be heavily impacted if the UK does not remain in the EU. \nInterestingly, this statement is  from Irish coverage, which suggests that trade \nconcerns of Brexit also go beyond the UK itself.  \nThe second economic dimension  is somewhat more specific than the first. This \naspect  is concerned with the negative consequences for specific British industrie s as \nevident  here;  \nLeaving the EU poses a \u2018huge risk\u2019 to the Scotch whisky industry, the UK \nEnvironment Secretary claimed yesterday. Liz Truss said Scotland's largest \nexporter would face soaring costs and red tape in the event of a Brexit next \nmonth (TS-2016-29).  \nThis has some relationship to the first dimension, seeing as the consequences are \nportrayed to be linked  to trade. However, here we see the depiction  of a very specific \nindustry : the Scottish whisky industry.  \nHowever, i t is not only the whisky industry that would  be impacted by Brexit, the \nsame thing can be seen in the car industry;  \nEconomist Howard Archer said uncertainties over the UK economic outlook \nand concerns about the EU referendum could be a \u2018potential speed bu mp\u2019 for \nthe UK car industry (TS-2016 -63).32 \n                                                   \n31 See also: II -2016 -06, II -2016 -31, II -2018 -42, II-2016 -60, TS-2016 -94, TS-2018 -13, TS-2018 -33,  \n32 See also: II -2016 -05, TS-2016 -117, TS-2016 -120, TS-2018 -07, TS -2018 -40, TS-2018 -74 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  59 of 93 \n Again, a major industry for the UK is depicted as  potentially be ing at risk in a Brexit \nsituation.  \nThe third economic aspect is regarding rising housing prices and unemployment, \nwhich can be seen here;  \nLeaving the EU would push down house prices and raise mortgage costs, \nGeorge Osborne has controversially warned  (TS-2016 -69).  \nAs well as here;  \nHouse prices have also started to cool - dropping to an average of 0.5 per cent \nin England and Wales in March - and it appears that overseas investors have \nbeen staying away from UK commercial investments ahead of the EU \nreferendum (TS-2016 -72)33. \nIn both of the above examples, Brexit  is portrayed as having a  negative impact on \ngeneral living standards in the UK. This is al so mirrored in the concern of rising \nunemployment, as portrayed here;  \nBank of England boss Mark Carney yesterday issued the grimmest warning yet \nabout a Brexit, saying it could trigger a recession. Inflation and unemployment \nare likely to rise if we opt ou t, he said. And the Pound could fall \u2018perhaps \nsharply\u2019, pushing up prices and hitting growth (TS-2016 -27).  \nWe see a prominent economist warn about some very core aspects of the economic \nsystem . It shows that Brexit is depicted as having an adverse impact on the lives of \neveryday citizens in the UK.  \nThese three dimensions  are part of this overall economic  aspect in which the central \ntheme is that the British economy and UK citizens will be worse off outside the EU.   \nA different aspect of the core -narrative , namely that the UK will not benefit from \nBrexit , is concerned with intelligence security, as well as a general concern for the \nsecurity of the British population, which can be seen in the following ;  \nThirteen former US defence chiefs and five ex -NATO boss es last night warned a \nBrexit would help the UK's enemies. Quitting the EU would harm Britain's \nstanding and leave us \u2018dangerously weakened\u2019, the retired White House chiefs - \n                                                   \n33 See also: TS -2016 -33, II -2016 -24 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  60 of 93 \n including former CIA boss George Schultz - said in a letter to The Times  (TS-\n2016 -32).  \nInterestingly, we see US defence chiefs and NATO officials used as key witnesses. \nEssentially, the argument is  portrayed as being  that the UK will be weaker outside \nthe EU in terms of security, not only because of capabilities, but also because of h arm \nto Britain\u2019s \u2018standing\u2019.  \nThe same sentiment can be seen in this;  \nFirst Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6, said Brexit wouldn't damage UK \nsecurity and we'd be safer if we regained control of our borders. Then \nyesterday Sir John Sawers, another ex -MI6 head, warned that leaving the EU \ncould undermine \u2018our ability to pro tect ourselves\u2019 from terrorists (TS-2016 -\n103)34.  \nHere, the emphasis is not on the standing, but rather on the actual defence against \nterrorism. Both  examples however, portray  the UK weakened in terms of security \noutside the EU.  \nA different aspect to the co re-narrative  is concerned with the EU\u2019s role as a standard \nsetter and how the UK needs the EU to fulfil this role.  This can be seen here;  \nHarriet Harman has sparked a backlash by saying Brexiteers think a woman's \nplace is in the home. The Labour MP said t he EU helped secure reforms \nincluding equal pay and maternity rights. She claimed there was a \u2018match\u2019 \nbetween people who want out and \u2018want women back in the home\u2019 (TS-2016 -\n73).  \nEssentially, fear of a roll back of standards as fundamental as women\u2019s right s is used  \nto argue against a Brexit, because it is depicted as damag ing to  these fundamental \nrights.  \nHowever, it is not only in terms of equal rights that there is a need for the EU as a \nstandard setter;  \nAll of the approved chemicals used in European agr iculture have limitations as \nto usage. Restrictions These include individual crop permissions/restrictions, \n                                                   \n34 See also: II -2016 -10, TS -2016 -102, TS -2016 -113 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  61 of 93 \n maximum rates, periods of permitted usage, conditions under which \napplication is permitted, buffer zones in which application is permitted, \nconditio n of application equipment and usage restricted to persons who have \nundertaken a training course in pesticide application. The same level of \ncontrols are not in place for imported products. How much product are we \nimporting in foodstuffs that does not meet  our standards? Within Europe we \nhave a very comprehensive residue testing in food products combined with \nrecords keeping by farmers of all products used and traceability of both \nanimals and crops. Controls are rigidly enforced on farm. Can the same be sai d \nfor imported product? If Britain exits the EU will we have different \nenvironmental standards for crops produced in the Northern Ireland? The \nissue of immediate concern is that the food we import in Europe should meet \nthe same standards as Europe demands of it's farmers (II-2016 -39).  \nHere, we see that the EU is instrumentalised as important regarding agricultural \nregulations. This seems to suggest a fear that the UK outside of the EU would not be \nable, or willing, to live up to the same high standards. Fu rther, this statement also \ntouches on the EU\u2019s large power as a trade bloc. We can see that there is a concern of \nthe UK importing/exporting lower quality goods because it does not have the same \npower as the EU in terms of setting standards for import/expo rt. \nA good summary of the risks to the UK, by leaving the EU can be seen in the \nfollowing;   \nVote Leave will tell you EU red tape is strangling our hardworking firms. \nThey're living in cloud cuckoo land. A vote to leave would be a triple tragedy - \nmore rule s, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU. Right now we \ncan sell to 500million people in the blink of an eye. Now look at Norway, which \nisn't in the EU. Its firms must fill out a form with 50 boxes. Then they need \ntedious custom checks, which co uld be a death sentence for our fresh fruit. Over \n100,000 of our businesses sell to the EU. Add together all this wasted time and \nmoney and you'll see why leaving is a hassle they could do without (TS-2016 -\n122).35 \n                                                   \n35 See also: TS -2016 -37 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  62 of 93 \n This statement depicts the same  concerns seen in the other examples; the UK would \nbe far harder pressed to trade with the EU if it were to be outside the Union.  \nA different aspect of the core -narrative is not concerned with the negative impact on \nthe UK in even of Brexit, but rather mak es the case that other  EU members will \nbenefit from the UK\u2019s exit. The argument consists of two things the first one being \nthat Brexit will result in better opportunities for member states which can be seen \nhere;  \nHe will tell a conference in London today t hat Britain's planned departure from \nthe EU must be seen as a \u2018catalyst rather than a catastrophe\u2019 for Irish higher \neducation and research. Mr FitzGerald, who has been knighted in the UK, says \nIreland must prepare to take advantage of being \u2018the centre of English -\nspeaking higher education and research in the EU\u2019 (II-2018 -14). \nAs well as,  \nBank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) has named key staff who will move to \nDublin ahead of Brexit, to join the bank's new European global banking and \nmarkets operations. Las t week, the Irish Independent reported that the global \nbank is to relocate 125 jobs to Dublin as it overhauls its banking business in the \nUK and Europe in preparation for the UK exit from the EU. (II-2018 -10)36. \nWhat can be seen  portrayed  in these two examp les are the benefits that  can be gain ed \nby Ireland in case of a Brexit , e.g. getting more jobs to the country . Since companies \nsuddenly can no longer rely on an office in the UK to be within the EU and might \nneed access to the single market, Ireland can and will benefit from that . We see this \nin effect already, looking at the example of BAML, where  Brexit and the uncertainty \nabout what is going to happen and how an agreement between the EU and UK is \ngoing to  be structure d, has led to the company moving em ployees to Ireland . At the \nsame time there is also an opportunity for Ireland to become the best place to go for \nEnglish -speaking higher education [\u2026] in the EU  which is portrayed as being  a huge \ngain for Ireland and Irish economy.  \n                                                   \n36 See also: II-2018 -02, II-2018 -34, II-2018 -41, II-2018 -60 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  63 of 93 \n The other side of this a spect is that the EU will struggle after a Brexit, which is why \nthe UK should stay.  This is exemplified in the potential downsizing of the EU \nbudget ; \nBrussels unveiled plans to hike foreign aid spending by a quarter yesterday - as \na huge row broke out bet ween member states over plugging the EU's post -\nBrexit black hole. Eurocrats want to splurge \u00a3108billion on overseas \ndevelopment as part of its seven -year budget. Remaining member states would \nsee contributions to the overall EU budget rocket. But Dutch PM Mark Rutte \nsaid: \u2018A smaller EU as a result of Brexit should also mean a smaller budget\u2019 \n(TS-2018 -16). \nWe see a clear concern for the future of the EU without the UK  depicted . By arguing \nthat the EU essentially needs the UK to keep economically in shape, th e importance \nof the UK is highlighted.  \nThis is also reflected in the following example, which pertains specifically to the Irish \neconomy;  \nThe potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy, particularly on the Irish \nagri -food  sector, has been discussed a nd debated the length and breadth of the \ncountry for the last year and a half and it will continue up to and beyond \nMarch 29 next, when the UK leaves the European Union. For Irish farmers, one \nof the key concerns relates to the impact that Brexit might hav e on the EU \nbudget and, especially, on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget post -\n2020 (II-2018 -52)37. \nThere is a concern for how  Brexit would  affect Irish farmers and a concern for how \nthe EU would be financed after Brexit. Interestingly, these budge tary concerns \nappear both in Irish and UK coverage.  \nThe last aspect of the core -narrative warns about general problems with a Brexit, \nsuch as expat rights or the quality of life for Britons ;  \nA report by his committee also warns the rights of ex -pats to li ve in Europe or \nget free healthcare would be thrown into chaos (TS-2016 -10).  \n                                                   \n37 See also: II -2018 -68 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  64 of 93 \n Or here, a variety of issues;   \nThe Labour leader urged the 9.3million who supported Labour at the last \nGeneral Election to vote to stay in Europe. He said: \u2018I believe we have to vote to \nremain to defend investment, to defend jobs, to defend the environment and to \ndefend workers' rights\u2019 (TS-2016 -13).  \nA Brexit is portrayed as also negatively affect ing the overseas territories of the UK, \nwhich can be seen here;   \nThe Falklands would  face a \u2018catastrophic\u2019 risk if Britain pulls out of the EU, the \nislands' leader has warned. Gavin Short fears the move would encourage \nArgentina to be much more aggressive in its sovereignty claims. And he said it \ncould also lose up to \u00a3120million worth of  fish, meat and farm trade with \nEurope (TS-2016 -58)38. \nAs we can see depicted here, the threat to the Falkland Islands is deemed not only \neconomical, but also territorial. This touches upon both the previously mentioned \nconcerns for how trade would suffer, but also how overall security for UK citizens \nwould suffer.  \nIn summary, this core -narrative , about the UK not benefitting  from Brexit , is \ncomprised of several trends.  First and foremost, the economic implications for the \nUK are a very large  focus , where pa rticularly trade with the EU is seen as vital to the \nUK economic health.  Then, there is a concern for the security of the UK. Both in \nterms of security against terrorism, but also, as seen in TS -2016 -58, a concern for the \nterritorial integrity of the UK. T hirdly, there is a trend towards portraying the EU as \na much -needed standard setter in terms of both fundamental rights and agricultural \nand trading standards.  Another argument for why the UK would be worse of is \nessentially made by arguing that other memb ers, particularly Ireland, would benefit \nfrom the problems that would arise for companies if the UK was not in the EU.  \nPerhaps this core -narrative is best described in the following statement,  \nThe European partnership has helped turn enemies into friends a nd made us \nall better off  (TS-2016 -52). \n                                                   \n38 See also: TS -2016 -21, TS -2016 -62, TS-2016 -70, TS-2016 -77, TS-2016 -107, II-2016 -05, II-2016 -21 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  65 of 93 \n These overall trends and tendencies can be found in both  the British and Irish news \nmedia coverage in the year s 2016 and 2018. A large reason for this is very likely the \nimminent Brexit -referendum and the heightened focus on the pros and cons to EU \nmembership at that time.  The EU is consistently portrayed positively in this core -\nnarrative, being a beneficial influence on the UK\u2019s economy and security. At the same \ntime, we can clearly see that the phenomenon of Brexit,  and by extension its \nproponents, are characterised as unreliable and risky.  \n6.5.2  The UK will benefit from Brexit  \nAs opposed to the previous core -narrative, there is also the core -narrative that the \nUK will benefit from Brexit. This narrative consists of sever al aspects , one of the \nargument s posits that the EU is holding the UK back from achieving its full potential. \nEssentially, this  means that if the UK leaves the EU , the UK will be able to live up to \nits potential and gain much from the Brexit.  These gains c ould,  for instance , be in \nterms of econom ic potential, as  can be seen in these two examples;  \nTheresa May must summon every ounce of courage today and make the right \nchoice for Britain. More than a year ago she set out her admirable vision for \nBrexit. We would retake control of immigration, our laws and our money. And, \ncrucially, we would be comple tely free to trade independently beyond the EU's \nborders. She called that \u2018the great prize for this country - to build a truly Global \nBritain, a great trading nation\u2019 (TS-2018 -62). \nFree trade outside the EU is here seen  to be portrayed  as the ultimate libe ration of \nUK potential. The argument is depicted as being: without the constraints of the EU, \nthe UK would be able to, once again, become a world leading trading power in its \nown right. The statement above also refers to an aspect of autonomy, which if \u2018ta ken \nback\u2019 by the UK would lead to both better UK laws and economic upturns, a \nsentiment echoed in the following;  \nBoris Johnson said yesterday a Brexit would create almost 300,000 jobs \nbecause Britain could forge its own trade deals with countries outside t he EU \n(TS-2016 -07).39 \n                                                   \n39 See also: TS -2018 -66 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  66 of 93 \n The economy aspect is seen  depicted  here in terms of trade agreements , more \nbeneficial and easier to make with the UK being out of the EU. Therefor e, the EU \nholds the UK back since  the UK is not  allowed to make independent trade \nagreem ents with anyone whilst being a member of the Union, which does not allow \nthe full potential of the British  economy  unfold .  \nAnother economic benefit to Brexit is argued to be a lowering in prices of food and \ngoods in general , which can be seen here;  \nEU ta riffs also make food more expensive. Grocery bills could fall by up to 20 \nper cent once we leave the customs union, according to the Policy Exchange \nthink -tank. It is scandalous that four fifths of the tariffs on non -EU goods \nbought by UK shoppers go direc tly to Brussels (TS-2018 -72). \nThe argument  is portrayed  thusly:  EU rules and regulations make food more \nexpensive. Outside the EU, this would not happen , thereby lowering food prices. We \ncan also see the EU being portrayed as greedy, expressed in the idea that the majority \nof tariffs on UK food \u2018scandalously\u2019 go to the EU. Similar ideas are expressed in the \nfollowing statement;  \nUKIP leader Nigel Farage is planning to hijack Labour's cost -of-living \ncampaign. He will unveil its latest election posters directl y linking EU \nmembership to the price of grub and fuel. U KIP will claim food bills would be \n\u00a3400 cheaper if we ditched Brussels, while power bills would be \u00a3112 less. (TS-\n2014 -06)40 \nAgain, the view expressed is quite clearly that by exiting the EU, the UK wi ll be better \noff. Here, it seems to suggest that consumers can even save the, substantial , sum of \nover \u00a3500.  \nBoth of the above examples suggest that a UK outside the EU would be beneficial to \nordinary consumers, essentially putting more money in their poc kets.  \nA different aspect of this core -narrative argues that the UK would benefit from being \nfreed from EU bureaucracy. This is exemplified here ;  \n                                                   \n40 See also: TS-2018 -34 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  67 of 93 \n Mrs May was lobbying for a customs partnership solution where the UK \ncollects duty on behalf of the EU. Mr Jav id said the plan would hinder Brexit \nBritain trading around the world - to the delight of Brexiteers. (TS-2018 -48) \nWe see EU bureaucratic rules, such as a customs partnership, where the UK would \ncollect EU duties on behalf of the Union, presented as a hind rance to international \ntrade. This is also echoed in the following statement;  \nThe new power to trade globally, beyond the EU and unhindered by it, must be \na red line. It is the future ... a Brexit Leavers can live with (TS-2018 -63) 41 \nSimply put, the freedom to trade, without EU interference, is paramount to UK \nsuccess. Both of these statements see EU red -tape as a hindrance to UK trading, and \ntherefore as a hindrance to a powerful UK.  \nAnother aspect of the core -narrative is the argumen t that the EU needs the UK to \nsucceed, and therefore the UK has substantial leverage to gain the best possible \nterms for Brexit. This argument can be seen expressed here ; \nWe are warned an Out vote on June 23 will bring the roof  down on the entire \nEuropean Union and imperil civilised Western society as we know it. The \nfragile euro will implode, plunging the world into another catastrophic \nfinancial crash. Extremists will rise to power across the Continent, wrecking \nthe Grand Project and putting 70 years of p eace at risk. Conflict will break out \namong squabbling member states, stoked by malevolent Russian tyrant \nVladimir Putin (TS-2016 -105) .  \nWe see both security and economic consequences for the EU mentioned in this \nstatement. Essentially, even though the ton e is somewhat exaggerated, it depicts  \nareas where the UK provides necessary stability to the EU, without which it would \nsharply decline. Another example of the EU needing the UK to succeed can be seen \nhere;  \nA vote for Brexit could \u2018pull Europe apart\u2019 and risk the security of the entire \ncontinent, a former MI6 chief has warned.

He added: \u2018We need to make \nsure the centre is solid\u2019 (TS-2016 -55)42. \nThis example seems to portra y similar consequences of a Brexit. Were the UK to \nleave the EU, it would lead to  EU member states drift ing apart to a point where \nextreme  political left and right wing s would emerge in the EU , destabilising the \nUnion .  \nThe last aspect of this core narrati ve is concerned with the implications of migration \nif the UK does not leave the EU . Here the focus  is seen to be  on the need of the UK to \nleave the EU to gain control of its own borders;  \nMPs campaigning for Britain to leave the EU stressed the situation wi ll get \nworse as other countries, including Turkey, wait to join the EU (TS-2016 -99). \nAs we have seen previously in other themes, the fear that Turkey joins the EU and \nthat this would lead to a mass migration movement within the EU is portrayed  here \nas well . Therefore, the UK must leave the EU according to the argument. These \nmigration concerns are also mirrored here;  \nMore than 1.5  million EU nationals now working in Britain would not be \nallowed to do so if the UK votes for Brexit, a report claims. Seventy -five per \ncent of the 2.2  million EU citizens earning a living here fail to meet visa \nrequirements set for those from other parts of the world, a Migration \nObservatory study found  (TS-2016 -03)43. \nHere, we see the argument that millions of EU citizens that are in the UK because of \nEU rules, would not even qualify for visas if they were not EU citizens. This is a clear \nrejection of one of the core tenements of the EU project, the free movement of \npeople. Therefore, it also seems clear that the suggestion here is that the UK will be \nmuch better off in control of its own border, where only immigrants fulfilling visa \nrequirements would be allowed  through  immigration.  It portrays  the EU as an \nirresponsibl e entity, as well as EU citizens as a burden upon UK society.  \nOverall, this core -narrative is in many ways the polar opposite of the previous core \nnarrative. Essentially, the base argument is that the UK will benefit tremendously \n                                                   \n42 See also: TS -2016 -30, TS -2016 -38, TS -2016 -76, TS-2016 -91, II-2016 -37 \n43 See also: TS -2016 -35, TS -2016 -80, TS -2016 -101 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  69 of 93 \n from a Brexit. This is clearly shown in the economic argument, which sees the UK \nboth gain large trading benefits, as well as generally better terms for the average \nconsumers outside the EU, essentially the UK is held back by the EU in these areas . \nAnother argument seems to be  concerned with the bureaucra tic constraints of  the EU \nsystem  and how this restrains the potential of the UK. This constraint is then argued \nto be an excellent reason  why the UK should leave the EU. There is also a portrayal of \nthe UK as a necessity to the E U, which is used to argue that the UK could therefore \nget very favourable relations with the EU when it leaves the Union. One of the often -\nrepeated  arguments regarding a benefit to Brexit is border control. Here, it is made \nclear that only outside the EU c an the UK really control immigration and that the EU \nhas only placed burdens on UK society in that regard. This is seen to be argued by \npointing out that most of the current EU residents in the UK would not be granted \nvisas, if they were not EU citizens.  This core -narrative about the UK benefitting  from \nBrexit is almost exclusively mentioned in the British news media coverage in the \nyears 2016 and 2018. Like  the previous  core -narrative, the narrative here should be \nseen in relation to the Brexit -referendum in 2016, and the run up to that, where most \nof the coverage is located. However, even after Brexit became a reality, we see \nproponents arguing for the reason why Brexit is the best route. This seems to suggest \nthe ambiguous status Brexit has in the UK, eve n today.  \n6.5.3  Thematic tendencies  \nWhat is immediately obvious within this theme is the binary relationship between \nthe two core -narratives. On one side, the core -narrative \u201cThe UK will not benefit \nfrom Brexit\u201d is clearly very concerned about the conse quences for the UK if it leaves \nthe EU. On the other side, the core -narrative \u201cThe UK will benefit from Brexit\u201d is \nobviously concerned with the consequences if the UK does not leave the EU. \nHowever, the second narrative has a mixed focus, both on the potential of the UK \nwhen it leaves the EU, but also a concern of the consequences of the EU\u2019s influence \non the UK, particularly in regard to  migration policy. Many of the worries and \nconcerns seemingly regarding the same issues in both narratives, with the notable \nexce ption of security and migration concerns, which only appear in the anti -Brexit \nand pro -Brexit narrative, respectively.  \nIt is interesting, that the narrative which sees Brexit as a bad thing for the UK is \nportrayed both in Irish and British news media cover age, whereas the narrative \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  70 of 93 \n about the UK benefitting  from Brexit is solely  portrayed in British news media \ncoverage. The EU is portrayed almost completely opposite in each core -narrative. I n \nthe narrative with the UK will not benefit from Brexit the EU is b eing portrayed as a \nhelper and a positive influence,  whereas EU is portrayed as a bad influence and \ndetrimental to the UK in the pro -Brexit narrative.  This seems to exemplify  the idea of \nconstituting  us, the UK,  as a part of the EU or seeing us, the UK, in opposition versus \nthem , the EU . \n6.6 The  state of Brexit negotiations  \nThe theme \u201c The state of Brexit negotiations\u201d includes core -narratives where the state \nof the negotiations between the UK and the EU are essential to the story. These core -\nnarrati ves focus on the entire process of the Brexit negotiations and appear from the \nperspective of different actors such as the UK wanting to leave  the EU  and the EU \nhaving responsibilities towards  its member states.   \n6.6.1  Betraying Brexit  \nThis core -narrative focus es on how the British Prime Minister , in this case Theresa \nMay,  has an obligation to the people in the UK  of \u2018delivering\u2019  on Brexit , in accordance \nto the  referendum results in 2016.  The expectations towards the PM and her \nnegotiations of Brexit are clearly  seen here ; \nTheresa May says today she is \u2018absolutely determined\u2019 to leave the EU customs \nunion and the single market. It's good to hear you say it Prime Minister. We \nintend to keep you to your word. The evidence at the moment is that she is \ntrying to forc e through a fudge on the customs union which would make the \nnotion of taking back control meaningless (TS-2018 -60). \nThe delivery of a \u2018good\u2019 Brexit, i.e. one that is not \u2018fudged\u2019, is here presented as \nsomething very important.  The statement seeks to persua de the reader that  Theresa \nMay, up until that point, has not done a good job of Brexit, essentially not delivering \nwhat was promised of the referendum. This feeling of not living up to a, arguably \nvague, promise is also reflected here,  \nBrexiteers hailed B oris Johnson as they told Theresa May to dump her customs \nplan with the EU. They lauded the Foreign Secretary for ripping into the PM's \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  71 of 93 \n preferred approach of a post -Brexit customs partnership. Mr Johnson said it \nwas \u2018crazy\u2019, \u2018totally untried\u2019 and would bet ray the Brexit vote (TS-2018 -59)44. \nWe see the idea of betraying  Brexit is closely linked to the idea that anything short of \nleaving the EU completely seems to go against the spirit of the Brexit -referendum.  \nWe also see a prominent proponent of Brexit, Boris Johnson , state  this perceived \nobligation to not make a custom partnership with the EU since that would be a \nbetrayal of the Brexit referendum.  \nThis core -narrative occurs specifically in UK coverage, only in 2018. The potential \nnon-delivery of Brexit  is presented as concerning for the UK.   \nThe next core -narrative is taking the opposite point of view where the focus is on how \nTheresa May is delivering on Brexit.  \n6.6.2  Delivering on Brexit  \nThis core -narrative revolves around the argument that  Prime Minister T heresa May \nis trying to deliver , or getting , the best possible deal for the British whilst honouring \nthe outcome of the referendum.  This can be seen here;  \nThe prime minister agreed a fall -back Irish Border deal with the EU last \nDecember, hailed as \u2018bullet -proof\u2019 and \u2018cast -iron\u2019 by Taoiseach  [Irish prime -\nminister]  Leo Varadkar and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney  (II-2018 -\n31). \nAnd,  \nTheresa May last night moved to unite her Cabinet behind her Brexit plan and \ntold the wider public: \u2018Trust me to deliver. \u2019 The PM said it was her \u2018mission\u2019 to \ntake back control of laws, money and borders (TS-2018 -36)45. \nIt is here seen how Theresa May is presented to be concerned with the issues of \ntaking back control with the borders, laws and money. This should be seen in the \ncontext of trying to deliver on the spirit  of the  referendum . We see these same issues \nthroughout Brexit coverage, and therefore, it must be assumed that this is Theresa \nMay\u2019s idea  of what is possible and best . The custom s partnership should be seen as  \n                                                   \n44 See also: TS -2018 -04, TS -2018 -05, TS -2018 -09, TS-2018 -10, TS-2018 -31, TS-2018 -35, TS-2018 -64, \nTS-2018 -68, TS-2018 -75 \n45 See also: TS -2018 -02, TS -2018 -12, TS -2018 -26, TS-2018 -46, TS-2018 -55, TS-2018 -63II -2018 -18 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  72 of 93 \n the best outcome thinkable from May\u2019s point of view, where she also seems to have \nthe backing of Irish politicians.  This is particularly important since the issue of the \nIrish border has wide historical implications for the UK . The Northern Ireland - \nIrela nd conflict was  only solved due to the open border between Ireland and the UK. \nHaving this openness threatened is potentially the biggest issue in the Brexit debate  \n(Chatzky, 2019) .  \nComparing these two core -narratives, there seems to be a disconnect between how \nThe Sun presents its perception of  this custom s partnership and what Theresa May \nthinks of it.  The difference in opinion on the customs partnership could be argued to \nbe one of split loyalties for the PM. On one h and, she wishes to honour the will of the \npeople (i.e. Brexit), but on the other  she has an obligation as the PM to make the best \npossible deal for the country , even if that means compromising on some of the terms . \nInterestingly, there seems to be a differ ence in tone from the PM, depending on \nwhether she speaks of Brexit in general, where the motto of taking back control  is \ninvoke d, \nIn an apparent bid to placate hard -line Brexiteers, she also said she would \ndeliver on taking back control of the UK\u2019s border s, money and laws  (II-2018 -\n19)46. \n or whether she speaks of her Brexit -deal, in which case her tone seems more \nconciliatory towards the EU ,  \nShe was lobbying for a customs partnership47 where the UK collects duty on \nbehalf of the EU (TS-2018 -26) \nThe next core -narrative does not take the  point of view of the  UK, like these two core -\nnarratives ha ve. Instead it portrays UK as being unreasonable in its negotiations with \nthe EU . \n6.6.3  The UK is being unreasonable  \nThis core -narrative is concerned with how the UK believes it can ch erry-pick parts of \nthe EU cooperation they want to be a part of and  leave out the things that the country \n                                                   \n46 See also: TS-2018 -36, TS-2018 -46 \n47 The customs partnership is seen as a \u2018softer\u2019 Brexit, favoured by the EU.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  73 of 93 \n does not want to be a part of. This  is portrayed as unreasonable by EU officials , and \nsome member states , which can be seen here;  \nSo, just to make this clear, one year and 43 weeks after the Brexit vote, your UK \ngovernment still can't decide between two alternative plans - BOTH of which \nhave already been rejected by the EU. Just to make this even clearer, whic hever \nplan they decide on, we already know that the man from Brussels says \u2018No\u2019 (TS-\n2018 -25). \nIn this quote it can be seen how the UK is being unrealistic , due to trying to pass  an \nagreement in the UK parliament that lawmakers already know has been rejecte d by \nthe EU. At the same time, we see puzzlement related to the inability by the British \nParliament to agree on any deal whatsoever. The same puzzlement, or consternation, \ncan be seen in the following;  \nThe T\u00e1naiste  [Irish deputy prime -minister]  pointed to the impossible scenario \nwhere the UK believes it can stay outside the customs union and single market \nand expect the EU and Ireland to evade long -established rules of the single \nmarket - most of which Britain was instrumental in creating - in order to \nsatisfy misguided Brexiteers' fantasies.  \u2018The British government has red lines \nall over the place and expects the EU to accommodate them. We have red lines, \nso does the EU, but nobody seems to focus on that,\u2019 Mr Coveney said (II-2018 -\n11)48. \nThis quote focusses on the same aspects of the UK wanting to be a part of some areas \nof the EU cooperation and leave out others. This is something that cannot be \ntolerated by the Ireland , or the EU, which is responsible for all its member states \ninterests. We also see that th e Irish deputy prime minister characterises Brexit \nproponents as misguided , at the same time pointing to the red lines  of the UK\u2019s PM \nas part of the problem.  \nThis core -narrative expresses a concern for the border between Ireland and Northern \nIreland , whic h can be seen in this quote;  \nT\u00e1naiste Simon Coveney has warned the divided British government that \nIreland won't be flexible on the outcome of the post -Brexit Irish Border, saying \n                                                   \n48 See also: II -2018 -12, II -2018-22, II-2018 -32 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  74 of 93 \n there is no technical solution to avoid a hard Border. Mr Coveney was speaki ng \nas the British cabinet remained split on how to avoid a hard Border in Ireland. \nOne senior minister, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, cast fresh doubt on \nthe viability of Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed post -Brexit customs \npartnership with the EU, saying it had \u2018flaws\u2019. He said there were \u2018significant \nquestion marks\u2019 about whether the model was deliverable (II-2018 -19). \nHere, we again see this fear of what will happen to the British -Irish border in case of \na Brexit. During the negotiations, diff erent scenarios  have all revolved around this \nquestion. Northern Ireland , as a part of the UK , is leaving the EU which leads to a \nneed for a border, invalidating the core values of the EU project, as well as the \nagreement between Ireland and the UK  (Campbell, 2019) .  \nIt is exemplified in statements such as ; \nAs the lead negotiator for the EU 27, Mr Barnier has - and continues to have - \nalmost complete support from every Irish stakeholder in Brexit, including \ncrossparty rec ognition, as well as from business and civil liberties groups. \nTheir presence reflected this (II -2018 -11) 49. \nReflecting complete confidence of Ireland in the EU -negotiator. This suggests that \nthe EU and Ireland are aligned, whereas the UK is indirectly pr esented as outside \nthis alignment.  \nThe last core -narrative in this theme is concerned with how  the EU is perceived to \ntreat the UK poorly  in the process of these negotiations .  \n6.6.4  The EU treats the UK poorly  \nThis core -narrative , about the EU treat ing the UK p oorly , revolves around  how the \nEU no longer cooperates with the  UK, in relation to the Brexit negotiations . This lack \nof cooperation here, where the EU, and Ireland, are accused of wanting a hard border \non the Irish -UK border ;  \nIn a report published this w eek, Trimble went on to accuse Michel Barnier, the \nEU's lead negotiator in the Brexit talks, of \u2018reckless intransigence\u2019. The former \n                                                   \n49 See also: II-2018 -22 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  75 of 93 \n leader of the Ulster Unionist Party claimed that it was Ireland and the EU, not \nthe UK, which would cause a hard Border on this island (II-2018 -64)50. \nHere , we see  how the blame is placed on the  EU and Ireland rather than the UK \nwhen it comes to the agreement to prevent a border between Northern Ireland and \nIreland. Essentially, the UK accuses the EU of explicitly wanting a hard border, \nrather than it being a natural effect of not being inside the EU anymore. The EU, and \nIreland, are portrayed as provocateurs willing to orchestrate confrontation with the \nUK to promote  their own goals. Clearly, we see both the EU and Ireland constituted \nas something opposite the UK. This supports the idea, here shown through the quote \nof a former Northern Irish politician, of the EU not acting in good faith and treating \nthe UK poorly. A nother  instance of a lack willingness to cooperat e on the side of the \nEU is shown in the following example, where the focus is on EU policy ; \nThe PM will today launch Britain's own space programme after Eurocrats \nsecretly tried to ground the country after B rexit. Theresa May is tasking \naerospace experts to work on a satellite -operated navigation system. Brussels \nnegotiators are refusing to allow the UK to participate fully in the EU's Galileo \nsatellite programme, which has a key military role. Some member st ates want \na deal with Britain because it is a major defence ally. But The Sun can reveal \nEU officials are withholding a negotiating document which could lead to a \ncompromise. No10 insists a UK system would cost little more than the \ncontributions to Galileo  (TS-2018 -58). \nVery clearly, it is presented here  as if the EU is acting against the UK,  by withholding \nimportant documents,  keeping it out of an EU satellite program based on the UK\u2019s \nwish to leave the EU. Here, it is presented as if the EU secretively tr ies to prevent the \njoining of the  UK, which due to the key military role  might have security \nimplications for the UK. This seems to suggest not only that the EU treats the UK \npoorly, but even that the EU acts with the intent of keeping the UK on the outsid e. \nInterestingly, this core -narrative appears both in Ireland and the UK. However, \nwhereas the UK coverage seems to take the side of the UK, Irish coverage seems to \nuse UK politicians to present  this argument, rather than taking a stance of its own . \n                                                   \n50 See also: II-2018 -29 \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  76 of 93 \n The na rrative only appears in 2018, presumably due to the more concrete concerns \nand issues that appeared during that part of the negotiations.  \n6.6.5  Thematic tendencies  \nIn this theme , we see two sets of binary core -narratives.  On one hand, we see the \nportrayal of th e British PM not delivering the Brexit she has promised, on the other \nwe see a narrative that purports her delivering the best Brexit she can. We also see a \nportrayal of the UK as being a hindrance to the progression of negotiations, as well as \nseeing the opposite view, where the EU and Ireland are accused of slowing down the \nnegotiations. Interestingly, the first two core -narratives seem less concerned with the \nrelationship between the EU and the UK, rather focussing on the internal \nmachination of UK polit ics. Having said that, we see that the EU is often used as an \nindirect actor, portrayed as obstinate and hindering. This portrayal is also seen in the \ncore -narrative The EU treats the UK poorly , where we see the EU portrayed as a bad \nfaith actor. On the ot her side, there is a similar portrayal in the core -narrative The \nUK is being unreasonable , expect with reversed roles. It is worth noting that the \nportrayal of the UK being unreasonable relies heavily on the inability of British \nParliament to agree on a un ified policy, rather than suggesting the UK is a malicious \nactor.  \n \n7.0 Narrative comparison  \nThe following section explores the relationship between the twenty -one core -\nnarratives found in the previous thematic analysis. Here, we present the analytical \nfindings  and show the relationship between our core -narratives and their presence in \nthe UK and Ireland, as well as the constitution of us vs. them  and how the EU is \nportrayed, respectively.  Following this, we examine the core -narratives occurrence in \nthe time fra me51. \nIn the first table, the division of the different narratives across The Sun  and the Irish \nIndependent can be seen. We decided to split the narratives into three groups, \n                                                   \n51 All the raw tables can be found in Appendix B  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  77 of 93 \n depending on their frequency of occurrence . This was primarily done to provide an \noverview of the narrative\u2019s relative frequency  to each other. Through this, we are able \ncompare the narratives whilst being aware of the limitations due to the difference in \nsize. Our sizes where defined as such;  \n\u2022 Major core -narratives consist of 16+ codes  \n\u2022 Medium  core -narratives consist of  10-15 codes  \n\u2022 Minor  core -narratives consist of  0-9 codes  \nThis gave us the following spread; 7 major narratives, 6 medium narratives, 8 minor \nnarratives.  \nTable 8 - Narrative size and presence  \nCore -narrative  Major  Medium  Minor  Presen ce in  \nThe Sun  Presen ce in \nIrish \nIndependent  \nThe EU uses its values to \nstabilise international \npolitics    X 14.29%  85.71%  \nMigration issues are solved \nby the EU    X 0% 100%  \nThe EU stands up for itself    X 20%  80%  \nThe EU institutions govern \nin their own rights   X  7.69%  92.31%  \nConsumers are protected by \nthe EU   X  27.27%  72.73%  \nThe EU acts as a standard \nsetter  X   30.77%  69.23%  \nWe are part of the EU   X  0% 100%  \nWe benefit from EU funded \ndevelopment    X 0% 100%  \nThe EU acts in bad faith \nbecause of migration    X 100%  0% \nThe EU is the cause of \nmigration problems  X   94.12%  5.88%  \nThe EU intrudes on national \npolicy  X   86.36%  13.64%  \nThe EU prioritises wrongly   X  35.71%  64.29%  \nThe EU is taking autonomy \naway from members   X  41.67%  58.33%  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  78 of 93 \n Our national politicians \nlack credibility  X   100%  0% \nThe European politicians \nlack credibility    X 83.33%  16.67%  \nThe UK will not benefit \nfrom Brexit  X   61.67%  38.33%  \nThe UK will benefit from \nBrexit  X   93.88%  6.12%  \nBetraying Brexit  X   100%  0% \nDelivering on Brexit   X  81.82%  18.18%  \nThe UK is being \nunreasonable    X 12.5%  87.5%  \nThe EU treats the UK poorly    X 50%  50%  \n \nAt a glance, it is quite evident that some narratives were  much more heavily present \nin one coverage over another. There were 6 completely unique narratives, only \nappearing in either The Sun or the Irish Independent . There were  11 narratives found \nmore frequently in the Irish Independent , whereas 9 are found more  frequently in \nThe Sun . One  narrative can be found exactly 50/50 in both newspapers.  \nOf the major narratives, 6 out of 7 of these were more heavily present in The Sun . \nThe other narrative, The EU acts as a standard setter , was also almost 40 percent \npresen t in the UK, whilst being 60 percent present in Ireland. Interestingly,  most of \nthe major narratives portray the EU negatively. Additionally, at least half of these \nnarratives also relate to Brexit in some shape or form.   \nOf the six medium narratives, 4 ou t of 6 were  more heavily present in Irish coverage, \nThe EU is taking autonomy away from members was split almost evenly and  \nDelivering on Brexit was almost exclusively to be found in the UK.  As opposed to the \nmajor narratives, there does not seem to be eit her a UK or Irish bias.  \nLooking at the eight minor narratives, 5 out of 8 were  heavily or exclusively found in \nIreland. The EU treats the UK poorly is present in both countries, albeit with \nseemingly different presentations  (see section 6.6.4) . The European politicians lack \ncredibility  was only to be found in The Sun , whereas Our national politicians lack \ncredibility  also c ould  be found, to a smaller extent, in the Irish Independent . As we \nhave previously seen, these two narratives are very similar i n their composition.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  79 of 93 \n Overall, if we compare these numbers with the original number of narratives found \nin either newspaper (see section 5.2), we can see that even though there is a higher \nfrequency of narratives found in The Sun , there are less, but more major, core -\nnarratives to be found in the newspaper. This paints a picture of more frequent major \ncore -narratives in The Sun  but more diverse core -narratives in the Irish \nIndependent .  \nIn the following table, the characterisation  of the EU in the different narratives can \nbe seen. Additionally, the table also provides an overview of how the relationship \nbetween the EU and the other actors in each narrative is.  \nTable 9 - Constitutionalising and characterising  of EU  \nCore -narrative  Us   Them  How is EU characterised?  \nTheme - The EU as an international player  \nThe EU uses its values to \nstabilise international \npolitics  73.33%  26.67%  Stabilising presence, defender of \nvalues  \nMigration issues are \nsolved by the EU  100%  0% Using values to regulate flow of \nmigration  \nThe EU stands up for \nitself  66.67%  33.33%  Finally s tanding up fo r core \nvalues, direct opposition to U.S.  \nTheme - EU governance  \nThe EU institutions \ngovern in their own \nrights  100%  0% Legitimate actor, institutions seen \nas just and legitimate also when \nprompting national governments \nto respond  \nConsumers are protected \nby the EU  100%  0% EC is strong protector of \nconsumers  \nThe EU acts as a \nstandard setter  76.27%  23.73%  Positive presence on regulation, \nseen as force of good influence , \nsome scepticism  \nWe are part of the EU  100%  0% Inclusive club, positive  \nWe benefit from EU \nfunded development  100%  0% Provides positive growth \nopportunities  \nThe EU acts in bad faith \nbecause of migration  0% 100%  Lying, failing, bad faith actor  \nTheme - Criticism of EU policy  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  80 of 93 \n The EU is the cause of \nmigration problems  8.41%  91.59%  Not able to regulate EU -migration, \nfailing member states, weak on \nexternal border control  \nThe EU intrudes on \nnational policy  8.57%  91.43%  Restricting national governments, \nmeddling in internal affairs, \n\u2018heavy -handed\u2019, abusing position \nto bias citizens  \nThe EU prioritises \nwrongly  80.33%  19.67%  Members do not think of EU wide \ninterests  \nThe EU is taking \nautonomy away from \nmembers  0% 100%  Power  hungry, eroding national \nsovereignty  \nTheme - Political alienation  \nOur national politicians \nlack credibility  7.64%  92.36%  Seen as puppet -master, national \npoliticians seen as not credible if \non the side of the EU  \nThe European politicians \nlack credibility  0% 100%  Lacking credibility to convince \nvoters, does not live up to \npromises, EU politicians seen as \ngreedy  \nTheme - Outcomes of Brexit  \nThe UK will not benefit \nfrom Brexit  80.97%  19.03%  Provides safe growth, seen as \nstable, important for security, very \nimportant for trade  \nThe UK will benefit from \nBrexit  9.73%  90.27%  Holding back the UK, bad for \nbusiness, greedy, overgrown \nbureaucracy  \nTheme - The state of Brexit negotiations  \nBetraying Brexit  0% 100%  Seen as other, only working in \nself-interest  \nDelivering on Brexit  0% 100%  EU does not allow UK to exercise \nsovereignty  \nThe UK is being \nunreasonable  9.12%  90.88%  Reasonable, protecting Ireland \nand other members  \nThe EU treats the UK \npoorly  0% 100%  Unreasonable, disrespectful \ntowards UK, bad faith act ing \n \nIn the table above, the narratives are arranged according to their themes. This \nprovides an easier overview, as well as allowing us to compare the different \nnarratives across themes more easily.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  81 of 93 \n Looking at the theme The EU as an international player , we can see the three core -\nnarratives decisively constituting the EU as us. This is particularly obvious in \nMigration issues are solved by the EU . This minor narrative (see previous table), is \npresent explicitly in Ireland. Coupled with the characterisation of the EU as a \npositive value -based actor, we see a beginning correlation between constituting the \nEU as us and positive characterisation of the EU as an actor.  This correlation is also \nfound in The EU uses its values to stabilise internat ional politics , where three -\nquarters of the characterisation of the EU fall within the us category.  \nIn the theme EU governance , there is a clear tendency for the narratives to portray \nthe EU as us. This is most clearly seen in the narratives The EU instit utions govern \nin their own rights , Consumers are protected by the EU , and We benefit from EU \nfunded development . Common for all of these is also their positive characterisation \nof the EU. Additionally, these narratives all are either predominantly or exclu sively \npresent in Irish coverage. The major narrative of The EU acts as a standard setter  is \npresent both in Irish Independent  and The Sun . In this narrative we can see a \ndifferentiated portrayal of the EU, where three -quarter of the coverage portrays the \nEU as us. Here too, we can see a correlation between positive characterisation and \nthe constitution of EU as us. The one narrative, The EU acts in bad faith because of \nmigration , which characterises the EU as a negative actor and a part of them, is \npresent  only in The Sun . \nThe theme Criticism of EU policy , we see a clear trend of portraying the EU \nnegatively. In three out of four narratives, The EU is the cause of migration \nproblems , The EU intrudes on national policy , The EU is taking autonomy away \nfrom me mbers , the portrayal of the EU is almost exclusively as an other/them . The \nfirst two narratives mentioned here are both major narratives, occurring almost \nsolely in The Sun  coverage. Here, the EU is characterised as a weak and failing entity, \nholding back members with heavy -handed regulations . In this theme, we see \nevidence of a correlation between characteristics and portrayal in narratives \nprimarily occurring in the UK. Th roughout it can be observed how the EU is \nprimarily constituted as a them  and characterised negatively in The Sun  coverage. In \nthe narrative The EU is taking autonomy away from members , we can see an \nexclusive portrayal of the EU as them . Interestingly, th is narrative occurs more in \nIreland (58.33%) than in the UK (41.67%).  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  82 of 93 \n Political alienation  is a theme where the portrayal of the EU is almost exclusively as \nthem . As seen in the table above, the EU is characterised in both narratives, Our \nnational politici ans lack credibility and The European politicians lack credibility , as \na negative influence and conductive to greedy behaviour. These two narratives are \ndominated by personal attacks on politicians and their credibility, calling politicians \narrogant  and o ut of touch , as well as attacking the House of Lords as undemocratic. \nAll in all, these narratives show some of the most forceful language in the entire data \nset.  \nThe theme Outcomes of Brexit  has two opposing narratives. On one hand, The UK \nwill not benefi t from Brexit  primarily portrays the EU as us, characterising it as a \nprovider of stability, safety and growth. On the other hand, The UK will benefit from \nBrexit  overwhelmingly portrays the EU as them , characterising it as greedy, \novergrown bureaucracy ho lding back the UK. Although both of these major \nnarratives are primarily present in the UK, we can see that The UK will not benefit \nfrom Brexit also occurs quite a lot in Ireland (38.33%). Interestingly, if we look at \nThe UK will benefit from Brexit , we ca n see 6.12% of occurrences in Ireland. Here, it \nis important to point out, as we discussed in the thematic analysis, the Irish coverage \nessentially uses UK politicians to showcase this narrative, without endorsing it \nthemselves.  \nThe state of Brexit negotia tions  portrays the EU almost completely as them . Both the \nnarratives of Betraying Brexit , Delivering on Brexit , and The EU treats the UK \npoorly exclusively portray the EU as them . Here, the characterisation of the EU is as \na negative, disrespectful actors that works only in self -interest. These narratives \noccur primarily in the UK.  \nGenerally, we see a correlation between the constitution of the EU as either us or \nthem  and the cov erage in either the Irish Independent  or The Sun . In the Irish \nIndependent , a majority of narratives constitute the EU as us, whereas the opposite \nis true for The Sun . Here, the majority of narratives constitute the EU as them . There \nalso seems to be a cor relation between us and them  and whether the EU is \nconsidered a positive or a negative actor. In most narratives where the EU is \nconstituted as us, it is characterised positively, whereas most narratives constituting \nthe EU as them  characterise the EU as a  negative actor.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  83 of 93 \n In th e following table , we examine the occurrence of narratives across the different \ntime . To this end, the break -down of narratives across the time frames is shown \nbelow:   \nTable 10 - Spread of narratives over time  \nCore -narrative  The Sun  Irish \nIndependent  Total  \n2014  2016  2018  2014  2016  2018  \nThe EU uses its values to stabilise \ninternational politics  - 1 - 1 1 4 7 \nMigration issues are solved by the EU  - - - - 5 - 5 \nThe EU stands up for itself  - - 1 - - 4 5 \nThe EU institutions govern in their own \nrights  - - 1 2 8 2 13 \nConsumers are protected by the EU  1 2 - 3 2 3 11 \nThe EU acts as a standard setter  1 6 1 10 3 5 26 \nWe are part of the EU  - - - 6 4 5 15 \nWe benefit from EU funded development  - - - 3 2 2 7 \nThe EU acts in bad faith because of \nmigration  - 1 - - - - 1 \nThe EU is the cause of migration problems  6 26 - - 2 - 34 \nThe EU intrudes on national policy  2 15 2 1 2 - 22 \nThe EU prioritises wrongly  - 4 1 3 2 4 14 \nThe EU is taking autonomy away from \nmembers  - 4 1 5 1 1 12 \nOur national politicians lack credibility  1 16 12 - - - 29 \nThe European politicians lack credibility  - 5 - - 1 - 6 \nThe UK will not benefit from Brexit  - 29 8 - 10 13 60 \nThe UK will benefit from Brexit  3 24 19 - 2 1 49 \nBetraying Brexit  - - 17 - - - 17 \nDelivering on Brexit  1 - 8 - - 2 11 \nThe UK is being unreasonable  - - 1 - - 7 8 \nThe EU treats the UK poorly  - - 4 - - 4 8 \nTotal  15 133 76 34 45 57 36052 \n \nAt a glance, it is evident that some narratives are much more heavily represented at \ncertain times than others. This is particularly obvious when looking at narratives \n                                                   \n52 This number is comprised of narrative codes within our core -narratives, the difference between \ntotal coded narratives (440) and total codes within the core -narratives (360) is due to a high number \nof non -conforming narratives that do not create coherent c ore-narratives. These non -conforming \nnarratives nonetheless fall within our thematic categories.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  84 of 93 \n surrounding Brexit. If we are to look at the total numbers, we see roughly a nine -fold \nmultiplication of mentions of the EU in the UK between 2014 and 2016. We see some \nof this interest abate between 2016 and 2018, although it remains significantly higher \nthan in 2014.  \nIn the Irish coverage other trends can be seen. One of those trends is the relative \ncontinuance of EU narratives such as Consumers are protected by the EU  and We \nare part of the EU . We also see that the narrative The UK will not benefit from  Brexit \nis the largest of the Brexit related narratives to occur in Ireland. Interestingly, we \nalso see the emergence of Brexit negotiation related narratives in 2018.  \nThere are a number of narratives that stay almost exactly the same throughout the \nentir e time frame. Of these, most are to be found in Irish coverage where narratives \nsuch as Consumers are protected by the EU and We are part of the EU . An \ninteresting observation relates to coverage of the EU in The Sun , here we see that a \nnumber of these nar ratives do not stretch across the entire time frame, appearing \nand disappearing throughout the period. Thus, we see the enormous amount of \nBrexit coverage in 2016, which is somewhat smaller in 2018, as well as the \ndisappearance of migration as a large -scale issue between 2016 and 2018.  \nOverall, a very fluid landscape of narratives across the time frame emerges. Whilst \nsome narratives can be found across the time frame with similar frequency, most are \nonly to be found either in some parts of the time frame, or with very differing \nfrequency.  \n \n8.0 Discussion  \nIn this discussion, we re -examine some of the most important findings and how they \nrelate to each other. In a sense, it is a continuation of our analysis, where we explore \nthe trends of the core -narratives and see how they relate to each other across time \nand state boundaries . \nOverall, there are a surprising number of narratives that are uniquely present in \neither the UK or Ireland, at the same time, only very few narratives are evenly \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  85 of 93 \n present  (see section 7, Ta ble 8) . This suggests a very differentiated narrative \nlandscape, where the unique narratives are so specifically linked to their respective \nnation that there is no cross -pollination of narratives. At the same time, there are a \nfew narratives that do appear  (almost) evenly across both newspaper coverages. This \nseems to suggest that these narratives have a common theme that resonates across \nboth member states. Interestingly, these common narratives can  be quite different. \nFor instance, The EU is taking autono my away from members  occurs in both \nnewspapers, suggesting that  this is an issue recognised in both countries. It also \nshows that the EU is portrayed negatively when perceived to shift sovereignty from \nmember states to itself, regardless of the members sta tes\u2019 relationship with the EU. \nThere are also narratives such as The UK will not benefit from Brexit , which point \ntowards a shared concern for the future of the UK, albeit because of different \ninterests. The occurrence of this narrative in 2018 in both new spapers seems to \nsuggest a concern on both sides of the border about the future of the relationship \nbetween Northern Ireland (UK) and Ireland.  \nA further point of note is the occurrence of most major narratives primarily in The \nSun. 6 out of 7 major narrat ives are more frequently found in The Sun , whereas most \nof the minor narratives, 5 out of 8, are found more frequently in the Irish \nIndependent . Essentially, there are more frequent major core -narratives in The Sun  \nbut more total core -narratives in the Irish Independent . This suggest a more nuanced \nengagement with the EU in the Irish Independent , whereas The Sun  engages more \nwith certain core issues. This could be either due to a more differentiated view of the \nEU in Ireland, or conversely a narrower  view o f the EU in the UK. However, it could \nalso be due to the types of newspapers we compare in this project. As we established \nin section 4.4, tabloid newspapers are traditionally more concise in their coverage, \npossibly leading to less nuanced coverage of a t opic such as the EU . This also might \nmean that The Sun  focuses on fewer narratives that garner more interest from the \npublic. Hereby, these few narratives become more influential in their portrayal of the \nEU.  \nIf we look at tables 8 and 9 combined, we see a strong correlation between those \nnarratives  that are uniquely present in Ireland, and positive  portrayal s of the EU. \nThis is evident in narratives such as, Migration issues are solved by the EU  or We \nbenefit from EU funded development . Conversely, The Sun coverage portrays the EU \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  86 of 93 \n quite negatively in  its unique narratives , such as Our national politicians lack \ncredibility  and The EU acts in bad faith because of migration . It seems very clear \nthat there is a difference of how the EU is portrayed in The Su n and the Irish \nIndependent . As we have seen, the characterisation of the EU in UK coverage often \nfocuses on the EU as a negative entity, a them . Conversely, the Irish coverage is often \nseen to focus on the EU as a positive force, an us.  \nHowever, there ar e also outliers that do not support this correlation . In the analysis, \nwe saw that Irish coverage of the narrative , EU prioritises wrongly , we see  a \ndifferent portrayal and characterisation of the EU. Here, the EU is portrayed \nprimarily as us, even  though the overall characterisation of the EU is negative. \nAlthough, this characterisation was more focused on national politicians in member \nstates rather than the EU. The essential focus seems to be on the lack of EU wide \naspirations of the member states\u2019 polit ical leaders, suggesting that the EU itself is not \nnecessarily at fault. It could be argued that this correlation between portrayal and \ncharacteristic suggest a feeling of being part of the solution  on the part of the Irish \nIndependent , i.e. taking part in  changing the priorities of the EU from inside the \n\u2018club\u2019. This is also true the other way around. The narrative of The UK is \nunreasonable  portrays the EU as them , whilst having a positive characterisation of \nthe EU. The Irish coverage suggests that even t hough the EU is constituted as a them, \ni.e. not identical to Ireland, it protects Irish interests as a member of the Union.   \nIf we are to look at the total frequency of narratives spread across the time frame, we \nsee roughly a nine -fold multiplication of mentions of the EU in The Sun  from 2014 to \n2016. This is quite interesting in relation to our initial ideas about the coverage of \n2014. Here, we presumed that in a year, and month, with EU elections, we would find \na large proportion of narratives about the EU. It has become clear that  the question \nof Brexit has meant extraordinary growth in EU coverage. This is most likely due to \nthe continuance of the issues surrounding Brexit in the overall political landscape of \nthe UK.  \nThe occurrence of the narratives about political alienation, p rimarily in The Sun  in \n2016  and onwards, point towards a larger awareness of potential issues of credibility \nwith politicians coinciding with the Brexit -referendum. The composition of this \nnarrative, with both personal criticism of politicians, such as Dav id Cameron, and \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  87 of 93 \n criticism of democratic institutions, such as The House of Lords, point towards an \nunderlying unhappiness with several aspects of the political system.  \nAdditionally, we also see how the narratives about migration  (Migration issues are \nsolved by the EU , The EU is the cause of migration problems , and The EU acts in \nbad faith because of migration ) disappear in both The Sun  and the Irish \nIndependent  between 2016 and 2018.  This is quite interesting, as it suggests that \neither the concerns and is sues of migration have disappeared, or other narratives \nhave become more dominant in the discourse. At the same time, we see that the \nBrexit narratives have become much more prominent in 2016 and 2018, which seems \nto reflect the political realities in the UK, where Brexit continues to dominate the \npublic debate . We can see that the Brexit narratives swallow a lot of the themes of the \nother narratives between 2016 and 2018. By this, we refer to appearance of migration \nrelated discourse in Brexit narratives, such as Theresa May\u2019s promise to take back \ncontrol of laws, money and borders  (TS-2018 -36).  \nWhat has also become apparent is the binary structure of some core -narratives. For \ninstance, we can see this in theme of Outcomes of Brexit . Here, we essentially have \ntwo core -narratives that are diametrical opposites. These opposites draw on the same \nfacts to predict different outcomes, i.e. the fact that trading relationships will have to \nbe renegotiated is in The UK will not benefit from B rexit  portrayed as a disaster, \nwhile the core -narrative The UK will benefit from Brexit  sees this as an opportunity \nto negotiate improved  trade deals.  This is also observable in the theme The state of \nBrexit negotiation . There, we have two sets of binary n arratives. The narratives The \nUK is being unreasonable,  and The EU treats the UK poorly  also draw on some of \nthe same events, reaching diametrically opposed conclusions.  \nBetraying Brexit and Delivering on Brexit  show an interesting interaction  of two \ncore -narratives . We see that Theresa May respond to criticism, criticism that can also \nbe seen in Betraying Brexit . An example of this is the statement,  \nTheresa May says today she is \u2018absolutely determined\u2019 to leave the EU customs \nunion  [\u2026] at the moment [\u2026] she is trying to force through a fudge on the \ncustoms union [making]  the notion of taking back control meaningless (TS-\n2018 -60) \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  88 of 93 \n This shows the criticism levelled at Theresa May, and her response to it, which can \nalso be seen in she also said she would deliv er on taking back control of the UK\u2019s \nborders, money and laws  (II-2018 -19). This suggests that binary core -narratives can \ninteract and influence each other.  Here, it seems that one part of a core -narrative can \nreact and change in relation to the contents of a different core -narrative. We can also \nsee that some issues can be instrumentalised to tell different stories. Issues \nsurrounding migration are to be found both in the themes of EU governance , \nCriticism of EU policy,  and EU as an international player . In these cases, even \nthough the content of the narrative is migration, this is used to construct very \ndifferent narratives with different characterisations of the EU.  \nGenerally, we have seen a tendency of narratives along the lines of the EU as a \nnegative  actor and the EU as a positive actor  where the thematical focal point is the \nsame . Essentially, we can see this divide in our themes, e.g. EU governance and \nCriticism of EU policy , with both of these themes having a focal point of EU policies.  \nThis distin ction between positive and negative can be seen to be very closely \nconnected to the constitution of the EU as either us or them .  \nWe expected that choo sing 2014 a s a point of departure, right before the Eu ropean \nelections, there would be more inte nse coverage of the EU and  its institutions. \nInterestingly, there were no mention s in either newspaper about t he ongoing election \nprocess  at that time.  \n \n9.0 Conclusion  \nThrough the analysis of newspaper articles from The Sun (UK) and the Irish \nIndependent (Ireland), as representation  of EU member states, we have been able to \nidentify twenty -one core narratives used by these media companies when portraying \nthe EU. As previously mentioned, different types of news media might yield different \nnarrative structures. Therefore, we acknowledg e that the comparison of The Sun and \nthe Irish Independent does not represent an exhaustive comparison of the entire \nmedia landscape of these two countries.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  89 of 93 \n We saw that different narratives were constructed around diverse themes in both \nmember states. Som e of these narratives were found to be in both the UK and \nIreland, such as The EU is taking autonomy away from members  and The EU acts \nas a standard setter , whilst other narratives were unique to either member, such as \nOur national politicians lack credibi lity in the UK and We benefit from EU funded \ndevelopment  in Ireland. We also saw that the characterisation of the EU varied \nbetween these different narratives. We found that UK coverage often focused on the \nEU as a negative entity, while Irish coverage oft en focused on the EU as a positive \nentity.  \nThe distribution of narratives changed over time, with several  issues that rose to \nprominence and others that disappeared completely. This was exemplified in regard \nto Brexit. Narratives about Brexit rose from no n-existence in 2014, to extreme \nprominence in both 2016 and 2018. Brexit was the main issue with which the EU was \nengaged in UK coverage in 2016 and 2018. In Ireland, we saw fewer fluctuations in \nnarratives over time. At the same time, we saw a more divers e number of narratives \nrepresented in the Irish Independent . However, while The Sun  depicted fewer \nnarratives, these narratives appeared more frequently.  \nWithin these narratives, we identified and examined the relationship between \ndifferent narrative acto rs, specifically, how these actors constituted the EU and \nthemselves. Here, we found large differences in how the EU is portrayed in the Irish \nIndependent  versus The Sun . We found that coverage in The Sun was often critical of \nthe EU, constituting the EU a s an other . In the Irish Independent , we saw that \ncoverage tended to  portray the EU more favourably, often constituting the EU as an \nus. \nWe also saw that some narratives had close relationships. Some had binary structure \nwhere diametrically opposed narratives drew on the same facts to reach conclusions, \nparticularly seen in narratives about Brexit. We also observed narratives interacting, \nwith one narrative reacting to the development of the other. Further, we also saw \nthat even narratives might disa ppear, such as the migration narratives, the issues \ncould later be found in other narratives, such as ones regarding Brexit negotiations \nand outcomes. We also saw that some issues, such as migration, could be \ninstrumentalised in different narratives to tel l different stories.  \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  90 of 93 \n Our findings suggest a narrative landscape that in many ways is continuously \nevolving, nonetheless anchored in some parts around key subjects, which are \nreplicated repeatedly . It is a landscape divided by diverging portrayals of the EU , \nutilising diverse issues to tell different stories about the EU. By identifying these \nnarratives and characterising them, we have attempted to contribute towards an \noverall better point of departure when identifying narratives about the EU in news \nmedia.  \n \n10.0 Perspectives  \nLooking back at the project and its findings, several questions for further research \ncan be raised. Based on  the findings and given the limitations, it would be quite \ninteresting to map the entire media landscape in Ireland and the UK. This way, it \nwould be possible, with more certainty, to see exactly which narratives and their \nportrayal of the EU across a broa d spectrum of media. At the same time, it would be \ninteresting to see the development over time going back further, given that both \ncountries have a similar history with the EU.  This might help us understand why the \nrelationship between member states and t he EU can develop so differently, even \nthough they share so many similarities.  The extension of the time frame might also \nhave highlighted more recent changes in narratives, based on changing political \nrealities, such as Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal.  \nMapping the media landscape in all the EU members, or a larger part of them, would \nalso open new avenues of understanding the portrayal of the EU through narratives. \nThis would highlight regional differences and similarities in a way that has not been \npossible usi ng Ireland and the UK.  \nIn a similar vein, we saw that Brexit became a large focus in our narratives. \nTherefore, examining member states media with Brexit as the focal point would  \nprovide an opportunity to see how, or if, narratives regarding the EU have e volved in \ndifferent member states following what is, arguably, one of the largest challenges the \nEuropean Union has had to face.   \nLars Roesgaard  Culture, Communication and Globalisati on Aalborg University  \nThomas Vikner  Master Thesis  Summer 2019  \nPage  91 of 93 \n 11.0 References  \nBal, M.

At present, the dominant\napproach to fighting misinformation is to place the onus for do-\ning so on the large social platforms where many users spend their\ntime. This approach places a critical social decision in the hands\nof for-profit companies, and limits users\u2019 autonomy in deciding\nwho they trust to declare what is accurate [ 51]. It also does noth-\ning to combat misinformation that users encounter off the social\nplatforms, including the many news sites found on the web. The\ndownsides of centralized misinformation moderation have moti-\nvated some researchers and practitioners to pursue decentralized\nsolutions to the problem. For instance, Twitter Community Notes is\nan example of such an approach which involves all the users of the\ncommunity in assessing the accuracy of content and rating each\nother\u2019s assessments. However, the final decision of what notes to\neventually show to the public is taken in a centralized fashion, by\nTwitter\u2019s \u201cbridging algorithm\" [8].\nIn contrast, a body of work has advocated for giving users more\nautonomy while aiding them by providing the tools that they need\nfor discerning truth from falsehoods. For instance, it is reportedarXiv:2403.11485v1  [cs.HC]  18 Mar 2024\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\nthat enabling users to assess the accuracy of content can reduce\ntheir likelihood to share misinformation [ 49], as it nudges users\nto have accuracy on top of their mind [ 81,82]. If user assessments\nare captured as structured metadata, they can be displayed on\ncontent in structured form as well, similar to but separate from\nlikes or comments, and have the potential to warn the assessor\u2019s\nsocial circle should they encounter the misinforming content [ 51].\nJahanbakhsh et al. argue that users should additionally be given\nthe ability to specify whose assessments they would like to see\u2014in\nessence, leaving it to each user to decide who they trust as their\nmoderators. They report that even on the current platforms, users\ndo ask those they trust for their assessments; however, they do this\nwithout platform support, and in fact despite the platforms getting\nin their way. In a user study of a prototype social news sharing\nplatform that offers these affordances, the authors determine that\nusers want them and are capable of using them [ 51]. Capturing\nassessments and trust relationships in structured form can be a first\nstep in designing interventions that point users to fact-checking\ninformation from those that they trust.\nTo increase user autonomy, platform operators can be urged\nto incorporate the affordances of user generated assessments and\nspecified trusted sources. However, this incorporation is unlikely to\nhappen without activism or legislation, because changing the user\nexperience drastically, particularly ceding too much control over\ncontent to their users, can impact platform revenues. Researchers\ncould build a new social platform where they offer these affordances\nto users, for instance similar to the prototype platform presented by\nJahanbakhsh et al. [ 51]. But such undertaking realistically may not\nsucceed because first, it costs much development and maintenance\nfor this new platform to have a chance to compete with the existing\nsocial platforms; and second, users are unlikely to abandon their\nsocial network on the existing platforms and join a new one without\na critical mass of their connections already present there.\nWhile social media platforms have been an important outlet\nfor the circulation of misinformation, they are far from being the\nonly one [ 34]. Efforts concentrated on getting social platforms to\nmoderate content ignore that users consume content, by choice or\nby accident, outside these platforms as well. Users for instance, may\nencounter links to unverified or misinforming content on a news or\nmedia website that crosslinks to another, in an email newsletter, or\non a news aggregator. It is unrealistic to expect that every website or\nplatform on the web, some the very perpetrators of misinformation,\noffer content moderation and in a fair and rigorous way.\nThe pursuit for ubiquitous content moderation that preserves\nuser autonomy is the motivation behind this work. What follows\nis a case study of how enabling users to moderate content, specifi-\ncally in the context of misinformation, can be deployed everywhere\non the web , in a platform-agnostic manner and without support\nfrom the social platforms or individual web sites. We use the term\n\u201cmoderation\u201d as a concept that involves categorizing the status of\ncontent by applying labels, including those that are commonly used\nby platforms such as \u201cmisleading\" or \u201cexplicit\u201d as well as any other\nlabel that can help a user customize their web experience, such as\n\u201cdepressing\u201d. The other aspect of moderation is taking an action,\nif any, on content that has been positively or negatively labeled,\ne.g., whether to simply flag or remove it. These two aspects are\noften bundled together in the status-quo practices. In this work,we do not focus on the latter aspect and simply signal the status of\ncontent. If the categorization of content is customized according to\nusers\u2019 needs and input, then a set of tools can exist that take the\nlabels and act in different ways on them, or within the same tool,\nthe choice of what to do with the content can also be deferred to\nthe user [51].\nIn this work, we design, deploy, and evaluate a browser extension\nthat lets anyone assess any content\u2014news articles, Youtube videos,\ntweets, etc.\u2014 anywhere on the web, and lets each user independently\ndecide whose assessments they trust and want to use to help protect\nthem from misinformation. This tool is an extension of the Trustnet\nsocial platform previously offered by Jahanbakhsh et al. [ 51]. Upon\nvisiting a page, the user will see assessments of the content by\ntheir trusted sources, if any have contributed one, as shown in\nFigure 1. Such assessments can aid the user in deciding whether\nthe content they are viewing is credible. However, since links on\nsocial media are often not clicked, even when they are shared [ 35],\nshowing the assessments of a page only when a user visits the page\nwill not benefit those who do not navigate to the page. To address\nthis issue, the extension also places any available trusted accuracy\nassessments next to outgoing links on the page the user is reading,\nas displayed in Figures 2 & 3.\nTo evaluate the potential of such a design and users\u2019 perception\nof it, we conducted a user study of the extension. We recruited 32\nusers and to use the extension for two weeks. Users were tasked\nwith assessing the accuracy of two pieces of content daily. Users\nalso could, but were not required to, share content with the other\nusers via the extension. The shared content would be presented on\neach user\u2019s feed on the Trustnet platform instance that we asked\nthem to visit on a daily basis. We surveyed our users after the\nuser study to understand their fact-checking needs and desires and\ntheir perception of the tool. The user study serves as a technology\nprobe [ 45] where users can interact with a tool that empowers them\nto have an active role in moderating misinformation for themselves\nand others, without needing to drastically change where and how\nthey consume content. By offering the experience of a new alter-\nnative, our technology probe breaks our subjects free of the status\nquo, encouraging less constrained thinking about their needs and\ndesires for misinformation moderation.\nOur user study sets out to answer three main research questions:\nRQ1: What are the facets of users\u2019 information needs that a\ndemocratized misinformation moderation, made possible through\nour proposed tool, can address?;\nOur first research question aims to empirically demonstrate the\npotential for democratization of misinformation governance. In-\nvestigating the diversity of users\u2019 needs after their exposure to\nthe tool helps us understand whether centralized fact-checking\ncan sufficiently cover the breadth of user needs and desires, some\nof which users may be empowered to articulate after they real-\nize other forms of misinformation moderation may be possible.\nWe focus on multiple aspects of users\u2019 needs: how important they\nthink it is to avoid misinformation on various topics, how easy\nthey find it to fact-check content on various topics, whether they\nwant to see assessments from others, and whether they want to\ncontribute assessments for the benefit of others. We show that even\nin our small-scale study, the distribution of the types of content\npeople deem important to assess differs across individuals and from\nA Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation CHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nFigure 2: The extension places any available ac-\ncuracy assessments from the user\u2019s trusted or fol-\nlowed sources next to outgoing links on the page\nthe user is visiting.

The link is visually faded because it has\nbeen assessed as inaccurate.\nFigure 3: Outgoing links to a Youtube video on the page are displayed\nwith a checkmark icon (marked with blue arrows), indicating that the\nvideo has been assessed as accurate by the user\u2019s assessors.\nwhat is typically fact-checked by professional fact-checking initia-\ntives. Moreover, depending on the topic, users wished for including\nviewpoints and assessments from than professional fact-checkers\nalone\u2014e.g., journalists from other countries and immigrants on\nissues related to foreign affairs. These observations further bolster\nthe argument that there is a need for decentralized approach to\ncontent moderation.\nRQ2: What criteria for assessing content accuracy do users use\nwhen using our browser extension?\nExamining the rationales that users use in their assessments\nhelps us determine whether regular people can indeed assess con-\ntent effectively. By extending a taxonomy of such rationales with\nnew categories not previously reported in prior work, we contribute\nto the literature on user-centered indicators of content credibil-\nity [49,105]. Additionally, these rationales can be built into tools\nto capture users\u2019 assessments of content credibility in structured\nform.\nRQ3: How do users perceive a browser extension for in-situ\nsignaling and assessment of misinformation from their customized\nsources?\n\u2022RQ3a. What do they perceive as the advantages and down-\nsides of the approach?\n\u2022RQ3b. What are their ideas for improving it and how could\nthey be incentivized to use it?\nInvestigating these questions helps us determine whether users\nfind the tool of value to them and how it can be improved.\nThe main contributions of our work are: 1) the design of a sys-\ntem for democratized in-place signaling and assessment of misin-\nformation anywhere on the web which allows users to moderate\nmisinformation for themselves with the help of those they trust; 2)\na taxonomy of criteria for assessing content credibility not previ-\nously reported in prior work emerged from our study, which can\nbe used to extend the credibility indicators framework offered byprior work [ 49,105]; and 3) An empirical understanding of how\nusers use and perceive this system.\nThis tool provides users with the autonomy to moderate and fil-\nter misinformation in-situ anywhere on the web for themselves and\nto additionally help their social circle do so. We offer recommen-\ndations for extending the design and architecture behind this tool\nto domains beyond misinformation, and designing a class of tools\nthat further empower users to moderate content for themselves\nand choose who they want as their moderator.\n2 RELATED WORK\nThroughout the paper, we use the term \u201cmisinformation\u201d as an\numbrella term encompassing the various types of false informa-\ntion that can be found on the web per Zannettou et al., including\nfabricated stories, propaganda, conspiracy theories, hoaxes, biased\nor one-sided content, rumors, clickbait, and more [ 102]. Here, we\nsituate our work in the literature related to identifying and dealing\nwith misinformation, tools that allow for personalizing user\u2019s web\nexperience, and systems that aid in sensemaking.\n2.1 Identifying and Dealing with\nMisinformation\nGiven the impact that misinformation on social platforms has had\non people\u2019s lives and even democracy [ 11,16,21,96], researchers as\nwell as platform operators have been investigating and deploying\napproaches to detect and counter misinforming content. The space\nof these approaches is broadly contained within these two axes:\n\u2022Who gets to decide what is misinformation\n\u2022and whether the moderation decisions are contained within\na single platform/website or applied ubiquitously\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\nThe arbiters of misinformation can range from a central authority\nto a body of a trusted few to a democratized process e.g., through\nmajority votes from users to each individual.\n2.1.1 Centralization. The dominant approach is centralization of\nthe arbitration power\u2014in most cases to the platforms\u2014who decide\non both the detection of misinformation as well as the decision on\nhow to deal with the misinforming content. Centralized approaches\nto misinformation detection include using machine learning models\nfor classifying whether content is accurate [ 13,20,85,103], and\nleveraging human moderators and third party fact-checking and\nnews organizations [ 7,10]. Centralized approaches to dealing with\nmisinformation include displaying warning labels next to, down-\nranking, reduction (e.g., shadow-banning), or removal of the content\nor suspension of offender accounts [18, 24, 27, 38, 75, 77, 84].\nA body of work has investigated the effectiveness of these cen-\ntralized approaches. For instance, Bak-Coleman et al. show that con-\ntent removal and account banning can be effective at stopping the\ngrowth of misinformation [ 15]. Researchers have also reported that\nwarning labels can increase user discernment of content accuracy\nor reduce users\u2019 likelihood of sharing misinformation [ 17,92,101].\nOther studies however, found warning labels have limited or ad-\nverse effects [25, 36, 79].\nNevertheless, the role of platforms as moderators of content and\nspeech is contested by some researches, scholars of law, as well\nas users who believe the downsides of ceding such control to the\nplatforms can be grave. One such downside is that by assuming\nthe role of a truth arbiter, platforms can limit users\u2019 freedom of\nspeech and listening and their autonomy in deciding what con-\ntent to consume [ 41,51,60,89]. Related is the concern that even\nplatform-assigned labels or messages can be perceived as truth\ngovernance and a threat to freedom of speech [ 29,54]. In fact,\nsome users perceive platform labels as judgmental, paternalistic,\nand against the platform ethos [ 89]. Another concern is that any\ncentralized decision, by platforms or otherwise, to for instance,\ndown-rank or filter misinformation cannot address the needs of\nevery user, as some users want to be aware of what misinforming\ncontent their social circle is exposed to, so that they can talk to\nthem about it [ 14,51,69,86]. Yet another concern is that for these\ncentralized approaches to work, users have to rely on the trust-\nworthiness, goodwill, and competence of the moderators [ 66,71];\nhowever, some users consider platforms profit-driven and politi-\ncally biased [ 51,89]. These concerns are valid given the history of\nplatforms blocking content that arguably did not have potential\nto harm or content by activists or dissidents in certain autocratic\ncountries [5, 37, 47, 52, 90].\nWhile the centralized approaches mentioned above are gener-\nally contained within a single platform, some exist that have been\napplied ubiquotiously. These include classifiers to label clickbait or\nsensationalist headlines based on lexical features that were incor-\nporated into browser extensions that warn users when they view\nsuch a headline [23, 88].\n2.1.2 A Select Body of a Trusted Few. There exist approaches that\nput the power of arbitration in the hands of a trusted few (e.g.,\nfact-checkers or journalists). ClaimBuster is a system of this nature,\nwhich checks claims in live discourses, news, and social media\nposts against a repository of fact-checked claims [ 43]. Another isConsidertIt, a system for public dialog where participants discuss\npros and cons of issues, integrated an on-demand fact-checking into\nthe Living Voters Guide (LVG) deliberation space. Fact-checking\nwas staffed by librarians and any LVG user could request that\nany pro or con point submitted by other users be fact-checked.\nThe fact-checking information would then be placed in-situ [ 61].\nThe interactive fact-checking element in this system is similar to\nthe one in our tool. Another example is Videolyzer that enables\npolitical bloggers and journalists to assess aspects of quality in\nvideos including accuracy and bias [ 28]. Other systems have also\nbeen developed to help the body of the select few monitor and\nverify potentially critical content shared in social spaces [73].\nWhile these initiatives are valuable, their effectiveness can be\nlimited by being constrained to a platform and not incorporated\ninto the systems where users encounter content. This issue is coun-\ntered by tools such as NewsGuard, a browser extension that shows\ndetailed transparency and credibility scores given by journalists\nto various sources (i.e., websites) [ 64]. These scores are placed\nalongside links that users encounter as they browse the web. A\nshortcoming of displaying credibility ratings at the granularity of\na source is that not all content from an unreliable source is inac-\ncurate; and conversely, not all content from a reliable source is\naccurate [ 51]. However, for approaches that confine the power to\nassess credibility to a limited set of individuals, e.g. journalists, scal-\ning the investigation and signalling of the credibility at content-level\nwould be impractical. Even at the source-level, such an approach\nfails to capture the reliability of sources that are not notable enough.\n2.1.3 Democratization. Moving farther away from centralization\nof the arbitration power, a body of work has studied how to involve\nusers in the process of content moderation. Most notably, Twit-\nter Community Notes (previously known as Birdwatch) enables\nusers to anonymously write \u201cnotes\u201d critiquing or adding additional\ncontext to a tweet that they find misleading. Other community\nmembers can rate notes as helpful. Twitter\u2019s bridging algorithm\nthen decides which notes are eventually shown to users by inspect-\ning whether the raters seem to come from diverse perspectives [ 8].\nSubreddits and Facebook groups also have moderators from the\nuser body appointed to the role. In these cases however, the result-\ning decision is imposed on all users of the community, regardless\nof whether they agree with the outcome or the decision making\nprocess.\n2.1.4 Individualization. At the end of the centralization/ decentral-\nization axis lie approaches that do not impose a single assessment\nfor content on all users and instead enable each individual to make\nmore informed decisions about content credibility, e.g., by relying\nless on intuition and instead, engaging in critical thinking [ 74,83].\nThese include nudges that ask users to assess the accuracy of con-\ntent before sharing it [ 32,49], subtly priming users to have accuracy\non top of their mind [ 81,82], or providing users with checklists\nbased on recommendations from authoritative sources (e.g., the\nWHO) to guide users in evaluating content reliability for them-\nselves [ 44]. Jahanbakhsh et al. proposed a set of design affordances,\nthat they argue platforms should adopt, which democratize the\npower to not only determine what content is misinforming, but\nalso decide what to do about such content. These affordances in-\nclude enabling users to: 1) assess content as part of the data model 2)\nA Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation CHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nspecify whose assessments they consider trustworthy, and 3) filter\nmisinformation from their feed as assessed by their trusted sources.\nThese affordances are intended to empower users in their practices\naround fighting misinformation that the authors uncover through\na study\u2014 users already ask those who they trust within their social\ncircle to verify the information that they encounter. And they also\nprovide fact-checking information to their friends and family [ 51].\nIndeed, users are more receptive to correcting information from\ntheir friends than strangers [ 42,70]. However, platforms do not\nsupport these user practices and sometimes even undermine them.\nJahanbakhsh et al. provided these user affordances through a\nprototype social media platform that they designed [ 51]. However,\nit is unrealistic to expect that the myriad of websites and platforms\nwhere users consume content will adopt these affordances. There-\nfore, in this work, we explore using a browser extension that acts\nas an overlay on the web, and allows users to assess the accuracy\nof any content that they encounter across platforms, as well as see\nthe assessments of their trusted sources on the content. Our de-\nsign deals with operationalizing trusted assessments ubiquitously\nand in-situ including where they should be placed considering the\nparticulars of user\u2019s content consumption practices on the web;\ne.g., the fact that many users skim headlines and links to content,\nbut click on them only sporadically [19]. In addition, our architec-\nture broadens the coverage of content that can be assessed beyond\narticles.\nThere do exist other tools that both are individualized and whose\narbitration decisions are applied ubiquitously. One is the Rehead-\nline browser extension that enables users to suggest headlines they\ndeem better for news articles and specify whose suggested head-\nlines they want to see on the web [ 50]. Another is Dispute Finder,\na browser extension that highlights text snippets making disputed\nclaims and shows articles arguing for and against the claim. The\ndisputed claims in the system are restricted to those in certain fact-\nchecking websites such as Snopes and Politifact. With centralized\nfact-checking often lagging behind the spread of false claims [ 93],\nthe effectiveness of this tool can be limited when the user encoun-\nters content that is not old enough to have been fact-checked by\nfact-checkers of the two platforms. Dispute Finder is individualized\nas it is the user who specifies the sources of the articles a user\nwishes to see for or against the disputed claims, although users are\nrestricted to websites that meet the Wikipedia criteria for being\nreliable [31].\n2.2 Personalizing Users\u2019 Web Experience\nOur browser extension belongs to the class of tools that personalize\nusers\u2019 web experience across platforms. A classic example of such\na tool was WebWatcher, which followed the user\u2019s actions on the\nweb, learned the user\u2019s interests, and highlighted or added certain\nhyperlinks on the page for the user to follow [ 55,56]. Within this\nclass, web annotation tools exist that enable users to add content\nto webpages where they do not have authoring permission. One\nsuch example is Hypothesis, a browser extension that allows users\nto highlight and annotate text and for future visitors on the page\nto view and interact with the annotations. Hypothesis users can\nmake their annotations visible to the public or only within a private\ngroup of users [ 2,58]. NB is a similar social annotation tool forclassroom settings [ 107]. Other tools have also existed that enable\nusers to add comments on a page that are not necessarily tied to a\nparticular piece of content on the page. Examples include Google\nSidewiki and Eyebrowse [12, 104].\nOur extension differs from these tools in two ways. One is that\nthe assessments, i.e., the annotations or metadata, that are submit-\nted via the extension are structured. The structure makes it possible\nto differentiate assessments arguing for the accuracy of the content\nand the counter arguments as well as the questions about the accu-\nracy of the content. The differentiation makes it possible to show\neach of these categories differently in the UI. For helping the user\ndetermine content credibility as is the purpose in this domain, it\nis important to surface arguments as well as counter-arguments\nin a salient fashion. The other difference in this tool is the fine-\ngrained control that the user has in determining their sources of\nassessments, i.e., their trusted sources after the model proposed\nin [51].\n2.3 Systems that Aid in Sensemaking\nBy allowing users to share assessments with each other, and to\ncontextualize their assessments in-situ, our browser extension is\nrelated to a class of systems that empower and aid users in the pro-\ncess of sensemaking. The sensemaking brought about by our tool\nis in fact distributed\u2014i.e., it leverages other users\u2019 work without\nthose users directly collaborating with each other [ 33]. Research\nhas shown that empowering users to scaffold on each others\u2019 learn-\ning can increase the depth of their sensemaking [ 59]. Of the other\nwork that similar to our case, aid users in making sense of infor-\nmation, Goyal et al. provided a sensemaking translucence interface\nfor crime solving, which included a hypothesis window to promote\nidea exchange and a suspect visualization for automatic feedback\non suspects discussed in the hypothesis window [ 39]. The role\nof visualization in improving sensemaking has been explored in\nother work as well, including for representing data links or analysis\nprovenance [ 40,65]. Other work has reported on the effectiveness\nof creating shared representations between domain experts and the\ncrowd at increasing sensemaking [ 98]. Close to our scenario, Kuzne-\ntov et al. designed a browser extension with the goal of reducing\nthe friction of collecting information while remaining in the flow\nof the sensemaking process. The extension allows users to access\nand organize external content on the web in-situ while preserving\nthe provenance of and the context around the content [62].\n3 THE SYSTEM\nTo build our system, we extended the open source Trustnet plat-\nform presented in [ 51]. The reason we used Trustnet was because it\nalready provides an API for managing the data models that our envi-\nsioned extension would use. In this section, we provide a summary\nof the Trustnet platform and describe the design of the extension\nthat we built.\n3.1 The Trustnet Platform\nTrustnet is an open source prototype social content sharing plat-\nform developed by Jahanbakhsh et al [ 51]. On this platform, users\ncan post content or import content from other websites using their\nURL, follow other users or news media (all generally referred to as\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\nsources ) to see the content they post on their newsfeed, provide as-\nsessment of content, i.e., mark content as accurate or inaccurate and\nprovide their reasoning, trust other users, and see the assessments\nof those they follow and trust on the content appearing in their\nnewsfeed. The platform also offers a filter which a user can use to\nfilter the posts in their newsfeed based on how the posts have been\nassessed by the user\u2019s trusted sources. Users can also inquire about\nthe accuracy of posts, and optionally elaborate on their question. A\nuser\u2019s question about content accuracy is relayed to their trusted\nsources by default; although the user can choose to specify from\nwhom they would like assessments. Users can ask their question\nabout content accuracy anonymously. On this platform, who a user\ntrusts is kept private to the user. Follow relationships on the other\nhand, are public.\nWe extended the API of Trustnet\u2019s backend to serve the browser\nextension that we developed. In addition, we updated Trustnet\u2019s\nclient to work with the extended backend. Using the extended\nsystem, users can sign up for an account on the Trustnet platform,\nand specify which other users they trust or want to follow, and\nthen use the same account for logging into and working with the\nextension.\n3.2 The Trustnet Extension\nThe design decisions pertaining to the Trustnet extension1were\nmade through many rounds of discussion within the research team\nas well as pilot tests with a broader group of researchers who\nvolunteered their time as alpha testers. Here we describe the design\nas well as the rationales behind the various decisions. The flow of\nthe user interaction with the system is shown in Figure 4.\nWhen a user is on a web page, the extension checks the URL\n(and its variations2) to see whether its associated content has been\nassessed by those the user trusts or follows. If there are such assess-\nments for the page, a pane that contains the assessments pops open\non the side of the page automatically. The pane stays open for a few\nseconds and then is minimized to a floating button on the top right\ncorner of the viewport to avoid obstructing the user\u2019s view. The\npane and the floating button color is determined by the assessed\naccuracy of the content, as we will later describe. Clicking on the\nfloating button re-opens the pane. The reason we made the decision\nto show the pane automatically when assessments were present,\nas opposed to letting the user notice the colored floating button,\nwas because we expected that with a small user base, users would\nonly occasionally encounter pages which their sources had assessed\nand we wanted to prevent \u201cchange blindness\u201d. Change blindness\nis a phenomenon where changes in a visual scene go unnoticed\nbecause of visual inattention. The degree of change blindness is\nhigher when the observer does not expect a change [ 87], e.g., be-\ncause change happens infrequently. We deemed it important to\nsuccessfully deliver the signal that assessments are present on a\npage. With a wider adoption and a higher likelihood of assessments\n1Code available at https://github.com/farnazj/Trustnet-Extension\nExtension on the Chrome web store:\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/trustnet/nphapibbiamgbhamgmfgdeiiekddoejo\n2Depending on how the page is served, the same resource can be accessed with slightly\ndifferent URLs, for instance with or without index.html or/concatenated to the end,\nover both secure and plain HTTP, or using geolocation IP services to redirect requests\nto different domain names such as BBC.co.uk to BBC.com if the requester IP is in the\nU.S.being present on various pages, users could be given the option to\nhave the pane minimized from the beginning and open automat-\nically in certain situations, for instance, when the page has been\nevaluated as inaccurate. For ease of discernment, the color of the\npane as well as the floating button signals the accuracy status of the\ncontent: green for accurate, red for inaccurate (Figure 1), and orange\nfor split opinion\u2014where some of the user\u2019s assessors have marked\nthe content as accurate and others as inaccurate (See Figure 4).\nThe accuracy status of the page (and hence the pane\u2019s color) is\ndetermined by: 1. the assessment that the user has submitted for\nthe page, if any. 2. In case the user has not assessed the page, the\nassessments from those that the user trusts if any exist. 3. If there are\nno such assessments, the assessments of those the user follows. A\npage is determined as accurate if allthe assessments of the relevant\nassessors (i.e., the user, or those that the user trusts, or those that\nthe user follows in absence of trusted assessments) have evaluated\nthe page as accurate. The same is true for inaccurate. If there is\ndisagreement among the relevant assessors, the page\u2019s accuracy is\ndetermined as \u201csplit opinion\". If the page has no assessments from\neither the user or those that the user trusts or follows, the pane\ncontains no assessments and its color is grey.\nWe chose the green for accurate and red for inaccurate color\nscheme to be externally consistent with fact-checking platforms\nsuch as Politifact and Snopes. We selected the (yellow-)orange color\nfor split opinion because it is halfway between green and red on\nthe color wheel. Another design that we considered for the split\nopinion status was for the color of the pane to be determined as\na distance between red and green based on the proportion of as-\nsessments marking the content as accurate vs inaccurate. However,\nin cases when a minority assessment was outnumbered by assess-\nments arguing the opposite, it was possible that the color would be\nso close to either red or green that it would be indistinguishable.\nWe determined it was important to signal even a lone outlier dis-\nagreement amidst one-sided assessments, and that perhaps such\ncontrary viewpoint can point the user to the specific trusted asses-\nsor who might help guide them out of an echo-chamber. Therefore,\nwe decided against using a color gradient.\nThe same pane also shows inquiries about the accuracy of the\ncontent from those that either trust the user who is visiting the\npage or have specifically asked that their question be relayed to\nthe user. The user can use the same pane to submit their own\nassessment of the page, update their previous assessment, or ask\nabout the accuracy of the content. They can also use the pane to\nshare the content into the Trustnet platform after they have assessed\nit or asked about its accuracy. By sharing the content, other users\nwho follow the sharer will see the content in their Trustnet feed\nalong with the sharer\u2019s assessment of it. To help users expand their\nnetwork, the pane informs the user if there exist assessments on\nthe page by someone the user does not follow or trust. The pane\nshows up to 10 such sources who are trusted by the most number\nof users platform-wide. The user can choose to follow any of these\nsources if they wish to see their assessments on the page. Users can\nexpand, collapse, or close the extension pane.\nAn advantage of using URLs to bind assessments to and find\nassessments of content is that they are universal. Any resource on\nthe web including news articles, social media posts (e.g., Facebook\nposts and tweets) and even their comments, Youtube videos, etc.\nA Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation CHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\n1. After the user installs the extension and opens any tab, the Trustnet extension pane appears on the corner, and asks the user to log in or sign up.2. For sign up, the user is redirected to the Trustnet platform.3. Once the user signs up on the Trustnet platform, they can log in. The platform informs them how they can browse through sources and select any they want to follow or Trust.User can log into the Trustnet extension using the same credentials.\n5. By expanding the pane using the button, the user can input their assessment of the page.4. With the extension running, user will see a floating button in the corner of any page they visit. The color of the button signifies the accuracy status of the page as assessed by the user\u2019s sources. Grey means the page is unassessed.\n6. The user can assess the content as accurate or inaccurate, or they can ask about its accuracy. \n7. If a user is on a page that has been assessed by their sources, the assessments side-pane automatically opens for a few seconds and shows the assessments. The color of the pane signifies the accuracy status of the page as assessed by the user\u2019s sources. This is a page that some of the user's assessors have marked as accurate and others as inaccurate. Questions asked about the accuracy of the content are shown at the top of the side-pane.8. The color of the floating button in the corner matches the color of the pane. By clicking on the floating button, the user can bring the assessments side-pane into view.\n9. If the user is on a page that has links to content assessed by their trusted sources, the extension places an icon indicating the accuracy status of their associated resource next to each link. Here, the green checkmark indicates that the content of this link has been assessed as true.\nFigure 4: The flow of user interaction with the Trustnet extension, from signing up to assessing and seeing assessments from\nothers.\nhas a unique URL and therefore the user can see its assessments by\ntheir social circle when navigating to the content\u2019s URL. However,\nmany of these resources are usually embedded into a feed (e.g.,\nsocial media posts) or are presented as links on an aggregator\npage (e.g., the front/home page of a news website). Prior work\nhas reported that links, for instance on social media, are oftennot clicked, even when they are shared [ 35]. Therefore, showing\nthe assessments of a page when a user visits the page will not\nbenefit the multitude of those users who do not navigate to the\npage. To address this issue, the extension also checks the links\non the page that the user is presently reading, and places an icon\nindicating the accuracy status of their associated resource next to\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\neach (if there exists assessments for the resource from the user\u2019s\nnetwork) by slightly modifying the rendered page (see Figure 3).\nThe extension further places a question mark next to the links\nabout the accuracy of whose content other users have inquired.\nWe additionally made the design decision to reduce the salience of\nlinks assessed as inaccurate by making them look faded (somewhat\ntransparent but still visible), as seen in Figures 2 & 3. The motivation\nfor reducing the visual salience was to reduce the \u201cillusory truth\u201d\neffect, in which a single prior exposure to a headline increases\nsubsequent perceptions of its accuracy [ 80]. By attempting to bias\neye movements (a proxy for overt attention) through reducing the\nvisual salience of content assessed as inaccurate, we aimed to make\nit easier for users to ignore links that are misinforming [ 46]. In effect,\nwe tried to introduce a design friction as a disincentive\u2014a small\nhurdle that users would need to overcome to read the content [ 78].\nNevertheless, users can still consume the content if they wish to as\nthe content is still where it would otherwise be and is visible.\n3.2.1 Dealing with Link Complications. A complication of finding\nassessments of outgoing links on a page is that these links cannot\nbe used as they are found on the rendered page to check whether\nthey have associated assessments in the Trustnet system\u2019s backend.\nThe reason is that many links go through (sometimes multiple)\nredirections before finally redirecting to the link from which the\nresource can be fetched. For instance, a link shared on X (formerly\nknown as Twitter) is automatically processed and shortened to\nanother with the format of https://t.co/xxx . Links on other\nwebsites may also first redirect to an intermediary URL so that the\nwebsite logs outgoing links (i.e., which link a user clicks to leave\nthe page).\nTo address the issue of redirections, when the extension encoun-\nters links on a page, it recursively follows each3until it encounters\nthe final link that contains the resource. The reason it is the client\nrather than the server that follows the redirects is three-fold: First,\nthe number of links a user encounters on any one page can be\nlarge, and if all the links encountered by all the users are sent to\nthe server so that it can follow their trail of redirects, the process\ncan incur a substantial delay as there is a limit on the number of\nparallel requests the server can send and therefore, it would need\nto batch the requests sequentially. Second, it is conceivable that\nmany of the requests across users are to the same websites and\nif a large number of requests are made to these websites by one\nor a few servers, the servers can get rate-limited. Third, the infor-\nmation to which the client has access allows it to visit some links\nthat the server cannot, for instance, those that are behind paywalls.\nNevertheless, the client cannot follow all the links as there are oc-\ncasions when upon following the redirects, the browser encounters\na Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue. The CORS issue\ntypically occurs when a web application running in one domain\n(the \u201corigin\") tries to make an HTTP request to a resource located\non a different domain. If the server hosting the resource does not\nexplicitly allow the requesting domain to access it, the browser\nwill block the request. This for instance, happens on Facebook or\nTwitter where the encountered links are shortened links from the\nsocial media domain but the target links belong to other domains\n3In order to protect against broken looping links, there is a maximum depth after\nwhich the extension abandons the pursuit.which enforce the CORS policy4. Because CORS is only enforced\nin the browser, these links are sent to the server for following.\nIt is likely that the links which have been encountered and whose\ntrails have been followed will be encountered again by the same or\nother users. Therefore, to boost future performance, after following\nthe links and fetching their target links, the client creates a mapping\nof the (cleaned5) original to the target links and sends it to the server.\nThe server then caches this mapping. When visiting a page, the\nextension first sends the encountered links on the page to the server\nand asks whether it holds a mapping for any of them, as fetching the\ntargets is faster this way. With enough people using the extension,\nthe load of following the link redirects on any one client becomes\nlower, as it will be more probable that the server already knows a\nmapping for at least some of the requested links. The server discards\nthe mappings that have not been requested for some time.\nMost redirects are either HTTP redirects (returning HTTP code\n300) or HTML redirects (where the URL to follow can be found\nin a meta element). Another redirection method is doing so in\nthe JavaScript running on the page which is harder to detect. We\nwanted the extension to be general-purpose and to work on as\nmany platforms as possible. During development, we tested the\nextension on numerous news and content sharing websites where\nwe anticipated users would want to post assessments. One where\nwe found JavaScript redirection was Google News. We made specific\naccommodations to fetch redirect URLs from returned HTML of\nGoogle News URLs.\nMany URLs have query parameters appended to them that are\nusually optional key value pairs customizing the query. For in-\nstance, clicking on an article link on Facebook will append a query\nparameter of the form ?fbclid=xxx to the article\u2019s URL, which\nis used for tracking purposes. Before requesting assessments for\nURLs or requesting mappings of them from the server, the exten-\nsion strips the URL of these query parameters because they do not\nplay a part in identifying the resource and their inclusion would\nresult in a false miss in the cache. However, we found a few web-\nsites where we anticipated users may want to use the extension\nand which unconventionally use query parameters to distinguish\na resource. These websites include Youtube (where video URLs\nare of the form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxx ), Face-\nbook photos, videos, and comments (but not for instance, Facebook\nposts), and Hacker News posts (where post URLs are of the form\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=xxx ). We made spe-\ncific arrangements so that the extension treats query parameters\nfrom these websites as a resource.\nThe set of links on a page can change even as the URL of the\npage is constant, for instance, because more content is loaded as\na result of an infinite scroll. The extension watches the page for\nchanges and reacts by looking for new links for which to fetch\nassessments.\nThe extension additionally has an Options page where the user\ncan specify their blacklisted domains, i.e., where they do not want\nthe extention to run.\n4For example: https://t.co/CUnCxRezGn (origin on Twitter) ->\nhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-live-updates-11-07-23/ (resource on\nCNN.com)\n5The extension first cleans the links found on the page, for instance by adding missing\nprotocol or hostname.\nA Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation CHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\n4 USER STUDY OF THE TOOL\nWe recruited participants to work with the Trustnet browser ex-\ntension and the Trustnet platform. We advertised the study on a\nbehavioral research platform managed by our institution with a\npool of diverse participants. We asked those who were interested\nto fill out a survey which in addition to describing the study and\nproviding the consent form, asked about the news sources partici-\npants consumed and the subreddits, Facebook groups, and Twitter\naccounts that they frequented or followed which discussed news.\nWe collected this information to test the extension on these web-\nsites or subcommunities prior to the onset of the study and resolve\nany potential issues. In the survey, we also asked prospective users\nto refer others in their network who might be interested in par-\nticipating because the tool can best be leveraged among members\nof a social circle with pre-existing trust relationships. However,\nwe were unsuccessful in recruiting those that were referred. The\nsurvey additionally asked for demographic information, adopted\nfrom prior studies on misinformation [49, 51].\nFor onboarding, we asked that users watch a short video tutorial\nexplaining the systems and their features, sign up for an account\non the Trustnet platform (which would enable users to log into the\nTrustnet extension as well), and add the extension to their Chrome\nbrowser through the Chrome Web Store. To bootstrap the study,\nwe configured every user to initially follow all other users of the\nstudy upon signup, so that they would be able to see each other\u2019s\nassessments. Users could later choose to unfollow one another. We\nasked that users perform the following tasks each day during the\ntwo-week period of the user study:\n\u2022Assess the accuracy of two pieces of content per day. These\ncould be news articles, tweets, Youtube videos, or any other\npiece of content that the participant wanted. We encouraged\nour participants to assess as many more pieces of content as\nthey liked.\n\u2022Check out the Trustnet feed to see what the users of the study\nshare every day. The reason was because through simply\nusing the extension, with such a small user base and varied\ninterests, it was unlikely that users would serendipitously\nrun into each other\u2019s assessments as they were browsing the\nweb. We encouraged, but not required users to share content\nto the Trustnet feed through the Trustnet extension. The\nreason we did not require sharing was because a valid use of\nthe system\u2014a feature missing in existing social platforms\u2014\nis assessing content as misinformation for the benefit of\nwhoever comes across the content, but not wanting to further\nincrease its visibility.\nAt the study\u2019s conclusion, participants completed two surveys\nasking about their experience with assessing, seeing assessments\nfrom others and their perceptions of the tool. The survey included\nquestions such as \u201cTo what extent did you like being able to assess\ncontent\u201d and \u201cTo what extent did you like to see the assessments\nof other users?\u201d with 5-item likert scale responses as well as free-\ntext elaboration. To better understand users\u2019 thought process in\nassessing content, the survey showed each user examples of con-\ntent they had assessed as inaccurate and asked them to explain the\ncharacteristics of content they assessed as (in)accurate. The ques-\ntions on the experience of assessing included if users believed theirassessments helped others and what content they had difficulty\nassessing if any, among others. The questions on the experience of\nreceiving assessments included how well-thought-out users found\nothers users\u2019 assessments and their accounts of disagreements with\nothers. Some of the survey questions were inspired by prior work\non democratized misinformation moderation [51].\nTo compensate participants, we randomly selected 4 via a raffle\nand awarded each with a $100 gift card. After analyzing the results,\nwe observed that users had assessed a wide range of content on\ndifferent topics, not necessarily limited to political news. However,\ntheir responses in the post-study survey centered around assess-\nment of political content, possibly because a few questions had\nprimed them to have politics on top of their mind. Therefore, we\nsent our participants another follow-up survey to further under-\nstand their thoughts on how useful they would find assessments on\ndifferent types of content and their current as well as desired fact-\nchecking practices around different topics. This survey included\nquestions such as \u201cHow important is it for you, if at all, to avoid in-\naccurate information related to each of these topics? (likert scale)\u201d,\n\u201cWho (if anyone) would you like to see assessments from on each\nof these topics? Please elaborate\u201d, and \u201cto what extent do you think\nyou can contribute assessments that can help others on each of\nthese topics\u201d. Participants were each compensated with a $10 gift\ncard for completing this follow-up survey. The questionnaires are\nincluded in the Supplementary Materials. The study was approved\nby our Institutional Review Board.\n4.1 Participants\nA total of 32 users participated in the user study, of whom 25 submit-\nted assessments for 3 or more days. View the full participation plot\nin Appendix Section A. Out of all the participants, 21 completed the\npost-study survey and 25 completed the follow-up survey asking\nabout assessments on different topics. 66% were female and 25%\nwere male. 28% identified as Democratic, 19% as Republican, and\n53% as Independent. The median age was 26 (ranging from 19 to\n67), the highest degree achieved Bachelor\u2019s degree (ranging from\nhigh school diploma to Doctoral degree or equivalent), and the\nmedian income $60,000 - $69,000 (ranging from less than $10,000\nto $150,000 or more).\n5 RESULTS\nFor categorizing the themes surfaced in users\u2019 qualitative data such\nas their assessments or answers to the surveys, one member of the\nresearch team made multiple passes over the data and used open\ncoding to assign codes to the idea units and axial coding to consoli-\ndate the themes [ 95]. These codes were refined through subsequent\npasses over the data by constant comparison and theoretical sam-\npling (i.e., building a temporary theory and then collecting more\ndata to test that theory), resulting in the emergence of more gen-\neralizable concepts. Then through selective coding, the researcher\nfocused more narrowly on codes of topical interest considering the\nquestion at hand [ 76], e.g., whether there is potential for democrati-\nzation or personalization of misinformation moderation. During the\nanalysis stage, we followed up with some participants via email to\nask them to clarify some of their responses. As described, our use of\ngrounded theory was interpretive and aimed to yield concepts and\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\nthemes; therefore, agreement or measures of inter-rater reliability\nwere not appropriate [72].\n5.1 The Breadth of User Needs Supports the\nCase for Democratized Misinformation\nModeration (RQ1)\n5.1.1 Users Differ with Each Other and with Fact-checkers on the\nImportance of the Accuracy of Various Topics. Responses in the\nfollow-up survey revealed that users not only differ in the topics that\nthey consume, but also to what extent they find it important to avoid\nmisinformation related to each topic. For instance, while some said\nthat the accuracy of any content matters to them, others considered\ncertain topics of less relevance or importance to them; some believed\ncertain topics are inherently non-factual or controversial, or that it\nis impossible to find unbiased news related to certain topics. Figure 5\nshows the perceived importance of avoiding misinformation related\nto different topics averaged among our participants. The accuracy\nof health-related and political content was at least of moderate\nimportance to most users. However, even in our small user sample,\nthere was some variation in how important they found the accuracy\nof other topics compared to the topics that are often scrutinized\nby fact-checkers. For instance, one participant deemed it more\nimportant for them to avoid misinformation on spiritual content\ncompared to political or scientific content. Another considered the\naccuracy of content on lifestyle, diet, nutrition, and beauty more\nimportant than that on foreign affairs. The status-quo of centralized\nfact-checking constrained to a limited set of professionals is unlikely\nto match with the breadth of the types of content for which different\nusers want assessments.\nSimilarly, the ease of fact-checking content related to each topic,\nand therefore the need for the involvement of external fact-checkers,\nvaried across users. Some participants explained that they fact-\ncheck by reading articles on a topic from different sources (N=6);\nothers relied on their trusted news sources to have done their\nresearch (N=3); some said certain topics are harder to fact-check\nbecause they are rarely presented objectively or that they do not\nhave objective standards by which they can be assessed (N=4), they\nare complex and the user does not have the required background\nknowledge to fully understand them or that the knowledge in the\nfield is constantly evolving (N=5), or that it takes a great deal of\neffort to assess the accuracy of an article on the topic along various\ncriteria such as missing information and statistics (N=4). Figure 5\nshows how easy participants on average find it to fact-check content\non various topics.\n\u201cThe more dense topics such as medical questions or\nin-depth political issues require a lot of foreknowledge\nor quick education to understand what is being dis-\ncussed before you can fact-check or make an opinion on\nsomething. \u201d (P25)\n5.1.2 There is a desire and potential for including others in pro-\nviding assessments, than professional fact-checkers alone. The vi-\nability of an ecosystem that involves users beyond professional\nfact-checkers in misinformation moderation is dependent on two\nfactors: 1) Whether users would want to view assessments fromsuch assessors, and 2) whether they can contribute assessments\nthat can help others.\nTo investigate the first aspect, in the follow-up survey, we asked\nusers from whom they want to see assessments on content related\nto each topic in an extension like the Trustnet extension that allows\nthem to see assessments from those they follow and trust. We have\nsummarized the responses per topic in Table 1. For all of the topics,\nusers wanted to see the assessments of experts and professionals as\nwell as other users. However the notion of what qualifications the\nexperts or what characteristics the users should have varied across\nparticipants. These responses corroborated prior work reporting\nthat users want to and do seek the judgment of a variety of different\nsources they consider trustworthy to determine whether content is\ncredible [51].\nWhat we additionally uncovered was that depending on the topic,\nparticipants wished to also view assessments from a broader set of\nindividuals. For instance, on political content, participants liked to\nsee assessments from users with certain or diverse demographics\nor political leanings or those users who have been affected by\ncertain policies. On issues related to foreign affairs, they wished for\nthe assessments of users or journalists from other countries and\nimmigrants.\nTo investigate the second aspect, we asked our participants to\nindicate on which topics they believe they can contribute assess-\nments that can help others. In Section 5.2, we will further shed light\non this aspect by reporting on the types of rationales they used\nin their assessments. Two outcomes that would pose challenges\nfor the viability of such an ecosystem would be if users believed\nthemselves incapable of assessing or if on the contrary, they were\nready to profess their opinion about credibility of content without\nconsideration. What we observed however, was that the extent to\nwhich participants perceived their own assessments on various top-\nics helpful varied considerably and depended on whether they were\nan expert on, interested in, or well-read on a certain topic, their\nconfidence in their knowledge, whether they could trust themselves\nto be unbiased, and whether they considered themselves capable of\nfinding accurate and balanced information to pass their findings to\nothers. Therefore, it was interesting that users exhibited discern-\nment about when their assessments would contribute meaningfully,\nas demonstrated in this quote:\n\u201cI know more about certain topics because I work in\nthat area or because I am interested and consume more\nabout those topics. I feel that my assessments would be\nmore useful in those areas rather than in areas I have\nno experience or interest in. \u201d (P20)\n5.1.3 Users Assessed Content from Diverse Sources . Our partici-\npants submitted a total of 641 assessments and asked 39 questions\nabout the accuracy of various pieces of content. To understand\nwhat type of content users would want to assess if given the oppor-\ntunity, we investigated the sources to which the content belonged.\nThe sources of content that participants assessed or inquired about\nusing the Trustnet extension included various local, national, and\nglobal news, hyper-partisan, or misinformation websites (e.g., BBC,\nCBS58 Milwaukee, National Review, Info Wars, Common Dreams),\nnews aggregators (e.g., AllSides, Yahoo News), non-English news\nsources (e.g., El Pa\u00eds), government websites (e.g., CDC), academic\nA Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation CHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nFigure 5: The extent to which participants found it important to avoid misinformation on various topics, and how easy they\nfound it to fact-check information related to the topics they reported at least a little important to avoid misinformation on\n(rating >= 2), on a scale of 1-5. Each user answered these questions only on those topics that they reported they consume.\njournals (e.g., National Library of Medicine), publications of various\nuniversities (e.g., NYU Law and University of Bath UK), posts on\ncontent sharing websites (e.g., Twitter, Youtube, and Hacker News),\nand specialty news and blogs (e.g., related to the economy, sports,\nentertainment and celebrity gossip, diet and nutrition, home im-\nprovement, etc.). Source of other content assessed included archives\nand personal content (e.g., email).\nThe tweets and Hacker News posts that participants had as-\nsessed had embedded links to outside news articles. The assessed\nYoutube videos were created by accounts that had between 200K\nand 10M (in the case of major media organizations) subscribers. The\ncontent that these videos discussed were diverse including some\nthat touted certain misleading information and conspiracy theories,\nothers that explained various scientific and historical events, some\nthat disclosed the unethical practices of various corporations or\nthe inauthenticity of certain claims such as those of psychics and\nmediums, and, because it was making news at the time, a number\nthat discussed Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard trials, for instance,inviting body language and behavior experts to \u201creveal what she\nreally thought\u201d.\n5.2 Users\u2019 Criteria for Assessing Content (RQ2)\nWe investigated users\u2019 assessments to understand what kind of\ncriteria and rationales they had used for evaluating accuracy. To\nanalyze the themes in participants\u2019 rationales, we first consulted\nprior work that presented criteria for assessing content accuracy:\nthe taxonomy of users\u2019 rationales for assessing news headlines [ 49],\nthe context and content credibility indicators developed by the\nCredibility Coalition in an attempt to define a shared language\nfor classifying misinformation and credibility [ 105], and problems\nwith news headlines (e.g., clickbait, sensationalism, etc.) that users\ncorrected when given a tool that enabled them to do so [ 50]. To ana-\nlyze the rationales that emerged in the assessments (and questions\u2014\nsince some questions also contained rationales for why the content\nmay or may not be accurate) of our users, we first partitioned their\nresponses into idea units, resulting in 732 idea units, each being\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\nTable 1: Participants\u2019 responses to who they would like to see assessments from on content related to various topics. Examples\nof assessors belonging to various categories that participants cited are shown in parentheses.\nTopic Professionals & experts Academics & researchers Users Journalists Friends\n& familyOther\nPolitical N=11 ( political analysts, politi-\ncians, previous office holders,\njudges)N=5 (Political scientists,\nhistorians, etc.)N=9 (those from diverse demo-\ngraphics or political leanings)N=5 N=2 N=4 (certain media\noutlets from all\nsides, political\nactivists)\nMedical, health N=17 (medical specialists) N=9 N=2 (patients) N=1 N=1\nScience, envi-\nronment, tech,\nengineeringN=9 (those in tech, designers,\nengineers)N=9 (the researchers who\nconduct the studies be-\ning written about, peers\nin the field)N=4 N=2 N=1\nBusiness, economy N=9 (business analysts, CEOs) N=4\n(economists)N=5 (small business owners) N=3 N=1\nForeign affairs N=6 (diplomats, ambassadors,\ngovernment workers)N=3 N=7 (locals, people on both sides\nof issues)N=8\n(foreign\ncorrespon-\ndentsN=1\nLifestyle, diet, nutri-\ntion, beautyN=6 (medical professionals,\nlife gurus, etc.)N=3 N=6 (women, those interested in\nweight loss or skincare)N=1 N=1 (influencers)\nSources outside the\nUS or non-English\nsourcesN=2 N=3 N=4 (immigrants, international\naudience, those who speak the\nlanguage fluently)N=5 N=1 (firsthand\nsources)\nSports N=10 (athletes, coaches, re-\ntired sportspeople)N=1 N=2 (fans) N=3 N=1\nGaming N=6 (gamers, e-sports profes-\nsionals)N=2\nEntertainment,\ncelebrity newsN=3 N=2 N=4 N=2\nSpirituality N=6 (pastors and spiritual lead-\ners from certain backgrounds\nor specializing in certain de-\nnominations )N=2 (theologians) N=5 (religious users or those\nwith similar moral backgrounds\nas the user)\na coherent unit of thought. Of these, a total of 204 idea units did\nnot include rationales, e.g., because they were questions about the\naccuracy of the content, or they simply summarized the article.\nWe then assigned codes from this body of related work to the rest\nof the idea units when the codes were appropriate, noting which\nrationales could not be captured by any of the proposed codes in\nthe related work. The criteria presented in prior work and discussed\nby our users included the trustworthiness of the source, presenting\nevidence that corroborates the claim, presentation of all viewpoints,\nsoundness of inference or logic, citation of studies, organizations,\nor experts, representative citations, title representativeness, among\nother factors. We then used grounded theory as described in Sec-\ntion 5 to build concepts that could encompass the user rationales\nthat were not assigned labels. Some of these emergent concepts\nwere generalizations of, and therefore encompassed, some of the\ncriteria in the prior work. When reporting the number of citations\nof rationales based on these more general concepts, the count in-\ncludes instances that were originally coded using the criteria from\nthe earlier work. To test inter-rater reliability for this part of the\nresults, another coder was trained on the criteria from the devel-\noped codebook as well as those in [ 49,105] that the criteria in the\ncodebook did not encompass. A sample of the idea units (about\n12%) were labeled by the coder. Both the training and test samples\nwere selected such that they covered all of the categories. Cohen\u2019s\nKappa was 0.63, indicating substantial agreement [63].\nHere, we elaborate on some of the criteria that are related to\nthose reported in prior work. We do not elaborate on the rest ofthe criteria because the definitions accompanied by the examples\nconvey the meaning well. We have summarized all criteria along\nwith representative quotes in Table 2. These can be used as criteria\nto extend the list of credibility indicators for content and context\ndeveloped in [105].\n5.2.1 Citations are credible. Two indicators in [ 105] that are closely\nrelated to this category include citation of organization and studies\nand quotes from experts (in the field), as they can add context or\nsupport to the article. Our users however, found content credibly not\nonly through researcher and expert citations but also from citations\nby others, including victim\u2019s family, eyewitnesses of various events,\ncancer patients (e.g., to attest to certain symptoms), and others.\nTherefore, the notion of who is a credible citation varies by topic.\n5.2.2 The details or underlying data are disclosed adequately. This\ncategory is closely related to the rationale reported in [ 49] about\nwhy people believe news claims\u2014that evidence presented in the\narticle corroborates the claim. In [ 49], there was no counterpart\nto this rationale for why people would disbelieve a news claim.\nOur users however, when discussing the data or details presented\nin an article, sometimes reported inadequate or even more than\nadequate disclosure of details as a criteria that detracts from article\ncredibility.\n5.2.3 The Content Discusses a Scientifically Reproducible Process\nor a Claim that Can Be Verified. This category is related to a ra-\ntionale reported in [49] for why people disbelieve claims\u2014that the\nclaim references something that is impossible to prove, e.g., using a\nA Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation CHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nmetric that cannot be measured. In [ 49], there was no counterpart\nto this rationale for why people would believe news claims. In the\nassessments that our users submitted, we observed that because a\nclaim could be verified (e.g., through a scientific process or by cross-\nchecking the evidence), it made users believe the claim as accurate.\nIn addition, one use case of this rationale that we observed, and\nwhich was not reported in [ 49], was that at the moment when the\narticle was published or being read, the general information or evi-\ndence at hand was or was not enough to deduce whether the article\nwas accurate. Or, while the claim in the article was accurate at that\nmoment, the situation was still evolving and future developments\nmight render the claim inaccurate, or vice versa.\n5.2.4 The Content Distinguishes Between Facts and Opinion. One of\nthe criteria that our users used for assessing content credibility was\nwhether the content was intended to be a factual piece as opposed\nto for instance, op-ed or anecdote, and if so, whether the piece\nexhibited any editorialization. Even if the content was editorialized,\nusers considered author\u2019s transparency about separating the facts\nand the opinions as a signal of content credibility. This category\nis a generalization of a rationale reported in [ 49] for why users\ndisbelieve news claims\u2014that the claim appears motivated or biased.\nWhile our users mostly used the tool to assess content accuracy,\nin some cases, they put it to other use cases which points to op-\nportunities for enabling individuals to annotate content beyond\nassessment of factuality. For instance, they used the tool to explain\nthat an article was not factual, but satirical or an opinion piece.\nOther use cases included expressing opinions or sentiments\u2014that a\nparticular story should not have been published (for instance be-\ncause it distresses the subjects the story is about or the story is not\nnews worthy) or conversely, that the story is insightful, important,\nor positive, or to express their (dis)agreement with the message of\nan article.\n5.3 Participants\u2019 Perceptions of the Tool and the\nAffordances It Provided (RQ3)\n5.3.1 Perceived Utility of the Tool and Its Advatanges and Downsides\n(RQ3a). Figures 6 and 7 show the extent to which participants liked\nbeing able to assess content and seeing the assessments of other\nusers respectively. We investigated their free-text responses to\nunderstand their reasons. The reasons they liked being able to\nassess included that it helped them think about the news in a more\nanalytical way or gauge their trust in a source (N=5), and that\nthey liked being interactive with the news content they consumed\nand the ability to call out content they found biased or misleading\n(N=4). The cited downsides of assessing were that it took extra time\nand effort (N=4) and that sometimes they find it hard to assess a\npiece of content e.g., when there is no obvious cause to think the\narticle might be inaccurate or worrying that one is biased in one\u2019s\nassessment (N=3). A frequently cited reason why participants liked\nseeing assessments from others included because users can get\nto know other people\u2019s perspectives and standards for evaluating\ncontent credibility or that it was fun (N=11):\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what people thought\nof different articles, and especially to read the reasons\nWHY they thought that. As opposed to people just blindly\nFigure 6: The extent to which users reported that they like\nthe ability to assess content in the post-study survey.\nFigure 7: The extent to which users reported that they like\nseeing assessments from others in the post-study survey.\ntaking a side, I liked to see people actually articulate\nand think through their assessments. It was especially\ninteresting to read when people had different views as\nto whether content was trustworthy or not. \u201d (P14)\nOther reasons included that by considering whether they agree\nor disagree with their assessments the user can think more criti-\ncally about content (N=2), and assessments from others, especially\ntrusted sources, help the user decide whether they should trust an\narticle (N=2). Some participants however, disliked democratized\nassessments because they believed people are biased or incapable\nof assessing (N=2).\nFigure 8 shows participants\u2019 post-study responses to how much\nthey believe a tool like the Trustnet extension would be useful\nto them if adopted by many people ( \u00af\ud835\udc4b=2.57, \ud835\udc60=0.79). In the\nfollow-up survey, we asked participants a similar question of to\nwhat extent they find it useful to see the assessments of content\nright on the page. Responses to this question are shown in Figure 9\n(\u00af\ud835\udc4b=2.84, \ud835\udc60=1.07).\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\nTable 2: The criteria for content accuracy cited by the users of the extension which were not reported in prior work on indicators\nof content credibility [49, 105].

We asked our participants what would\nincentivize them to use such a tool, what they would consider as\npotential reasons they might want to avoid it, and their ideas for\nresolving those issues. We have summarized their responses in\nTable 3.A common concern about the tool was that those who post\nassessments may abuse the ability, e.g., by pushing a certain narra-\ntive, using harmful language, engaging in coordinated attacks, etc.\nRelated were concerns about not knowing an assessor\u2019s political\nleanings or agenda. In fact, the Trustnet extension gives users the\nability to explicitly specify who they trust and follow and only\nshows a user assessments from their trusted and followed indi-\nviduals. The user would not even be aware of assessments on a\npiece of content by others, even a multitude of bots, if the user does\nnot follow or trust them. The reason why our participants were\nconcerned about this point may have been due to the fact that we\nset up our study such that all our participants would follow each\nother by default. Although in our tutorials and our communications\nwith them, we told them that they could unfollow others or choose\ncertain individuals as trustworthy, they may not have paid attention\nto this point.\nIn their responses, some participants also mentioned their con-\ncerns about specific UI design decisions that we had made. For\ninstance, while some participants found the green flag next to links\nassessed as accurate helpful, a few said that they would not care\nas much about if a piece of content is accurate compared to if it is\ninaccurate. In addition, although some users found the partial fad-\ning of content assessed as inaccurate helpful, others were against it\nor considered it a form of censorship. These differences in opinion\nacross users point to a need to give users controls for customizing\ntheir experience with the actions taken on content once the content\nhas been classified.\n6 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThe universal in-place assessments displayed through the Trustnet\nbrowser extension would be in contrast to expecting the user to\nactively seek fact-checking information from external sources for\nevery piece of content that they encounter. Furthermore, the ex-\ntension enabling the user to provide assessment in-place can help\nothers who find the user a trustworthy source.\nWe observed that our users used the extension to assess a variety\nof different types of content on various websites, blogs, and social\nmedia, and on various topics not limited to politics or health. Not all\nsources were widely known, but they still have enough consumers\nfor the accuracy of the content they publish to be consequential.\nIn the existing fact-checking model on today\u2019s web, the power to\nassess content is confined to a limited set of individuals and fact-\nchecking initiatives who do not have the resources to cover every\npiece of content published by every source. For instance, a number\nof Youtube channels whose videos our participants had assessed as\nwell as some specialty websites and blogs had enough subscribers\nfor a wide reach but perhaps not enough to garner attention from\nthe fact-checking organizations. To scale fact-checking in a world\nwhere everyone could be a publisher, we need all the help we can\nget, even from regular users and perhaps especially those who have\ninterest in and knowledge about a particular topic, to sieve accurate\nfrom inaccurate information.\nWhile assessments in our tool are democratized, how often a\nuser views content with credibility assessments depends on who\nand how many sources they have marked as trustworthy. The issue\nof scaling such democratized trusted assessments so that a user\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\nTable 3: Participants\u2019 reasons to avoid the tool and what would incentivize them to use it.\nArgument Example\nUser abuse including biased assessors, harmful language, assessment bomb-\ning of certain authors or pages, paid experts (N=9)\u201cAssessors would have a lot of power.

Another\nis to explore whether a more extensive trust network can be built\nfor each user by leveraging transitivity of trust. Prior work has also\nexamined trust transitivity in social networks, in the context of e-\ncommerce, recommender systems, and chat moderation [ 26,57,67].\nIndeed, there is also the potential for a hybrid approach where the\nextension delivers professional fact-checking information to users\nin addition to that from regular users, but leaves it to the users to\ndecide which fact checkers to trust.\n6.1 Design Implications\n6.1.1 User Criteria for Evaluating Content Accuracy.

In contrast to other studies that have presented\ncriteria for assessing content credibility [ 105] and [ 49], in our study,\nusers were not restricted to a set of curated news claims or articles,\nbut could use the tool to submit their assessment of any piece of\ncontent of their choosing. In this in-the-wild setting, some of the\nrationales that emerged out of the assessments encompassed, but\nwere broader than, those previously reported in [ 49] and [ 105], and\nsome had not been reported before.\nTools that allow users to evaluate content credibility, such as\nours, can be augmented with a checklist of criteria surfaced in our\nstudy as a form of guideline to nudge the user to reflect on various\naspects of credibility, when sharing content, similar to the proposal\nin [49], or even when reading content. While in [ 49], going throughthe checklist in addition to providing free-text reasoning at the\ntime of sharing did not lead users to share less misinformation\ncompared to providing free-text assessments alone, future work\nshould study whether a different set of criteria such as ours could\nbe effective. Even if the structured checklist does not reduce the\nsharing of misinformation, it can still help those who view the\ncriteria that the assessors have highlighted in structured form, and\nperhaps even use them in filtering through content or assessments.\n6.1.2 Incentivizing Participation. A hurdle in using the tool that\nparticipants mentioned is that it can be time consuming to con-\ntribute or read assessments. Future work can investigate how to\nfurther aid users in their sensemaking process, e.g., by providing\na mechanism using which they can collectively cluster, synthe-\nsize, and surface unique information in the assessments, similar\nto Crowdlines or Wikum [ 68,106]. The tool can then visualize the\nanalysis provenance so that other users can audit the sensemak-\ning pipeline [ 65]. The assessments pane can also be structured to\ninclude a section into which users can clip \u201cevidence\u201d, including\nlinks to public hearing videos, studies, fact-checking articles, etc.\nthat can help establish the veracity of claims in the content.\nOur users also desired some form of compensation or recognition\nfor their effort. The tool can be enhanced with a reputation system\nsimilar to the one in Stack Overflow where users accrue points\nbased on how others rate their assessments or questions about\ncontent accuracy. To protect against coordinated attacks against\nan individual, the reputation score a user A views for user B would\nnot be a global score, but rather a function of the scores that A\u2019s\ntrusted sources (or those who have an extended trust path to A)\nhave given to B\u2019s assessments. In fact, the score system can be used\nA Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation CHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nto incentivize users to write assessments that can reach across the\npolitical divide or to read assessments from others that are not\nsimilar to them, e.g., by assigning a higher weight to the upvote on\nan assessment from an out-group user compared to those from the\nin-group users.\n6.1.3 Democratizing the Design Space of Actions on Labeled Content.\nWe scoped our approach and consequently our tool to democratiz-\ning the power to categorize the accuracy status of content. Informed\nby literature, we then made specific design decisions about what to\ndo with the content that was labeled as accurate or inaccurate and\nhow to signal its status. Our users however, were not in agreement\nabout whether they liked these specific design decisions. For ex-\nample, while the accuracy and inaccuracy of content were of equal\nimportance to some, others wished to only be notified of inaccura-\ncies. These differences make the case for democratizing the choice\nin the design space of actions as well. In fact, this is another aspect\nof moderation that can be democratized regardless of whether the\narbitration itself is. Even if accuracy labels are generated by a select\nfew, the decision of whether, how, and in what circumstances users\nwant to view labels can be deferred to users.\n6.2 Content Moderation on the Client Side\nIn the current information ecosystem and without much control\nover choosing what content they wish to see or avoid, users have\nsubmitted to the will of the platforms and their feed curation algo-\nrithms. The power of what information flows where is much tilted\nin the favor of the platforms. Our work is a case study of how we can\ngive more agency to the users and democratize content moderation\non the web, without support from the underlying platforms. While\nour tool was focused on enabling users to assess the accuracy of\ncontent and see assessments from their trusted sources, the system\ncan be generalized, empowering users in a variety of other use\ncases. For instance, our users desired to see assessments from users\nor news outlets with diverse perspectives or from different sides.\nTaking this idea further, the architecture and design of our tool can\nbe used to enable users to provide alternative sources for content\u2014\nthose with a different political leaning similar to an in-situ All-\nSides [ 1], those that a user thinks are more credible than the source\nat hand, or those that together with the source can paint a more\ncomplete picture of the story. The system can be adopted to label\ncontent that is hostile to various marginalized identities, similar\nto the Shinigami Eyes browser extension that colors trans-friendly\nand anti-trans social media groups, users, and search results [ 6].\nThe system can be used to label content with certain valence, for\ninstance \u201cdepressing\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d, so that the user may choose to\nfilter out labeled content if and when they are not in a state of\nmind to consume it. Future work can study different types of de-\nmocratized governance on these tools, e.g., leaving the decision of\ncategorization to customized trusted sources specified by the user\nas in our study or allowing the user to choose among various sets\nof moderator bodies with different standards for what constitutes a\npositive label. The choice of whether such content should removed\nfrom the user\u2019s view can be given to the user as well. Indeed, in\nour study, not every user was in agreement about whether visual\nfading of content assessed as inaccurate is an acceptable design\ndecision.The user-generated data in such a tool can further be augmented\nwith machine learning or user-configurable word filters similar\nto [53] to block content on certain topics, with certain valence, or\nfrom certain people that appears on the user\u2019s feed. While users\ncannot stop the flow of unwanted and unasked for messages, for\ninstance those that are forcefully boosted to them (e.g., Elon Musk\u2019s\ntweets receiving the \u201cpower user multiplier\u201d special treatment [ 91]),\nthey can leverage browser extensions such as ours to locally flag\nsuch content or remove it from the rendered page.\n6.3 Broader Social Implications\n6.3.1 Are regular users able to find trustworthy sources? The ecosys-\ntem that we propose relies on the users to find and vet others who\nshould be trusted to provide assessments. But is this a challenge\nthat could render the approach not feasible? We argue that on the\ncontrary, this approach enables users to do online what they would\ndo in natural settings, as finding trusted sources and heeding the\ninformation that they provide is how people have always deter-\nmined the truth. Epistemically, social construction of knowledge is\nindividuals receiving testimony from trusted sources about infor-\nmation that they cannot verify by direct observation [ 94]. On social\nplatforms, users commenting about a post\u2019s accuracy contribute to\nthe socially constructed knowledge of others who trust them [22].\nAdditionally, the presupposition of democracy is that we recognize\nour fellow citizens as having the capacity to participate in collective\ngovernance. However, social platforms, or the web, currently do\nnot accommodate these age-old practices well.\n6.3.2 Echo Chambers. An adverse effect of giving users autonomy\nto decide from whom they would like to see assessments can be\nthe potential for echo chambers. But does this mean that instead,\na governing body should make decisions that it decrees are in the\nbest interest of users? Prior work has warned against relinquishing\nthe power of content moderation to platforms and advocated for\nuser autonomy in this space and argued that individuals have a\nmoral right to freedom of listening and against compelled listen-\ning [ 48,51]. These rights are delivered to users on some platforms\nthrough affordances that allow them to for instance, tag, rate, or\nupvote content and filter based on this metadata. Therefore, such\naffordances already have precedence on the web. Another advan-\ntage to structuring trust and assessments on the web is that such\ntools as ours can deliver features aimed at directing users to trust-\nworthy contrary viewpoints. In fact, prior work has also reported\nthat users are more receptive to fact-checking information from\nfriends than strangers [ 42,70]. In our tool, we made an initial at-\ntempt at encouraging users to expand their network by having the\nextension inform the user if there exist assessments on the page by\nsomeone that they do not follow or trust. Because of the sparsity\nof the data in our small-scale user study, the recommended sources\non a page were those who were trusted by the most number of\nusers platform-wide. However, with a larger adoption of the tool,\nthe extension can recommend to a user contrary viewpoints by\nsources that for instance, have a history of assessments that align\nwith the user\u2019s, or sources that are trusted by those that user deems\ntrustworthy.\nCHI \u201924, May 11\u201316, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Jahanbakhsh and Karger\n6.4 Challenges of Finding Link Redirects and\nPossible Solutions\nTo display user-generated content, for many use cases including\nours, it is necessary to find embedded links on the page that the\nuser is visiting as well as to which resource each link redirects. A\npotential complication of the client following the trail of redirects\nfor many links from the same domain is that the client can get rate-\nlimited. In our system architecture, because the server caches the\nredirects that the clients have found, with a large enough number\nof users, the number of links for which each client needs to find\nthe redirected resource becomes fewer. To further protect against\ngetting rate-limited, the client does not fetch all the links it finds on\nthe page at once, but rather batches the requests and spreads them\nout. We set the delay between the request batches the same across\nall websites because many websites do not disclose their rate limits.\nThis static delay results in suboptimal delay in fetching the links\non some domains that would allow for more frequent requests and\nconversely, getting rate-limited on others that only allow for less\nfrequent requests.\nHowever, this issue can be dealt with in two ways. The first is to\nkeep an estimate of the rate-limit of each domain on the server and\ndynamically change it until the estimate appropriately captures\nthe domain\u2019s actual rate-limit. This can be done by for instance,\nadditively increasing the rate of requests the client makes on the\ndomain if it does not get rate-limited, and conversely, multiplica-\ntively decreasing the rate of requests if it does, similar to congestion\ncontrol schemes in networks. The second is to learn whether the\nlinks to internal and external resources on a website are likely to\ngo through redirections. While the extension currently attempts to\nfollow all links found on a webpage, the links on many websites\nin fact\u2014at least those that direct to internal resources\u2014do not go\nthrough redirections. Identifying these websites after a number of\nencounters can prevent the extension from getting rate-limited,\ndecrease the delay of fetching user-generated content on the links,\nand reduce the load of caching mappings of links on the server.\n7 LIMITATIONS\nA limitation of the empowerment brought about by our tool is the\ninherent limitation of browser extensions\u2014that they only work on\ndesktop and not on mobile browsers or within mobile applications.\nThis is unfortunate especially because certain messaging apps such\nas WhatsApp have been a hotbed of misinformation [ 97]. To par-\ntially address this issue, we can provide databases or platforms such\nas [51] where users can copy and paste in-app messages or links to\nassess them or see their assessments. However, this solution relies\non users adopting this extra step into their content consumption\nprocess.\nAnother limitation of this tool concerns how Facebook deals\nwith links. When displaying posts or external links embedded in\nposts (e.g., posts from news media), the rendered DOM does not\ninclude their URLs, unless as a result of user action such as the\nuser hovering their mouse over the elements. Therefore, without\nthis extra action from the user, the extension cannot know the\nURLs of the displayed posts or content to fetch their assessments.\nInterestingly, embedded links used to have their URL in the DOM\nin the early days of the Trustnet extension, but no longer do. Therationale behind this change in design is unclear. However, it points\nto the need for active maintenance of browser extensions such as\nTrustnet to keep working on hostile platforms.\nWhile it is conceivable to view a source as generally well-informed\nin their assessments, trust in a source may not always be a simple\nbinary choice of yes or no. Future work should study how users\nreason about their degree of trust in various sources and how to\nincorporate that into such a tool as ours.\n8 CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we explore democratizing misinformation moderation\non the web by providing users with a browser extension that em-\npowers them to assess any content including news articles, social\nmedia posts, or videos, and to see assessments from the sources they\nhave marked as trustworthy in-situ. We evaluated the potentials\nand the challenges of such a design through a two-week user study\nwhere we asked users to use the tool to assess any content that they\nwanted. We observed a gap between the content that users want to\nassess and whose accuracy they consider important and the type of\ncontent that is usually assessed by fact-checking initiatives, point-\ning to a need for giving users autonomy in this space. Our users\nperceived value in the ability to assess content or see assessments\nfrom others right on the content, for instance, because they believed\nthe process helped them think critically about news. They also had\nideas for improving the process such as incorporating a reputation\nor a point system to incentive users to contribute assessments. We\nalso investigated user\u2019s rationales for their assessments and believe\nthey can extend credibility indicators reported in prior work and\ncan be used for guiding users in how to evaluate content accuracy.\nOur work suggests there is potential for democratizing content\nmoderation on the web through tool such as ours.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank all the alpha testers of our tool as well as the users of our\nstudy.

Not all the ones\nthat completed the tasks for fewer than 14 days dropped out\nbefore the study\u2019s conclusion. Rather, they did not complete\nthe tasks in certain days.\nA PARTICIPATION\nFigure 10 shows the participation distribution across our study\nparticipants.\nB PARTISANSHIP\nPrior work has reported that users\u2019 assessments of content accuracy\ncorrelates with whether the their partisanship aligns with that of\nthe content [ 9,49]. We wanted to further investigate whether parti-\nsanship plays a role in the context of our study where users were not\nrestricted in their choice of which content to assess. Therefore, we\nconsulted the media bias ratings provided by 3 sources (AllSides [ 1],\nAd Fontes Media [ 4], and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) [ 3]) and\ndeveloped a normalized numeric political leaning value averaged\nfrom the ratings given by these sources. The value ranged from -1\nto 1, with negative values indicating a left-leaning ideology, and\npositive values indicating a right-leaning ideology. A number of\ndomains in our dataset were aggregator websites such as Hacker\nNews, Allsides, and Yahoo News that present articles from vari-\nous media. For retrieving the bias of the articles assessed by our\nusers on these aggregators, we considered the original source of\nthe articles, for instance LA Times for an article assessed on Yahoo\nNews.\nThe political leaning information on a number of sources was not\navailable in these repositories. Some of these sources for instance,\nwere not major news websites or covered specialty news. In fact, the\nlack of information about bias or credibility of a number of sources\nthat our small user sample consumed points to the gap\u2014perhaps\nresulting from limited resources\u2014between the content fact-checked\nby professionals and the content that the general public consumes\nand about whose accuracy they inquire. The number of datapoints\n(i.e., user assessments) for which we had the political leaning of the\nmedia source was 588.\nTo measure partisanship concordance between a user and the\ncontent that the user assessed, we made the simplifying assumption\nthat the leaning of the content is the same as the leaning of its media\nsource. We labeled each user as either a Democratic or a Republican.\nWe were able to place all participants including those who identified\nas Independent or other in one of the two Democrat or Republican\ncategories because in addition to party, we had asked participantsabout their political preference (strongly Republican, lean Republi-\ncan, Republican, Democrat, lean Democrat, strongly Democrat). If\nthe numeric political leaning value of the media source was neg-\native and the user was labeled as a Democratic, or if the media\nvalue was positive and the user was a Republican, partisanship\nconcordance had a value of 1. Otherwise, partisanship concordance\nwas 0.\nTo understand if partisanship concordance has an effect on users\u2019\naccuracy judgment, we fit a generalized linear model to the data.\nTo do so, we used the function \"glmer\" from the R package \"lme4\"\nand used the family function \"Binomial\" with the link \"logit\". We\nincluded user and content identifiers as random effects to account\nfor variation in the outcome as a result of the unobserved charac-\nteristics of a particular user or a piece of content. The model was\nas follows:\naccuracy assessment\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50=\ud835\udefd1(partisanship concordance )\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\n+\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc62+\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc50+\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50 (1)\nwhere the accuracy assessment\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50is user \ud835\udc62\u2019s assessment of con-\ntent \ud835\udc50. The indicator variable 1(partisanship concordance )\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50de-\nnotes whether user \ud835\udc62\u2019s political leaning is aligned with content \ud835\udc50.\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc62is the matrix for the random effects for observations for partici-\npant \ud835\udc62, and \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc50for content \ud835\udc50.\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50is the error term. \ud835\udefdis the coefficient\nof interest.\nInterestingly, we observed that partisanship concordance did\nnot have a significant effect on users\u2019 assessment [ \ud835\udefd=0.45, \ud835\udc67=\n0.56, \ud835\udc5d=0.58], suggesting that the effect of partisanship on users\u2019\nassessments when users are not restricted in what content to assess\nwarrants more research.", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "A Browser Extension for in-place Signaling and Assessment of Misinformation", "author": ["F Jahanbakhsh", "DR Karger"], "pub_year": "2024", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference \u2026", "abstract": "The status-quo of misinformation moderation is a central authority, usually social platforms,  deciding what content constitutes misinformation and how it should be handled.

For this purpose, two methods were used: \nthe first of the analyses assesses the reliability of the information source and the probability \nof the correctness of the claim. The second part of the research is based on a content analysis \nfocused on the occurrence of disinformation elements in the texts published on both \nwebsites.  \nThe results of the first analysis showed that the  articles from  the Aeronet website can \nbe considered untrustworthy in 100  % of cases, and the Otev\u0159i svou mysl  website in more \n \n \n than 80  %. The content analysis confirmed the occurrence of disinformation elements in all \ntexts, with a strong emotional charge and unclear text output being the most common \nbut questioning of government authorities and questioning of expert knowledge were also \nrepeatedly present. The thesis  also identified differences in the stylistics of the texts \nand the focus of both websites \u2013 Aeronet's texts are more often politically focused, while \nOtev\u0159i svou mysl  operates in the field of esotericism and pseudoscie nce. \nThe work contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms of functioning \nof disinformation media in the Czech environment and can be used as a framework \nfor further research or media -educational activities.  \n \nKl\u00ed\u010dov\u00e1 slova  \nAlternativn\u00ed m\u00e9dia, dezinformace, konspirace, covid -19, Aeronet, Otev\u0159i svou mysl  \n \nKeywords  \nAlternative media, disinformation, conspiracy, covid -19, Aeronet, Otev\u0159i svou mysl  \n \nTitle  \nThe Role and Informing of Selected Alternative Media in the Czech Society during \nthe COVID -19 Pandemic  \n \n \n Pod\u011bkov\u00e1n\u00ed   \nNa tomto m\u00edst\u011b  bych r\u00e1da pod\u011bkovala sv\u00e9mu vedouc\u00edmu pr\u00e1ce PhDr. ThMgr.

Using the Admiralty Code analysis and content analysis, specific \ndisinformation elements that appeared in selected articles were identif ied. \nThe thesis contains a theoretical part , which  focused on  the COVID -19 pandemic \nin the Czech Republic, as well as outlined the way in which information about crisis \nsituations (which the COVID -19 pandemic undoubtedly was ) should be conducted. \nThe theoretical part also tried to define the concept of \"disinformation\" in connection with \nconspiracy theories and the theory of anti -publicity and anti -publicity.  \nThe results of both analyses gradually showed that the disinformation aspects defined \nin the theoretical part of this thesis are significantly represented in the sample of articles \nfrom  both selected media. According to the Admiralty Code, the Aeronet website was \nmarked as completely untrustworthy in 100% of cases, Otev\u0159i svou mysl  in 84% of articles \n(with another 11% classified as \"uncertain\"); at the same time, 100% of the analysed  texts \ncontained at least one demonstrably false claim and most of the defi ned disinformation \nelements: emotional charge, questioning of government authorities, questioning of expert \nknowledge, or unclear text output appeared repeatedly and systematically. The websites \nworked with  different way s of informing and focus ed their articles  differently : the Aeronet \nwebsite used confrontational language and its articles  turned out to be politically focused, \nwhile Ot ev\u0159i svou mysl aimed more at emotional resonance and interpreted esoteric \n\"knowledge\" and pseudoscientific authorities \u2013 in the context of the specific signs \nof disinformation with which this work operated, it is true that on the Aeronet website, \nquestioning of government authorities was slightly more frequent (which the analysis \nidentified in 87% of the examined articles compared to 73% in the articles published on the \nOtev\u0159i svou mysl website), on the other hand, questioning of expert knowledge was a more \nfrequent element on the Otev\u0159i svou mysl website (according to the analysis, this element \nwas present in 93% of the articles  from the sample, on the Aeronet web site it was 80% of  the \narticles ). Both author\u2019s  hypotheses were confirmed,  and both research questions were \nanswered using the results of the second analysis.   \n \n \n75 \n The potential contribution of this thesis lies not only in the verification \nof the disinformation nature of the two selected alternative media, but also in the analysis \nof the way , in which they inform , and what aspects do they choose for their way to  inform, \nwhile these aspects  can shape  the public opinion. The analysis also enabled a comparison \nof two different types of alternative content and showed that, although they differ \nstylistically and thematically, they ultimately use very similar methods of spr eading \nmanipulative messages. The results thus contribute to a deeper understanding of the \nfunctioning of disinformation websites and the emergence of disinformation content, \nincluding its essentials in the Czech media environment, and can serve as a basis  for further \nresearch and practical use - for example, in the field of media education or in the work \nof fact-checkers.  \nAlthough the attractiveness of alternative media for the audience was not the central \ntopic of this work, it cannot be completely ignored \u2013 especially regarding  the number \nof visitors  of the selected websites, which in the first year of the pandemic reached around \none million readers per month on both websites. It can therefore be argued that alternative \nwebsites represent real competition to traditional news channels. One reason for their \npopularity may be the desire of some readers to  encounter an opinion that they cannot find \nin standard media,  and they may miss the plurality of opinions in public media \u2013 the only \nexceptions are individual formats, such as the program me M\u00e1te slovo with Michaela  J\u00edlkov\u00e1,  \nwhich, however criticized, offers a platform to voices outside the mainstream. The issue \nof the attractiveness of alternative media leads to questions that go beyond the scope of this \ntheses , but could be the subject of separate research: Where is the line between representing \ndifferent opinions and interpreting false claims? What should news  that inform  look like , \naccording to the audience of alternative media, without contributing to  the spread \nof disinformation ? \nOne aspect that this thesis  could have paid more attention to is the specific way , \nin which disinformation websites work with expert studies \u2013 i.e. the phenomenon \nof misinterpretation of research and scientifically relevant studies. However, only some \nof the analysed  texts dealt with these studies (which is why it would not be methodologically \naccurate to systematically evaluate this aspect), and in cases where they occurred, they often \ninvolved significant shifts in meaning: for example, a study of the tra nsmission of infection, \nspecified in more detail in Chapter 7.2.2, operating on the principle of placing true \ninformation in a false context that completely distorted its original meaning.   \n \n \n76 \n Pou\u017eit \u00e9 prameny a literatura  \nAERONET.

We analyzed URLs cited in Twitter \nmessages before and after the temporary interruption of the vaccine development on \nSeptember 9, 2020 to investigate the presence of low credibility and malicious infor -\nmation. We show that the halt of the AstraZeneca clinical trials prompted tweets that \ncast doubt, fear and vaccine opposition. We discovered a strong presence of URLs \nfrom low credibility or malicious websites, as classified by independent fact-check -\ning organizations or identified by web hosting infrastructure features. Moreover, we \nidentified what appears to be coordinated operations to artificially promote some of \nthese URLs hosted on malicious websites.\nKeywords AstraZeneca vaccine\u00a0\u00b7 Coordinated URL promotion\u00a0\u00b7 Misinformation\n1 Introduction\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic that started in early 2020, social media platforms \nhave played a critical role in widely spreading information, regardless of its verac-\nity (Rosenberg et\u00a0 al. 2020). As COVID-19 vaccines moved through development, a \n * Sameera Horawalavithana \n sameera1@usf.edu\n * Adriana Iamnitchi \n a.iamnitchi@maastrichtuniversity.nl\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n449\n1 3Vaccination trials on\u00a0hold: malicious and\u00a0low credibility\u2026\nsignificant surge in misinformation and anti-vaccine narratives became evident on \nTwitter (Smith et\u00a0al. 2020; Bagherpour 2020). Twitter discussions about AstraZeneca, \na vaccine developed at Oxford University, were no exception to this as the vaccine has \nbeen mired in controversy ever since its inception (Jemielniak and Krempovych 2021).\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine development faced numerous challenges due to a temporary \nhalt of its trials in September 2020 caused by an unexplained illness in one of the par -\nticipants (Reuters 2021; Robbins et\u00a0al. 2020). Details surrounding the event were not \nthoroughly disclosed, which lead scientists to question the transparency of the vaccine \ndevelopment efforts (Cyranoski and Mallapaty 2020). The temporary interruption of \nthe AstraZeneca vaccine trials also sparked political debates as government officials, \nespecially in the United States, had been trying to fast-track its approval and roll-outs \n(Forbes 2020). As AstraZeneca quickly resumed its clinical trials and entered its final \nphase of development, safety issues and concerns about its efficacy intensified (Cyra-\nnoski and Mallapaty 2020; PBS 2020).\nThis paper investigates the information shared on Twitter in a period that marked an \nimportant step in the development of the AstraZeneca vaccine. We ask several research \nquestions in this study. To what extent is the presence of low credibility and malicious \ninformation about Astrazeneca vaccine related discussions in Twitter due to its global \nhalt/suspension? What are the properties of the URLs that share low credibility and \nmalicious information? Is there any coordinated behavior for promoting bad quality \ninformation, if so, how persistent is such behavior?\nWe focus on two time periods, before and after the temporary interruption of the \nvaccine development on September 9, 2020. While our focus in on AstraZeneca-related \ndiscussions, we also detected tweets that mentioned SputnikV, Moderna and Pfizer vac-\ncines with stories that cast doubt and fear towards the safety and efficacy of the vac-\ncines. A deeper analysis shows that vaccine-related stories are promoted by both low \ncredibility and malware-hosted websites. In contrast to the low credibility websites that \noften promote vaccination myths and conspiracy stories, the malware hosted on other \nwebsites can be used to trace the web searching activities of the Twitter audience inter -\nested in COVID-19 vaccines. For example, the properties of the most popular mali-\ncious URLs in two time periods are quite similar, such as short-lived newly created \ndomains, self-signed certificates, content management system and hosting geographical \nlocation.\nSome user accounts use this information to target specific communities with stories \npromoting certain vaccines favorably, while questioning others. For example, Russian-\nsponsored media outlets took advantage of the halt of trials to push narratives discredit-\ning the AstraZeneca vaccine and boost the promotion of SputnikV instead. We discov -\nered persistent groups of users engaged in the rapid propagation and artificial inflation \nof a particular URL through simultaneous tweeting. This behavior suggests potential \nsigns of coordination to promote malicious and low-credibility URLs on Twitter.\n450 S.\u00a0Horawalavithana et al.\n1 3\n2  Related work\nAlong factual information, misinformation and disinformation related to COVID-19 \nregularly circulate in social media (Huang and Carley 2020). As vaccines became \navailable, (mis)disinformation surrounding them started to increase and persist on \nTwitter (DeVerna et\u00a0 al. 2021). Combating the spread of (mis)disinformation and \nconspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 on social media has become a global con-\ncern as, even in the absence of any scientific evidence, it has increased the number \nof people hesitant to get vaccinated (Wilson and Wiysonge 2020; Chadwick et\u00a0al. \n2021).\nNumerous research efforts aimed to assess the prevalence of misinformation \nrelated to COVID-19 in social media. Pranesh et\u00a0al. (2021) quantified the magnitude \nof misinformation presence in COVID-19 related tweets across different languages. \nKarami et\u00a0al. (2021) showed that vaccine discussions on Twitter are evolving with \nnegative and non-negative attitudes on different issues. Their analysis revealed that \ntweets on topics related to vaccination sites, getting vaccines, and vaccine effective-\nness exhibit positive sentiment, while tweets about government strategies related to \nvaccination, vaccination hesitancy, vaccine immunity, and social distancing often \nsparked negative discussions. Yang et\u00a0al. (2020) and Sharma et\u00a0al. (2022) investi-\ngate URLs embedded in tweets to evaluate the credibility of the content at domain \nlevel. These studies highlight that there is a comparable presence of both low-quality \nsources and sources from mainstream media in Twitter. In addition, they found that \nsocial bots are most likely to engage with the promotion and amplification of low \ncredibility information.\nOther studies analyzed the extent to which different users engage with misinfor -\nmation. Teng et\u00a0 al. (2022) highlight that social bots\u2019 contribution to misinforma-\ntion is surprisingly low. The authors identified two user groups who engage with \nmisinformation: the strong-adherent users, who aim at supplying or/and promoting \nmisinformation for certain purposes, and the weak-adherent individuals, who are \noccasionally exposed to misinformation but are easily triggered to further spread \nmisinformation. Echoing the same sentiment, Silva et\u00a0 al. (2020) showed that the \nsignificant majority of both factual and misinformation tweets were generated by \nreal users (not bots) even though bot accounts tweeted more misinformation (8.5%) \nrelative to factual information (5.2%). Contrary to these findings, Yang et\u00a0al. (2020) \nobserved a higher-than-normal participation rate of bot accounts in both posting and \namplifying low-credibility content. Their results also show that bot-like tweeters \nattract more bot-like retweeters than human-like tweeters.\nThis paper builds on our previous analysis of Twitter discussions during a period \nof uncertainty in the AstraZeneca vaccine development (Horawalavithana et\u00a0 al. \n2021). In contrast to many previous research, we characterize low quality content \nvia both malicious and low credibility URL analysis to identify tweets which esca-\nlate community concerns with regards to vaccine efficacy. We also analyze the coor -\ndinated link-sharing behavior by revealing groups of users who share the same URL \nwithin unusually short time.\n451\n1 3Vaccination trials on\u00a0hold: malicious and\u00a0low credibility\u2026\n3  Data collection and\u00a0processing\nThe mistrust in what was perceived as rushed vaccine development during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has been reported to undermine people\u2019s intention to \nreceive the COVID-19 vaccines (Vivek 2021). In addition, concerns related to the \nside effects reported in vaccine clinical trials raised questions about their safety \n(Nuzhath et\u00a0al. 2020). One such major incident was reported in September 2020, \nwhen an unexplained illness appeared during the clinical trials for the AstraZen-\neca vaccine.\nWe collected tweets using the Twitter API from 1st of September 2020 to 15th of \nSeptember 2020. The original keywords used to collect this dataset are\u00a0  AstraZen-\neca, \u201cAstra Zeneca\u201d, AZD1222, COVID, vaccine, immunity, \u201cherd immunity\u201d, Bar -\nrington, and \u201cfocused protection\u201d.  We used the same keyword list used to collect a \nsimilar dataset released as part of the 2021 Grand Challenge of the North American \nSocial Network Conference (NASN) (NASN 2021). Our data collection cover many \nmissing tweets in the NASN dataset after September 9th 2021 (Horawalavithana \net\u00a0al. 2021). We used the vaccine-related keywords in the regex condition: pfizer OR \nastrazeneca OR moderna OR (sputnik AND vaccine) to select tweets relevant to our \nstudy.\nWe grouped the Twitter messages into two disjoint subsets based on their inclu-\nsion of URLs. The first subset contains 3,212,586 Twitter messages (by 1,788,788 \nusers) without URLs. The second subset consists of 3,958,864 messages (55% of all \nmessages) that contain at least one URL. These messages are shared by 1,267,873 \nusers and cite 3,247,946 distinct URLs from 167,186 distinct web domains. The \nnumber of such messages per day are presented in Fig.\u00a01.\nWe pre-processed this dataset to identify hashtags, user mentions, and URL \ndomains. We eliminated the URLs which link to other tweets. In addition, the \nexternal links (e.g., a tweet mentioning a YouTube video, or an external website \nFig. 1  Number of Twitter messages over time.

We \nobserve another spike on September 15th, where the majority of tweets (574) cite an \narticle related to COVID re-infection.4 There are some other tweets (354) citing an \narticle written about a whistle-blower named Dr. Yan who released a report suggest-\ning coronavirus was \u2018Lab Modified\u2019.5\nWe consider two periods in our analysis, before (September 1\u20138) and after (Sep-\ntember 9\u201315) the temporary interruption of the vaccine development on September \n9, 2020.

When \ncomparing the two periods, there is a significant increase in AstraZeneca men-\ntioned tweets (363.7% increase) in the second period. Additionally, we observed that \nPfizer mentioned tweets also increased significantly by 149.1%. We observed that \nSputnikV and Moderna vaccines mentioned tweets decreased by 50.2% and 57.5% \nrespectively. There is also a significant increase (149.36%) of tweets mentioning \nboth Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.\nWe used a pretrained embedding model universal-sentence-encoder6 provided in \nthe Top2Vec package (Angelov 2020) to identify topics in the tweets dataset from \nthe above mentioned two time frames. Using the default parameters, we obtained \n2,527 and 2,225 topics before and after the vaccine development halt, respectively. \nWe selected the top 10 topics from most occurring keywords from both time periods \nand performed a qualitative analysis (as shown in Tables\u00a0 1 and 2). We noticed that \nface mask-related topics are prevalent in the discussions after the vaccine develop-\nment halt. Twitter users have discussed about the usability and efficacy of the face-\nmasks and the importance of wearing one (see Appendix  Tables\u00a0 7 and 8 for sam-\nple tweets). Other topics include COVID-19 related deaths, safety, and testing. In \naddition, we identified tweets discussing unemployment due to COVID-19 or due to \nshutdown of businesses (see Appendix Table\u00a09 for sample tweets).Table 1  Top-10 topics identified from Tweet texts ( September 1\u20138)\nTopic label Top 10 words # Tweets\nVaccines Vaccin, antivax, polio, smallpox, hpv, pox, vacc, vax, chickenpox, \ntyphoid41,634\nCovid Safety Aye, awhil, suscept, exagger, blindli, isnt, huh, arent, diplomaci, ahem 27,520\nPolitics Trump, djt, trumpster, drumpf, maga, trumpism, donald, trumper, \nlibtard, honestli25,641\nCovid Deaths Deaths, death, die, mortem, dead, lethal, rip, tue, morbid, fatal 22,972\nCovid Related News Amp, vox, rrb, rha, interf, wire, slash, tc, pedal, tele 22,896\nFacemasks Mask, facemask, unmask, helmet, helm, wig, visor, bandana, hide, \nconceal22,837\nDonald Trump Vaccin, antivax, trump, djt, drumpf, trumpster, trumpism, barron, \nkushner, hpv20,994\nChild Safety School, schoolchildren, preschool, classroom, homeschool, teacher, \nuncov, kindergarten, isd, teach13,173\nCovid Tests Test, tester, retest, assay, exam, swab, trial, checkup, appt, dmv 12,914\nFlu Virus Flu, influenza, flue, sars, sicker, swine, cdc, vaccin, ill, ebola 11,325\n6 https:// tfhub. dev/ google/ unive rsal- sente nce- encod er/4.\n454 S.\u00a0Horawalavithana et al.\n1 3\n4  URL analysis\nWe analyze the URLs cited in the tweets to identify the extent of sharing poor \nquality information that were originated from outside of the platform. To this end, \nwe group the URLs into low credibility URLs (Sect.\u00a0 4.1) and malicious URLs \n(Sect.\u00a04.2).\n4.1  Low credibility information sources\nWe aim to investigate how Twitter users react to low credibility information sources \nacross the two different periods. We grouped the web domains according to the clas-\nsification made by two sources (i.e., Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC 2020) and the \nFactual (Factual 2020). We considered as low credibility those web domains that \nwere in at least one of the following categories: questionable sources, conspiracy-\npseudoscience, or (very)low credibility rating. We identified 14,215 (2%) URLs \nfrom 377 low credibility information sources that are shared in 42,271 (2.7%) mes-\nsages posted before the halt of trials, and 12,768 URLs from 363 low credibility \nsources shared in 36,906 (2.7%) messages posted after the halt of trials. Table\u00a0 3 \nshows the top 10 most popular domains by number of tweets from each time frame \nof interest.\nthegatewaypundit.com  and rt.com  are the most popular low credibil-\nity web domains by number of mentions (4326 and 3626) and number of engaged \nusers (1947 and 1971) despite publishing fewer URLs/articles than other domains \nin the period corresponding to before the halt. These two web sources are known for \nspreading propaganda and promoting conspiracy theories in their articles. After the \nhalting of the AstraZeneca trials, the most shared low credibility web domains were \nrt.com  and zerohedge.com. Both domains are classified with low to very low Table 2  Top-10 topics identified from Tweet texts (September 9\u201315)\nTopic label Top 10 words # Tweets\nFacemasks Mask, facemask, unmask, helmet, helm, safeguard, conceal, hide, \nvisor, impun29,824\nVaccines Vaccin, antivax, polio, smallpox, hpv, narrow, vax, pox, cdc, bcg 25,316\nCovid Safety aye, awhil, arent, bhi, diplomaci, isnt, exagger, webpag, meh, blindli 22,205\nCovid Related News Amp, vox, rha, interf, wire, circuit, ion, tele, pedal, slash 20,691\nDonald Trump Trump, djt, trumpster, drumpf, maga, trumper, donald, trumpism, lyin, \nbluster20,172\nCovid Deaths Deaths, death, mortem, die, lethal, dead, fatal, morbid, rip, tue 19,759\nVaccines Vaccin, antivax, polio, smallpox, pox, hpv, chickenpox, vax, typhoid, \ncdc18,073\nUnemployment due \nto CovidWork, jobless, quit, iam, job, awhil, ive, dole, newsengin, workload 14,881\nCovid Safety Aye, exagger, weve, plz, blindli, let, suscept, breweri, section, about 13,000\nPolitics Biden, vp, joe, djt, trumpster, trump, obama, msnbc, sotu, mccain 12,537\n455\n1 3Vaccination trials on\u00a0hold: malicious and\u00a0low credibility\u2026\ncredibility due to the promotion of pseudoscience misinformation. During both peri-\nods, we also observed that sputniknews.com  made it to the top-10 of low cred-\nibility domains shared in Twitter. Similar to other Russian state-sponsored outlets in \nthe list, sputniknews.com exploited the halt of the AstraZeneca trials to push \nnarratives discrediting the vaccine and boost the promotion of SputnikV instead.\nThe list of most popular low credibility web domains did not changed drastically \nacross the two distinct time periods, but their rankings did (as shown in Fig.\u00a0 3a\u00a0and \nb).\nWe also noted some cases in which tweets citing the same URL often share the \nsame article heading. These users promoted certain topics through massive repeti-\ntion of messages via injecting URLs. For example, an article published in zero-\nhedge.com  was in the Top-10 most popular URLs on the day when the AstraZen-\neza vaccine development halted.7 However, this article tried to build an alternative \nframe highlighting a statement by the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the \nissue instead of reporting the details of the main event.Table 3  Twitter sharing characteristics for low credibility domains as identified by MBFC\nWe also include the overall ranking of the low credibility domains out of all domains in the datasetPeriod Domain # Tweets # Users # URLs Overall rank\nSeptember 1\u20138 thegatewaypundit.com 4326 1947 358 27\nrt.com 3626 1971 687 31\nzerohedge.com 2948 1815 237 36\ndailymail.co.uk 2548 1392 1122 45\nfoxnews.com 2281 1196 622 52\ngranma.cu 1536 486 192 86\nwesternjournal.com 1459 876 277 93\nfr24news.com 1414 21 1407 96\nsputniknews.com 1363 602 649 99\nnews18.com 1070 273 660 129\nSeptember 9\u201315 rt.com 2972 1478 646 36\nzerohedge.com 2930 1692 237 39\ndailymail.co.uk 2485 1411 1039 49\nfoxnews.com 2273 1390 616 56\ngranma.cu 1864 518 238 72\nthegatewaypundit.com 1589 902 208 83\nsputniknews.com 1509 648 698 91\nfr24news.com 1188 15 1184 108\nnews18.com 879 270 541 137\nwesternjournal.com 727 493 177 169\n7 https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/ft-confirms-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-caused-serious-spinal-\nissues-test-patient\n456 S.\u00a0Horawalavithana et al.\n1 3\n4.2  Malicious URLs\nWe used VirusTotal (VT) (VirusTotal 2021) to extract the maliciousness of \nURLs. VT provides the state-of-the-art aggregated intelligence for domains and \nURLs, and relies on more than 70 third-party updated antivirus (AV) engines. For \nall distinct URLs in our collection, we extracted VT scan reports via querying the \npublicly available API. Each VT scan report contains of the verdict from every \nAV engine, information related to the URL such as first and last seen dates of the \nURL in the VT system, hosting IP address, final redirected URL (if applicable), \ncontent length, etc. Each AV engine in a VT report detects if the URL is mali-\ncious or not. In order to indicate the maliciousness of a URL, we looked at how \nmany engines flag it as such.\nIn this study, we labelled a URL as malicious if at least one AV engine detects \nit as malicious. Such malicious URLs, in general, are either phishing websites \nthat steal user credentials and/or personally identifiable information from victims \nor malware hosting websites that attempt to install malware on victims\u2019 devices. \nBefore suspending the trial, we observed that 35.9% of the malicious URLs uti-\nlize URL shortening services with top 4 services being bit.ly, tinyurl.\ncom, ow.ly and goo.su whereas as only 20.2% of benign URLs utilize such \nservices. We noticed rather different proportions after the trail. 25.9% of the mali-\ncious URLs utilize URL shortening services with top 4 services being bit.ly, \now.ly, hubs.ly, and rb.gy whereas only 7.2% of benign URLs utilize such \nservices. This observation is consistent with the trend that malicious actors are \nincreasingly using URL shortening services to camouflage malicious URLs to \npresent non-suspicious-looking URLs to users (FAS 2020). We found that 30.80% \nand 40.66% of the domains related to malicious URLs are ranked below 100K by (a)Top-10 shared domains (Before) (b)Top-10 share ddomain s(After)\nFig. 3  Twitter sharing characteristics of most popular domains.   a and b Show the Top-10 domains by \nthe number of distinct URLs in each time frame. The size of the markers in this plot are proportional to \nthe number of URLs associated with the domain\n457\n1 3Vaccination trials on\u00a0hold: malicious and\u00a0low credibility\u2026\nAlexa Amazon (2021) before and after the halt respectively (the lower the rank \nvalue, the higher the popularity). This indicates the alarming reality that mali-\ncious actors are able to reach a large user base reaping a high return on invest-\nment for their attacks.\nWe further analyzed the malicious URLs to identify related malicious URLs. To \nthis end, based on the lexical features in the literature Silva et\u00a0 al. (2021) and the \nhosting features mentioned in Table\u00a0 4, we clustered the malicious URLs using PCA/\nOPTICS algorithm. While lexical features identify characteristics related to URLs \nthemselves, hosting features, extracted from Farsight Passive DNS (PDNS) data \n(Farsight Security 2021), capture the characteristics of underlying hosting infra-\nstructure. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 4, these features collectively identify 4 distinct malicious \nURL clusters. We manually verified the accuracy of the top 2 clusters by check -\ning the web page content, registration information and domain certificate informa-\ntion. The clusters observed in the two time frame are quite similar in their properties \nsuch as short-lived newly created domains, self-signed certificates, content man-\nagement system (CMS) technology and hosting geographical location. We further \nanalyzed the clusters based on the maliciousness of URLs. The maliciousness of a \nURL can loosely be measured by #VT, the number of VT positives. An interesting \nobservation is that URLs belonging to different maliciousness levels share similar \nlexical and hosting features. We further analyzed these malicious URLs in terms \nof where they are hosted. Unexpectedly, we found that 80.04% of these malicious \nURLs are hosted in content delivery networks (CDNs) such as Cloudflare and Aka-\nmai. While CDNs provide fast delivery of content across the globe through their \ndistributed computing infrastructure, we believe a key reason why malicious actors \nutilize such services is to improve attack agility and stay below the radar of mali-\ncious domain detection mechanisms in place. This observation is further reinforced \nwith the increased utilization of public cloud computing infrastructure (33.5% of all \nmalicious URLs) sharing hosting IPs with tens of thousands of unrelated domains, \nwhich are mostly benign. Such shared IPs are usually not blocked in practice due to \nthe collateral damage.\n5  Coordinated URL sharing behavior\nPrevious work on detecting coordination has focused on accounts who consistently \namplify/boost sources of information (e.g., users who co-retweet the same tweets) \nin a social media platform\u00a0 (Keller et\u00a0 al. 2020; Pacheco et\u00a0 al. 2021; Weber and \nNeumann 2020). In this work, we are interested in those accounts who introduce \nnew information into the platform, specifically in the form of URLs. One of our \nobjectives is to characterize the URL sharing activities in the COVID-19 vaccine \nrelated discussions. To this end, we describe the presence of two groups of URLs \n(i.e., low-credibility and malicious URLs) in Twitter tweets. According to previous \nresearch\u00a0(Pacheco et\u00a0al. 2021; Kin Wai et\u00a0al. 2021), low-credibility URLs are often \npromoted by coordinated groups of users in diverse contexts (e.g., U.S. elections, \nHong Kong protests, and the Syrian civil war).\n458 S.\u00a0Horawalavithana et al.\n1 3\nTable 4  Details of the URL hosting and lexical features\nFeature Description Type\nVT_Dur URL duration in VirusTotal (VT) Hosting\nPDNS_Dur Domain duration in Passive Domain Name Resolution (PDNS) Hosting\n#IPs # hosting IPs Hosting\n#Queries # times the domain is accessed Hosting\n#NSes # Name servers Hosting\nIs_NS Do the apexes of the domain name and NS domain name match?

Each point is a URL, and it is \ncolored according to the cluster it belongs\n459\n1 3Vaccination trials on\u00a0hold: malicious and\u00a0low credibility\u2026\nTo detect coordinated link-sharing behavior, we employed the methodology pro-\nposed in Giglietto et\u00a0 al. (2020), where coordination is defined as \u201cdifferent users \nwho repeatedly share the same URLs in an unusually short period of time.\u201d The \ncomputation of this time threshold is based on the analysis of inter-arrival times \nbetween tweets of the same URL for each period of interest. Particularly, the timing \nbehavior of the top quickest shared URLs, as identified based on the time differences \nbetween consecutive tweets, is further explored. The desired threshold is computed \nby calculating the median time that it takes these top URLs to reach a certain pro-\nportion of their total shares. As can be seen, the inference of this threshold relies on \nthree parameters: (1) the percentage of top URLs for the analysis, (2) the number \nof consecutive tweets to consider in the inter-arrival analysis (e.g., time difference \nbetween first and second post, or first and last post), and (3) the proportion of tweets \neach URL needs to reach in order to compute the median time.\nWe experimented with different configurations of these parameters to identify a \nreasonable coordination time threshold, in which simultaneous postings of the same \nURL would be considered unusual compared to the activity patterns of the entire \nperiod. The time threshold is mostly sensitive to both the percentage of quickest \nURLs and the number of consecutive tweets considered in the time difference analy -\nsis. For example, when considering high percentage of URLs (e.g., 25%, 50% or \n75%) or a large number of consecutive tweets, the coordination interval would be \ntoo long and not sufficiently strict. Stringent time thresholds were found when con-\nsidering smaller values for these parameters. Specifically, we considered the median \ntime that it takes the 10% quickest URLs, ranked by their time differences between \nthe first and second posts, to reach 50% of their shares. The threshold was 5 s for \nboth periods, before and after the halt of trials.\nWe compared the coordinated networks that spanned across the two different time \nperiods: September 1\u20138 and September 9\u201315, which correspond to Twitter activi-\nties from before and after the halt of the AZ trials, respectively. We only considered \nURLs that were shared at least twice and by different user accounts. From Septem-\nber 1 to September 8, 143,782 URLs were posted in 705,917 tweets. From Septem-\nber 9 to September 10, 128,426 URLs were posted in 643,667 tweets.\nFor each time period, we constructed the network of timely-coordinated accounts \nby considering only those pairs of users who post the same URL within the corre-\nsponding time interval threshold. The edge weights between users correspond to the \nnumber of URLs posted simultaneously within the threshold. In an attempt to reduce \nthe chances of false positives (i.e., simultaneous postings happening by chance), we \nremove from these networks connections with an edge weight of 1. We acknowl-\nedged that additional filtering strategies could reduce even further the amount of \nfalse positives in the network. For example, inspecting the time difference between \nthe publication date of an article and the timestamps of simultaneous tweets could \nreveal instances of organic behavior (e.g., crowds sharing synchronously due to a \nshare-button functionality on websites). Unfortunately, we failed to scrape accurate \npublication dates for many articles due to web pages being inactive or changes to the \noriginal date caused by updates.\nTable\u00a0 5 shows a comparison between the coordinated networks corresponding to \neach time period we investigate across various network properties. We found that \n460 S.\u00a0Horawalavithana et al.\n1 3\nthere are no drastic differences in terms of the size, density, and number of unique \nURLs shared between the two networks across different periods. Most connected \ncomponents in both periods consist of dyads and triads (89% in the before network \nand 90% in the after network).\nTo investigate the level of trustworthiness of the news sources present in each \ncoordinated network, we grouped the web domains according to their credibility rat-\nings as mentioned in Sect.\u00a0 4.1. We identified 385 URLs from 34 low credibility web \ndomains, 2860 URLs from 77 credibility web domains, and 12,895 URLs from 1387 \nweb domains with unknown credibility score. Figure\u00a0 5a\u00a0and  b show the coordinated \nnetworks, from before and after the halt of trials, induced on only those network \ncomponents that consist of at least one coordinated connection sharing credibility \nor low credibility domains. That is, we ignore those components in the coordinated \nnetwork that exclusively shared domains with unknown credibility. The induced \nnetwork for the period before the halt consists of 508 nodes and 820 edges (out of \nwhich 56 are to low credibility sources, which is 2% of the total edges in the original \ncoordinated network). The induced network for the period after the halt consists of \n444 nodes and 515 edges (out of which 58 are to low credibility sources, which also \nrepresents 2% of the total edges in the non-induced network).\nSimilarly, we also investigated the level of maliciousness of URLs in the coordi-\nnated networks by inducing on network components with at least one connection to \na URL classified as malicious by VT. We identified 623 malicious URLs from 52 \ndifferent web domains. The induced network for the period before the halt consists \nof 276 nodes and 632 edges (out of which 188 are to malicious sources, which is \n6% of the total edges in the original coordinated network). The induced network for \nthe period after the halt consists of 222 nodes and 273 edges (out of which 130 are \nto malicious sources, which represents 4.7% of the total edges in the non-induced \nnetwork).\nThese observations suggest that the extent to which both low credibility and \nmalicious sources are promoted by coordinated groups of users is relatively similar \nacross the two time frames. The number of coordinated nodes that overlap between \nthe two different periods is 314 for the induced networks by credibility and 147 \nfor the induced networks by maliciousness, which is more than half of the users in \nboth cases. This highlights that groups of coordinated users, who promote either Table 5  Basic network \nproperties for the two \ncoordinated networks from \nbefore and after the halt of trialsStatistics Before (September \n1\u20138)After \n(September \n9\u201315)\nNumber of Nodes 2794 2528\nNumber of Edges 2998 2745\nNumber of URLs 8831 7420\nNumber of Domains 1136 1030\nConnected Components 1039 919\nNumber of Dyads 774 699\nNumber of Triads 148 124\n461\n1 3Vaccination trials on\u00a0hold: malicious and\u00a0low credibility\u2026\nlow credibility or malicious URLs, are persistent across the two different periods we \nstudy.\nTable\u00a0 6 shows the top-10 most popular low credibility sources shared by coordi-\nnated users across the two periods of interest. We found that, in both time frames, \nthe most popular sources were zerohedge.com , news18.com, and sput-\nniknews.com . The first is a website in the conspiracy-pseudoscience category, \nand the last two are classified as questionable sources with a poor fact-checking \nrecord. We observed a high presence of Russian web sources among the low cred-\nibility domains in the coordinated networks. Some are well-known domains such as \nsputniknews.com  and rt.com , and others less popular such as cnnn.ru  and \ninosminews.ru , which we found are news aggregators that often re-publish arti-\ncles from the first two. We noticed that web domains shared by coordinated groups \nremained relatively similar in terms of their popularity across the two different peri-\nods of interest. Finally, we found that only a small number of coordinately shared \nURLs (26) from two web domains are classified as both low credibility and mali-\ncious: rt.com  and tmz.com .\n6  Conclusions\nIn times of crisis, whether political or health-related, online disinformation is ampli-\nfied by social media promotion of alternative media outlets (Horawalavithana et\u00a0al. \n2020; 2021). This study adds to the growing body of work (Ferrara et\u00a0al. 2020) that \ninvestigates the misinformation activity during the COVID-19 crisis by analyzing \na Twitter dataset collected between September 1 and 15, 2020. This period covers (a)Septem ber1\u20138 (b)Septem ber9\u201315\nFig. 5  Network of coordinated users before (left) and after (right) the halt of AstraZeneca trials.

Our contribu-\ntions complement previous observations (Horawalavithana et\u00a0al. 2021; Singh et\u00a0al. \n2020) in multiple ways.\nFirst, we found a significant increase of AstraZeneca vaccine mentioned tweets \nin the period following the halt of AstraZeneca vaccine trials. These messages also \ncontain topics related to the usability and efficacy of the facemasks, vaccine safety \nand COVID related deaths. We also detect tweets that mention SputnikV, Moderna \nand Pfizer vaccines with the stories that aimed at casting doubts and fear towards \nthe safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. This vaccination trial event was also \nlinked to multiple other COVID-19 stories. For example, politicized discussions \nconcerning the decisions by government officials to roll-out prematurely the vac-\ncines were also prominent. On the other hand, topics related to unemployment due \nto COVID-19 or due to shutdown of businesses were popular after the vaccination \ntrial event.\nSecond, we discover a strong presence of malicious and low-credibility infor -\nmation sources shared on Twitter messages. Not only URLs from low-credibility \nsources, as classified by independent fact-checking organizations, were present in \nthe dataset, but many of them pointed to pages with malicious code. We found that \na significant portion of these low-credibility and malicious URLs (36%) used URL \nshortening services to a greater extent than non-malicious URLs (<1%). In addition, Table 6  Twitter sharing characteristics for low credibility URLs posted by users found in the coordinated \nnetworks from before and after the halt of AstraZeneca trials\nPeriod Domain # Tweets # Users # URLs\nSeptember 1\u20138 zerohedge.com 152 12 47\nnews18.com 89 6 24\nsputniknews.com 44 6 21\nwesternjournal.com 33 3 16\ndailymail.co.uk 31 13 15\nyc.news 28 4 7\ntheepochtimes.com 26 3 13\nrt.com 21 8 8\nbreitbart.com 18 3 9\nfoxnews.com 17 4 7\nSeptember 9\u201315 zerohedge.com 198 11 19\nnews18.com 68 6 19\nsputniknews.com 60 6 30\nfoxnews.com 37 6 14\ntheepochtimes.com 34 5 16\nrt.com 28 9 9\nwesternjournal.com 23 5 11\ndailymail.co.uk 22 9 11\nbreitbart.com 22 6 9\nyc.news 20 4 5\n463\n1 3Vaccination trials on\u00a0hold: malicious and\u00a0low credibility\u2026\nthey were usually hosted on well-established and reputable content delivery net-\nworks in an attempt, we believe, to avoid detection.\nThird, we found similar properties of the malicious URLs shared before and after \nthe vaccine development halt event. For example, most popular malicious URLs \nin two time periods are quite similar in their properties such as short-lived newly \ncreated domains, self-signed certificates, content management system and hosting \ngeographical location. Moreover, URLs belonging to different maliciousness levels \nshare similar lexical and hosting features.\nFinally, we discovered potential signs of coordination to promote malicious and \nlow-credibility URLs on Twitter. Specifically, we identified groups of users who \npotentially engage in the rapid propagation and artificial inflation of a particu-\nlar URL through simultaneous tweeting. Our observations suggest that the extent \nto which both low credibility and malicious sources are promoted by coordinated \ngroups of users is relatively similar across the two time periods before and after the \nvaccine development halt event. The code and the dataset used in this work are pub-\nlicly available (De\u00a0Silva et\u00a0al. 2022).\nOur analysis is useful for multiple stakeholders ranging from individuals, edu-\ncators, health professionals, journalists, researchers and governments. According \nto the Surgeon General of the United States, understanding the malign objectives \naround COVID-19 discussions would help to reduce confusion and mistrust around \nvaccines and promote public health efforts (Vivek 2021). In this work, we press the \nneeds to extend the definition of COVID-19 related malign content into both low-\ncredibility and malicious content types. This would open new directions for jour -\nnalists and researchers to broaden health misinformation research done with social \nmedia datasets. In addition, they can identify high quality information sources to \navoid amplifying malign content. As these malign content can change the perception \nof general public towards participation in future vaccine trials, we urge health pro-\nfessionals to better inform vulnerable communities. We also show how the malign \ncontent spreads across Twitter with potential signs of coordination. This might be \nhelpful for individuals to identify potential coordination campaigns and avoid ampli-\nfying malign content unwittingly. Educators can use our findings to share com-\nmon tactics used by bad actors and use them as evidence to improve educational \nprograms.\nFurther work is needed to fully comprehend the dubious objectives of bad actors \nactive in times of crisis. For example, bad actors might have chosen this event strate-\ngically to maximize the spread of low quality information. These actors can deploy \nthe same strategy in future conversations, thus having content moderation tech-\nniques to limit what they can share is important. However, we can only speculate on \nthe motivation behind the use of malware shared along with vaccine-related stories. \nBad actors can use this strategy to target specific user communities with the new \nstories promoting certain vaccines favorably, while questioning others (FAS 2020). \nOn the other hand, the low-credibility news sources might have reported this event \nopportunistically in an attempt to promote vaccine hesitancy. People might have \nengaged with these low quality sources to watch out the information space around \nCOVID-19 vaccines. According to (Smith et\u00a0al. 2020), there is a deficit of high qual-\nity information sources to seek vaccine information. Bad actors use this information \n464 S.\u00a0Horawalavithana et al.\n1 3\ndeficit as an advantage to push low quality information. We believe this analysis \ncan be extended in understanding the role of bad actors during similar emotionally-\ncharged conversations in the future. Another direction is to analyze the change of \npublic perception around COVID-19 vaccines before and after the issues reported in \nthe vaccine trials or the exposure to the news of side effects.\nAppendix A\u00a0Example tweets in\u00a0Twitter discussions\nSee Tables\u00a07, 8 and 9.\nTable 7  An excerpt from tweets discussing face masks (September 1\u20138)\nTweets\nWear a mask, covid is https://t. co/ fCKTD lvDNF\nThink twice before wearing a face shield to protect against COVID-19 instead of a cloth face mask\u2014\nhere\u2019s why https://t. co/ 4DYER lEbd9 https://t. co/ fJeOt gT7zA\n@NBCNews Protect yourself From Covid 19 Use Mask &amp; Facial Shield (see photo).Remember \nthat on the street &amp; in public Transportation People R wearing the mask Incorrectly.

Analyzing approximately 47 million Facebook posts, this study investigates the interactions\nof around 170 million users with news pages, revealing distinct patterns based on political orientations. While users generally\nprefer content that reflects their political biases, the extent of engagement varies even among individuals with similar ideological\nleanings. Specifically, political biases heavily influence commenting behaviors, particularly among users leaning towards the center-\nleft and the right. Conversely, the \u2019likes\u2019 from center-left and centrist users are more indicative of their political affiliations. This\nresearch illuminates the complex relationship between social media behavior and political polarization, offering new insights into\nthe manifestation of ideological divisions online.\nIndex Terms \u2014Social Media, Polarization, Selective Exposure, News Consumption.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nTHe World Wide Web has vastly increased information\naccessibility, transforming how information is distributed\nand consumed globally. This evolution has revolutionized\ncommunication methods, erasing geographical and temporal\nconstraints. Over recent decades, expanding social networks\nand shifting public discourse to digital platforms have led\nscholars to explore how users interact with information and\nform behavioral clusters, often challenging traditional expec-\ntations. It is well-documented that online users tend to engage\nwith information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs, typi-\ncally ignoring conflicting viewpoints [1], [2]. Such behaviors\ncreate echo chambers, where like-minded individuals reinforce\neach other\u2019s views [3], [4], [5]. Such configurations, alongside\ngrowing polarization, manifest with varying intensity across\ndifferent social media platforms [6], suggesting that the users\u2019\nbase as well as platform designs and algorithms, which aim to\nmaximize engagement, play a significant role in shaping these\nsocial dynamics.\nExisting literature [7] suggests that although individuals\ngenerally prefer political news that aligns with their pre-\nexisting beliefs, they do not entirely ignore opposing view-\npoints. Conversely, Guess [8] finds that most users gravitate\ntowards centrist news outlets despite a small, highly engaged\ngroup favoring partisan sources. These patterns indicate a\nnotable convergence in the information available to the broader\npublic. However, the ability of individuals to completely shield\nthemselves from conflicting information is limited due to\nthe minimal control they have over the content presented\nto them and the dynamics of information spread on social\nmedia platforms. Notably, \u2019weak ties\u2019\u2014connections between\nloosely affiliated individuals like acquaintances or distant\nrelatives\u2014are crucial in spreading new information across\nsocial networks [9].\nNotably, most content users interact with on social media\nis not actively sought but is delivered through a network\nalgorithm tailored to maximize user engagement. This char-\nCorresponding author: W. Quattrociocchi (email: wal-\nter.quattrociocchi@uniroma1.it).acteristic is pivotal as it may foster unrecognized behavioral\npatterns, complicating efforts to measure such effects. Due\nto concerns over potential manipulation by malicious actors,\nsocial networks often refrain from disclosing the specifics\nof these algorithms. Sunstein, in his book Republic: Divided\nDemocracy in the Age of Social Media [10], discusses the Age\nof the Algorithm , where users lack control over their news\nconsumption, inadvertently contributing to the formation of\necho chambers.\nNot all users exhibit polarization similarly. However, their\nbehaviors show significant nuances. Zaller observes that polit-\nically engaged citizens are particularly receptive to messages\nthat align with their beliefs [11]. Similarly, Taber and Lodge\nfind that highly partisan users are more likely to embrace\nsupporting arguments while dismissing contrary ones with-\nout question [12]. This suggests that increasing polarization\ncomplicates efforts to mitigate it, and using counterfactuals\nmight even be counterproductive [2]. The debate over which\npolitical group is more prone to selective exposure and biased\ninformation processing remains unresolved. Some studies in-\ndicate that conservatives are more likely to engage in such\nbehaviors [13], [14], [15], while others present contradictory\nfindings [16], [17], [18]. Furthermore, there is no consensus\non cross-party discussions; Barber \u00b4a suggests that liberals are\nmore involved in cross-party interactions [19], whereas Wu\nargues that conservatives are more likely to engage in such\ndiscussions [20].\nIn this study, we explore the phenomenon of selective\nexposure by analyzing how about 170 million Facebook users\ninteract with approximately 47 million posts from news agen-\ncies with varying political leanings. We specifically measure\nthe intensity of selective exposure and assess whether users\nprefer specific ideologies or news agencies. The analysis is\nstructured around several distinct scenarios of user selectivity:\n\u2022users who are not selective at all;\n\u2022users who are selective both in terms of pages viewed\nand the political leaning of the pages;\n\u2022users who are selective only in terms of political leaning;\n\u2022users who are selective in terms of pages viewed.arXiv:2407.03773v1  [cs.SI]  4 Jul 2024\n2\nBy categorizing user behavior into these scenarios, we\naim to uncover the extent and nature of selective exposure,\nidentifying whether it is more pronounced towards particular\nideologies or news providers.\nWe find that all users exhibit strong selectivity in terms\nof political leaning, a phenomenon explained mainly by a\nmarked preference for specific pages [21], [22]. However,\nthis preference does not fully account for the leaning-based\nselective exposure observed in specific user groups. These\nresults are crucial for understanding the primary drivers of\nselective exposure and the resultant polarization within online\ncommunities. Our framework enables an examination of the\nrole political affiliation plays in the selectivity exhibited by\nusers. The structure of this paper is organized as follows:\nInitially, we discuss related works that explore the concepts\nof polarization, the echo chamber hypothesis, and their in-\nteractions with social media. We then describe the theoretical\nmethods used in our analysis, including entropy as a proxy for\nmeasuring selective exposure and two randomization strategies\nto evaluate the robustness of our findings. Following this,\nwe detail the patterns of user activity concentration and\ndemonstrate how this concentration aligns predominantly with\nideological page biases. The paper concludes by presenting\nevidence of leaning-driven selectivity, predominantly among\nusers who follow pages with right and center-left biases.\nII. R ELATED WORKS\nA. Polarization and Echo Chambers\nThe prevailing hypothesis suggests that echo chambers\non social media significantly influence social dynamics by\namplifying similar opinions and minimizing opposing ones,\nfostering homophily and polarization [5]. This effect is of-\nten exacerbated by the emergence of intolerance in online\ndiscussions [23], [24], which further polarizes interactions\n[25], [26], [27], [28]. Numerous studies employing diverse\nalgorithms and methodologies substantiate these observations\n[29], [30], [31], [32], including Garimella\u2019s work [4], which\nuses the Walktrap Controversy metric to measure segregation\nin discussion networks on polarizing topics. Additionally,\nSalloum [33] investigates how network size, edge count, and\ndegree distribution influence polarization scores, proposing\nmethods to mitigate these biases. Global events such as Brexit\n[34], vaccine debates [35], and climate change discussions\n[36] frequently act as catalysts for the formation of echo\nchambers. The political bias of news agencies covering these\nevents significantly contributes to these dynamics, as studies\nindicate that highly polarized user clusters often form around\nspecific news pages [37], [21], distinguished by their narrative\nand selective biases [38]. It is crucial to differentiate between\naffective and ideological polarization. Affective polarization,\nor psychological polarization [39], occurs when opposing\ngroups harbor feelings of dislike and distrust towards each\nother. In contrast, ideological polarization involves differing\nviews that do not necessarily include moral judgments of the\nopposing group. Affective polarization is particularly noted\nin the partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans\nin the United States [40] and is increasingly prevalent onsocial media. This rise is attributed to the ease of identifying\na user\u2019s political leanings, which complicates civil cross-\nparty dialogue, reinforces social and political identities, and\npromotes negative stereotyping of opposing groups.\nB. The interplay between social media and polarization\nWhile there is broad consensus that social networks often\nserve as arenas for polarization and echo chambers, the precise\nmechanisms through which these platforms influence these\nphenomena are still being explored [6]. Concerns about the\nrole of social media and search engines in filtering news,\npotentially exacerbating polarization, remain significant [10],\n[41]. Although highly polarized users tend to form homoge-\nneous clusters, such filtering effects might be mitigated by\nsystems like those proposed by Garimella [42]. Conversely,\nstudies indicate that exposure to contrarian news sources\nmay actually increase political polarization [43], [44], and\nintroducing users who believe in conspiracy theories to fact-\ncheckers could be ineffective or even counterproductive [2],\n[45]. The impact of algorithmically tailored feeds on polar-\nization has also been critically examined [46], [47], [48],\n[49]. These studies assess the interactions between algorithmic\nrecommendations and societal forces, comparing their effects\nto those produced by non-tailored feeds. The findings suggest\nthat personalized feeds may not significantly increase polar-\nization, pointing to other factors as potential drivers behind\nthe observed polarization on these platforms.\nIII. M ATERIALS AND METHODS\nA. Entropy and selective exposure\nTo fully measure the phenomenon of selective exposure\ndefined as a tendency for people both consciously and un-\nconsciously to seek out material that supports their existing\nattitudes and opinions and to actively avoid material that\nchallenges their views [50], one would need the full digital\ntrace of a user and the reasons that motivated the user to\ninteract with one page instead of another. In its absence, we\nuse the entropy of the interactions as a proxy. We recall that\nShannon Entropy is commonly used in information theory to\nmeasure the concentration of a distribution. In our framework,\nusers with low entropy are the most selective, while those\ninteracting with different bias levels uniformly have high\nentropy.\nIn particular, here we also employ some of its properties\nthat arise when considering sub-partitions.\nConsider a set universe Uand a partition \u03c3={s1, . . . , sn}\nof it. We denote |si| \u2261ci. Suppose that \u03c1is a partition of \u03c3,\ni.e. if for each r\u2208\u03c1, r\u2286si\u2208\u03c3for exactly one i. Then, each\nset of \u03c1can be written as:\n\u03c1={s1\n1, . . . , s1\nc1, . . . , si\n1, . . . , si\nci, sn\n1, . . . , sn\ncn},\ni.e.si\njits the j\u2212th subset of si.\nNow, consider a random variable X\u03c1having image in \u03c1.\nObviously, X\u03c1can be naturally extended to X\u03c3having image\nin\u03c3. We define p(X\u03c1\u2208si\nj)\u2261pi\nj. It follows, p(X\u03c1\u2208si) =\np(X\u03c3\u2208si) =Pci\nj=1pi\nj\u2261pi. We have that:\n3\nH(X\u03c1) =\u2212X\niX\njpi\njlogpi\nj=\n=\u2212X\niX\nj \npi\njlog(pi) +pi\njlogpi\nj\npi!\n=\n=\u2212X\nipilog(pi)\u2212X\nipiX\nj\u00afpi\njlog \u00afpi\nj,\nwhere \u00afpi\nj=pi\nj\npi. In a more compact form, we have obtained:\nH(X\u03c1) =H(X\u03c3) +X\nipiH(X\u03c1|X\u03c3\u2208si). (1)\nIn this work, we consider interactions over pages having\na certain political leaning. Therefore, given the general set\nof spaces, \u03c3will be the partition induced by their political\nleaning, while \u03c1will be simply the partition in which each\npage is considered alone.\nHaving reached Equation (1), it is immediate to find the\ntheoretical minimum and maximum entropy of the finer par-\ntition \u03c1(i.e. the pages) given the interaction over partition \u03c3\n(i.e. the leanings).\nThis follows from the observation that the H(X\u03c3)and\npiterms are fixed, and the terms H(X\u03c1|X\u03c3\u2208si)are\nall independent of one another and thus can be minimized\n(maximized) independently. The minimum is clearly found\nwhen H(X\u03c1|X\u03c3\u2208si) = 0 \u2200ii.e. when the activity of the\nuser is concentrated in at most one page for every si(i.e.\nleaning).\nOn the other hand, we recall that the maximum entropy is\nreached by a uniform distribution. Since we consider interac-\ntions, which are discrete and often not large, it is not always\npossible to obtain an exact uniform distribution. Therefore,\nwe compute the maximum possible value of entropy with the\nbelow criteria.\nConsider a user uwithninteractions in cipages from si.\nThe maximum entropy is found when rpages receive q+ 1\ninteractions and ci\u2212rpages receive qinteractions, where q\nandrare the quotient and remainder of the integer division\nofn\nci. Note that, if n\u2264ci, the maximum entropy is simply\nlogn.\nFinally, we note that in every sithe minimum and maximum\nentropies are the same only when there is only one interaction,\nin which case H(X\u03c1|X\u03c3\u2208si) = 0 .\nB. Strong and weak randomization\nIn our analysis, we compare the actual interaction patterns to\nthose resulting from two randomization processes: a stronger\none, where each interaction between users and pages is ran-\ndomized, and a weaker one, where the Bias labels of the pages\nare randomized. In both cases, the number of interactions made\nby each user and received by each page remains the same, and\nthe number of pages for each bias label remains unchanged.\nFurthermore, we notice that in the strong randomization pro-\ncess, the users distribute their activity uniformly across pages\nas the original multiple interactions between the same user andthe same page are now spread between multiple pages. This\nuniformity of interactions implies that the result of a strong\nrandomization process would be unaffected by a further weak\nrandomization. Thus, the strong randomization process implies\nthe weaker one. In Figure 1, the details of the randomization\nprocesses are visually explained. Note that, in the bipartite\nrepresentation, each edge indicate an interaction between a\nuser and a page and multiple edges are allowed.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022Users Pages Bias labels\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022Users Pages Bias labels\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022Users Pages Bias labels\n\u2022Original dataset\nStrong Randomization\nWeak Randomization\nFig. 1. In the tripartite representation of the interactions, the strong random-\nization process affects the user-pages interactions, while the weak one affects\nthe page-bias affiliations.\nIV. R ESULTS\nIn our analysis, we use the same dataset as two previous\npapers [21], [6], which comprise roughly 266 million com-\nments and 1.5 billion likes from about 170 million users on\n47 million Facebook posts by 222 pages of news agencies.\nThose news agencies have a Bias score, provided by Media\nBias/Fact Check [51], with five possible leanings ranging from\nleft to right. We infer the political bias of users using the mode\nof the leanings of their interactions. The distribution of pages\nand users by political leaning is shown in Figure 2, where we\nsee that while most pages and users are identified as center-left\nleaning, there are in proportion many more right-wing users\nthan pages.\n0.0\u00d710+02.5\u00d710+75.0\u00d710+77.5\u00d710+71.0\u00d710+8\nLeft\nCenter\u2212LeftCenter\nCenter\u2212RightRight\nBiasCountUsers by bias\n0.0\u00d710+02.5\u00d710+15.0\u00d710+17.5\u00d710+11.0\u00d710+2\nLeft\nCenter\u2212LeftCenter\nCenter\u2212RightRight\nBiasCountPages by bias\nFig. 2. Number of Facebook pages and users grouped by political affiliation.\nA. Measuring Selective exposure\nWe first explore patterns of activity concentration by group-\ning users by the number of their likes and comments. We\n4\ncreate 12logarithmic bins and, for each bin, we compute the\naverage number of pages they interact with. We then replicate\nthis analysis on the strongly randomized dataset (see Materials\nand Methods for further details). Figure 3 compares the two\nscenarios.\nComments Likes\n101103105101103105050100150\nNumber of interactionsNumber of pages visitedUsers per bin\n100102104106\nRandom\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFig. 3. Number of pages among which users divide their attention.\nThe results show that the real behavior of users is much\nmore concentrated than the randomized case. Note that, in this\nlatter case, the probability that a user interacts with a page is\nsolely based on the page\u2019s popularity i.e. the number of users\ninteracting with it. While this on itself does not imply that\nthere is a specific tendency for users to prefer content that\nis congruent with their specific view, it already suggests that\nusers\u2019 activity is strongly dependent on factors that transcend\nthe simple popularity of the page, as in the randomization case.\nTo understand if political leaning could be one of these\nfactors, we group pages by their bias level and, for each\nuser, we evaluate the Shannon entropy of their distribution\nof interactions left in each political class. We use this metric\nbecause it clearly indicates how concentrated or spread out\neach user\u2019s activity is. We scale the entropy values to a [0,1]\ninterval by dividing by log 5 , the theoretical maximum entropy\nvalue for 5 classes. To ensure that the observed selectivity is\nnot due to low activity, we consider only users who have made\nmore than 5 comments (likes) in this and all further analyses.\nThe empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) of the\nvalues of Shannon\u2019s entropy for all groups of users is presented\nin Figure 4. Additionally, we highlight the entropy levels\ncorresponding to a user interacting evenly with two, three,\nand four different leanings using grey lines.\nClearly, the leaning classification of users is most reliable\nfor those with entropy at the left of the first line, since they\ncomment very heterogeneously. All groups of users display a\nstrong level of selectivity, with center-leaning users being the\nmost selective. We observe that, in all groups, at least 50% of\nthe users concentrated their commenting activity on pages of\nthe same political leaning. This trend is also present, albeit less\nprominent, with likes, with center-right-leaning users being\nless selective than other groups of users. We compare this\nsituation with the strong randomization process, that describes\nusers interacting with pages based solely on popularity.\nInterestingly, we observe a substantial difference with the\nrandomized scenario, suggesting again that even the least\nselective users choose content according to a criterion com-\npatible with political leaning.\nComments LikesOriginal Dataset Strong randomization\n0.000.250.500.751.000.000.250.500.751.000.000.250.500.751.00\n0.000.250.500.751.00\nEntropy (scaled)P(e < x)Left\nCenter\u2212Left\nCenter\nCenter\u2212Right\nRight\nTotalFig. 4. Distributions of bias entropy of users compared with the strongly\nrandomized scenario.\nB. Page and Bias Selectivity\nIn the previous section we have shown that users display\na strong level of selectivity compatible with an ideological\nclassification of the pages. However, this can only partially\ncapture users\u2019 preferences in their activity. If users base their\ninteractions solely on the political leaning of a page, they\nwill treat all pages with the same leaning similarly. On the\nother hand, if users are selective about specific pages, their\ninteractions within each bias level will reflect that page-driven\nselectivity. We observe that since pages can be thought of\nas a sub-partition of the bias levels, the values of the two\nentropies (the one calculated by considering the interaction on\npages and bias levels) are actually dependent, as explained in\nMaterials and Methods. In particular, we find that the entropy\ncalculated on pages is equal to the entropy calculated on the\nbias levels summed with a weighted average of the entropies\nof the pages inside each bias level. Since each term of this\naverage is independent, they can be trivially minimized and\nmaximized. As explained in Materials and Methods, for each\nuser, we find the theoretical interval I(u) = [m(u), M(u)]in\nwhich the actual page entropy Hp(u)can be found and scale\nthe result using\nx(u) =Hp\u2212m\nM\u2212m.\nDoing that, users who make at most one interaction per bias\nlevel are removed as the theoretical minimum and maximum\ncoincide. This phenomenon is desirable, as it is impossible to\ndecide if further selectivity is motivated by a preference for\nspecific pages. We also recall that the analysis is performed\nonly on users who have made at least five comments (likes) to\nensure that the selectivity measured cannot be attributed to low\nactivity. Table I reports the summary characteristics of the x(u)\nvalues distribution. Interestingly, we can observe that users\ntend to be very selective regarding pages, often concentrating\ntheir activity on one page per bias level.\n5\nTABLE I\nQUARTILES OF THE xSTATISTICS DESCRIBING INTER -BIAS SELECTIVITY .\nMin 1st Quartile Median 3rd Quantile Max\nLikes 0 0 0 0.2108 1\nComments 0 0 0 0.09045 1\nC. Bias and Page Selectivity\nIn the previous sections, we have observed that, although\nusers exhibit a selective behavior that is compatible with\npolitical segregation, it is not the only explaining driver of user\nactivity. As users interact with -relatively- few pages, many\nalternative divisions could be compatible with the observed\nphenomenon, and thus, it is necessary to assess the divergence\nbetween the real selective exposure expressed by the users\nand a benchmark value found by grouping pages randomly.\nTo accomplish this, we perform the weak randomization\nprocess described in Materials and Methods to account for\nmeasurements of bias selectivity that may arise from the\nsimple page selectivity or other sorts of selective behaviors\n(for instance, locality-driven selectivity). We notice that the\nusers interacting with only one page will naturally interact with\nonly one bias class, regardless of the randomization. For those\nusers, deciding if a preference in political leaning, locality,\nor any arbitrary classification of pages drives their choice of\nactivity is impossible. For this reason, we set those users aside\nand only compute the distributions of users who interact with\nat least two pages and have a minimum of five interactions.\nUpon performing the weak randomization process, we note\nthat since the user-page relations are unchanged, the page\nentropy of each user remains unaffected by this particular\nrandomization process. This allows us to measure the bias\nselectivity while accounting for the strong patterns of page\nselectivity measured previously.\nWe perform a Monte Carlo experiment where each sim-\nulation is obtained using the weak randomization process.\nTo ensure the manageability of the procedure, we used a\nrandom sample of the dataset (slightly over 2% of the users).\nBy averaging over multiple groupings of pages, we obtain a\nbenchmark value for the bias entropy of the users, which we\ncan then compare to the actual bias entropy. If the political\nleaning determines a further selectivity, the distribution of\nthe original dataset will have higher entropy values, and,\nespecially at the left of the first line, the entropy eCDF will\nhave higher values. If, on the contrary, the two distributions\nare similar or the weak randomization process produces higher\nentropy values, it means that the political leaning of the pages\ndoes not drive the selectivity of the users.\nFigure 5 compares the real and randomized eCDF distribu-\ntions and Table II summarizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the distributions.\nWe observe that users primarily commenting on center and\ncenter-right-leaning pages align closely with the randomized\ndistribution, suggesting that the political leaning of these pages\naligns with their usual consumption patterns. In contrast, users\ninteracting with center-left-leaning pages show the most signif-\nicant divergence from the randomized model, indicating that\npolitical leanings heavily influence their news consumptionhabits. This is evident when comparing these findings with\nthose illustrated in Figure 4, where users engaging with only\none page are included. Notably, the exclusion of such users\nsignificantly reduces the number of those with zero entropy.\nCenter-leaning users, who are the most selective, are most\nimpacted by this exclusion. This suggests that less politically\nengaged users, who typically follow only one page, tend\nto prefer center-leaning pages. Conversely, users with more\nexplicit political preferences display greater selectivity in their\ninteractions. For likes, the patterns slightly differ. Center-\nleaning users clearly exhibit bias-driven engagement, a trend\nthat is less pronounced among right-leaning users and even\nless so among center-right-leaning ones.\nIn particular, center-right-leaning users are less selective\nthan their randomized counterparts. Left- and center-left-\nleaning users display prominent levels of divergence.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the\nphenomenon of selective exposure on social media platforms.\nInitially, we observe that user activity predominantly concen-\ntrates on a limited number of pages. As user engagement\nincreases, these pages quickly become saturated, suggesting\nthat user interactions are focused despite the availability of\nvast content. Employing Shannon Entropy to explore the\nhomogeneity of user behavior, we identify a strong prefer-\nence for content that aligns with users\u2019 pre-existing political\nviews. This finding supports the hypothesis that social media\nserves as an echo chamber, amplifying and reinforcing similar\nviewpoints. Further analysis reveals that user engagement\nis not uniform across pages with similar political leanings.\nUsers prefer specific news sources within political categories,\nindicating a more nuanced approach to selective exposure that\nincludes specific sources resonating deeply with individual\nusers. This observation prompted developing and applying\na novel methodology designed to dissect and analyze the\nreasons behind such selective behaviors. Our findings indi-\ncate that political congruence is a more significant driver of\nuser behavior than random selection, with effects particularly\npronounced among users leaning towards the center-left. Our\nwork establishes a robust framework for analyzing and com-\nparing the mechanisms of selective exposure across various\nuser groups on social media. This framework enhances our\nunderstanding of why users gravitate towards certain content\nand improves our ability to predict page-level selectivity based\non political bias. Additionally, it helps identify which user\ngroups are most susceptible to selective exposure, shedding\nlight on how echo chambers form and persist. However, this\nstudy has limitations. It does not account for the tone or nature\nof interactions\u2014whether users support, criticize, or comment\non content in a neutral or hostile manner. Despite this, we\nare confident in the robustness of our findings. We observe\nthat negative or hostile interactions, though present, do not\nsignificantly alter the overall patterns of selective exposure.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E. Bakshy, S. Messing, and L. A.

This thesis tries to develop a method for Information Disor-\nder Detection for the social media platform Reddit based on a publicly available dataset\ncalled Fakeddit. For this purpose, a multimodal neural network is designed for tackling\nthis problem. Many other state-of-the-art methods are only using single or dual-modality\napproaches e.g. text and images. This thesis incorporates up to four different modalities\nto prove the advantages of a multimodal over a mono-modal approach. The results con-\n\ufb01rm the superiority of a multimodal approach and improves the detection accuracy by a\nremarkable amount.\nIII\nKurzfassung\nSp\u00e4testens seit den Brexit Verhandlungen und den US-Wahlen 2016 sind die Auswirkun-\ngen von Fake News auf die \u00f6ffentliche Meinung nicht mehr verleugbar. Diese Falschinfor-\nmationen werden gro\u00dfteils \u00fcber soziale Netzwerke wie Twitter und Facebook verteilt. In\ndieser Arbeit wird versucht werden, eine Methode zur Erkennung von Fake-Informationen\nf\u00fcr die Social-Media-Plattform Reddit zu entwickeln, die auf einem \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglichen\nDatensatz namens Fakeddit basiert. Zu diesem Zweck soll ein multimodales neuronales\nNetz entworfen werden, um dieses Problem zu l\u00f6sen. Viele andere State-of-the-Art Meth-\noden beschr\u00e4nken sich auf nur eine oder zwei Modalit\u00e4ten, z.B. Text und Bilder.

\"information disorder\" on public opinion.\nThe topic is highly complex and the evaluation of fake news is a semantically very demand-\ning task. The manual identi\ufb01cation of fake news or rumors in a broader sense is a dif\ufb01cult\ntask even for experts. Because of the constantly growing amount of data, the question\narises whether information disorder can also be automatically identi\ufb01ed and evaluated by\ndata analysis and machine learning, this will be the main goal of this thesis.\n1.2 Goals\nTo answer this question, an information disorder detector based on state-of-the-art neural\nnetwork models from the \ufb01eld of Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), as\nwell as methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be built and evaluated. The\naim is to create a method to enable users of social media channels such as Twitter or\nReddit to quickly distinguish between fake information and non-fake information.\nBased on four available data modalities, namely two different semantic textual information,\nvisual information, and meta data information a concept of a neural network ensemble will\nbe developed. All four data modalities are merged into one large multimodal network which\nis then used to automatically distinguish between fake and non-fake samples.\n1\n1 Introduction\n1.3 Research Questions\nThe main research questions which are going to be answered in this thesis are:\n\u2022 Which modality is more meaningful for information disorder detection, two different\ntextual modalities, the visual modality or the meta-data modality?\n\u2022 To what extent can combined multimodal analysis, as opposed to mono-modal, im-\nprove the detection of information disorder in social media data?\n\u2022 Which network architectures from research are best suited for the multimodal analy-\nsis of information disorder?\n1.4 Research Approach\nBased on a Google Scholar search using common terms like \"fake news detection\", \"mis-\ninformation detection\", \"information disorder detection\", \"rumor detection\" and \"rumor ver-\ni\ufb01cation\", current papers and surveys are searched for. Besides Google Scholar other\nplatforms like Springer or Elsevier or IEEE are used. As soon as a solid base of repre-\nsentative literature has been established, further literature (e.g. from the Related Work\nsections) is examined. Based on the current publications of the last \ufb01ve years, a search for\npublications that have cited them is also conducted.\nThe second step consists of a more in-depth analysis of selected papers with regard to\nthe methods and data sets used. The focus here is on papers that use multimodal data. At\nthis stage, \ufb01rst indicators can already be collected to answer the third research question,\nsince the evaluation of the literature search is meaningful in this respect.\nThe third step is to develop an automatic method for meaningful information disorder\ndetection by using state-of-the-art machine learning methods.\n2\n1 Introduction\n1.5 Applications\nDue to the increasing amount of internet users also the users of online social media web-\nsites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Reddit are steadily increasing. The speed\nof spreading News (and Fake News) is also becoming faster. For this reason, methods\nhave to be developed to verify these news for credibility. Some of the already online web\nservices are:1\nFact-checking Website automatic / manual checking\naltnews.in manual\nClimatefeedback.org manual\nfactcheck.org manual\nfactmata.com automatic (AI)\nfullfact.org automatic (AI)\nhoax-slayer.com manual\nhoaxy.iuni.iu.edu using other online services\nleadstories.com manual\nmediabiasfactcheck.com manual\nour.news automatic (AI)\npolitifact.com manual\nsnopes.com manual\ntruthor\ufb01ction.com manual\nTable 1.1. Excerpt of available fact-checking websites\nAs shown in table 1.1 many of the provided websites are performing fact checking man-\nually by doing good journalism. But this is very expensive and time consuming and can be\nextended by the use of arti\ufb01cial intelligence. This extension is necessary due to the tremen-\ndous speed of spreading misinformation. Today, however, only a few platforms employ AI\nfor information veri\ufb01cation.\n1All retrieved on 11.07.2020.\n3\n1 Introduction\n1.6 Structure of the thesis\nThe following thesis is structured as follows. Chapter 2 gives an overview about existing\ntechnologies in the \ufb01eld of mono and multimodal information disorder analysis. It starts\nwith a de\ufb01nition of terms, what is currently summarized under the terms e.g. information\ndisorder, misinformation, rumor, spam and Fake News. Afterwards a deep dive into the\nstate-of-the-art is made structured by the modality text, visual and meta. Followed by an\noverview about the currently used datasets in this \ufb01eld of application. The chapter will\nbe closed by a in-depth discussion about the proposed methods, their advantages and\ndisadvantages and open challenges.\nChapter 3 provides an detailed description of which parts the experimental part of this\nthesis is build on. The chapter starts with an introduction to the four modalities chosen and\nwhere they came from. Furthermore also the possible output is discussed. Afterwards sev-\neral possibilities about pre-processing each of these modalities is discussed. Section 3.3\nan analysis about the used components is provided, followed by a detailed description how\nevery component is implemented and which special components were chosen to handle\nthe challenge of detecting information disorder.\nChapter 4 presents the chosen dataset, all experimental setups and all the results of\nthe experiments carried out and discusses them modality for modality. Finally chapter 5\nconcludes the whole thesis, presents open questions and future work.\n4\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.1 Terminology\nFigure 2.1. Conceptual Framework of information disorder, combined image of (Wardle\nand Derakhshan 2017) and (Kumar and Shah 2018)\nThe term Fake News is nowadays used in many different cases. It does not describe\nall facets of the whole complex topic of information disorder. A more general term that\ncan be taken is \"information disorder\" which can be applied to all historical impacts of\nmis-, dis-, and malinformation, that we currently know and classify contemporary mis- and\ndisinformation as Wardle and Derakhshan (2017) as \"information pollution\" at a global\nscale. An overview and to visualize the whole concept about all three types see furthermore\n\ufb01gure 2.1, that will be described in the rest of this section. In general these types can be\ndistinguished either by intent, mis- and disinformation, or if the content is even harmful\n(malinformation).\n5\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.1.1 Misinformation\nMisinformation is information which are created without the intent of misleading users oth-\nerwise this information is called disinformation if there intent was to mislead (Kumar and\nShah 2018). Moreover, misinformation can occur either inadvertently, for example through\nignorance, or through misunderstanding of facts. Often misinformation is also distributed\nquickly through ignorance via blogs or other services such as Facebook or Twitter. But even\nvery trivial facts can be unintentionally distorted by different interpretations or knowledge\nlevels of the people involved.\n2.1.2 Disinformation\nDisinformation in general, are information with an intent to change the public opinion (Fallis\n2014; Hernon 1995; Kumar and Shah 2018). A very good example for this kind of in-\nformation are the Brexit Votum and the US election 2016 (J. Kim et al. 2018), where the\npublic opionion was lead to a certain decision which had a great impact on the political\nlandscape of the world. The problem behind is, as stated in (Kumar and Shah 2018), to\nunderstand the motives for the disinformation and the motive for the generation for the de-\nception. Both questions do not necessarily have to be answered with the same statement\nor intent. Rumours, for example, also fall into this category.\nFigure 2.2. Fake News and related components, originally by (Zhang and Ghorbani 2020)\n6\n2 Background & Related Work\nOne type of Disinformation is Fake News. Fake News is news which intent is to mislead\nthe public opinion so they fall into this category of information. As seen in \ufb01gure 2.2 the\nwhole problem can not being described only by one term. Fake News, like all news, have to\nbe written or generated. This can be done by humans or computers. The next component\nis the target of Fake News. These can be a whole platform such as Facebook or Twitter\nfor example. The fake needs to be written for one ore more speci\ufb01c target groups, this\nis summarized under the term \"Potential Risk Analysis\". The generated content can be\ndivided in real content such as text or images, but also into non physical content such as\npurpose or sentiment. The social context part describes how the fakes are distribute, for\nexample via a platform, this includes again an analysis of the target group. The last (blue)\ncomponents describes the components before but in a more \ufb01ne grained way to specify\neach component in more detail. To summon up, Fake News is just a term which describes\na high-level concept for distributing manipulated content to one or more target groups on\nspeci\ufb01c platforms with speci\ufb01c sentiment and language (Zhang and Ghorbani 2020).\nIn the worst-case Fake News can lead to a gunshot1. A great impact of spreading Fake\nNews are so-called social bots, which are automated programs on social media services,\nsuch as Facebook and Twitter which are spreading misleading content (E. Ferrara et al.\n2016; Forelle et al. 2015; P . N. Howard and Kollanyi 2016; Shao, Ciampaglia, Varol, Flam-\nmini, et al. 2017; Shao, Ciampaglia, Varol, Y ang, et al. 2018). Their intent is to lead a\ndiscussion into a certain direction, all controlled by one person, a so-called lone-wolve\n(Kumar and Shah 2018; Vosoughi et al. 2018). So just one person can be responsible for\nspreading information disorder with the intent to mislead the public opinion.\nTo summon up, Fake News is news which is intentionally and veri\ufb01able false and may\nmislead readers (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017).\n2.1.3 Malinformation\nMalinformation is a kind of information, created with the intent to harm people or organisa-\ntions. The interesting part is that the information used, is true information and not gener-\nated information. So truthful information, for example court records or classi\ufb01ed material\nis published. One example is the leak of emails of Macron just before the run-off vote in\n2017.2The information within the emails was real, but the handling of the case included\nfalse information and harmed Macron\u2019s campaign.\n1As happened in 2016: https://wapo.st/2FVhoEZ , retrieved on 12.07.2020.\n2For more information about the email leak see: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/world/europe/\nmacron-hacking-attack-france.html , retrieved on 24.08.2020.\n7\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.1.4 Fine-grained categorization\nFigure 2.3. Types of information disorder, as shown in (Wardle 2017; Wardle and\nDerakhshan 2017).\nA more \ufb01ne-grained categorization of mis-, and disinformation is proposed by Wardle\nand Derakhshan (2017). It is often not possible to draw a hard line between mis-, and\ndisinformation. One aspect of this kind of information is the intent. As seen in \ufb01gure 2.3 on\nthe one hand, \"Satire or Parody\" on the left side has no intention to cause harm but can\nfool people, but one the other hand \"Fabricated Content\" is designed and has the intent\nto be designed and mislead people. So on the left hand side of the \ufb01gure several types\nof misinformation and on the right hand side several types of disinformation are shown. In\nbetween there are several gradations of the respective extremes. It is important to note\nthat it is a continuum, i.e. there is no sharp or clear border between the individual types\nof mis-, and disinformation. The 6-way label of the chosen dataset, which is introduced\nin section 4.1, has the possibility to train a method for distinguish between most of these\ntypes.\n8\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.1.5 Focus of this thesis\nThis thesis will mainly focus on information disorder as introduced by Wardle and Der-\nakhshan (2017), which is de\ufb01ned as the combination of the three types of information\nintroduced before: mis-, dis-, and malinformation as seen in \ufb01gure 2.1.\nFurthermore information disorder has three different phases, or life cycle:\n\u2022 Creation - When the message has been created\n\u2022 Production - When the message has been converted into a media product\n\u2022 Distribution - The message is made public\nSimilar to the lifecycle following three elements of information disorder can be de\ufb01ned:\n\u2022 Agent - The person/program/bot that created, produces and distributed the message\n\u2022 Message - Important to \ufb01nd out is: The type of message, format of the message and\noccurring characteristics\n\u2022 Interpreter - When the message was read by the target group, how is it interpreted,\nwhich actions are performed afterwards.\nTo summon up, information disorder is an interdisciplinary concept that tries to describe\nthe universe of fake information generation, distribution and social as well as historical\nimpact on our current society (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017). This thesis will focus on\nthe detection of fake and non-fake information, summarized under the term information\ndisorder.\n9\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.2 State-of-the-Art\nThis section surveys current state-of-the-art methods for information disorder detection for\ndifferent individual data modalities and multiple modalities. Table 2.1 should provide an\noverview about state-of-the-art papers and their used dataset modalities. This table by no\nmeans claims to be complete, but offers a representative extract of the current research\nsituation. Within the last \ufb01ve years more and more researchers dealt with the topic of\nNLP and developed a new set of methods for text and language processing. Most of the\nresearch was done by using the textual modality. Fusing different information sources such\nas, for example, text and visual information is a relatively new topic. The literature research\nfocused on a selection of high-quality paper from the last few years. All papers are by\nrenowned and much-cited authors and this state-of-the-art analysis should provide a good\noverview about the topic of information disorder detection.\nAuthor text visual meta\nMa, Gao, P . Mitra, et al. (2016) X\nMa, Gao, and Wong (2017) X\nMa, Gao, and Wong (2018) X\nMohtarami et al. (2018) X\nLago et al. (2019) X\nSinghal et al. (2019) XX\nY . Wang et al. (2018) XX\nNakamura et al.

Overview about authors and used modalities in the proposed methods.\n10\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.2.1 Mono-modal approaches incorporating textual information\nMa, Gao, and Wong (2018) proposed a rumor detection system with the ability to detect\nrumors at a very early stage by using tree-structured recursive bottom-up (BU-RvNN) and\ntop-down (TD-RvNN) neural networks. Each word of each claim is modelled as a tree\narchitecture and processed by an LSTM and gate recurrent units (GRU) (Cho et al. 2014).\nThe GRU should model the interaction between each tree node maintaining the structural\nintegrity of a sentence or a claim in general. So the advantage of the proposed method lies\nin learning more meaningful representations of sentences and does not need to perform\nexpensive pairwise comparisons of words. The used datasets Twitter15 and Twitter16 are\nsmaller datasets that consists out of around 1.2k samples each and were introduced by\nMa, Gao, and Wong (2017). The proposed method BU-RvNN reached an accuracy of\n70.8% and the TD-RvNN reached 72.3% on the Twitter15 dataset. Furthermore the BU-\nRvNN reached an accuracy of 71.8% and the TD-RvNN reached 73.7% on the Twitter16\ndataset for the task of rumor detection.\nMohtarami et al. (2018) proposed a stance veri\ufb01cation system that uses a CNN in com-\nbination with LSTMs. The aim was to verify if a given document agrees, disagrees, dis-\ncusses, or is unrelated to a certain claim. The used dataset \"Fake News Challenge\" will be\nintroduced in section 2.3. The word embeddings were generated by using GloVe (Penning-\nton et al. 2014). The CNN connects neighbouring word units to improve the very promising\nresults. Due to the unbalanced dataset randomly selected samples of all classes allows\ntraining on the same number of samples for each class. The method is also capable to ex-\ntract meaningful snippets which can help experts for further investigation and explainability\nof the method. The best of the three proposed methods (sMemNN with TF) performed with\nan accuracy of 88.57% on the FakeNewsChallenge dataset.\nKochkina et al. (2017) proposed a rumour veracity and rumour stance classi\ufb01cation sys-\ntem which uses a Branch-LSTM Model (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997). The used\ndataset will be described in section 2.3. The method uses only textual information and\ninformation calculated out of the tweets for example the count of negation words or swear\nwords. The text is pre-processed with standard NLP methods such as removing stop\nwords, lower case, and tokenization. The proposed method is capable to learn features\nfrom the tweet representation together with the other features at each time step. The pro-\nposed method performed with an accuracy of 78.4% on the test set of PHEME dataset for\nthe task of rumor veracity and stance classi\ufb01cation.\n11\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.2.2 Mono-modal approaches incorporating visual information\nLago et al. (2019) proposed an image forensic technique-based approach. Textual anal-\nysis, as stated, has only a complementary effect on the classi\ufb01cation. By applying image\nforensic methods such as color \ufb01lter array (P . Ferrara et al. 2012) or jpeg ghosts analysis\n(Farid 2009; Zach et al. 2012). A similar tool is called Splicebuster (Cozzolino et al. 2015),\nit is possible to \ufb01nd edited or manipulated images. The used datasets \"image veri\ufb01ca-\ntion corpus\" and \"BuzzFeedNews\" will be described in section 2.3. A third dataset was\ncreated by crawling news websites by the authors themselves. It could be shown that clas-\nsical image veri\ufb01cation methods, as described above, work on almost the same level as\nSplicebuster and machine learning methods like Random Forest Classi\ufb01er (RFC) or Logis-\ntic Regression Classi\ufb01er (LRC). The described results refer only to the image modality and\nare not representing combinations of image and text.\nThe proposed methods RFC reached an accuracy of 74% on the \"image-veri\ufb01cation-\ncorpus\" dataset by using only image forensic technologies as stated in the paper. The\nsame accuracy was reached by the combination of RFC and the Splicebuster method.\nOnly the RFC with CNN method performed around 73%. A similar picture is provided if the\nLRC is taken into account. The accuracy of LRC in combination with the image forensic\nmethod reached around 75% accuracy on the dataset. The same accuracy was achieved\nby combining LRC with Splicebuster. Again only the LRC + CNN method was performing\naround 74%.\nThe RFC in combination with the image forensic methods achieved around 75% accu-\nracy on the BuzzFeedNews dataset. The RFC-Splicebuster method performed with 70%\nless well on this dataset. Here the RFC-CNN method performed with 73% much better.\nThe LRC in combination with the image forensic methods performed around 77%. The\nLRC-CNN method with around 78% on the BuzzFeedNews dataset was performing a little\nbit better. Only the LRC-Splicebuster method performed with 76% slightly worse than the\nother methods on this dataset.\nThe RFC in combination with the image forensic methods achieved, equally to the CNN\nmethod, around 92% on the self-crawled CrawlerNews dataset. Only the Splicebuster\nmethod performed less well with around 88%. Utilizing the LRC all three methods per-\nformed equally with around 93% on the CrawlerNews dataset.\n12\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.2.3 Multimodal approaches incorporating textual and visual information\nNakamura et al. (2019) and Nakamura et al. (2020) proposed a multimodal network for\nFake News Detection by using the textual and visual modality. The used dataset Fakkedit\nwill be the evaluation dataset for this thesis and an in-depth analysis can be bound in\nsection 4.1. For the textual modality two different methods namely BERT3and InferSent\n(Conneau et al. 2017) were chosen for the evaluation. For the visual modality three dif-\nferent commonly used image classi\ufb01cation networks ResNet50 (He et al. 2016a), VGG16\n(Simonyan and Zisserman 2014) and Ef\ufb01cientNet (Tan and Q. V. Le 2019) were chosen\nfor the feature extraction. These networks were used to extract features from the dataset\nwhich are used as input for the classi\ufb01cation head. This consists out of a fusion layer which\nfuses the features by following strategies: Add, Average, Concatenate and Maximum.4\nThe proposed method, combining textual and visual information performed with around\n90% validation and test accuracy very well on the Fakeddit dataset regarding the 2-way\nproblem. The same accuracy was achieved on the 3-way problem. Only the accuracy on\nthe most complex 6-way problem dropped to around 86% on both sets.\nEANN or event adversarial neural network proposed by Y . Wang et al. (2018) is a multi-\nmodal network ensemble that utilizes textual and visual information. The advantage above\nother approaches is that EANN can extract event invariant features. This knowledge can\nbe easily transferred between already known events to unknown events. The textual infor-\nmation is processed by a Text-CNN (Y . Kim 2014) and a VGG-19 for the visual modality.\nThe used dataset \"image-veri\ufb01cation-corpus\" will be introduced in section 2.3. The second\nWeibo dataset is identical to the dataset used by Jin et al. (2017).\nThe EANN approach achieved an accuracy of 71.5% on the image-veri\ufb01cation-corpus\ndataset and 82.7% accuracy on the self-collected Weibo dataset. The authors could show\nthat using an event discriminator for fake news detection can improve the accuracy of such\nsystems.\n3Which will be discussed in section 3.1.1.\n4https://keras.io/api/layers/merging_layers/ , retrieved on 21.07.2020.\n13\n2 Background & Related Work\nSpotfake (Singhal et al. 2019) is a multimodal fake news detection system which utilizes\nBERT (Devlin et al. 2018), which will be described in more detail in section 3.1.1 for text\nprocessing and VGG-19 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2014), pretrained on Imagenet (Deng\net al. 2009) for the visual modality. One of the used dataset is the \"image-veri\ufb01cation\ncorpus\" which will be introduced in section 2.3. The second dataset from the Chinese\nsocial media website Weibo5is also taken into account. The extracted features from BERT\nand the VGG-19 model are concatenated. The results of the Spotfake system with an\naccuracy of 77.77% on the \"image-veri\ufb01cation-corpus\" dataset and 89.23% on the Weibo\ndataset, which were also used by the EANN approach showed that the Spotfake system\nperforms better than the EANN approach(Y . Wang et al. 2018).\n5weibo.com , retrieved on 13.07.2020.\n14\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.2.4 Multimodal approaches incorporating textual and meta information\nDong et al. (2018) proposed a uni\ufb01ed attention model with latent representations by com-\nbining textual information and users meta data. The used data comes from the \"LIAR\"\ndataset which will be introduced in section 2.3 and from the BuzzFeed dataset which will\nbe also described in section 2.3. The strength of the proposed hybrid models lies in the\nability to fuse information consisting out of different kinds of information, such as textual\nand meta data. The RNN component can capture contextual information at a high level\nbut cannot hold information about the prominent parts of the textual modality. To overcome\nthis disadvantage the method utilizes bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) (Cho et\nal. 2014) to extract features from the data. All the extracted information are fused in an\nattention matrix which fuses the features from both modalities. The results showed that\na multimodal approach succeeds above monomodal settings by achieving an accuracy of\n82.83% on the LIAR dataset and 83.84% on the BuzzFeedNews dataset.\nZubiaga, Liakata, and Procter (2017) proposes a rumor detection system by utilizing\nConditional Random Fields. The dataset (PHEME) will be discussed later in section 2.3.\nEach tweet and response on it has been modelled as a chain to take advantage of the CRF\nmethod which can also consider neighbours to its decision. The data chain consists out\nof the text of the tweet together with relevant meta data (social context) of the user which\nposted it. This method proposed, outperforms other classi\ufb01ers such as SVM, Random\nForest, and others on the PHEME dataset. The best classi\ufb01er, measured by the F1 score\nis the conditional random \ufb01eld classi\ufb01er with a F1 score of 0.606 on the task of rumor\ndetection on the PHEME dataset.\nRuchansky et al. (2017) proposed a Fake News Detection System called CSI - Capture\nScore and Integrate. The used network architectures utilized a LSTM for learning a repre-\nsentation of the text, preprocessed by doc2vec (Q. Le and Mikolov 2014), an extension of\nword2vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) and user activity information. The second module \"Score\"\nis a neural network fed by a user graph to extract a score for each different user. The \"In-\ntegrate module\" combines both information and classi\ufb01es both separated learned modality\ninto Fake or no Fake. The used dataset is initially created by Ma, Gao, P . Mitra, et al.\n(2016) but is currently not available for download. The proposed method achieved 89.2%\non the Twitter dataset and 95.3% on the Weibo dataset introduced in Ma, Gao, P . Mitra,\net al. (2016).\n15\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.2.5 Multimodal approaches incorporating three modalities\nSAME or Sentiment aware multi-modal embedding for detecting Fake News (Cui et al.\n2019) is a mulitmodal Fake News Detection system which uses GloVe embedded feature\nvectors (Pennington et al. 2014), VGGNet encoded image features and one-hot encoded\nmeta data such as sources, keywords, and other related information. All the collected\ninformation is connected to an adversarial network. The used dataset \"FakeNewsNet\" will\nbe introduced in section 2.3. The method achieved very promising results on t the Politifact\ndataset with and Macro F1 score of about 77.24 and 80.42 on the GossipCop dataset and\nshowed clearly the bene\ufb01ts of a Deep Learning based approach over a \"classic\" machine\nlearning approach such as KNN or SVM.\nJin et al. (2017) proposed a multimodal end-to-end recurrent neural network for rumour\ndetection in microblogs by utilizing LSTMs for textual and meta data information, such as\nhash-tag, mentions, retweets, and text semantic features, and a VGG-19 network for the\nvisual modality. The authors created its own dataset by crawling the Chinese social media\nwebsite Weibo between May 2012 to January 2016. The second dataset the \"image-\nveri\ufb01cation-corpus\" will be introduced in section 2.3. The achieved accuracy around 78.8%\non the collected Weibo dataset and 68.2% on the \"image-veri\ufb01cation-corpus\" shows the\nimprovement on the task of rumor detection by fusing information out of different modalities.\n16\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.3 Datasets\nThis section will provide an overview of currently used datasets for information disorder\ndetection. The provided list in table 2.2 is by no means complete and all-encompassing\nbut should give a good entry point into detecting information disorder. The sorting by\nmodality should provide a quick overview about the most commonly used modalities and\ndatasets within the last years.\nDataset name Samples Source Modality Url\nBreaking! 700 BS - Detector text -\nCOVID-19 Infodemic 1100 self-collected text https://bit.ly/30apgtN\nCredbank 60 mio crowd-sourced text https://bit.ly/3fcNCrc\nFake News Challenge 525k news websites text https://bit.ly/3jUOvZ2\nFakeNewsCorpus 9.4 mio opensources.co text https://bit.ly/3jXFoGG\nFA-KES 804 15 news websites text https://bit.ly/2PbgDcc\nFEVER 185k Wikipedia text https://bit.ly/3jTNf8d\nNELA-GT -2019 1.12 mio 260 news websites text https://bit.ly/2DoyU2P\nPHEME 15k Twitter text https://bit.ly/312DsEj\nTwitter15 842 Twitter text -\nTwitter16 990 Twitter text -\nBuzzFace 2263 / 1.6 mio comments Facebook text, image https://bit.ly/39NzLqc\nThe PS-Battles Dataset 100k Reddit image, meta https://bit.ly/3fhbYQm\nFakeNewsNet 600k Politifact, GossipCop, Twitter text, meta https://bit.ly/3f7vPBC\nLiar 13k Politifact text, meta https://bit.ly/3geQJQE\nNELA2017 136k 92 news websites text, meta https://bit.ly/3jVajUg\nNELA-GT -2018 713k 194 news websites text, meta https://bit.ly/3hOjpQO\nSome Like it Hoax 15.5k Facebook text, meta https://bit.ly/2P6orfj\nBuzzFeed 2016 2.2k different news outlets text, image, meta https://bit.ly/30aAtKW\nFakeddit 1 mio Reddit text, image, meta https://bit.ly/2Pm9UMJ\nImage-veri\ufb01cation-corpus 18k Twitter text, image, meta https://bit.ly/30ZNaHv\nTable 2.2. Overview about commonly used datasets and where to \ufb01nd them.\nBreaking! The \"Breaking!\" dataset consists out of 700 news articles from USA politics\nfrom August to November 2016. It incorporates only text samples. It is built out of well\nknown fake articles from the Stanford dataset (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017) in combina-\ntion with manually labelled fake articles from the famous BS-Detector.6. The labelling is\ndone manually by applying two different label categories, primary label - false, partial truth,\nand opinions/commentary presented as facts and secondary label - fake (from the original\nStanford dataset) and questionable (from the original Kaggle dataset). The trained model\nconsists of a bi-directional LSTM in combination with a 1-D CNN model and performed\nvery well on the dataset (Pathak and Srihari 2019).\n6The original dataset does not exist anymore but has been republished and extended here: https://github.\ncom/thiagovas/bs-detector-dataset The BS-Detector plugin can be found here: https://github.com/\nselfagency/bs-detector .\n17\n2 Background & Related Work\nBuzzFace The \"BuzzFace\" dataset consists out of 1.6 millions of text samples and re-\nlated images (if available) from nine news outlets7during September 2016, also in the time\nof the US elections.8The \ufb01rst step of quality control was, that only sources were taken\nthat have the \"veri\ufb01ed\" status of Facebook. The whole dataset is then manually labeled\nby BuzzFeed journalists into four different label categories namely: mostly true, mostly\nfalse, a mixture of true and false, and no factual content. No speci\ufb01c baseline method was\nproposed by the dataset authors (Santia and Williams 2018).\nBuzzFeed The \"Buzzfeed\" news dataset9is a fact-checking dataset, mainly sourced from\nFacebook. It consists of around 2.2k samples with links to Facebook posts from Fake\nNews- and non-Fake News websites and also provides several meta data samples. Addi-\ntional information can be found by accessing the Facebook API.\nCOVID-19 Infodemic The \"Covid-19 infodemic\" dataset consists out of 1100 news arti-\ncles from 88 news sources and social network posts from various sites such as Facebook.\nThe provided labels are True or Fake. The balanced dataset was manually labeled.10No\nspeci\ufb01c baseline or method was proposed.\nCredbank The \"Credbank\" dataset consists out of more than 60 million tweets grouped\ninto 1049 news events. The main source for this dataset is Twitter. The annotation of\nthe dataset was made by utilizing Amazons Mechanical Turk service.11For each sample\nseveral persons could rate and algorithms were used to sort the ratings into the \ufb01ve pos-\nsible points on the 5-point Likert scale namely: certainly inaccurate, probably inaccurate,\nuncertain (doubtful), probably accurate, and certainly accurate (T. Mitra and Gilbert 2015).\nFake News Challenge The \"Fake News Challenge\" dataset consists of around 525k\nsamples collected from different news websites belonging to around 300 topics with 5 -\n20 articles. Each sample is labeled into four different categories: agree, discuss, disagree,\nand unrelated. For now, there is no overview or in-depth analysis of the dataset itself\npublished (Pomerleau and Rao 2017).\n7See furthermore: https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/indexing-facebook-news-pages-ad-archive,\nretrieved on 10.07.2020.\n8The data was collected by using the Facebook Graph API https://developers.facebook.com/docs/\ngraph-api/ , retrieved on 10.07.2020.\n9https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis , retrieved on\n13.07.2020.\n10See furthermore: https://towardsdatascience.com/explore-covid-19-infodemic-2d1ceaae2306 , re-\ntrieved on 10.07.2020.\n11https://www.mturk.com/, retrieved on 10.07.2020.\n18\n2 Background & Related Work\nFakeddit This dataset will be described in detail in section 4.1 because this thesis will be\nusing it for developing a multimodal method for information disorder detection.\nFake News Corpus The \"Fake News Corpus\" dataset consists currently out of 9.4 million\nsamples from 1001 web-domains, mainly from a curated list of websites which can be\nfound here: https://github.com/OpenSourcesGroup/opensources .12Each sample of the\ndataset is labelled to one of eleven types of misinformation, such as fake news, satire,\nextreme bias, conspiracy theory, state news, junk science, hate news, clickbait, proceed\nwith caution, political, and credible. A baseline implementation can be found on GitHub.13\nFake News Net The \"Fake News Net\" dataset consists out of 600k samples from the\nnews websites GossipCop14and Politifact, both famous fact-checking websites. From the\nlabeled news articles from the before mentioned websites related Tweets from Twitter were\ncollected, together with user and other meta data. The meta and user data were used\nfor automatic bot detection (Davis et al. 2016). The creators of the dataset also proposed\ndifferent baseline methods (Shu et al. 2019).\nFA-KES The \"FA-KES\" dataset consists out of 804 news articles in the \ufb01eld of the Syrian\nWar. The annotation was supported by crowd-sourcing manually labelled. Additional fea-\ntures were collected and added to the dataset including when did this event happen and/or\nwhere did it happen (Salem et al. 2019).\nFEVER The \"FEVER\" - Fact Extraction and VERi\ufb01cation dataset consists out of 185k\nsamples for the task of claim veri\ufb01cation, a subpart of misinformation detection. The source\nare Wikipedia sentences which have been manually altered and classi\ufb01ed into three differ-\nent label classes namely: supported, refuted, and not enough info. A baseline approach\nconsisting out of a Neural Network utilizing classic text approaches such as TF-IDF for\nvector similarity across different documents and Natural Language Processing (NLTK) was\nproposed by (Thorne et al. 2018).\n12The website http://www.opensources.com/ is of\ufb02ine but still available on the web.archive: https://web.\narchive.org/web/20190801000000*/http://www.opensources.co/ , retrieved on 10.07.2020.\n13https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsRecognition , retrieved on 10.07.2020.\n14https://www.gossipcop.com/ , retrieved on 11.07.2020.\n19\n2 Background & Related Work\nImage-Veri\ufb01cation-Corpus The \"image-veri\ufb01cation-corpus\" dataset consists out of 17\ndifferent events with around 400 images including 18k tweets of different languages with\nadditional meta data such as user data. For labelling the original news articles were taken\ninto account. If the image was on this reputable news website, the speci\ufb01c image was\nlabeled with True or if not with Fake, the same approach was used for the tweets. A basic\napproach and baseline were also proposed by the creators of the dataset (Boididou et al.\n2018).\nLIAR The \"LIAR\" dataset consists out of around 13k manually labeled dataset of short\nstatements of the fact-checking website Politifacts.15Their approach uses a combination\nof word embedding models and meta data which is fed via a ConvNet and a Bi-directional\nLSTM (W. Y . Wang 2017).\nNELA2017 The \"NELA2017\" or NEws LAndscape dataset consists out of around 136k\nsamples collected from April 2017 till Oktober 2017 from 92 news sources. The main\nsources are reliable news websites along with different others such as fake news websites.\nThe content includes articles from the USA political landscape. The dataset consists not\nonly out of the text and body of each news article but also out of a lot of more computed\nfeatures such as Part-of-Speech (POS) sentiment analysis, Facebook API engagement,\nreadability measure, moral and many more. A full list of features and a detailed analysis of\nthe dataset can be found in (Horne et al. 2018).\nNELA-GT-2018 The \"NELA-GT -2018\" dataset consists out of around 713k samples col-\nlected from February 2018 to November 2018 from around 194 news and media sources.\nIt extends the \"NELA2017\" dataset by collecting related and similar news articles. The\nground truth data is collected from eight different sites below are for example Wikipedia,\nOpenSources, and Politifact (N\u00f8rregaard et al. 2019).\nNELA-GT-2019 The \"NELA-GT -2019\" dataset consists out of around 1.12 million sam-\nples collected from 01.01.2019 till 31.12.2019 from around 260 news sources. It also\nextends the \"NELA-GT -2018\" dataset by again collecting around 400k more news articles.\nThe labelling process is similar to the previous dataset (Gruppi et al. 2020).\n15https://www.politifact.com/, retrieved on 11.07.2020.\n20\n2 Background & Related Work\nPHEME The \"PHEME\" dataset consists out of around 5k tweets grouped into 330 rumor\nthreads. All the collected events are manually labelled by journalists. The topics vary from\nthe Ottawa Shooting over Charlie Hebdo to the Germanwings crash. The labels consist out\nof rumour threads and non-rumour threads. Within each thread, the conversation tweets\nare labeled into three types namely: support and response type, certainty, and evidentiality\nwith regarding subtypes to allow a \ufb01ne-grained analysis of the news events. It consists out\nof two types of information: Content-based features, which are for example word vectors\nor part-of-speech tags, but also social features such as tweet count or follow ratio or age\nof the tweet owner. A detailed analysis can be found in the paper of the creators (Zubiaga,\nLiakata, Procter, et al. 2016). A baseline method with CRF has been introduced by (Buntain\nand Golbeck 2017; Zubiaga, Liakata, and Procter 2017; Zubiaga, Liakata, Procter, et al.\n2016).\nSome like it Hoax The \"Some like it Hoax\" dataset consists out of around 15,5k Face-\nbook posts and around 900k users. It was collected from July to December 2016 through\nthe Facebook Graph API. The sources consist out of 14 conspiracy- and 18 scienti\ufb01c pages\nwith more than 2.3 million likes. The dataset has textual and meta information, such as the\nlikes related to each post. The main research question was to classi\ufb01y posts into hoax\nand non-hoax just by looking at the likes of each post. The dataset creators proposed a\nbaseline method with remarkable results exceeding 99% (Tacchini et al. 2017).\nThe PS-Battles Dataset \"The PS-Battles Dataset\" consists out of around 100k images\ngrouped into around 11k subsets sourced mainly from Reddit, Imgur16and a various num-\nber of smaller \ufb01le sharing hosts. Not only the original, unmanipulated image but also a\nvarying number of manipulated images in different image formats such as jpg and png\nare contained in the dataset. Next to the visual modality also meta data is collected are\navailable for example the username of the post owner, community score, and many more\n(Heller et al. 2018).\nTwitter15 The \"Twitter15\" dataset consists out of around 421 true and 421 rumour stories\nfrom the social media platform Twitter, which were collected in March 2015.

At the time of writing this thesis, the dataset was not available\nanymore.\n16www.imgur.com , retrieved on 18.07.2020.\n21\n2 Background & Related Work\nTwitter16 The \"Twitter16\" dataset consists out of around 498 rumour and 494 non-rumour\nstories from the social media platform Twitter, which were collected between March and\nDecember 2016 and is similar to the \"Twitter15\" dataset regarding labeling by using the\nfact-checking website snopes.com (Ma, Gao, P . Mitra, et al. 2016). At the time of writing\nthis thesis, the dataset was not available anymore.\n2.4 Discussion\nAs described in the previous section many different approaches are developed for tackling\nthe broad \ufb01eld of information disorder detection, mis- and disinformation detection, rumor\nveri\ufb01cation, and Fake News Detection. Many of the proposed methods are only considering\none modality such as suggested by Cho et al. (2014), Kochkina et al. (2017), Lago et\nal. (2019), Ma, Gao, and Wong (2018), and Mohtarami et al. (2018). The challenges in\ninformation disorder detection are multilayered. On the one hand, the detection should be\npossible at a very early stage (Ma, Gao, and Wong 2018) but this is not always possible due\nto the lack of appropriate datasets and the multifaceted nature of rumours. On the other\nhand an early stage detection is often not reliable because a rumor for example can be true\ntill facts are available which prove it either true or wrong. Another problem is, that there\nare various social media platforms on the internet, such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit\n(and many more ...). The mis,- dis,- and malinformation on different platforms has also\ndifferent natures and facets and current models are not capable to handle information from\ndifferent sources. Nakamura et al. (2019), Nakamura et al. (2020), Singhal et al. (2019),\nand Y . Wang et al. (2018) proposed different kinds of multimodal network architectures by\nfusing textual and visual information. The used components for each modality vary a lot.\nOn the one hand, Nakamura et al. (2019) and Nakamura et al. (2020) utilize InferSent\n(Conneau et al. 2017) and BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) for the textual modality and on the\nother hand (Y . Wang et al. 2018) use a Text-CNN (Y . Kim 2014) and (Cui et al. 2019)\nutilizes Global Vector (GloVe) (Pennington et al. 2014) or doc2vec (Q. Le and Mikolov\n2014) and word2vev (Mikolov et al. 2013), respectively. Most of the methods were using\nword embeddings such as BERT which is one of the most powerful tools for text processing.\nFor the visual modality classical approaches such as ResNet, VGG16, VGG19 (Si-\nmonyan and Zisserman 2014) or MobileNet (Nakamura et al. 2019; Nakamura et al. 2020)\nare taken into account. All these networks were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset to\nbene\ufb01t of the learned features (Deng et al. 2009). Lago et al. (2019) proposed and eval-\nuated different methods for \ufb01nding manipulated images within a dataset by using image\nforensic methods together with Splicebuster (Cozzolino et al. 2015), a tool which learns\nimage manipulation with no prior knowledge.\n22\n2 Background & Related Work\nMeta-data such as related user data or retweets and many more are a useful source of\ninformation. Dong et al. (2018) proposed a uni\ufb01ed attention model that can learn repre-\nsentations out of text and users meta data. It could be shown that utilizing gated recurrent\nunits (GRUs) (Cho et al. 2014) for extracting features from multi modal data were very use-\nful in detecting information disorder. Another approach by using an LSTM was undertaken\nby (Ruchansky et al. 2017) which features were extracted by modeling the dataset inside\na graph. But also more \"traditional\" approaches are used within information disorder de-\ntection such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) by (Zubiaga, Liakata, and Procter 2017)\nwhich outperform SVMs and Random Forest classi\ufb01ers.\nThe concept fusing feature representations from different modalities is often advanta-\ngeous than relying on only one modality (Cui et al. 2019; Jin et al. 2017; Nakamura et al.\n2020). The key for taking advantage out of fusing different modalities is the correct fusing\nstrategy. But this depends on the availability of each of the modalities. Nakamura et al.\n(2020) for example evaluated different fusing strategies such as concatenation, addition or\nmaximum of each input feature representation. Cui et al. (2019) fused the features into an\nattention matrix and calculate the output based on this. Jin et al. (2017) also concatenates\nthe output before feeding the new representation into a LSTM network.\nIt is dif\ufb01cult to compare results from different methods over different datasets. But to give\nan impression, current state-of-the-art multimodal approaches are performing around 90%\naccuracy on the given datasets (Nakamura et al. 2020).\nOne open challenge is to transfer knowledge from one social media platform, such as\nFacebook, Twitter, or Reddit, to another one. Each one collects different kinds of data.\nNot only textual or visual information are important but also meta information is crucial.\nBut exactly this kind of information varies a lot in between the social media networks. The\nchallenge here is to \ufb01nd features that are interchangeable between these platforms, in\norder to make a method capable to be used in various domains.\nWithin the previously presented state-of-the-art, many different approaches for tackling\nthe problem of information disorder were introduced and discussed. Many of the proposed\nmethods developed specialized methods, for example Gated-Recurrent-Units (GRUs) (Cho\net al. 2014; Dong et al. 2018; Ma, Gao, and Wong 2018) for handling sub-tasks of, or the\nwhole information disorder detection task. This thesis will take well working, established\nmethods, introduced in the following chapter 3, to fuse each modality afterwards of each\nseparate modality, to preserve the informative value and build a robust information disorder\nclassi\ufb01er.\n23\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation\nof Information Disorder\nThis chapter presents all technologies that are going to be used in the experiments. Fur-\nthermore, also details about the implementation and evaluation process will be provided.\nMoreover the theoretical technical background of the used components and model param-\neters will be introduced and explained in the rest of this chapter.\nFigure 3.1. General method overview of this thesis.\nThis thesis, as seen in \ufb01gure 3.1, proposes a four-modality automatic information dis-\norder detection system. The \ufb01rst stage, after reading the data is the data pre-processing\nstep. Depending on each modality different pre-processing steps, such as tokenization or\nnormalization are performed. Afterwards each modality is processed within a separate en-\n24\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\ncoder, such as BERT, ResNet50v2, or a MLP . Depending on the experimental setup one\nor more modalities are fused inside the Level 1 and Level 2 Fusion layer. Afterwards the\nresult is classi\ufb01ed into \"fake\" or \"non-fake\". An in-depth description of each part and a\nmore detailed description of the method will be given during this chapter.\n3.1 Input Modalities\nThis thesis will focus on data that comes from the social media website Reddit. Reddit\nis a social media platform which allows user to post content concerning different topics.\nOther user can comment, up- and down vote posts which has impact on the order on\nwhich position the post is placed on Reddit. The dataset Fakeddit (Nakamura et al. 2019;\nNakamura et al. 2020), which will be introduced in section 4.1, was chosen due its large\namount of available multimodal data in the \ufb01eld of information disorder detection.\nAs shown in \ufb01gure 3.2 a typical subreddit1(1) consists out of ntopics (2), which con-\ntent is textual and/or visual information such as images or videos (2, 3). (4) shows the\ncurrent upvote/downvote counter and (5) describes the count of related comments for this\nparticular topic.\nTo summon up, four different modalities can be distinguished. Two textual modalities,\nwhich have different semantic meanings, one visual modality and one meta-data modal-\nity, which consists out of different post or user describing data. All the before mentioned\nmodalities are part of the chosen Fakeddit dataset, that is going to be presented, with an\nin-depth analysis, in section 4.1. An example is described below:\nAs seen in \ufb01gure 3.3 a tree is shown. The related title (body of the Reddit) is \"This tree\nis split right open\" and exemplary one related comment is \"exactly what i thought\". The\nmeta-data shows 0.94 for the upvote/downvote ratio and 12 for the score.\nSo each Reddit has one or more modalities:\n1.

The structure of a typical Subreddit on the Reddit platform.\nFigure 3.3. One example of the Fakeddit dataset.\n26\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.1.1 Textual modeling\nBERT or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Devlin et al. 2018) is\na method of learning deep bidirectional representations of unlabeled text. In difference to\nother state-of-the-art language representation methods such as deep biLMs respectively\nElMo (Peters, Neumann, Iyyer, et al. 2018; Peters, Neumann, Zettlemoyer, et al. 2018)\nor ULMFiT (J. Howard and Ruder 2018) BERT can learn not only from one direction (e.g.\nfrom left to right) but also from both direction and bene\ufb01ts from being pretrained on a large\ncorpus of text. Before BERT, NLP methods suffered from on huge disadvantage, the uni-\ndirectional learning. This disadvantage should be solved by BERT, which uses a \"masked\nlanguage model\" which originates from the 1960s under the name \"Cloze procedure\" (Tay-\nlor 1953). To summarize the idea behind was that the language model must predict the\nid of randomly masked tokens. BERT extends this method to a so-called \"next sentence\nprediction\". This forces the model to learn the connections to both sides of the word re-\nspectively sentence. BERT achieves really good results also on new tasks such as Fake\nNews Detection (Nakamura et al. 2020), that is why this method is also chosen for this\nthesis.\n3.1.2 Visual modeling\nThis thesis will perform experiments by using following state-of-the-art image classi\ufb01cation\nnetworks:2\n\u2022 ResNet50V2\n\u2022 ResNet101V2\n\u2022 Inceptionv3\n2All the networks weights are available via the Keras framework, if desired also pretrained on ImageNet (Deng\net al. 2009) https://keras.io/api/applications/ , retrieved on 21.07.2020.\n27\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\nResNet50v2 and ResNet101V2\nThe successor of ResNet50 (He et al. 2016a), the ResNet50V2 respectively ResNet101V2\n(He et al. 2016b) was chosen for this thesis. The main difference, as seen in \ufb01gure 3.4\nbetween Version 1 (a) and Version 2 (e) is that in V2 the matrix multiplication with the\nweights is done after the Batch-Normalisation and ReLu activation. Furthermore, in V2\nthe last non-linearity is removed. This is a so-called \"identity mapping\".3The difference\nbetween the 50 and the 101 version is just the count of residual blocks used within the\nbody of the network.\nFigure 3.4. Difference between ResNetv1 (a) and ResNetv2 (e) with different possible\nvariants in between (b-d), as seen in (He et al. 2016b).\nInceptionv3\nThe Inceptionv1 network (former GoogLeNet) was \ufb01rstly introduced in (Szegedy, W. Liu, et\nal. 2015). Within the development of the InceptionV2 network (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015)\nbatch normalisation was added. The evolution of the InceptionV3 network was done\nby adding factorization convolutions with large \ufb01lter sizes and using auxiliary classi\ufb01ers\n(Szegedy, Vanhoucke, et al. 2015). The latest step in the development of the Inception\nnetworks was the impact of residual connections on the Inception network. The results\nwas the Inceptionv4 network, the Inception-ResNet-v1 and v2 networks (Szegedy, Ioffe,\net al. 2017). Due to its availability within the Keras framework the Inceptionv3 variant was\nchosen to process the visual modality of this thesis.\n3For further details see (He et al. 2016b) and https://cv-tricks.com/keras/\nunderstand-implement-resnets/ , retrieved on 21.07.2020.\n28\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.1.3 Modeling of meta-data\nSince meta-data can only occur in combination with other data, as they describe them,\nthere are no pretrained or freely available networks like BERT or InceptionV3. In this thesis,\na shallow MLP should be established for processing this modality which will be described\nand analyzed in section 4.1.\n3.2 Target variable\nThe dataset provides different kinds of labels, 2-way (fake or no fake), 3-way (true, fake\nbut the text is true) and, 6-way (True, Satire/Parody, Misleading Content, Imposter Con-\ntent, False Connection, Manipulated Content) (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017) . A detailed\nanalysis of the dataset will be provided in section 4.1. For this thesis the 2-way label is\nappropriate, but the network will be designed for a multi-label problem.\n29\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.3 Multimodal Architecture\nFigure 3.5. Detailed overview of the proposed method.\nThe multimodal architecture is seen in \ufb01gure 3.5. It consists of several work\ufb02ows, one\nfor each modality. For the two textual modalities namely title and comments, the data is\npre-processed through the BERT Tokenization module. Afterwards the representation is\nlearned by the BERT Language Model. Depending on which modality, or fusion of modal-\nities, is evaluated a fusion layer connects different learned feature vectors. For the visual\nmodality the data is also pre-processed. After resizing and normalising the images, the rep-\nresentation is fed into a state-of-the-art image model, such as ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2\nor InceptionV3. Also the meta-data modality is pre-processed by applying z-score normal-\nization to all input vectors. Afterwards the representation is fed to a shallow MLP .\nIf one modality is evaluated, only one classi\ufb01cation layer follows the encoder. If more than\none modality needs to be evaluated, a fusion layer is implemented in between. Depending\nif the meta-data modality is involved, two separate fusion layers (Level 1 - Fusion and Level\n2 - Fusion) are implemented to keep the information value of each modality at the same\nmeaning level. The speci\ufb01c implementation details of the fusion layers are described within\nthr rest of this chapter.\n30\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.4 Implementation\nFigure 3.6. Detailed overview of the implementation of the proposed method.\nThe implementation4of the thesis was done by using Jupyter Notebooks5and Python\n3.6.6The hardware speci\ufb01cations can be found in section 4.4.2 of this thesis. The neural\nnetwork was implemented by using the Keras - Platform7for Tensor\ufb02ow 2.8For the usage\nof Tensor\ufb02ow 2 also the available GPUs should be used addressed by utilizing NVIDIA\u2019s\nCUDA Framework9in combination with Tensor\ufb02ow 2 Mirrored Strategies10, so the avail-\nability of multiple GPUs can be ef\ufb01ciently used. The models itself were implemented by\n4The repositories for this thesis are for the preprocessing steps: https://github.com/akirchknopf/\nFID-Preprocessing and for the model / network part: https://github.com/akirchknopf/\nFID-Model-Handling and for the evaluation part: https://github.com/akirchknopf/FID-Evaluation .\n5https://jupyter.org/ , retrieved on 17.07.2020.\n6https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/ , retrieved on 17.07.2020.\n7https://keras.io/ , retrieved on 17.07.2020.\n8https://www.tensor\ufb02ow.org/ , retrieved 17.07.2020.\n9https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads , retrieved on 17.07.2020.\n10https://www.tensor\ufb02ow.org/guide/distributed_training , retrieved on 17.07.2020.\n31\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\nusing the Keras Functional API, because it allows building models with several inputs and\nthe ability to fuse different outputs from different models.11Unless otherwise stated, RELU\nis chosen as activation function (Nair and Hinton 2010).\nAs it can be seen in \ufb01gure 3.6 the implementation consists out of several components,\nthat are going to be described during the rest of this chapter. For all modalities, except\nfor the meta-data modality, state-of-the-art methods were adapted for processing the data.\nFor simplicity the data-preprocessing is excluded from the follwing network schematics.\n3.4.1 Data-Processing\nEach data modality is pre-processed before being fed into the connected encoder. The\ntextual modalities are pre-processed by applying standard Natural Language Processing\nmethods, such as lower-case all the text and removing punctuation and numbers as de-\nscribed in (Nakamura et al. 2020). The images are resized to \ufb01t the neural networks input\nsize and are standardized by the dataset means. The meta-data values were standardized\nusing the z-score normalization approach.\n3.4.2 Textual component\nBERT, as described in section 3.1.1 was implemented by utilizing the \"BERT -for-TF2\" pack-\nage.12This allows the usage of BERT in form of a common Keras layer. In this thesis the\nBERT Layer is implemented, followed by a Dropout layer (Srivastava et al. 2014). The\nclassi\ufb01cation layer is a classic softmax layer (Bridle 1990a; Bridle 1990b) as seen in \ufb01gure\n3.7.\nFigure 3.7.

Dur-\ning the \ufb01rst part of the experiments all of the three proposed networks are going to be\nevaluated.\nFigure 3.8. Architecture overview about the network for the visual modality. For each run\na different network ResNet50v2, ResNet101V2 or InceptionV3 is used.\n33\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.4.4 Meta component\nFor the meta component, a small MLP with three layers was created as seen in \ufb01gure 3.9.\nThe weights were initialized by using the Xavier initializer (Glorot and Bengio 2010). This\nmethod successes over \"traditional\" random initializers. One bene\ufb01t above the randomly\ninitialized function is the variance of the backpropagated gradient. By using the random\ninitialised weights the variance of the backpropagated gradient is much higher than the\nvariance of the gradient using the Glorot Normal or Xavier initialisation method. On the one\nhand, this initialising method is very suitable for tanh and sigmoid activation function but,\non the other hand not so good for ReLus (Nair and Hinton 2010). Nevertheless, all layers\nin this thesis are implemented by using ReLu activation. So the meta-model should also\nbeing implemented by using this kind of activation function. Furthermore for this shallow\nMLP L1 and L2 regularizer were also utilized.13\nFigure 3.9. Architecture overview about the network for the meta modality.\n13https://keras.io/api/layers/regularizers/ , retrieved on 17.07.2020.\n34\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.4.5 Two modalities\nFor the two modalities approach six possible combinations were evaluated. For this pur-\npose, the already trained single modal network has been split up and rebuild. On top of\nboth models, a concatenation layer is set. Afterwards a dense layer with 512 neurons,\nfollowed by a dropout layer, and \ufb01nally a softmax classi\ufb01cation layer is build, as seen for\nthe approaches in \ufb01gures 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12. If the meta modality is involved it is not con-\ncatenated to the other modalities directly. Due to its simplicity and availability, this modality\nwill be concatenated after reducing the other modalities ( or the concatenation of it ) to a\nsix neurons representation as seen in \ufb01gures 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15.\nIf an image model is evaluated in combination with the other modality, only the best\nmodel of the mono-modal runs were further processed.\nFigure 3.10.

The \ufb01rst architecture \"title, comments, and visual\" will be\nalso evaluated with different fusion techniques.\nFigure 3.16.

The\nmeta modality is again fused in a later step due to its simplicity and shallowness. As seen\nin \ufb01gure 3.20 the fusion is again a two level approach as already introduced before to retain\nthe information value of the meta modality.\nFigure 3.20. Architecture overview about the network for the modalities visual, comments,\nvisual and meta.\nWithin the next sections relevant parts of proposed method such as fusion strategies,\nloss function and regularization strategies are introduced.\n40\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.4.8 Fusion\nWithin the multimodal approaches, different fusion strategies will be evaluated. Possible\ncandidates are Concatenation but also Maximum or Add fusion strategy would be an op-\ntion. Only the best multimodal combinations will be evaluated with different fusion strate-\ngies which are easily implemented over the Keras API14. These are:\n\u2022 Concatenation\n\u2022 Maximum\n\u2022 Addition\nConcatenation\nFigure 3.21. Example how the Concatenation layer works.\nAs an example, given is a vector a and a vector b as shown in \ufb01gure 3.21. Concatenating\nthe two vectors means that the two input vectors, which do not have to have the same\nlength, except for the concatenation axis, are joined lengthwise into vector c, but their\nvalues are not changed. This is a common way to retain all information from the layers, or\nin this case modalities.\n14https://keras.io/api/layers/merging_layers/ , retrieved on 25.08.2020.\n41\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\nMaximum\nFigure 3.22. Example how the Maximum layer works.\nAs an example, given is a vector a and a vector b as shown in \ufb01gure 3.22. Maximum of\nthe two vectors means, that both input vectors must have the same shape and after that\nthey are compared element by element and the higher value is copied into a new vector c,\nwith the same shape.\nAddition\nFigure 3.23. Example how the Addition layer works.\nAs an example, given is a vector a and a vector b as shown in \ufb01gure 3.23. Addition of\nthe two vectors means, that the two input vectors, of same shape, are added element by\nelement and a new vector c. of same shape, is returned.\nTo summon up, each fusion strategy has it own advantages, which are dependent on the\ninput modality. During the experiments in chapter 4 all of them are evaluated for several\nmodels. Only the Level 1 Fusion, as seen in \ufb01gure 3.6 will be affected by these different\nstrategies. The Level 2 Fusion will be always a concatenation.\n42\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.4.9 Loss function and optimization\nAll the used models in this thesis are going to be optimized on the validation loss. The\nSparse Categorical Cross Entropy function was chosen as a loss function. It is a softmax\nactivation plus a cross-entropy loss. This loss is used for a multi-class problem. Since the\ndataset, which will be introduced in section 4.1, has up to six different classes, this loss\nfunction suits very well. The \ufb01rst part, the softmax function is de\ufb01ned in Goodfellow et al.\n(2016) as followed:\nsoftmax (x)i=exp(xi)/summationtextn\nj=1exp(xj)\nThis activation function is widely used in uncountable classi\ufb01cation problems and is part\nof multiple deep learning frameworks such as Caffe, PyTorch, and Tensor\ufb02ow15.\nThe categorical cross-entropy loss must be calculated for each class label per prediction\nand sum up the result, so the formula is:\nCE=\u22121\nn/summationdisplay\ni\u2208currBatch(tilnyi+ (1\u2212yi)ln(1\u2212yi))\nSondetermines all samples in the batch, iiterates over the batch targets tand outputs\ny(Skansi 2018). The difference between categorical and sparse categorical cross-entropy\nloss is only the format of the labels e.g.:\nCategorical Cross Entropy:\ny_true = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1,0]]\nwill changed in Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy to:\ny_true = [0, 1, 1]\nSo if the labels are available in integers ( e.g. in the 6-way label ) then sparse categorical\ncross-entropy is the better choice due to the fact that the conversion from integer label\nencoding to one-hot encoding have not to be done. The loss function is implemented using\nthe Keras API.\n15https://keras.io/api/layers/activations/ , retrieved on 29.07.2020.\n43\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\n3.4.10 Regularizing strategies\nIn this section strategies for the regularization of neural networks, which are going to be\nused in this thesis, will be introduced.\nDropout\nSrivastava et al. (2014) introduced the concept of a Dropout Layer which helps to prevent\nneural networks from over\ufb01tting. The idea behind was pretty simple but very effective.\nDuring training the Dropout Layer drops randomly (based on a passed value) unit and their\nconnections to the other neurons. So the networks have to learn in different ways by using\nalternative connections each time the neurons got deactivated as seen in \ufb01gure 3.24.\nFigure 3.24. Example of how Dropout works.\n44\n3 A Multimodal Approach for Identi\ufb01cation of Information Disorder\nL2 - L1 Regularization\nOriginally known as weight decay, ridge regression, or Tikhonov regularization is the L2\nregularization one of the most commonly used regularization strategies. The formula is:\n\u2126 (\u0398) =1\n2/bardbl\u03c9/bardbl2\n2\nThe L1 regularization is another method of penalizing the model parameters. The for-\nmula is:\n\u2126 (\u0398) =/bardbl\u03c9/bardbl1=/summationdisplay\ni|wi|,\nThe values of L2 and/or L1 are added to the loss term to prevent the model from over-\n\ufb01tting too quick. (Goodfellow et al. 2016) Within the Keras framework regularizers can be\neasily used by calling the regularizers class/function.16\nWithin this thesis, the combination of L1 and L2 regularizers is used for the meta modality\nbecause there is no pretrained network for this modality available and the network should\nnot over\ufb01t too quickly.\n16https://keras.io/api/layers/regularizers/ , retrieved on 21.07.2020.\n45\n4 Experiments & Results\nThis chapter introduces the chosen dataset Fakeddit and related data sanitation and data\npre-processing steps. Afterwards the experimental setups of each modality and combina-\ntion of modalities are presented including the calculated results.\n4.1 Dataset: Fakeddit\n4.1.1 Description\nThe Fakeddit dataset (Nakamura et al. 2019; Nakamura et al. 2020) was chosen because\nit was published very recently and consists out of a remarkable amount of multimodal data.\nThis allows experiments on a large scale problem. All types of information disorder, as\nde\ufb01ned in section 2.1, are part of this multimodal dataset. Another advantage is that due\nto the novelty of the dataset, there are few methods from other authors available.\nThe Fakeddit dataset (Nakamura et al. 2020) consists out of one million samples from up\nto six different categories of information disorder and was collected by using the pushshift\nAPI.1\nFigure 4.1. Excerpt of top 25 most discussed topics on Reddit on 02.07.2020, 13:55.\n1https://www.pushshift.io , retrieved on 29.07.2020.\n46\n4 Experiments & Results\nIncluded are not only textual information but also visual and meta-data information.2All\nthis information are collected from 2008 to 2019 and around 680k samples are multimodal\nsamples. The source of this dataset is Reddit3, the so-called front page of the internet.\nIt consists out of uncountable subreddits, or sub-themes where users can discuss and\ncomment on a wide variety of content. An example of what is currently (02-07-2020, 13:55)\nmostly discussed on Reddit can be found in \ufb01gure 4.1 but it changes within minutes. It is\na very good example of how volatile the current important topics on the internet are. The\ndataset content is widely spread from political news to daily-life content. Every user can\nup/down vote and comment each single submission and helps so to separate valuable\ncontent from fakes or unnecessary information.\nReddit, as a social media website, has 430 million users4and had 1.55 billions total vis-\nits from February 2020 to July 2020.5With around 130k active communities (subreddits)\nand around 30 billion page views per month Reddit has a highly active community, dis-\ncussing about nearly anything and anyone. Depending on the time of the day, around 400k\ncomments and around 50k new submissions are posted on Reddit, as seen in \ufb01gure 4.2.6\nAccording to statista.com, Reddit belongs to the Top 6 of the most popular social networks\napps in the US with around 50 million US users in September 2019.7In July 2020 around\n51% of the users originated from the US, followed by the UK with around 7,7%, the \ufb01rst,\nmainly German speaking country is Germany with around 3.18% on the 5th place.\nFigure 4.2.

At \ufb01rst, each moderator of\neach subreddit checks if all posted items are related to the subreddits topic purpose and\nremoved it otherwise. Secondly, the score feature of each subreddit is used to \ufb01lter the con-\ntent furthermore. Every sample with a score below 1 was consequently removed, because\nthe score feature shows if the sample contributes to the topic or is off-topic or misleading.\nDue to the large number of samples, the ground-truth veri\ufb01cation process is not com-\npletely manual due to lack of human resources. The authors took randomly ten samples\nfrom each subreddit and checked if the samples are related to the subreddits theme or\nnot. If any of the samples are not related, the whole subreddit is removed together with all\nrelated samples. Afterwards all samples are labelled with a 2-way, 3-way, and 6-way label,\nwhich will be described in the rest of this section. However, it must be pointed out that not\nevery sample has been manually checked for correctness!\nThe provided label groups of the dataset are:\n2-way-label:\n\u2022 Fake\n\u2022 No Fake\nSo the output of a model can be either fake or no fake. This label group does not\ndistinguish if the image is showing a correct content but only the text is false. This will be\nthe preferred label group during the performed experiments in this thesis.\n3-way-label:\n\u2022 True\n\u2022 Fake, but Text is true\n\u2022 Fake and Text is also a fake\nThe 3-way label group allows to distinguish results in a more \ufb01ne-grained way. So the\nresult can be completely true or if the image contains fake information but the describing\ntext can be true. This can happen if the image is manipulated and the text describes\nthe non manipulated image. Finally, the whole sample can be a complete fake, including\nimages and text.\n48\n4 Experiments & Results\n6-way-label:\n\u2022 True\n\u2022 Satire/Parody\n\u2022 Misleading Content\n\u2022 Manipulated Content\n\u2022 False Connection\n\u2022 Imposter Content\nThe 6-way-label group is based on the work of Wardle (2017) as already described in\nsection 2 and shown \ufb01gure 2.3. Again, there is no hard border where mis-, or disinformation\nstarts or ends, because it is a continuum and sometimes a sample could be interpreted to\ncontain parts of both worlds.\n4.1.3 Dataset partition\nThis section describes the technical and statistical aspects of the chosen Fakeddit dataset.\nIn general deep learning datasets are splitted into three different parts. The training set\ncontains most of the samples from the dataset and is used to train the model. The validation\nset can be either a subset of the training set (which is then not used for training) or a\nseparate set. It is used for the validation step of the model to \ufb01nd out how well the model\nperforms. The third part is the so-called test set. The test set is never touched, except after\ntraining the model to test the performance on an unseen part of the data set.\nThe whole dataset is pre-splitted, by the creators, into four sets:8\n1. Train set with 878218 samples\n2. Validation set with 92444 samples\n3. Public test set with 92444 samples\n4. Private test set with 92444 samples for the leaderboard (Which is held back)9\nAll three publicly available sets are exactly the same if the three label groups are consid-\nered as it can be seen in table 4.1. It should be noted that the test set was also analyzed\nfor completeness only, but no parameters were selected or optimized based on the test\nset. This would contradict the scienti\ufb01c approach.\n8These numbers came from the original paper published by (Nakamura et al. 2020).\n9This is not yet available at the time of writing of this thesis.\n49\n4 Experiments & Results\nLabel-group Label Training-Set Validation-Set Test-Set\n2-way label Fake 46% 46% 46%\nNo fake 54% 54% 54%\n3-way label No fake 46% 46% 46%\nFake, but true text 2% 2% 2%\nFake 52% 52% 52%\n6-way-label True 46% 46% 46%\nSatire/Parody 5% 5% 5%\nMisleading Content 16% 16% 16%\nImposter Content 3% 3% 3%\nFalse Connection 27% 27% 27%\nManipulated Content 3% 3% 3%\nTable 4.1. Percentage distribution of the individual label groups on the training, validation\nand test set\n50\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.1.4 Samples\nWithin the following section some examples are introduced and described. Some of the\nshown samples are not easily classify for us humans into fake or no-fake and shows how\nchallenging the task in general is.\nFigure 4.3. Sample 1\n Figure 4.4. Sample 2\nAs seen in \ufb01gure 4.3 the image shows a part of a music sheet. The title, \"I found a\nface in my sheet music too\", cannot be exposed as fake at \ufb01rst sight. At second glance,\nhowever, there is an interesting arrangement of single notes next to the word (sing). If you\nlook closer you can recognize a smiley or a face. The related score is 13, the number of\ncomments is 2, and the upvote/downvote ratio is 0.84.\nAs seen in \ufb01gure 4.4 a farm landscape with some sheep is shown. If you take a closer\nlook at the shadow of the sheep on the left side, you will notice that it does not look natural.\nOn closer inspection the shadow turns out to be a badly retouched version of a chicken.\nThe related score is 4, and the number of related comments is 60, and the upvote/downvote\nratio is 0.94.\nAs seen in \ufb01gure 4.5 several persons in costumes are shown. The title, \"The minuteman\nof Kiev\", describes what we can see on the image itself. But such heroes are, if gladly\ndesired, unfortunately \ufb01ction and thus fake. This sample does not have a related score, the\nnumber of comments is 103, and also the upvote/downvote ratio is not available.10\nAs seen in \ufb01gure 4.6 a piece of meat is shown. The title, \"Rabbi meat from cloned pig\n10Some meta-data of samples are missing. This is handled during the pre-processing step, as described in\nsection 4.1.6.\n51\n4 Experiments & Results\nFigure 4.5. Sample 3\n Figure 4.6. Sample 4\ncould be kosher for jews to eat with milk\", looks like a fake at \ufb01rst glance. But it is no fake,\nthis image, as also the title were published in an israeli newspaper in 2018.11The related\nscore is 577, and the count of comments is 6769, and the upvote/downvote ratio is 0.92.\nTo summarize this section, it is on the one hand often very obvious to us what is fake\nand what is not fake, but often enough our eyes are not easily convinced of the truth. The\nmeta modality can support the decision process because there is a clear trend. If you look\nat the score, you can see that it is increasing and parallel to this the upvote/downvote ratio\nis also increasing. This indicates that the community has reacted very strongly to this topic,\nwhich is especially evident in the last example with almost 7000 comments. It remains to\nbe seen whether this \ufb01rst insight is re\ufb02ected in the results of the method or not. This is also\na challenge for the proposed method.\n4.1.5 In depth analysis\nAn in-depth analysis of the dataset showed the following details which will have a great\nimpact on further method development. Many of the best settings for the hyperparameters\nof the method which should be developed can be estimated in a preprocessing step. The\nsequence length of the BERT tokenizer is one of the most important hyperparameter for\nthe text and comments modality. The greatest impact has this parameter on the training\ntime and accuracy. If it is too short, valueable parts of the text are cut off, if it is too long\nthe whole training process is stretched unnecessary because of a lower batch size. An\nanalysis of the data showed that 75% of the textual data of the \"clean_title\" column of the\ndataset has a length of 57 characters. A visual representation can be found in \ufb01gure 4.7.\nThe same analysis has been performed on the validation and test set, which shows a very\nsimilar picture. It has to be noted that all y-scales are logarithmic scales.\nThe number of words per title was similarly analyzed. Interestingly, in 75% of cases the\ntitles are not longer than 10 words as seen in \ufb01gure 4.8. Another analysis was performed on\n11https://www.timeso\ufb01srael.com/rabbi-meat-from-cloned-pig-could-be-eaten-by-jews-with-milk/ , re-\ntrieved on 26.08.2020.\n52\n4 Experiments & Results\nFigure 4.7.

As seen in \ufb01gure 4.9, 75 % of the sequences\nare not longer then 138 tokens.\nFigure 4.9. Distribution of the BERT\nsequence length of the whole train\nset.\nFigure 4.10. Distribution of the\nBERT sequence length of the\nwhole validation set.\nA very similar, homogeneous picture regarding the sequence length, can be found in the\nvalidation set as seen in \ufb01gure 4.10. Again around 75% of the tokens were not longer than\n140 tokens.\nThe same analysis was made for the comments of each submission. Around 75% of the\ncomments have a character length of less than 517 chars. A visual representation can be\nfound in 4.11. Another analysis on the word count showed that also 75% of the comments\nare not longer than 71 words (\ufb01gure 4.12).\nAs before the same analysis on the sequences of the BERT tokenizer was performed.\nAs seen in \ufb01gure 4.13, 4.14 75% of the comments of the train and validation set has a\nsequence length around 142 tokens.\nIt must be explicitly mentioned at this point that this analysis was not performed on the\ntest set. For the sake of science, the test set should not be analyzed, since the training\nparameters should be selected on the basis of the training set and were selected in this\nthesis.\n53\n4 Experiments & Results\nFigure 4.11. Distribution of\ncomments length of the whole train\nset.\nFigure 4.12. Distribution of\ncomments word count length of the\nwhole train set.\nFigure 4.13. Distribution of\ncomments sequence length of the\nwhole train set.\nFigure 4.14. Distribution of\ncomments sequence length of the\nwhole val set.\n54\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.1.6 Data sanitation and pre-processing\nIn this section the data loading and data sanitation process is described \ufb01rst and then the\ndata pre-processing is discussed. These processes will be described modality by modality.\nAt the end a table shows how many of the samples are left.\nTextual modality\nThe data set is made available as a CSV \ufb01le. The splits are distributed by own csv \ufb01les ex-\ncept for the submission comments which are collected in one huge 2GB \ufb01le. This data for-\nmat is very well compressable but still 800k samples for training are a challenging amount\nof data. After a \ufb01rst inspection non-relevant columns were dropped. Furthermore, rows\nwith no title attribute are together dropped with samples where no image is available. The\ncreators prepared an already sanitized and converted to a lowercase version of the title\nwithin the clean_title column.\nFor the comments modality, all comments concerning a speci\ufb01c ID are collected, after-\nwards the text is cleaned as described in (Nakamura et al. 2020). Furthermore, the number\nof theoretically available and actually existing comments is not negligible. Because these\nmeta information is very important the number of the real available comments is inserted\ninto the column, because the comments text and the number of comments are also pro-\ncessed as a feature.\nVisual modality\nAll images could be obtained in two ways. Since all links are available in the csvs \ufb01les, the\nimages could be downloaded from the respective platforms using a program provided by\nthe authors. Since this possibility often caused problems with non-downloadable images,\nall images were provided via an archive.12The images were available in different image\nsizes, but all of them were uniformly in JPG format.\nAlso, the visual information is pre-processed. The images are reduced to a size of\n256px x 256px and 768px x 768px. This step is necessary due to the fact that the used\nimage models requires an uniform input image size. This means that images that are too\nlarge are scaled down and images that are too small are scaled up. All the images are then\nsaved to a harddisk. During this pre-processing step, the mean and standard deviation is\ncalculated and saved. Afterwards the mean over the whole dataset is calculated and sub-\ntracted during runtime together with a normalization between 0 - 1 to be better processed\nby the neural network. saving the images again has the background, because it would be\n12Available here: https://github.com/entitize/Fakeddit , retrieved on 27.08.2020.\n55\n4 Experiments & Results\nvery expensive to do this on the \ufb02y. This would result in an unnecessary extension of the\nruntime of each epoch. In addition, this process would have to be repeated with each run,\nwhich would also be unnecessary.\nMeta modality\nauthor_enc num_comments score upvote/downvote ratio\nValue ranges 0 - 273235 0 - 10783 -950 - 137179 0.5 - 1.0\nNo values 28535 167089 0 167089\n% of clean training set 5% 30% 0% 30%\nTable 4.2. Count of samples and percantage of missing meta data entries of the cleaned\ndataset.\nThe meta data modality was the most complex one for the data pre-processing step.\nAs seen in table 4.2 an overview about the meta modality of the already cleaned training\ndataset is given. The \ufb01rst column shows the author encoding. The authors were encoded\nby replacing the name by an unique id. This resulted in 273234 unique author ids. So in\ngeneral each author wrote three entries of the cleaned dataset. The last number (273235)\nis given if the authors name is not available. The number of comments is in the range of 0\nto 10783, but for the sake of completeness it should be mentioned that this number refers\nto the theoretically actual available comments. During the pre-processing step, the actual\nnumber of comments available is inserted in this column. This has to be noted also for the\nscore column. The values within this column reaches from -950 to 137179 and shows the\nimmense range of values. The last column, the upvote/downvote ratio ranges from 0.5 to\n1.0.\nauthor_enc num_comments score upvote/downvote ratio\nValue ranges 0 - 273235 -0.218 - 11.63 -0.441 - 44.82 0.5 - 1.0\nTable 4.3. Meta data values after normalizaton\nAs already stated above, during this process some problems occurred. Within the\ncolumns score, upvote_ratio and num_comments a lot of missing data were observed.\nBefore occurring nan values are \ufb01lled, the mean and standard deviation were calculated\nfor the z score normalisation. The reason behind is, that a network can learn features\nwhich are normalized in the same range or around a certain point more easier. In table\n4.3 the value ranges after the normalization are shown. Missing data are \ufb01lled with so-\ncalled NAN13values. Afterwards the NAN values, which now encoding missing data, are\n\ufb01lled with the negative max values of the column, to represent a identical value that should\nshow anomaly. Additionally a new column is introduced \"hasNan\". In each row where a\nNAN value occurs the value is set to 1. The combination of the negative max value in the\n13NAN = not a number.\n56\n4 Experiments & Results\noriginal column in combination with the 1 in the additional column should represent the fact,\nthat this data entry was not existent. The goal of this arti\ufb01cial feature generation should be\nto tell the network in the simplest possible way that all entries with this value combination\nare \"faulty\". This is also the reason why the z-normalized columns are not centered around\n0, as you can see in table 4.3. This process is also performed for the columns score,\nupvote_ratio and num_comments.\nStatistics\nDuring the data sanitation and pre-processing step some of the samples were removed\nfrom the dataset. Due to the multimodal approach of this method all samples without an\nimage were removed. Sometimes important information such as the title or clean_title were\nmissing. These samples were also removed. These operations were applied to all sets.\nThe following table 4.4 shows the count and percentage of the original number of samples\nleft.\nTrainings-Set Validation-Set Test-Set\nbefore sanitation 878218 76767 76752\nafter sanitation 560622 58972 58954\n% left: 64% 77% 77%\nTable 4.4. Percentage of samples left after the sanitation proces.\nTo summon up, the data sanitation and pre-processing step is important to normalize\nand transform the input data into a machine learning understandable data format. The\nobservations and facts established in this section are congruent with those presented by\nthe dataset creators in their paper.\n57\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.2 Performance measures\nFor this method classi\ufb01cation accuracy (= portion of correct classi\ufb01ed samples) is chosen\nas a performance measure because for a binary problem, as described in section 3.2, F1\nscore is possible, but not necessary. Furthermore, the proposed leaderboard14and the\npaper of the dataset authors (Nakamura et al. 2019) and (Nakamura et al. 2020) have also\nchosen the accuracy metric and thus comparability to alternative approaches is given.\nAn important factor to mention is the so-called random baseline. The random base-\nline represents a limit, which means that if this value is exceeded, a learning success is\nrecorded. This limit is 61% in this thesis. In a balanced case this limit lies at 50%. So every\nresult above 61% can be rated as success, everything below shows that the model does\nnot learn from the extracted features.\n4.3 Hyper-Parameters\nThis sections introduces the chosen Hyperparameters of the proposed method. Hyperpa-\nrameters are divided into two different subcatories in this thesis. Firstly, model parameters\nwhich controls different settings of parts of the network and related submodels. Secondly,\ntraining parameters which controls directly the training procedures.\n14The leaderboard is at the time of writing this thesis not available, see furthermore: https://github.com/\nentitize/Fakeddit/issues/1 , retrieved on 20.08.2020.\n58\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.3.1 Model Parameters\nThis section introduces relevant model parameters which con\ufb01gures whole modes or only\nsub settings of the network. These are:\n\u2022 BERT - Sequence Length\n\u2022 Image Models - Model\n\u2022 Image Models - Image Size\n\u2022 Meta Model - Architecture\n\u2022 Meta Model - Initializer\n\u2022 Fusion layer\nAlready introduces in section 4.1.5 the sequence length is one import model parameter\nof the BERT model. In the \ufb01rst step, the tokenization, the text is tokenized. The sequence\nlength controls the maximum length of the afterwards taken count of tokens. The maximum\nvalue, without changing the BERT layer itself and lossing all the pretrained weights, is 512.\nThe experiments and results in section 4 will show the impact of the sequence length on\nthe models performance.\nAs already introduced in section 3.1.2 three different image models are going to be\nevaluated in mono modal runs. The results are shown in section 4.5.1 and the best model\nwill be further used in the multimodal runs. The second related model parameter is the\nimage size. Assuming that a high resolution of the image will result in a high information\nvalue and further improve the results. This will be evaluated in section 4.5.1 too.\nConcerning the meta model two different model parameters are introduced. At \ufb01rst the\nwhole meta models architecture as described in section 3.4.4. The shallow MLP architec-\nture is chosen due to the available complexity of the input features. Secondly, the initializer\nfunction, is chosen based on the paper of Glorot and Bengio (2010) which is also refer-\nenced in the Keras Functional API Documentation.\nThe last model parameter is the fusion layer. Within the evaluation part of this method\nthree different kinds of fusion strategies, namely Concatenation, Addition and Maximum,\nare going to be evaluated. These are described in detail in section 3.4.8.\n59\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.3.2 Training Parameters\nFor each of the runs, different parameter settings were chosen based on the modality or\ncombination. The following parameters can be varied for training (except for the optimizer,\nwhich will be discussed afterwards):\n\u2022 Batch size\n\u2022 Epochs of training\n\u2022 Learning rate\nThe batch size is being individually adapted for each experiment for \ufb01tting on the evalua-\ntion hardware which will be introduced in section 4.4.2. This parameter varies from system\nto system.\nThe count of epochs for the training will be prede\ufb01ned in the experimental setups during\nthis section and de\ufb01nes how often the the training process will learn from the whole train-\ning data. If the early stopping callback triggers before this maximum count of epochs is\nreached, the experiment will be ended.\nLastly, the learning rate is also a training parameter which can be adapted. A too high\nlearning rate can result in a not converging model and/or in a consequently high loss.\nSmith (2017) showed that a estimation of the correct learning rate in advance can reduce\nthe training time tremendously. All models in this thesis will be evaluated with a static\nstarting learning rate of 10-5for the sake of comparison. If the model is detecting a loss\nplateau the learning rate is reduced to \ufb01nd the next local minimum.\n60\n4 Experiments & Results\nOptimizer\nAs the successor of AdaGrad (Duchi et al. 2011) and RMSProp15,Adam by Kingma and Ba\n(2017) was chosen due to its simplicity and computationally ef\ufb01cient design as an optimizer\nalgorithm and combining the advantages of both methods mentioned before. The design\nallows us to calculate the gradient ef\ufb01ciently and is suitable for large scale problems with a\nlot of parameters to learn.\nThe Adam optimizer takes three additional arguments, the learning rate, beta_1, beta_2\nand epsilon. Experiments by the authors showed that default values of beta_1 = 0.9,\nbeta_2 = 0.999, and epsilon = 10-8are suitable for their experiments.16and proposes\ne.g. for an InceptionV3 Network a value of 1.0 or 0.1 for epsilon. This will be evaluated in\nsection 4.5.1. All the proposed values are taken as default inputs for all experiments in this\nthesis.\nOver\ufb01tting prevention\nTo prevent over\ufb01tting two different methods are utilized. First an early stopping callback\nand secondly a method for reducing the learning rate on a plateau17. Both methods are\nprovided by the Keras API.18For the experiments, the early stopping patience of three\nepochs and restoring the weights of the best epoch was most suitable.\n15Still an unpublished method, background and further information available here: https://www.cs.toronto.\nedu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf . Retrieved on 02.07.2020.\n16The Keras documentation for the Adam optimizer states a different default value for epsilon, to precise: 10-7\nhttps://keras.io/api/optimizers/adam/ .\n17https://keras.io/api/callbacks/reduce_lr_on_plateau/ , retrieved on 02.07.2020.\n18https://keras.io/api/callbacks/early_stopping/ , retrieved on 02.07.2020.\n61\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.4 Experimental setup\nThe evaluation section will describe each run con\ufb01guration with the chosen Hyper-parameters\nand its result. Within this chapter a detailed description of the how the research questions\nare going to be answered is given, together with insights about how the experiments are\ncarried out and in which order. Finally, the results are going to be discussed.\n4.4.1 Research Questions\nAs in section 1.3 introduced, the research questions should be answered by performing\nexperiments on the Fakeddit dataset.\nWhich modality is more meaningful for information news detection, two different\ntextual modalities, the visual modality or the meta modality?\nAfter developing a multi modal neural network architecture for all modalities, each modal-\nity is evaluated one by one. Afterwards the results are evaluated and this question can be\nanswered.\nTo what extent can combined multimodal analysis, as opposed to mono-modal,\nimprove the detection of fake information in social media data?\nAfterwards the best con\ufb01gurations and parameters from the \ufb01rst, single modal runs were\nselected and combined in the developed multimodal approach. Combinations include two,\nthree and all four modalities. All possible combinations of modalities were evaluated to\nassess their mutual bene\ufb01t.\nWhich network architectures from research are best suited for the multimodal\nanalysis of fake information?\nTo answer this research question different modality-speci\ufb01c pre-trained network archi-\ntectures were integrated into the proposed solution for encoding the respective modalities.\nThe different architectures were systematically evaluated and compared.\n62\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.4.2 Evaluation Protocol\nWithin the rest of this chapter the experiments are carried out and the results are de-\nscribed. Firstly, the experiments for each modality are described. Beginning from the\nmono-modal experiments, over fusing two, three and lastly all four modalities. For the \ufb01rst\nmon-omonodal experiments, the architecture as described in section 3.4 and seen in \ufb01gure\n3.6 is splitted up and each modality is evaluated one-by-one. Afterwards the best mono-\nmodal models are fused into a dual modal setting and their output is fused together within\nthe Level 1 Fusion, an example is seen in \ufb01gure 3.11. If the meta modality is involved, the\nmodels output is consequently reduced and then concatenated and evaluated an example\nof this fusion strategy is seen in \ufb01gure 3.13. The same procedure is adapted for fusing\nthree different kinds of modalities and afterwards for all four modalities.\nEach experiment is systematically carried out by the following schema. Firstly, the appro-\npriate settings of the experiments are logged and saved for later investigation. Secondly,\nthe model is trained on the training set until the maximum count of epochs is reached, or\nthe early stopping criterion is ful\ufb01lled. This will prevent the model from over\ufb01tting. Thirdly,\nafter each epoch the models performance is evaluated on the validation set, which is held\nout and is not part of the training set. The models weights are updated. Lastly, after the\ntraining procedure has been completed, the models performance is \ufb01nally evaluated on the\nseparate test set.\nIn addition to the logging of parameters and results the best weights are also saved for\nfurther evaluation and investigation.\nHardware setup and implementation\nAll experiments are carried out on following hardware:\n\u2022 Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS\n\u2022 CPU i7-6900K @ 3.2 GHZ - 16 Threads\n\u2022 128 GB RAM\n\u2022 1 TB SSD Samsung EVO 860\n\u2022 4 x GTX 1080 Founders Edition with 8GB RAM\n63\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.5 Experiments and results\n4.5.1 Mono modal experiments and results\nFigure 4.15. Overview about the single modal approach\nThe \ufb01rst experiments will test all single modalities such as Title, Comments, Visual, and\nMeta as seen in the overview \ufb01gure 4.15. Afterwards the best parameters and network\ncon\ufb01gurations were chosen for following multimodal experiments. For the combination\napproaches the pretrained weights of the single modality networks were loaded and only\nthe resulting head is trained due to time and performance reasons. The head describes all\nlayers which are used to fuse and classify the processed samples. It is marked as white\nboxes with black borders within section 3.4.5 and beyond.\n64\n4 Experiments & Results\nTitle and Comments modality\nFor the textual modality of the experiments, BERT was chosen as mentioned before. The\nassumed settings for the textual modality can be found in table 4.5 for the title and 4.6 for\nthe comments. To validate the assumption that the sequence length should be chosen so\nthat most samples19can be mapped to it, a simpli\ufb01ed form of grid search is used. The\naim is to evaluate the model on the given dataset by altering, in this case, the sequence\nlength, to \ufb01nd the best ratio between accuracy and runtime. The results can be found in\nthe following tables.\nRun 1 Run 2 Run 3 Run 4 Run 5 Run 6\nSequence length 32 64 128 192 256 512\nEpochs 7/10 7/10 5/10 5/10 5/10 5/10\nBatch Size 512 228 96 64 32 16\nOptimizer - Beta 1 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9\nOptimizer - Beta 2 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999\nOptimizer - Epsilon 10-810-810-810-810-810-8\nDuration (mean) minutes 15.2 32.2 66.2 101.6 158.4 352\nAccuracy - Validation % 88.01% 88.21% 88.10% 87.99% 88.10% 88.23%\nAccuracy - Test % 88.03% 88.20% 88.10% 87.95% 88.23% 88.23%\nTable 4.5.

Run con\ufb01guration and results for the comments modality.\nThe results showed an interesting picture. For each of the six performed runs for each\nof the both modalities title and comments a similar behaviour could be observed.\nStarting with table 4.5 and \ufb01gure 4.16, it can be seen that altering the sequence length\nhas impact on various details. The \ufb01rst and most obvious fact is the parallelism between\nsequence length and duration of the corresponding epoch times. This is, for the title and\ncomments modality nearly the same, and therefore visualized in \ufb01gure 4.18 and \ufb01gure 4.19\ntoo.\n19For the assumption value see section 4.1.\n65\n4 Experiments & Results\nFigure 4.16. Results of the single modality title.\nFigure 4.17. Results of the single modality comments.\nFigure 4.18. Results of the\nevaluation of the ratio sequence\nlength to processing time for the\ntitle modality.\nFigure 4.19. Results of the\nevaluation of the ratio sequence\nlength to processing time for the\ncomments modality.\n66\n4 Experiments & Results\nHaving a closer look into table 4.5 and compare the sequence length and accuracy on\nthe validation and test set, the accuracies are hardly rising any more. Looking at the results\nof the comments modality in table 4.6 a similar picture is shown.\nThe same parallelism between sequence length and epoch duration can be observed\nas also the moderate increase of the accuracies, which are far over the random baseline,\nwhich is at 61%.20The results with around 88% for the title modalities and around 85% for\nthe comments modality is very good and shows the strength of the proposed mono-modal\napproach.\nFurthermore, it could be observed that the batch size does not have a lot of impact on\nthe accuracies. That shows that the models have a good ability to generalize and learn\nfrom the feature representations. In addition to this, it has to be noted that in no run the\nmaximum count of epochs (10) has been reached and the early stopping callback stopped\nthe training in before.\nTo summon up, to take a good average between the runs and also considering a mod-\nerate training time per epoch, a sequence length of 128 tokens is the best choice for the\ndataset. Also, the mean of the calculated \ufb01ve epochs with around 66 minutes is moderate\nand acceptable. This con\ufb01guration for both modalities are further implemented into the\nfollowing experiments as model parameters. Furthermore the \ufb01rst observation of section\n4.1.5, that the sequence length of BERT should be approximated in a pre-processing step\nis correct. The results of both textual modalities are very good. The comments modality is\neven a little better then the title modality, which was surprisingly.\n20The random baseline is represented in each image by the black line in the lower part of the image.\n67\n4 Experiments & Results\nVisual Modality\nThe visual modality will be evaluated by utilizing three different state-of-the-art image clas-\nsi\ufb01cation models as introduced in section 3.1.2, namely ResNet50v2, ResNet101v2 and\nInceptionv3. For this purpose different experiment parameters are assumed and intro-\nduced in the table 4.7. The main points to evaluate are, next to the different architectures,\nalso the impact of the image size on runtime and accuracy. The detailed results can be\nfound below in table 4.7\nRun 1 - ResNet50v2 Run 2 - ResNet101v2 Run 3 - InceptionV3 Run 4 - InceptionV3 Run 5 - ResNet50v2 Run 6 - InceptionV3\nEpochs 5/10 5/10 5/10 10/10 5/10 5/10\nImage Size 256px x 256px 256px x 256px 256px x 256px 256px x 256px 768px x 768px 768px x 768px\nBatch Size 256 128 256 256 32 32\nOptimizer - Beta 1 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9\nOptimizer - Beta 2 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999\nOptimizer - Epsilon 10-810-810-81 10-810-8\nDuration (mean) minutes 35.40 56.4 47 41 265.4 258.6\nAccuracy - Validation 77.13% 77.50% 78.11% 61.41% 80.89% 81.04%\nAccuracy - Test 77.47% 77.62% 78.48% 61.43% 81.23% 81.51%\nTable 4.7. Run con\ufb01guration and results for the visual modality.\nFigure 4.20. Results of the single modality visual.\nThe experiments with the visual modality showed a clear picture. The chosen networks:\nResNet50v2 (Run 1 and Run 5) ResNet101v2 (Run 2) and InceptionV3 (Run 3, 4 and 6)\nperformed pretty similar, but the Run 6 with the InceptionV3 was the best. Run 4 shows\nan outlier, which can be explained, because this run was made under the assumption\nthat a value of epsilon=1 for the optimizer will result in better runs, what was proposed in\nthe Keras documentation, referenced in the footnote of section 4.3.2. The result of 61.4%,\nwhich is hardly over the random baseline shows clearly that changing this parameter results\nin a large drop in the performance of the model. Run 5 and 6 were performed under the\nassumption that an input image with a higher resolution is favorable for fake classi\ufb01cation.\nThis can be con\ufb01rmed because Run 5 and Run 6 performed on the one hand better with\nan input size of 768px x 768px (before 256px x 256px) but on the other hand each epoch\nwas around \ufb01ve times slower. From 50 minutes per epoch to around 255 minutes. So a\ncompromise must be made if the better accuracy from around 81% counts or the faster\nprocessing time with around 77% accuracy, as it can be seen in \ufb01gure 4.20. When looking\n68\n4 Experiments & Results\nat the count of trained epochs it can be noticed that again the maximum count, except for\nRun 4, is not reached. Another option would be to fuse models which are not performing\nat the best level, but saving a lot of time during the training procedures. In this thesis time\nis not a problem so the better performing model is taken for all further experiments.\nMeta-Data Modality\nThe meta modality will be evaluated in a two-step process. The \ufb01rst step will evaluate\nwhich of the available features are meaningful, all of them, and then feature by feature. The\nexperiment settings can be found in table 4.8. The second step will fuse the most important\nfeatures and evaluate if arti\ufb01cially created columns (hasNanScore, hasNanUpvote)21have\na positive impact on the accuracy of the network. These settings can be found in table 4.8\nand table 4.9.\nRun 1 Run 2 Run 3 Run 4 Run 5\nEpochs 5/100 5/100 100/100 100/100 100/100\nChoosen columns all author_enc score upvote_ratio num_comments\nBatch Size 1024 1024 1024 1024 1024\nOptimizer - Beta 1 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9\nOptimizer - Beta 2 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999\nOptimizer - Epsilon 10-810-810-81 10-8\nDuration (mean) minutes 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23\nAccuracy - Validation 61.16% 60.76% 61.21% 74.54% 75.59%\nAccuracy - Test 61.19% 60.41% 61% 74.13% 75.63%\nTable 4.8. Run con\ufb01guration and results for the meta-data modality, only single feature.\nFigure 4.21. Results of the single modality meta-data by using in Run 1 all features and in\nthe Runs 2 - 5 only one feature.\nThe meta modality represents a dif\ufb01cult aspect of the dataset. The data consistence\nwas not very good and there were missing values as described on section 4.1.6. First\n21Why these columns were created is explained in section 4.1.6.\n69\n4 Experiments & Results\nexperiments with all meta-data (Run 1) and just with the author encoding (Run 2) performed\nnot very well, hardly above or below the random baseline. So looking at the results, the\nauthor encoding does not provide much information about if the topic is fake or not. The\nsame picture can be observed if all available and pre-processed meta-data are taken into\naccount (Run 1) or just the score feature (Run 3).\nThe most promising features were the upvote ratio (Run 4) which performed very well\nwith an accuracy on the validation and test set with around 74% and the count of available\ncomments regarding one topic, which performed slightly better with a validation and test\naccuracy about 75%. The training time was negligible with around 14 seconds with a batch\nsize from about 1024 as it can be seen in table 4.8 respectively in \ufb01gure 4.21. In this\ncase the count of epochs was always reached. More experiments can show if there is any\nimprovements if the count of epochs are further increased.\nRun 6 Run 7 Run 8\nEpochs 100/100 100/100 100/100\nChoosen columns score nan_score upvote nan_upvote upvote num_comments\nBatch Size 1024 1024 1024\nOptimizer - Beta 1 0.9 0.9 0.9\nOptimizer - Beta 2 0.999 0.999 0.999\nOptimizer - Epsilon 10-810-810-8\nDuration (mean) minutes 0.23 0.23 0.23\nAccuracy - Validation 61.21% 74.54% 77.8%\nAccuracy - Test 60.1% 74.13% 77.34%\nTable 4.9. Run con\ufb01guration and results for the meta modality, only best single features.\nFigure 4.22. Results of the single modality meta-data by using the best single features\ncombined.\nFusing the most promising single features, namely upvote ratio and num_comments,\ntogether showed an interesting picture. As it can be seen in \ufb01gure 4.22 in Run 6 combining\nthe features of the score with the hasNanScore feature does not increase the accuracy\non the validation and test set. The accuracy is more or less the random baseline with\n61%. The same observation could be made considering the upvote together with the\n70\n4 Experiments & Results\nhasNanUpVote feature.The accuracy is more or less the same from the single feature run\nwith around 74%. A different picture could be taken if the most promising features of the\nsingle feature meta runs 4 and 5, namely upvote ratio together with the count of comments\nare combined. After a learning time of around 100 epochs the validation and test accuracy\nwas \ufb01nally around 77.8% on the validation set and 77.34% on the test set. So combining\nthese feature results in a slightly better run (Run 8) and showed that Reddit\u2019s meta data\ncan also provide a useful source for fake information detection. Again the epoch time of\naround 14 seconds per epoch did not change.\nIn this section the mono-modal models have been evaluated by choosing different pa-\nrameters for the training procedures and model parameter for the con\ufb01guration of the mod-\nels. All the modalities showed remarkable results on validation and test sets. The two text\nmodalities performed around 88% resp. 86& and showed the importance of textual content\nin this task. The experiments on the visual modality proved that also images, depending\non the image size, can contribute a lot to this task. The best image model, the InceptionV3\nwill be further evaluated in the following combined tasks. It has also been proven that\nmeta-data, with an accuracy of up to 77.8% on the validation set, is an important part of a\ninformation disorder detection task. The challenge here is to \ufb01nd meaningful features. In\nthe following multimodal experiments the features of the num_comments and upvote ratio\ncolumns will be further evaluated. The next sections will cover multimodal experiments.\n71\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.5.2 Dual modal experiments and results\nThe second part of the experiments will now test all possible combinations of the best\nsingle modalities for the two modality approach. Within table 4.10 the assumed parameter\nsettings are presented. Since at this stage feature fusion is required, it has to be noted that\nat this point the features were fused by only utilizing concatenation as the preferred fusion\nstrategy.\nRun 1 Run 2 Run 3 Run 4 Run 5 Run 6\nChoosen modalities Title - Visual Title - Comments Title - Meta Comments - Meta Visual - Meta Visual - Comments\nSequence length 128 128 128 128 - 128\nEpochs 5/10 10/10 10/10 10/10 4/10 10/10\nBatch Size 228 2048 4096 1024 128 128\nImage Sizes 768px x 768px - - - 768px x 768px 768px x 768px\nOptimizer - Beta 1 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9\nOptimizer - Beta 2 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999 0.999\nOptimizer - Epsilon 10-810-810-810-810-810-8\nDuration (mean) minutes 93.80 39.2 20 20 86.25 90\nAccuracy - Validation 90.8% 85.9% 88.1% 78.2% 81.1% 88.0%\nAccuracy - Test 91.0% 85.7% 88.2% 78.2% 81.6% 88.1%\nTable 4.10. Overview about the experiment settings for dual modality.\nFigure 4.23. Results of the dual modality approach.\nAs it can be seen in table 4.10 and \ufb01gure 4.23, Run 1 performed the best with a validation\naccuracy of 90.8% and a test accuracy of 91%. The combination of the reddits title and\nrelated images performed very well. As mentioned in the previous section, from now only\nthe Inceptionv3 network is utilized for the visual modality. Also, Run 6 with images and\ncomments performed well and showed clearly the advantages of a multimodal approach.\nInterestingly, the runs containing meta information (Run 3, 4, and 5) did not improve the\naccuracy against the mono-modal Run 1 of the title modality. The same picture is shown in\nRun 5 where the meta-information did not improve the accuracy against the mono-modal\nvisual run, which stays around 88%. Within the next section the three modality approach\nis introduced.\n72\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.5.3 Three modalities\nThe third part of the experiments will now test all possible combinations of the best sin-\ngle modalities for the three modality approach.

Results and parameters of the three modalities approach.\nFigure 4.24. Results of the three modalities approach.\nAs it can be seen in \ufb01gure 4.24 respectively table 4.11 fusing the main modalities ti-\ntle, comments and visual resulted in a very good run validation accuracy of 94,9% and\n94,99% on the test set. But with around 106 minutes per epoch training time also the\nslowest one. Also fusing the modalities title, comments, and meta (Run 4) resulted in a\nvery good validation accuracy of 94,4% and 94,46% on the test set respectively. This run\nwas with 43 minutes per epoch also the fastest one. Only in the case of the last run the\nmaximum count of epochs is reached, this leads to the hypothesis that there could be room\nfor improvement.\nRun 1 (Title, Visual, Comments) as a very good run was evaluated by fusing the three\nmodalities by different strategies, namely Concat, Maximum, and Add. The best result, as\nseen in \ufb01gure 4.25 was with a minimal better result than Maximum and Add, which was\nConcatenate with a validation accuracy of 94.90% and 94.99% on the test set. But there\nis to mention, that the numbers differ only in a very small range of values. There is no\nlonger to speak of a real \"improvement\". But what should be emphasized is that the best\nresults need the title and comments modalities to reach peak performances. The image\nand meta-data modality provide only minimal improvement.\n73\n4 Experiments & Results\nFigure 4.25. Results and parameters of the three modalities approach, comparison of\ndifferent fusion strategies.\nThe last section of the experiments is going to present the \ufb01nal proposed method, the\nusage of all four modalities, and its results.\n74\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.5.4 Four modalities\nThe fourth part of the experiments will test the best combination of the single modalities\nfor the four modality approach as seen in the overview \ufb01gure 3.6.

Results and parameters of the four modality approach.\nFigure 4.26. Results of the model with all four modalities with different fusion strategies.\nAfter the evaluation of the \"all modalities\" runs an interesting picture emerged. As seen\nin \ufb01gure 4.26 and table 4.12 using different fusion strategies slightly different results were\nachieved. Run 3 was the best run with the Add layer fusion strategy with a validation\naccuracy of 95.22% respectively 95.54% test accuracy, followed by the Concatenation layer\nfusion strategy with a validation accuracy of 95.01% respectively 95.20% on the test set.\nFinally, the Maximum layer fusion strategy was the \"worst\" one with a validation accuracy\nof 94.92% respectively 95.10% on the test set. But it has to be noted that the differences\nbetween all three fusion strategies are only at a very tiny scale. The results all in all are\nremarkable and shows the strength of a multimodal approach.\n75\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.5.5 Statistical evaluation\nWith this section some statistical evaluations are going to presented and discussed. The\naim is to \ufb01nd out statistical evidence which supports the exoeriments and results of the\nprevious section.\nValidation Set / Samples Validation / % Test Set / Samples Test / %\nNumber of misclassi\ufb01ed samples - Over all models 157 0.27% 279 0.47%\nSingle Modal\nNosw* title was correct but visual was false 6419 10.89% 24882 42.21%\nNosw* visual was correct but title was false 22834 38.74% 3459 5.87%\nNosw* title was correct but meta was false 6419 10.89% 11374 19.30%\nNosw* meta was correct but title was false 21691 36.80% 5041 8.55%\nNosw* comments was correct but title was false 24113 40.91% 5724 9.71%\nNosw* comments was correct but visual was false 9158 15.54% 24149 40.97%\nNosw* comments was correct but meta was false 7406 12.56% 7600 12.89%\nNosw* title was correct but comments was false 3624 6.15% 6651 11.28%\nNosw* visual was correct but comments was false 5824 9.88% 3653 6.20%\nNosw* meta was correct but comments was false 5671 9.62% 2194 3.72%\nNosw* visual was correct but meta was false 9849 16.71% 6522 11.06%\nNosw* meta was correct but visual was false 7966 13.51% 21612 36.67%\nDual Modal\nNosw* single modalities succeeded over best dual modal title visual 619 1.05% 388 0.66%\nNosw* single modalities succeeded over best dual modal title meta 1551 2.63% 89 0.15%\nThree modalities\nNosw* single modalities succeeded over best tripple model 75 0.13% 115 0.20%\nNosw* triple model succeeded over all single models 370 0.63% 90 0.15%\nFour modalities\nNosw* single modalities succeeded over all-four-model 96 0.16% 52 0.09%\nNosw* all-four-modal succeeded over single models 379 0.64% 52 0.09%\nNosw* all-four-modal incorrect 2819 4.78% 2739 4.65%\nNosw* all-four-modal correct 56125 95.22% 56205 95.35%\nTable 4.13. Evaluation of the statistical analysis of the model results.\nAs it can be examined in table 4.1322just around 0.27% of the samples of the validation\nset and 0.47% of the samples of the test set were in total misclassi\ufb01ed overall evaluated\nmodels. A very interesting picture is revealed if the samples are count which are correctly\nclassi\ufb01ed if the title model is considered but falsely detected if only the visual model is\ntaken into account, which number lies around 24882 samples respectively 42% on the test\nset but only around 11% on the validation set. This leads to the conclusion that the title\nmodality is more meaningful than the image modality. A similar conclusion can be drawn\nif the comments modality is taken in comparison to the visual modality which is in around\n16% of the validation set respectively 42% of the test set misclassi\ufb01ed.\nThe meta modality was a crucial part of this dataset. Looking at the results if the ti-\ntle model predicted the labels correctly, in around 11% of the samples of validation set,\nrespectively around 19% on the test set the meta modality predicted the wrong label. A\nsimilar picture can be drawn if the comments modality is considered in opposition to the\ncount of misclassi\ufb01ed samples of the meta modality, which is around 13% on the validation\nand test set.\nA very interesting picture can be drawn if the combined model \"title - visual\" is consid-\nered. Only in around 1% of the samples on the validation, respectively 0.66% on the test\n22*Nosw = Number of samples where ...\n76\n4 Experiments & Results\nset, all single modalities succeeded over the dual-modal approach. This proves that in\naround 99% of the cases the dual modal approach is better than every single modal ap-\nproach. A similar evaluation was made if the \"title meta\" model is considered. There, in\n2.63% of the samples on the validation set, respectively 0.15% on the test set the single\nmodalities succeeded over the combined model. A similar picture can be drawn if the best\ntriple models23are evaluated.\nConsidering all four modalities in 99% of all cases the multimodal approach succeeded\nover all single modalities in combination. So it can be clearly stated, that fusing the knowl-\nedge of the single modalities into a multimodal approach is the best way for tackling the\nproblem of information disorder detection.\n23The model consists out of the title, comments, and visual modality.\n77\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.6 Discussion\nIn this section the results are going to be presented in a more compact layout.\nType Val Acc Test Acc\nSingle Modal\nRun Title (Run 3) 88.10% 88.10%\nRun Comments (Run 3) 86.70% 86.50%\nRun Visual (Run 5) 81.04% 81.51%\nRun Meta (Run 8) 77.80% 77.34%\nDual Modal\nTitle - Visual (Run 1) 90.80% 91.00%\nTitle - Comments (Run 2) 85.90% 85.70%\nTitle - Meta (Run 3) 88.10% 88.20%\nComments - Meta (Run 4) 78.20% 78.20%\nVisual - Meta (Run 5) 81.10% 81.60%\nVisual - Comments (Run 6) 88.00% 88.10%\nTriple Modal\nTitle - Visual - Comments 94.90% 94.99%\nVisual - Comments - Meta 91.23% 91.30%\nTitle - Visual - Meta 92.80% 92.80%\nTitle - Comments - Meta 94.40% 94.46%\nFour Modal\nTitle - Visual - Comments - Meta 95.22% 95.54%\nTable 4.14. Overview about the best models evaluated.\nAs it can be seen in table 4.14 the results were very promising. All modalities such as\ntitle, comments, visual, and meta are clearly over the random baseline of 61%. The most\nmeaningful modality is the title modality which has an accuracy of 88.10% on the validation\nand test set. The second best modality is the comments modality, followed by the visual\nand meta modality. Remarkable was, that considering only the best combination of the\nmeta-information, as described in section 4.5.1, the detection accuracy was around 78%.\nFrom the dual-modal approaches, the modalities title and visual was clearly the best\ncombination with an accuracy of around 91% on the validation and test set. The same\npicture could be taken if the three modalities approach were considered. The best combi-\nnation was the title, visual, and comments, followed by the title, comments, meta approach\nwith an accuracy of nearly 95% on the validation and test set respectively around 94.5%.\nFusing all four modalities showed that considering the meta modality also improves the\naccuracy to the best result of all experiments, namely 95.22% on the validation and 95.54%\non the test set.\n78\n4 Experiments & Results\n4.6.1 Comparison to the state-of-the-art\nIt is hardly possible to compare the results of this four modality approach with other mono-\nmodal approaches on other datasets. Even if the comparison would be possible on a single\nmodality level, it has also to be considered that the purpose of the method is the same.\nAs there are no other papers using this dataset yet, only a comparison with the authors\u2019\n(Nakamura et al. 2020) paper can be made.\nMethod Validation (Nakamura et al. 2020) Test (Nakamura et al. 2020) Validation thesis Test thesis Method\nBERT 86.54% 86.44% 88.10% 88.10% BERT\nResNet50 80.43% 80.70% 81.04% 81.51% Inceptionv3\nBert(Title) + ResNet50 89.29% 89.09% 90.80% 91.00% BERT (Title) + Inceptionv3\nAdd 85.51% 85.51% - - -\nMaximum 89.29% 89.09% - - -\nConcatenate 85.64% 85.68% - - -\n- - - 94.90% 94.99% BERT (Title, Comments) + Inceptionv3\n- - - 95.01% 95.20% Four modalities (Concatenate)\n- - - 95.22% 95.54% Four modalities (Add)\n- - - 94.92% 95.10% Four modalities (Maximum)\nTable 4.15. Comparison with results of (Nakamura et al. 2020).\nAs it can be seen in table 4.15 the results of the thesis are comparable to the results of\nNakamura et al. (2020). The monomodal approaches of the title and image modality are\ncomparable. Due to the fact that the parameter of sequence length of (Nakamura et al.\n2020) is not known, this could be the reason that the results of the proposed method of this\nwork are better. The visual modality of both papers are nearly identical. Starting with the\nthree modalities approach the strength of fusion multiple modalities emerges with a leap\nin accuracy of almost 5%. Utilizing different fusion strategies did not result in the same\nincrease of accuracy as in Nakamura et al. (2020) paper.\nSo, from the state-of-the-art analysis, it could be clearly stated that multimodal ap-\nproaches are better than mono-modal approaches. The same conclusion can be con\ufb01rmed\nby the experiments in this thesis.\n79\n5 Conclusion & Future Work\n5.1 Conclusion\nThis thesis presented a practical approach to information disorder detection. Firstly by a\nstate-of-the-art literature research, the theoretical background was explored for developing\na new method based on it. It was clearly stated that a multimodal approach outperforms\nmono-modal approaches. The main problem was that no big dataset was available until\nthe Fakeddit dataset was \ufb01rstly published in 2019. Containing around 640k multimodal\nsamples, this set was a good starting point to perform fake information detection on a large\nscale level. Secondly, using state-of-the-art text processing methods, such as BERT for\nthe text modalities and well-known image classi\ufb01cation networks, such as ResNet50v2,\nResNet101v2, and Inceptionv3, allowed to build up a powerful stack of models for the\nmono-modal and multimodal experiments. After calculating the random baseline, which\nwas around 61%, every single modality was evaluated to \ufb01nd the best performing models.\nAfterwards the best models (also considering time / accuracy rations) were taken for fusing\ndifferent modalities, up to the combination of all four modalities, namely title, comments,\nvisual, and meta data. The dataset allowed to evaluate the models up to a 6-label problem.\nDue to the complexity of the models and topic, only a 2-label setting was evaluated in the\nscope of this work.\nThe whole pipeline was implemented by using Functional API from the Deep Learning\nplatform Keras. A pre-analysis made on the dataset in advance showed that, especially for\nthe BERT model, picking the correct sequence length can save a lot of time, by not loosing\ntoo much accuracy. Each model was trained and evaluated in a well documented exper-\nimental setup. It could be clearly shown which modality and combinations of modalities\nperform better or worse.\nTo summon up, the results were very promising and showed the advantages of each\nmodality, but also the powerfulness of fusing different modalities, which resulted in an ac-\ncuracy of up to 95%. To answer the \ufb01rst research question, which modality is more mean-\ningful, is the answer multi-layered. If only single modalities are considered, the textual\nmodalities are most meaningful. If multimodal models are taken into account, then fusing\nall of the modalities showed the best results. The combined models showed clearly that\nchoosing the right combinations, had a great impact on the results of information disorder\n80\n5 Conclusion & Future Work\ndetection. The best dual modality approach was the title, visual approach, followed by the\nmodalities title, meta-data, followed by comments and visual. The best triple combination\nof modalities included modalities title, visual, and comments, followed by title, comments,\nand meta-data. Combining all four modalities performed best, this answers the second\nresearch question, to what extent can combined multimodal analysis improve the detection\nof information disorder. Using state-of-the-art methods, such as a pre-trained BERT -Model\nand pre-trained InceptionV3 in combination with a suitable meta-data model resulted in\nthe best runs and this answers the third research question, which network architectures\nfrom research are best suited for the multimodal analysis of information disorder. It must\nbe noted, that, as described in chapter 4, the meta-data model must be fused at a point,\nwhere the value of the features are most meaningful. It could be shown that nearly all\navailable information are extremely useful for being processed by a deep learning neural\nnetwork.\n81\n5 Conclusion & Future Work\n5.2 Limitations and Future Work\nUsing only multimodal samples from the dataset rather than all reduced the complexity of\nthe problem but also reduced the count of the available samples by a third. Also considering\nonly two labels instead of six1made the development of the method easier. So one point for\nthe future work would be on the one hand collecting more samples to tackle the problem\nof imbalanced classes or develop/\ufb01nd a solution for handling problems with this kind of\nimbalanced dataset.\nA second limitation is that the pre-processing and this method in general is for now\nonly suitable for the use on Reddit itself. Data from other social media platforms such as\nFacebook or Twitter can not be processed due to the different data formats and available\ndata. Developing a method that can handle data from different platforms or creating a\nrobust method if one of the features is missing is de\ufb01nitely a problem that should be solved\nby developing appropriate methods.\nA third limitation is the general problem of information disorder detection. It is ques-\ntionable that a sample always belongs to only one class. The proposed method can only\nhandle one label per sample and not multiple labels per sample. Additionally overcome\nthe concept of just fake or non-fake to more \ufb01ne-grained analysis of different sub-types\nof fake information. Furthermore a tool could be developed to highlight posts, or whole\nnews articles, or parts of the text, or image that could be identi\ufb01ed as fake or manipulated\ncontent.\nAnother possibility for future work is using explainability methods to explain which sam-\nples are wrongly or truly classi\ufb01ed and why. So the next generation networks can be better\ndesigned for future tasks.\nFinally, a more in-depth analysis could be performed by evaluating different models for\nthe same modality and if different methods on the same modality can improve the detection\nresult. This can be applied to all modalities.\nTo sum it up, information disorder detection is and will remain a challenge for our society.\nThe effects of information disorder, i.e. the problems of social, political and technical nature\nwill accompany mankind on many levels in its daily life and technical systems. Methods, as\nfor example presented in this work, can help to tackle the problem, but will never replace\ncommon sense and critical questioning of information.\n1The development of a method for the six label problem is much more dif\ufb01cult because of the fact that the\nclasses are heavily imbalanced.\n82\nBibliography\nAllcott, H., & Gentzkow, M.

This paper analyzes posts sharing news articles pertaining\nto the 2022 U.S. midterm elections originating from Twitter, Reddit, and\nFacebook pages. After classifying the news articles shared, this analysis\nfound that pink slime and misinformation receive more engagement per\ngroup size (on platforms with community features) than authentic local\nand national news sites. Furthermore, it finds that the distribution of\ntypes of news sources that a Facebook Page shares changes with its\nsize. Finally, the network features of groups sharing authentic local news\nare found to have a higher betweenness centrality than those of groups\nsharing pink slime.\nKeywords: cross-platform \u00b7misinformation \u00b7elections.\n1 Introduction\nSocial media platforms play a critical role in facilitating the dissemination of in-\nformation and the propagation of campaign narratives during events of political\nsignificance, such as the U. S. midterm elections. The ability of social media to\nreach large audiences in minimal time has established it as an important source\nof news for voters. It is important, therefore, to determine the quality and cred-\nibility of news shared over social media and assess differences in user response\nand engagement by type of news media.\nPrevious research in this area correlated demographics [8], ideological bias [7]\nand ideological extremity [10] with news type, typically \u201creal\u201d or \u201cmisinforma-\ntion,\u201d finding a positive relationship between age, conservatism, and polarization\n\u22c6This work was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Award\nN00014182106, the Knight Foundation, the Center for Computational Analysis of\nSocial and Organizational Systems (CASOS), and the Center for Informed Democ-\nracy and Social-cybersecurity (IDeaS). The views and conclusions contained in this\ndocument are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the\nofficial policies, either expressed or implied, of the ONR or the U.S. government.\n2 C. Lepird et al.\nand sharing misinformation. Susceptibility to misinformation as a metric of the\naverage user without any qualifiers or restrictions is mostly overlooked, with the\nexception of [6]. That research found that, in a general multi-platform dataset,\nreal news and misinformation exhibited similar spread patterns, potentially in-\ndicating that users are unable or unwilling to distinguish between credible and\nnon-credible news.\nFurthermore, while the existing literature predominantly compares real and\nmisinformation dissemination, more research is necessary in the comparison of\nlocal news and pink slime, a type of low-credibility, often partisan news disguised\nas a local publication to garner trust. This paper analyzes the relationship be-\ntween type of news (real, misinformation, local, pink) and user engagement,\nmeasured in like count and corrected for the size (implied popularity) of its page\nof origin.\n2 Data and Methods\nData was collected from Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook pertaining to the United\nStates 2022 Midterm Elections in regions with the most contention elections.\nThe posts pulled from each of the platforms contain URLs to external sites for\nfurther analysis. The elections took place on November 8, 2022, and the data was\ncollected from October 1, 2022 to December 1, 2022. Elections selected for this\nanalysis included the most competitive districts and regions in Arizona, Georgia,\nPennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin. For the full set of races and keywords,\ncontact the authors.\nThe Twitter researcher, Reddit\u2019s Pushshift API [13], and Facebook\u2019s Crowd-\nTangle API [1] were all used to pull the data for this research.\nOnce the data was collected, the URLs that the posts linked to were cleaned,\nand their Media/Bias Fact Check ratings were included [2]. Additionally, through-\nout this paper, \u201cknown sources of real news, misinformation, or pink slime\u201d will\nbe defined as news articles originating from domains listed as \u201creal, misinforma-\ntion, or pink slime\u201d in the media thesaurus compiled by the CASOS University\nCenter at Carnegie Mellon University. The media thesaurus has been compiled\nfrom multiple publicly available lists of news media URLs and media organiza-\ntions\u2019 Twitter accounts: Media Bias/Fact Check [2] lists many news sites and\nrates how factual and credible the reporting is for many; the George Wash-\nington University Dataverse [12] has a list of over 9600 Twitter accounts for\nmedia organizations, derived from over 160 million tweets between 2016 and\n2020; the Columbia Journalism Review site has been a source for hundreds of\n\u201cpink slime\u201d news outlet domains [11] that often publish biased, algorithmically\nproduced stories; there is also a Github repository [3] of unreliable, mislead-\ning, and/or \u201cmisinformation\u201d news sources that includes lists from Snopes Field\nGuide, Melissa Zimdars\u2019 OpenSources, Wikipedia, and others. There is often\noverlap between these sources, particularly for the less factual news outlets; to\nresolve any conflicts that emerge between the sources, the thesaurus errs on the\nside of not labeling a news source in question as misinformation. Finally, the\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 3\nlabels of \u201clocal news\u201d were through list of authentic local news sites owned by\ncompanies [4] as well as this Github repository [9].\n3 Analysis and Results\nThe full dataset included 1,306,829, 25,221, and 15,867 posts from Twitter, Face-\nbook Pages, and Reddit, respectively. Of those, 756,084 (Twitter) , 12,885 (Face-\nbook Pages) , and 7,275 (Reddit posts) linked to URLs that had a designated\nCASOS rating. Per Table 1, Reddit leads with the highest percentage of shared\nnews on the topic being to real news sites and the lowest percentage going to\nmisinformation sites - possibly due to the work of subreddit moderators. While\nFacebook doesn\u2019t have as high of a proportion of news going to misinformation\nsites as Twitter, the Facebook Pages lead in links going to local news sites as\nwell as pink slime sites. Contrary to [5] there were instances of pink slime sites\nshared on Reddit. While their research did not find pink slime sites on Reddit\n(perhaps to only searching political subreddits), this dataset found 11 references\nto these sites, mostly on smaller subreddits geared towards a local community.\nTable 1: Breakdown of news types shared on the three platforms.\nTwitter Facebook Reddit\nReal News Sites 80.39% 71.67% 89.84%\nMisinformation Sites 5.42% 4.50% 0.64%\nLocal News Sites 13.63% 22.5% 9.39%\nPink Slime Sites 0.56% 1.32% 0.13%\n3.1 Relative Engagement\nFacebook posts were made to Facebook Pages, and through CrowdTangle we\nwere able to find the number of Facebook users who like the page. Since Twitter\ndoesn\u2019t have an appropriate grouping feature, it was excluded from this portion\nof the analysis. Additionally, the Reddit data only had group size for individual\nposts to subreddits and not for comments made on the platform; since this\nremoved a large portion of the pink slime posts, this platform was also excluded\nfrom the analysis. For Facebook Pages, the median group has 64,403 subscribers\nand the smallest 25% of groups have fewer than 5,895 subscribers. To understand\nhow well posts made to these groups performed, a relative engagement metric\nwas established. For Facebook Pages this is the number of likes a post received\ndivided by the number of followers the page has, referred to in a platform-neutral\nway as Engagement Per Group Size.\nAfter calculating the Engagement Per Group Size, the posts were broken\ninto the four news types and compared. Per Figure 1, posts sharing pink slime\nreceived the highest engagement per group size followed by posts sharing misin-\nformation. Real news received the least relative engagement.\n4 C. Lepird et al.\nFig. 1: Logarithmic Distribution of the Boxplot Distribution of Engage-\nment/Group Size by News Type for Facebook and Reddit\n3.2 Network Properties\nTo get an understanding of the network properties of how these news sites spread,\na network created exclusively of accounts sharing pink slime and another created\nexclusively of accounts sharing local news sites were created. In Fig 2, Facebook\nPages and subreddits linking to sites shared by more than one group are shown.\nInterestingly, none of the groups from these platforms sharing pink slime link\nto other domains sharing pink slime in this dataset. For local news, 7.1% of the\ngroups that shared a local news site shared more than one.\nWhen these network are analyzed from Twitter users to news domains in\nFig 3, there are some Twitter users sharing more than one pink slime domain\n(2.3%), but that is far lower than the Twitter users sharing more than one local\nnews domain (11.2%). Upon further inspection, the individuals sharing multiple\npink slime domains on Twitter are sharing domains that are targeting different\nregions as opposed to pink slime sites operating in the same region.\n4 Discussion and Conclusion\nThe information gleaned from the relative engagement analysis highlights the\nimportance of pink slime sites on Facebook Pages. While it makes up a small\nminority of posts during the Midterm election, posts made to Facebook con-\ntaining these links received more likes (normalized by page size) than any other\nnews type. These sites are designed to target hyper local regions with content\nrelated to their community; increased relative engagement indicates that the\npeople seeing the content resonate with and appreciate it. While the posts fly\nunder the radar of researchers looking at the top news story by absolute engage-\nment metrics, it shows that promoting messaging at hyper local small groups are\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 5\n(a) Facebook and Reddit Groups\n(blue) x Local News Domain\n(green)\n(b) Facebook and Reddit Groups\n(blue) x Pink Slime Domain (pink)\nFig. 2: Facebook and Reddit Networks of Local and Pink Slime Sites Shared\nMore than Once\n(a) Twitter Users (blue) x Local\nNews Domain (green)\n(b) Twitter Users (blue) x Pink\nSlime Domain (pink)\nFig. 3: Twitter Networks of Local and Pink Slime Sites\n6 C. Lepird et al.\nhaving an outsized impact. Real news sources receiving the lowest engagement\nper group size is another concerning finding.\nWith regards to the network findings, it indicates that individuals on Twitter\nand groups on Facebook and Reddit are consuming and sharing pink slime sites\nin a silo. Individuals on Twitter and groups on Facebook and Reddit are much\nmore likely to share multiple sources of authentic local news sites than those\nsharing pink slime sites are to share more than one.\nFuture work will include an analysis of the individual Twitter accounts shar-\ning pink slime and local news and will assess the distribution of bot account\nsharing the sites.\nReferences\n1.
