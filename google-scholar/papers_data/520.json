How-\never, this transformation has brought with it unprecedented challenges, particularly in the realm of misinformation\npropagation. Telegram, with its encrypted channels and vast user base, has become a focal point for researchers and\npolicymakers alike, as it represents a complex ecosystem where information\u2014both accurate and misleading\u2014can spread\nrapidly and with far-reaching consequences [3, 4].\nThe distributed1[5] nature of information proliferation on Telegram, characterized by interconnected channels and\ngroups, creates an environment ripe for the formation of echo chambers and information silos[6, 7].\nWithin this intricate network structure, certain nodes play a pivotal role in bridging disparate communities, acting\nas conduits for information flow across ideological and thematic boundaries. These \"bridge nodes\" are gateways for\nboth, the dissemination of reliable information and the amplification of misinformation [8].\nPast research has advanced our understanding of misinformation dynamics in social media platforms [ 9\u201311]. This\nincludes content-based analyses [ 12] and network metrics to identify influential nodes and information flow patterns.\n\u2217Both authors contributed equally to this research.\n1As a platform, Telegram operates on a centralized computing systems architecture but its channel-based structure decentralizes the information feed for\nusers , and for the purpose of this research, this lack of a central information proliferation is what the term distributed will refer to.\nAuthors\u2019 Contact Information: Devang Shah, devangvshah16@gmail.com; Hriday Ranka, hridayr1234@gmail.com, SimPPL, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India;\nLynnette Hui Xian NG, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; Swapneel Mehta, SimPPL, Boston University and Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\n1arXiv:2411.05922v1  [cs.CY]  8 Nov 2024\n2 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\nBuilding on this foundation, our research examines the structure of private messaging ecosystems like Telegram, where\nthe dynamics of information propagation may differ significantly from centralized \u2018feed-based\u2019 platforms, posing unique\nrisks [ 1]. Our research takes a multidimensional approach in identifying and analyzing the role of critical nodes in\nTelegram\u2019s network structure. We propose a \"bridge score\" metric that aggregates measures across varied network\ncharacteristics to provide a comprehensive understanding of each node\u2019s potential to act as an \u2018information hub\u2019. This\napproach builds upon traditional graph-centrality measures, offering new insights into the structural underpinnings of\ninformation flow in distributed messaging platforms.\n2 Key Contributions\nIn this research, we seek to answer two key questions:\n(1)Are there distinct communities within which debunked disinformation propagates on distributed messaging\necosystems like Telegram?\n(2)How consistent is a multi-dimensional bridging metric in measuring the contribution of cross-community hubs\nin amplifying misinformation and reshaping network topologies?\nWe validate the metric using data from 1,748 public Telegram channels and groups containing over 900,000 messages,\nusing it to generate a minimum viable set of targets for intervening on the flow of disinformation across this large\nnetwork. Our contributions are twofold:\n2.1 Examining the nature of Fact-checked misinformation propagation across Communities\nWe collect links to debunked disinformation from a third-party website, EUvsDisinfo.eu, a flagship project of the\nEuropean Union that is focused on fact-checking false claims transparently. We identify messages containing these\nlinks shared in Telegram channels and visualize its spread to construct a misinformation network of channels that\ninteract to amplify the false claims. We split the network into separate communities based on their primary narratives.\nWe observe that misinformation crossing community boundaries (defined by modularity classes) reached an average of\n3.1 times more views than misinformation contained within a single community. Interestingly, the communities that\nare primarily utilized to forward messages and amplify misinformation have a 57.5% higher engagement rate than the\ncommunity where the false narrative originates. Much of the literature on channels where pro-Russian disinformation\nis promoted focus on these channels, where even removals may not have a long-term effect since the originating nodes\nare unaffected. These findings underscore the role of modularity in network structure in shaping the spread and impact\nof misinformation on Telegram.\n2.2 Developing a Multi-Dimensional Bridging Metric to identify targets for intervention\nOur multi-dimensional bridging metric, which combines in-degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and clustering\ncoefficient, revealed crucial insights into the role of cross-community hubs. Our selected bridge metric identified 12\n(originally 142, but 2 of these were private communities not accessible to the general public) high-impact bridge nodes\nacross the Telegram network, which were responsible for major cross-community misinformation flows. Removal of the\ntop 12 bridge nodes (by our metric) significantly impacted network topology and resulted in a 33.33% rise in the number\nof communities. We also observed that the Russian disinformation machinery reuses the same Telegram channels to\npromote different campaigns like Russia-Ukraine conflict, Moscow (Crocus Hall) attack, Anti-West propaganda, etc.\n2Further research will focus on the 12 publicly accessible channels, as data from private groups was unavailable for analysis.\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 3\nAnalysis of temporal dynamics revealed that the influence of bridge nodes on misinformation spread increased by\n24% during periods of heightened global events (e.g., feud between Russian president and Wagner group, pandemic\npeaks, Crocus Hall attack), suggesting their crucial role in misinformation dissemination during critical times. These\ninsights contribute to the broader understanding of information propagation in distributed systems, offering valuable\nknowledge that extends beyond Telegram to other messaging platforms and social networks [ 13]. Our work provides a\nfoundation for developing more effective strategies to stop disinformation proliferation & promote information integrity\nin these complex digital environments. As society grapples with the challenges of misinformation and the erosion of\nshared truths [14], our research offers a crucial step towards understanding and potentially mitigating these issues in\ndistributed messaging platforms. By illuminating the structural underpinnings of information flow in these ecosystems,\nwe pave the way for more targeted and effective interventions in the ongoing battle against digital misinformation.\n3 Related Work\nTelegram presented itself as a lightly moderated platform, with little to no government oversight; an image that has\nrecently been questioned given its self-admitted compliance with the governments of India and Brazil3Following the\nban of many Russian news outlets throughout Europe, several have turned to Telegram to share their content, with\nUkraina, Russia Today and Sputnik News even dedicating pages to instruct users on how to download the app (Bovet\nand Grindrod 2022 [ 15]). Telegram serves as a medium for information propagation, with its focus on several critical\nthemes: the interaction between Telegram and media narratives, the coordinated manipulation by bot/fake accounts,\ncontextual factors influencing user behavior, and the challenges against effective content moderation strategies.\nInformation Dissemination Dynamics. Hanley and Durumeric (2023) [ 16] analyzed the interrelation between\nRussian media outlets and 732 Telegram channels over a period of 1 year. They identified Telegram as a key source of\ncontent for Russian media outlets, some of which are using discussions from Telegram as a citation for the origin of the\ninformation, for up to 26.7% of their articles. Hoseini et al. (2022) [ 17] further conducted an in-depth analysis of over\n140 million messages coming from over 9,000 public Telegram channels. They established that a small number of users,\nwhom they termed \"superspreaders,\" are responsible for a particularly disproportionate amount of messages. Their\nwork exhibits the affordances that underpin the delivery of content on Telegram; although the platform offers immense\naccessibility and very extensive reach, delivery of content seems relatively localized. This phenomenon mirrors similar\nresearch in which just twelve prominent individuals, known as the \"Disinformation Dozen\"4, were found to account\nfor nearly two-thirds of anti-vaccine content circulating on major social media platforms, underscoring how a small\ngroup can disproportionately influence information dissemination across networks.\nCoordinated Information Manipulation. Studies have also revealed the strategic manipulation of information by\ninauthentic accounts. Burghardt et al. (2022) [ 18] investigated Russian-affiliated accounts\u2019 coordinated efforts during\nthe 2017 French election, showing how these accounts amplified certain narratives through repetitive retweets and\nemotionally charged content. This coordination is also reflected in the work of Dash and Mitra (2024) [ 19], who\nstudied Indian Twitter\u2019s influence campaigns, highlighting the need to draw a distinction between\"disseminators\"\nand \"amplifiers\" within hashtag campaigns. Both studies reveal the complex tactics used to shape and manipulate\nonline conversations, relevant for understanding how similar mechanisms might work in Telegram\u2019s lightly moderated\necosystem.\n3https://t.me/durov/346\n4https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/\n4 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\nContextual Factors in Information Practices. Beyond manipulation, contextual influences strongly shape how\nusers interact with misinformation on Telegram. Nikkhah et al. (2021) [ 20] emphasized how Iranian immigrants largely\nused Telegram as an essential source for immigration-related information, indicating how the functionalities of the\nplatform inform particular information-seeking behaviors. Peeters and Willaert (2023) [ 21] have further explored the\nrole of Telegram in the diffusion of conspiracy theories, and elaborated on how it serves as a platform through which\ninterlinked communities promote conspiracy-theories via message-forwarding. Lim and Perrault (2023) [ 22] found\nthat in Singapore, proliferation of misinformation on telegram is best explained by sharing behavior rather than the\nproduction of new content; this further contributes toward the argument that user activities, particularly sharing\nbehavior, are significant in shaping the way information spreads.\nContent Moderation and Platform Governance. Ma (2023)[ 23] not only advances the case for involving content\ncreators in the design of moderation systems but also details socio-economic dimensions of current policies and\nbureaucratic barriers to accessing the system. Participatory design initiatives, therefore, are needed to balance the\ninterests of different stakeholders involved in moderation efforts. Adjusting moderation strategies to the idiosyncrasies\nof Telegram could support a healthier information ecosystem on the platform and facilitate better governance.\nSeveral key studies from the community inform our understanding of how disinformation circulates in distributed\nand semi-regulated ecosystems like Telegram. Hanley et al. [ 24] explored the interrelationships among conspiracy\ntheories across five domains (including QAnon, COVID, UFOs, among others) that are interconnected by both legitimate\nnews sources and misinformation platforms. This research emphasizes the role of hyperlinked networks in propagating\nfalse narratives, drawing attention to the intricate web of associations among misinformation centers. This is relevant\nto our focus on Telegram, where disinformation can spread across seemingly isolated channels, supported by similar\ninterconnected dynamics. Similarly, Nied et al. [ 25] explored networks of alternative crisis narratives. Their identification\nof automated accounts and social botnets\u2019 role in the spread of disinformation demonstrates how these automated\nsystems can rapidly amplify false narratives across multiple communities, making traditional fact-checking efforts\nineffective due to the speed and scale of propagation. Understanding community structure and automated orchestration\nis crucial because it allows platform moderators to identify and disrupt these amplification networks before they\ncan achieve widespread reach, and helps researchers develop more effective early warning systems for emerging\ndisinformation campaigns. Aghajari\u2019s [ 26] work moves beyond individual content analysis to focus on community-level\nimpacts. This ecological view aligns with our research goal of analyzing not only how misinformation propagates\nbut also how certain nodes and hubs within Telegram\u2019s network structure serve as amplifiers, shaping community\ninteractions and influence. In this way, our work offers a comprehensive methodology supported by empirical evidence\nat a large scale, for understanding how distributed messaging platforms reshape disinformation ecosystems, with\nimplications for content moderation and platform governance.\n4 Dataset\nIn this section, we describe our data collection and processing pipelines. Figure 1 illustrates our system.\nWe collected messages from public Telegram channels using a multi-stage process, combining authoritative disin-\nformation databases with targeted channel data mining. Our seed article data source was the EUvsDisinfo database5,\nmaintained by the European External Action Service\u2019s East StratCom Task Force. We extracted over 10,000 fact-checked\narticles from this database. Analysis of the EUvsDisinfo dataset revealed 78 articles specifically citing Telegram as the\n5https://euvsdisinfo.eu/\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 5\nFig. 1.

Overview of our Telegram Dataset\nsource platform, leading to the identification of 46 unique Telegram channels. To focus on the most influential actors,\nwe used TGSTAT6, a Telegram analytics platform, to rank these channels by their citation index. This process yielded a\nsubset of 13 key channels (referred to as \"seed channels\") with the highest potential for disseminating and amplifying\ndisinformation narratives.\nUsing the Python Telethon API7, we scraped posts from these 13 seed channels. Our data collection resulted in two\nprimary datasets: one containing metadata about 1,748 Telegram channels that interacted with the 13 seed channels, and\nanother comprising 922,770 messages from those seed channels. The resulting dataset is predominantly in Russian and\nEnglish languages. To focus on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we applied temporal filtering to isolate 2421 forwards\nthat occurred after January 2022.\nIn our study, we exclusively used data from publicly available channels and did not seek out private channels or\nconversations. Furthermore, we focused solely on a user\u2019s interactions visible in public channels and did not seek to\n6https://tgstat.com/\n7https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/\n6 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\nidentify individuals beyond their engagement during the given period, in keeping with general privacy guidelines for\ncollecting social media.\n5 Methodology\n5.1 Network Graph Creation\nIdentification of hub nodes begins with the construction of a comprehensive network graph that visually represents the\nflow of information across Telegram channels. This graph serves as the foundation for subsequent analyses, providing\ncrucial insights into the structure and dynamics of disinformation dissemination.\nThe network graph construction initiates with the identification of forwarded messages within the collected dataset.\nEach unique Telegram channel is represented as a node in the graph. A directed edge is created between two nodes\nwhen a message is forwarded from one channel to another, representing the flow of information. Drawing inspiration\nfrom the telegram-tracker project by Esteban Ponce de Leon8, a custom Python script to process the msgs_dataset.csv\n& collected_chats.csv files was developed. This script performs the following key operations:\n\u2022Iteration through outgoing messages : The script iterates through each entry in the collected_chats \u02d9csv file,\nexamining the \u2018source\u2018 & \u2018username\u2018 fields to identify forwarded messages outgoing from seed channels.\n\u2022Iteration through incoming messages : The script iterates through each entry in the msgs_dataset \u02d9csv file,\nexamining \u2018forward_msg_from_peer_name\u2018 & \u2018channel_name\u2018 fields to identify forwarded messages incoming\ninto seed channels.\n\u2022Node creation : For each unique channel encountered (both source and destination of forwards), a node is\ncreated in the graph if it doesn\u2019t already exist.\n\u2022Edge creation : When a forwarded message is identified, an edge is created from the source to destination\nchannel.\nThe resulting graph structure is stored using the NetworkX library, which provides a flexible and powerful framework\nfor network analysis. The NetworkX graph data is saved as a GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) file.\n5.2 Community detection\nAfter constructing the network graph, we identify cohesive communities within the graph and analyze the thematic\ncontent of these communities. The Louvain algorithm [ 27], a widely-used method for detecting communities in large\nnetworks, was employed to identify modular classes within the Telegram channel network. This algorithm is particularly\neffective for uncovering hierarchical community structures in complex networks.\n(1)Data Preparation: Data Preparation: The GEXF file generated from the network graph creation step was\nloaded into Gephi, an open-source network analysis and visualization software.\n(2)Algorithm Application: Algorithm Application: Within Gephi, the Louvain community detection algorithm\nwas executed on the loaded graph. The resolution parameter, which controls the granularity of the detected\ncommunities, was set to 2.2 after careful consideration and experimentation. This value was chosen to strike a\nbalance between detecting meaningful communities and avoiding over-fragmentation of the network.\n(3)Execution and Output: Execution and Output: The algorithm iteratively optimized the modularity of the\nnetwork partition, grouping nodes into communities that maximize internal connections while minimizing\nexternal connections.\n8https://github.com/estebanpdl/telegram-tracker\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 7\nThe application of the Louvain algorithm resulted in the identification of 6 distinct modular classes within the\nnetwork. These classes were visually distinguished in the Gephi visualization using a color scheme: [Green, Purple, Dark\nGreen, Orange, Red, Blue]. Each color represents a distinct community of Telegram channels that exhibit higher internal\nconnectivity compared to their connections with channels in other communities. Figure 2 displays the distribution of\ncommunity sizes, revealing a notable disparity. The largest community encompasses 30.72% of all nodes, while the\nsmallest consists of 4.06% of the network. Gephi also offers a bunch of different layouts, determining the nature of\norganizing the graph visually. We utilised the \u2018ForceAtlas\u2019 layout, since this algorithm pulls strongly connected nodes\ntogether and pushes weakly connected nodes apart. Its complexity is O(N 2). This step transforms the raw message data\ninto a structured network representation.\nFig. 2. Visualization of Telegram Misinformation network on Gephi\n5.3 Bridge Metric Formulation\nBuilding upon the analysis of the above Telegram channels and their message sharing network structure, this study\nidentified six distinct communities propagating diverse forms of misinformation. While these communities exhibited\nstrong internal cohesion, the overall network analysis revealed a more complex picture of information flow and\ninfluence. Despite the apparent isolation of these communities, certain nodes emerged as critical connectors, facilitating\nthe spread of information across community boundaries. The observation of these inter-community connections\nprompted a deeper investigation into the role of bridging nodes or hubs within the network. These nodes appeared\nto play a disproportionately significant role in the dissemination of misinformation across the broader network.\nTheir position at the intersection of multiple communities suggested a unique capacity to amplify and cross-pollinate\nnarratives, potentially accelerating the spread of misinformation beyond isolated echo chambers. This work introduces\n8 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\na novel multi-dimensional bridging metric designed to identify and quantify the impact of cross-community hubs in\ndistributed messaging ecosystems, particularly in the context of misinformation amplification. The proposed metric,\ntermed the Bridge Score, integrates three key network centrality measures: in-degree centrality, eigenvector centrality,\nand clustering coefficient. Combining these three allows us to identify nodes with extensive connections, strategic\npositioning, and crucial bridging roles respectively. This composite approach aims to capture the multifaceted nature\nof influential nodes within complex network structures. The Bridge Score is formulated as a weighted sum of these\nnormalized centrality measures, allowing for flexible parameterization to adapt to various network contexts and research\nobjectives. The Bridge Score is crucial for identifying nodes that not only have high connectivity but also serve as\nkey connectors between different communities in a network. By integrating local and global network properties, this\nmetric enhances our understanding of a node\u2019s role in spreading information and maintaining network cohesion, which\nis especially useful in analyzing misinformation. This approach provides a more comprehensive assessment of node\nimportance than single-metric analyses and reveals structural vulnerabilities and resilience by observing changes in\nnetwork topology when high-scoring nodes are removed. Beyond misinformation studies, the Bridge Score\u2019s flexibility\nmakes it valuable for various network analysis applications, contributing a composite metric relating to graph theory.\nWe begin our discussion with each individual metric contributing to the composite, examining how indegree centrality,\neigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient each play a unique role in shaping the Bridge Score.\n5.3.1 In-degree Centrality - Quantifying Direction: In-degree centrality is a vital component of the Bridge Score, offering\na direct measure of a node\u2019s prominence within the network. In the context of directed networks, such as those formed\nby Telegram channels and their message sharing, in-degree centrality quantifies the number of incoming edges to a\ngiven node. Following the foundational work of Freeman [ 28] and as elaborated in modern network theory by Newman\n[29], we define the in-degree centrality of a node (channel) as the number of incoming edges (forwarded messages) into\nit. This metric is crucial for identifying potential bridge nodes for several reasons:\n\u2022Information Reception: Nodes with high in-degree centrality are positioned to receive information from multiple\nsources, making them potential aggregators of diverse narratives and misinformation strains.\n\u2022Influence: In the context of social networks, a high in-degree often correlates with greater visibility and perceived\nauthority, factors that can amplify the spread of information or misinformation.\n\u2022Community Interface: Nodes with high in-degree centrality that accept connections from multiple communities\nare uniquely positioned to serve as conduits for cross-community information flow.\nThe inclusion of in-degree centrality in the Bridge Score calculation addresses a critical aspect of information\ndissemination in distributed messaging ecosystems. While a high in-degree alone does not necessarily indicate a\nbridging role, it provides a crucial foundation for identifying nodes that have the potential to do so. A high in-degree\nmay indicate not just popularity, but also vulnerability to diverse information inputs, including misinformation from\nmultiple sources (as observed in the case of coordinated campaigns, or in denial of service attacks).\n5.3.2 Eigenvector Centrality - Capturing Influence: Eigenvector centrality extends the concept of node importance\nby considering not only the quantity of connections but also the quality of those connections within the network\nstructure. This metric captures the idea that connections to people who are themselves influential will lend a person\nmore influence than connections to less influential people.\nNewman [ 29] recognizes that connections to highly influential nodes contribute more to a node\u2019s importance than\nconnections to peripheral nodes. This property is particularly relevant in the context of information dissemination and\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 9\nmisinformation amplification in distributed messaging ecosystems. Incorporating eigenvector centrality into our bridge\nscore formulation models influence propagation by highlighting nodes that are influential, and therefore well-positioned\nto spread misinformation across various communities. This metric also emphasizes strategic positioning, identifying\nnodes that, while not having the highest number of connections, are relevant given to their connections with other\ninfluential nodes, revealing potential \u201chidden influencers\u201c in misinformation networks. Assuming reliable information\nreceives more engagement, the robustness of eigenvector centrality to manipulation is a key advantage; it is less\nsusceptible to the artificial inflation of influence through numerous low-quality connections, making it a more reliable\nmeasure of genuine influence. Lastly, the recursive nature of eigenvector centrality captures the potential for cascade\neffects in information diffusion, a conceptual underpinning of virality. By combining these metrics, we create a measure\nthat accounts for both the direct connectedness of a node and its strategic positioning within the broader network\nstructure.\n5.3.3 Clustering Coefficient - Measuring Community Connectivity: The local clustering coefficient is a metric that\ncaptures the extent to which a node\u2019s neighbors are connected to each other, providing insights into the formation of\nlocal network structures and communities. In network theory, the clustering coefficient is closely associated with the\nconcept of network modularity, which quantifies the tendency of a network to organize into distinct communities or\nclusters. Nodes with a high clustering coefficient are typically embedded within dense clusters or communities, while\nnodes with a low clustering coefficient are more likely to act as bridges connecting different communities.\nNodes with low clustering coefficients serve as critical bridges between densely connected communities and support\ninformation flow between distinct groups. Such nodes often occupy structural gaps in the network, acting as key\nintermediaries that control information flow. These Telegram channels also function as information brokers, selectively\ntransmitting or withholding information, which can contribute to the formation of echo chambers and divergent\nnarratives. In fact, removing these key nodes, identified by their low clustering coefficients, can lead to significant\nnetwork fragmentation, impairing the efficient flow of information and restricting the spread of misinformation. The\nincorporation of the clustering coefficient into our bridge score metric allows us to capture the community dynamics\nand local network structures.\n5.4 Weight Optimization for Composite Scoring:\nBy combining these three metrics \u2013 in-degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient \u2013 our bridge\nscore formulation offers assessment of a node\u2019s potential to serve as a cross-community hub, facilitating the amplification\nof diverse narratives and reshaping network topologies. To ensure comparability and balanced integration of these\nmetrics, we employ a normalization process followed by a weighted sum approach. Each metric is first normalized using\nmin-max normalization to scale values between 0 and 1. The final bridge score (BS) for each node is then calculated as a\nweighted sum of these normalized metrics:\nBridge_Score =(\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\u00b7indegree_centrality )+(\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc52\u00b7eigenvector_centrality )+(\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc50\u00b7clustering_coefficient ) (1)\nwhere w i, we, wcare respective weights for each metric.\nThis formulation allows for flexible adjustment of the relative importance of each metric through the weight\nparameters, enabling fine-tuning of the bridge score calculation to best capture the dynamics of specific messaging\necosystems under study. To maximize the effectiveness of our bridge score metric in identifying influential cross-\ncommunity hubs, we implemented an iterative weight optimization process. This process aims to determine the optimal\n10 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\ncombination of weights for in-degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient that best captures the\nmost influential bridging nodes. The empirical process involved systematically varying the weights (w_i, w_e, w_c)\nfrom 1 to 10 in integer increments each, resulting in 1000 unique weight combinations. This exploration allows us to\ncapture subtle variations in the relative importance of each metric. Beyond 10, we find it is computationally expensive\nto calculate this score, while below 1 it is too sensitive to small changes so we believe a reasonable set of weights can be\ndiscovered to fall within this range. For each weight combination (w_i, w_e, w_c), we performed the following steps:\n\u2022Bridge Score Calculation: We calculated the bridge score for each node in the network using the formula in\nequation 1.\n\u2022Identification of Top Bridge Nodes: For each weight combination, we identified the top 10 nodes with the highest\nbridge scores.\n\u2022Network Fragmentation Analysis: To assess the impact of these top bridge nodes on the overall network structure,\nwe performed a network fragmentation analysis. This involved (a) Creating a copy of the original network to\npreserve the baseline structure, (b) Removing the top 12 bridge nodes from the copied network, (c) Calculating\nnetwork-level metrics for both the original and modified networks. We focused primarily on network density\nas our key metric for this analysis, as it provides a concise measure of overall network connectivity. Network\ndensity is calculated as D = 2 * |E| / (|V| * (|V| - 1)) where, |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of\nvertices in the network.\n\u2022Impact Quantification: We quantified the impact of removing the top bridge nodes by calculating the difference\nin network density:\n\u0394density =\ud835\udc37original\u2212\ud835\udc37modified (2)\nA larger \u0394density indicates a more significant disruption to the network structure, suggesting that the removed\nnodes played a crucial role in maintaining network connectivity and information flow.\n\u2022Comparative Analysis: We compared the \u0394density values across all weight combinations to identify those that\nresulted in the most substantial network disruption when top bridge nodes were removed. This method helps\nuncover non-linear relationships between metric weights and their effects on network structure. As highlighted\nby [30], the exploration of different parameter settings can significantly affect the resulting network topology.\nWe emphasize network density as a key metric, which reflects overall connectivity and information flow within\nthe network. A notable reduction in density following node removal suggests those nodes were crucial for\nmaintaining network cohesion, in line with the structural holes theory [ 31]. Our focus on the top bridge nodes is\ninformed by network resilience principles, recognizing that a few highly connected nodes can disproportionately\ninfluence network structure and efficiency [32]. Additionally, we employ perturbation analysis to assess node\nimportance by evaluating their impact on network dynamics when altered or removed, drawing from minimum\ndriver node set concept in controllability of complex networks. The outcome of these iterations are mentioned\nin section 6 below.\n6RQ1: We can identify distinctive patterns in Fact-checked Misinformation propagation across Telegram\nNow, we delve into the spread of authority-identified misinformation across Telegram\u2019s network structure, examining\nhow different network characteristics influence propagation patterns. By exploring the interplay between community\ndetection and topic modeling, our analysis uncovers how misinformation flows between distinct groups within the\nnetwork.\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 11\n6.1 Setup:\nAfter detecting communities in the authority-identified misinformation network using the Louvain Clustering Algorithm,\na topic modeling approach was employed to extract the primary themes and narratives within each community. The\nBERTopic model, a state-of-the-art topic modeling technique based on transformers, was utilized for this purpose.\nSpecifically, the \"paraphrase-MiniLM-L12-v2\" embedding model was selected since it captures semantic nuances in\nshort texts, making it particularly suitable for analyzing Telegram messages. The process involved aggregating all\nmessages from the seed channels present in each identified community. These aggregated message sets were then fed\ninto the BERTopic model, which leveraged its underlying BERT architecture to generate contextualized embeddings for\neach message. The model then applied c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters of semantically similar messages, effectively\nidentifying the most prominent topics within each community. To ensure optimal performance and account for language\ndiversity, all messages were translated to English using Google Translate9. The output of this analysis revealed distinct\nprimary narratives for each color-coded community, as displayed in Figure 2. The figure delineates the community color,\nthe seed channels included in each community, and a concise description of the primary narrative or theme identified\nby the BERTopic model.This approach not only quantifies the thematic focus of each community but also provides\nvaluable insights into the specialized nature of disinformation dissemination across different channel clusters. The\nresults underscore the efficacy of combining network analysis with advanced natural language processing techniques\nin unraveling the complex landscape of coordinated disinformation campaigns on encrypted messaging platforms.\n6.1.1 Thematic Analysis of Misinformation Across Communities. The analysis of the BERTopic model across the 6\ncommunities in Figure 2 revealed distinct thematic focuses. The Blue community, represented by channels such as\n@dva_majors, @warfakes, and @kremlinprachka, predominantly discusses military activities and border tensions\ninvolving Ukraine, Russia, and NATO. It often disseminates pro-Russian messages, including false reports about\nattacks on civilian infrastructure like hospitals and maternity wards, alongside narratives concerning Russian military\nmobilization and nuclear concerns. The Green community, including channels like @SolovievLive and @pul_1, promotes\nRussian military and political propaganda, advocating for support of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, recruitment for the\nWagner PMC, and framing Russia and Belarus as defenders against Western aggression. This community emphasizes\nthemes of Russian military strength, demonizes Ukraine and the West, and encourages patriotic duty, often tying these\nnarratives to Orthodox Christian values. The Dark Green community, represented by channels such as @izvestia and\n@MariaVladimirovnaZakharova, reinforces narratives of Russian military superiority and success in Ukraine while\ndepicting Ukrainian forces as weak or cruel. The messages highlight Russian military achievements and frequently\naccuse Ukrainian forces of war crimes, portraying Russia as a protector of civilians in contested regions. In contrast, the\nRed community, exemplified by @infodefSPAIN, offers a pro-Russian perspective that critiques Western narratives and\ndiscusses Russia\u2019s geopolitical relations, including its military operations and ties with regions like Africa and Latin\nAmerica. The Purple community, with channels such as @ukraina_ru, @HersonVestnik, and @zvezdanews, glorifies\nRussian precision strikes against Ukrainian military assets, emphasizing successful attacks and portraying them as\nstrategically significant while undermining Ukrainian capabilities. Finally, the Orange community, represented by\n@sashakots and @margaritasimonyan, communicates narratives of Russian military successes and Ukrainian failures,\ndownplaying setbacks and spreading disinformation about alleged Ukrainian atrocities. This community aims to rally\ndomestic support for the war effort by fostering a tone of Russian patriotism and providing purported insider military\ninformation.\n9https://translate.google.com/\n12 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\n6.2 Network Scale, Connectivity and Topology:\nOur analysis of the Telegram messaging ecosystem revealed a complex and interconnected network structure, providing\ninsights into the potential pathways for misinformation propagation. The examined network comprised 1,748 nodes\n(Telegram channels) connected by 2,421 edges, representing interactions or information flows between these channels.\nThis substantial scale underscores the potential for rapid information dissemination within the ecosystem. Figure 2\npresents a high-level visualization of the network, with nodes colored by the 6 detected communities. This visualization\nhighlights the network\u2019s non-uniform structure, characterized by dense clusters interconnected by bridging connec-\ntions. This topology indicates the presence of highly connected hub nodes, which play a crucial role in information\ndissemination and potentially serve as amplifiers of misinformation.\nA few key network statistics: Average path length is a global metric that represents the average number of steps\nrequired to connect one channel to another across the network. In Telegram\u2019s ecosystem, a low average path length\nindicates that information reaches distant parts of the network quickly, even across ideologically or geographically\ndistinct communities. Network Density quantifies how many actual connections exist relative to the total possible\nconnections among channels. A higher density means that channels are more interconnected through frequent message\nforwarding, allowing information to spread rapidly across the network.\nAverage path length: 1.579\nNetwork Density: 0.0015849\nThe relatively short average path length, despite the network\u2019s large size, suggests a \"small-world\" property [ 33],\nfacilitating rapid information spread across the network. The network structure with the presence of a scale-free\ntopology, coupled with a clear community structure and geographical concentrations, suggests that misinformation\npropagation is likely to follow non-uniform patterns, potentially amplified by key hub nodes and bridge connections\nbetween communities.\n7 RQ2: Combining In-Degree, Clustering Coefficient, and Eigenvector Centrality serves as a robust\nmeasure to identify a small set of targets for intervention\nHere we will explore the multi-dimensional bridging metric, which is pivotal in understanding how cross-community\nhubs influence the spread of misinformation and alter network topologies. By examining these bridge nodes, we\nwill gain insight into their strategic positioning within the network and their role in connecting otherwise isolated\ncommunities. This analysis is crucial for identifying key points of vulnerability where misinformation is amplified,\nparticularly during geopolitical events. Furthermore, the removal of these nodes reveals significant shifts in network\nmetrics and engagement patterns, highlighting their impact on the overall flow of information. This exploration helps\ndeepen our understanding of how distributed messaging ecosystems are shaped by influential connectors.\n7.1 Weight Optimization and Network Perturbation Analysis:\nThe weight optimization process coupled with network perturbation analysis allowed us to fine-tune our metric while\nsimultaneously assessing its ability to identify nodes crucial for maintaining network cohesion and information flow. For\nthe weight optimization process, 1,000 weight combinations for bridge score components were assessed by calculating\nbridge scores for each combination, identifying the top 12 nodes, and performing network perturbation analysis. This\nanalysis involved comparing the network density of the original and perturbed networks to measure the impact of\nremoving the top 12 bridge nodes and finding the most optimal weights.\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 13\nFig. 3. Weight combinations and corresponding change in global network density\nFig. 4. Frequency of occurrence of channel as a top bridging channel among 1000 weight combinations\nFigure 3 demonstrates various weight combinations of Eigenvector Centrality, Clustering Coefficient, and In-degree\nthat achieve significant reductions in network density by removing the top bridge channels. Importantly, these different\ncombinations consistently identify the same core set of bridge nodes, each of which appears frequently among the top\n12 most impactful cross-community hubs for the considered 1000 combinations (Figure 4). This recurrence underscores\nthat our goal is not to seek a single \u201cmost optimal\u201d weight configuration but rather to leverage our bridge metric to\nreliably uncover influential bridge nodes that act as key conduits of misinformation across communities. Regardless of\n14 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\nthe chosen optimal weight combination, the proposed bridge metric consistently highlights these critical nodes, making\nthe equation robust in finding candidates for targeted intervention in the misinformation network.\nAfter optimizing the weights (w_i, w_e, w_c) across the range of (1,1,1) to (10,10,10), we identified that the combination\n(10, 7, 7) produced the highest change in network density before and after perturbing the network, with \u0394_\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66\nbeing the maximum. The original network density was 0.0015849, which dropped to 0.0015668 after the removal of the\ntop 12 bridge nodes.\nThis completed our bridge metric formulation and our proposed bridge metric is as follows:\nBridge_Score =10\u00d7indegree_centrality +7\u00d7eigenvector_centrality +7\u00d7clustering_coefficient (3)\nUsing this equation, we compute bridge scores for all nodes in the network and order them from highest to lowest. Nodes\nwith higher bridge scores serve as important cross-community hubs, facilitating rapid amplification of diverse narratives\nand reshaping network topologies. Our analysis identified a set of high-impact nodes that scored exceptionally well on\nour bridge metric, potentially serving as key conduits for cross-community information flow.\nChannel Clustering Norm.

Possible targets for intervention\nTable 2. presents the top nodes ranked by bridge score, including their normalized values for in-degree centrality,\neigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient. This detailed breakdown provides insights into the diverse character-\nistics that contribute to a node\u2019s bridging potential.\nFigure 6 presents network visualizations before and after the removal of top bridge nodes identified by the optimal\nweight combinations (Figure 5), visually demonstrating their impact on network structure (Figure 7).\n7.2 Impact of Bridge Node Removal:\nThe removal of the top 12 bridge nodes identified by our optimal weight combinations resulted in:\n\u20220.31% increase in average path length (from 1.579 to 1.584). Even a small increase in path length suggests that\nremoving key hubs slows down the spread of misinformation by increasing the distance between communities.\n\u202233.33% increase in number of communities (from 6 to 8), highlighting how the removal of key bridge nodes\nfragments the network, splitting previously connected groups into smaller, isolated clusters. This fragmentation\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 15\nFig. 5. The most influential cross-community hubs\nFig. 6. Network Visualizations Before and After Bridge Node Removal\ndemonstrates the structural role these hubs play in binding diverse communities together, and their absence\nreveals the potential for misinformation networks to weaken, limiting the reach and cohesion of harmful\nnarratives.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed bridge score in reducing network density and fragmenting the\nmisinformation network, we conducted a comparative analysis using nodes prioritized by the individual scoring metrics\nwe used to build our bridge score: in-degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient. In Table 3. each\nrow presents the effects of removing the top nodes as ranked by a particular metric on key network properties\u2014namely,\naverage path length, number of communities, and network density. By evaluating the impact of removing nodes ranked\nhighly by individual scores\u2014such as in-degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient\u2014we observe\nthat no single-metric approach achieves the same degree of network disruption as our composite bridge score.\n16 D.

Comparative Analysis of Network Disruption Metrics\nThe impact of our work shows that by strategically targeting and removing such influential nodes, the overall network\ncohesion is severely weakened, disrupting the pathways through which misinformation spreads and compartmentalizing\nthe spread of disinformation across distributed platforms.\n7.3 Spatial Distribution of Bridge Nodes:\nBuilding upon the understanding of the network\u2019s structural characteristics, the bridge score formula is now applied\nto identify and analyze key nodes that potentially facilitate cross-community information flow and misinformation\npropagation. To visualize the positioning of high-scoring bridge nodes within the network structure, we mapped their\nlocations relative to detected communities.\nFigure 8 displays the network graph with nodes sized by their bridge score and colored by community membership.\nHigh-scoring bridge nodes are highlighted, revealing their tendency to occupy strategic positions at the center of\nthe network and towards the internal peripheries of more prominent communities. With new channels being cre-\nated frequently, there is a need for continuous monitoring. New hubs position themselves strategically to amplify\nmisinformation of multiple community types.\n7.4 Significance of Cross-Community Hubs:\nThe application of our multidimensional bridge score revealed a highly skewed distribution of node\u2019s importance within\nthe network.\nFigure 9 presents a line graph of bridge scores across all nodes(with every 50th channel plotted across the X axis),\nplotted on a log scale. The distribution exhibits a heavy-tailed pattern, indicating that a small fraction of nodes possess\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 17\nFig. 7. Distribution of network into 8 (originally 6) distinct communities after removal of impactful hubs\ndisproportionately high bridge scores. This aligns with the scale-free nature of the network and suggests that a select\nfew nodes play crucial roles in bridging communities. A detailed analysis of engagement metrics between seed and\nbridge Telegram channels reveals striking contrasts. On average, messages in bridge channels are forwarded 845 times,\nsignificantly higher than the 147 forwards per message seen in seed channels. This indicates that bridge channels play\na critical role in amplifying content, particularly misinformation, by distributing it to broader audiences. Additionally,\nbridge channels experience 3.1 times more views per message compared to seed channels, highlighting their widespread\nreach. Interestingly, the pattern for replies is reversed\u2014seed channels receive around 34 replies for every 10 messages,\ncompared to only 8 replies per 10 messages in bridge channels. This suggests that bridge channels limit interactive\ndiscussions, likely to prevent scrutiny or fact-checking, and focus on rapidly disseminating pre-existing narratives.\nNotably, most messages in bridge channels are forwards, further emphasizing their role in content amplification rather\nthan original content creation.\nA close examination of the 4,492 Telegram channels that we originally started out with, reveal a recurring pattern in\nthe Russian disinformation machinery, where the same network of channels is repurposed to promote various false\n18 D. Shah and H. Ranka et al.\nFig. 8. Central positions of bridge nodes in the network\nnarratives. Initially, these channels were mobilized to propagate disinformation surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\nspreading misleading narratives to large audiences. However, our analysis also shows that the same network was later\nreactivated to disseminate misinformation about the Moscow (Crocus Hall) attack as shown in Figure 10. This reuse of\nchannels highlights the efficiency and adaptability of the disinformation ecosystem, where a pre-established network\ninfrastructure is leveraged to quickly shift focus and promote different campaigns, depending on the geopolitical\ncontext. Such strategic mobilization of channels indicates a coordinated effort to maintain influence and control over\npublic discourse, using misinformation as a tool to manipulate perceptions in various crises. This ability to recycle\ndisinformation networks across different events underscores the importance of continuously monitoring these channels\nto counteract the evolving narratives they propagate.\nA review of the links shared in bridging channels with corresponding url titles reveal that many of them lead to\nlow-quality, unreliable & state-sponsored sources, known for spreading misinformation and stoking social unrest.\nExamples include Dzen.ru & Russian News Agency-TASS, who are Russian news aggregators, often cited for promoting\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 19\nFig. 9.

Shah and H. Ranka et al.\nFig. 11. Message posting frequency in bridging channels with respect to time\nFigure 11 shows an analysis of posting activity in bridging channels, which reveal a marked increase in frequency\nduring major geopolitical events, often sparking controversy and potentially leading to social unrest. Notably, peaks\nwere observed during events such as June 24, 2023, when the feud with Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin posed\na significant threat to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 22-year rule, and October 13, 2022, when the U.N. General\nAssembly condemned Russia\u2019s illegal annexation in Ukraine. These spikes in activity indicate that such channels are\nstrategically used to amplify divisive narratives during critical moments to destabilize public discourse. With time, their\nfocus keeps changing and hence are capable of shaping a subscriber\u2019s perspective with the misinformation relating to\nlatest events and happenings. By examining these nodes\u2019 strategic positions and stability, one can gain insights into\nhow misinformation might spread across different groups. This information helps in developing targeted strategies to\nmonitor and curb harmful content across network boundaries.\n8 Conclusion\nThis work has contributed to the understanding of how distributed messaging platforms, particularly Telegram, facilitate\nthe flow of information through and between communities. By focusing on the role of bridge nodes in cross-community\ninformation propagation, we demonstrated that these key nodes are instrumental in amplifying content across otherwise\nisolated clusters. Our introduction of multi-dimensional bridging metrics reveals the critical connection between network\ntopology and the reach of information, showing that specific community structures can significantly enhance content\nvisibility and engagement. Moreover, our temporal analysis of bridge node activity during significant geopolitical\nevents highlights the dynamic and adaptive nature of information flow in distributed ecosystems. This underscores\nthe importance of network structure in determining the conditions under which misinformation or other content\nachieves broader dissemination. The findings of this study extend beyond theoretical contributions by offering practical\ninsights for platform design, content moderation, and intervention strategies. As misinformation continues to be a\nmajor challenge across digital ecosystems, this work provides a foundation for future research and the development\nof more robust socio-technical systems aimed at curbing the amplification of harmful narratives while promoting\ninformation integrity in distributed environments.\nBridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram 21\nAcknowledgments\nThis research would not have been possible without the invaluable insights and expertise of Eric Brichetto and Roman\nSannikov, whose work in open-source intelligence and disinformation investigations greatly enhanced the understanding\nof the different dynamics at play in misinformation campaigns.

(A) The latent ideology is calculated using the 500\nmost active banned and matched users on Gettr, merged into a single influ-\nencer cohort. Unit values on the x-axis correspond to the standard deviation\nof the ideology distribution for all users. Both distributions are unimodal\nwhen tested using Hartigan\u2019s diptest (multimodality not statistically signif-\nicant for the non-verified cohort, p= 0.99>0.01, or banned and matched\ncohort, p= 0.61>0.01).

The public scrutiny led platform administrators to set up moderation policies\nto curtail the rise of hate speech, misinformation and online harassment. These policies\ntriggered disenfranchised communities to settle on platforms that are not policing the content\nthat is shared by their community, nowadays known as the alt-tech ecosystem .\nOnce primarily used as a meeting space for fringe online communities, these platforms\nhave become major outlets for radical political movements. State presidents, such as Donald\nTrump and Jair Bolsonaro, have leveraged outlets belonging to the alt-tech ecosystem to\nsmear their adversaries, raise funds and share controversial narratives.\nIn this thesis, we study the rise of this alternative ecosystem and measure its impact on\nuser engagement, online discourse and the proliferation of extremist movements online.\nFirst, we look at the emergence of Voat, a far-right platform, and how it was competing\nagainst Reddit, its mainstream counterpart. We characterise the impact of deplatforming\npolicies from Reddit, the level of active engagement that emerges on Voat as well as the\ncross-community interactions that take place on the platform.\nSecond, we study cross-platform interactions by studying Gettr, a platform that has\nbecome a popular venue for right-wing state representatives in the US and Brazil. By\nlooking at a user\u2019s activity on Twitter and Gettr, we assess how deplatforming leads to the\nemergence of a committed community on an alt-tech platform, and how different user cohorts\nuse toxic discourse on both platforms.\nThird, we assess the impact of this phenomenon beyond the West by studying Koo, an\nIndian-made social platform that gathered support from nationalist political representatives\nin India and Nigeria. We study the ability for an alt-tech platform to become an international\nvenue and the interplay between language and culture in shaping online interactions.\nWe hope that this work will shed light on the social drivers that are catalysing the rise\nof this alternative online ecosystem, the societal risks that arise in an environment that does\nnot enforce any content moderation, and the challenges that policy makers must tackle to\nensure that these platforms do not become ideal venues for radicalisation.\n11\nPublications\nThis thesis is based on the following publications:\nI.

This \u201cmany-to-many\u201d\ncommunication pattern was seen as a way to catalyse the rise of a Digital Democracy [5],\nwith minimal hurdles between content producers and consumers.\nParallel to the sharp increase in technology adoption across the globe, some ethical issues\nhave started to arise regarding the content that is being shared on these online spaces [6].\nThe absence of gatekeeping systems implies that any content can be widely shared, with no\nmoderator in the loop to check the validity or the safety of the content. As such, some online\nplatforms were quickly swarmed with hateful and inappropriate content, with no safeguard\nin place to ensure that such content does not reach a vulnerable audience [7]. A totemic\nexample of the dilemma can be found in Usenet\u2019s history. Born in 1980 as a platform\npromoting an \u201canything-goes\u201d philosophy to promote unrestricted free speech [8], Usenet\nsustained several legal blows, with respect to their lack of moderation policies [9]. However,\nthe jurisprudence draws a line between primary publishers , who write, edit and publish the\nmaterial, and secondary publishers , who only distribute the material to a wider audience\nwith no curation [10], with platforms such as Usenet being traditionally included within the\nlatter category [11]. As a result, the US drafted Section 230, a legal act that provides online\nservices with an immunity from being held liable in the US for curating the content shared\non their platforms.\nThe debate around content moderation and safe practices in online ecosystems became\nall the more critical in recent years, following the rise of the alt-tech ecosystem [12]. With\nestablished social platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, becoming more stringent\nwith respect to online harassment, misinformation and hate speech [13, 14], new platforms\nstarted emerging, with their aim being to offer an alternative outlet to communities that have\nbeen banned from mainstream outlets [15]. This process, known as deplatforming , caused\nsignificant fringes of the online user base to aggregate on new outlets, where content moder-\n15\nation is close to non-existent [16 ] and anti-social narratives are tolerated, if not incentivised\nby the collectivity [17].\nOnce a fringe phenomenon, alt-tech platforms have recently become a major player in\npolitical propaganda, by allowing radicalised users to weave a collective narrative and build\na robust network, without being banned by the platform\u2019s administrators [18]. This has led\nto the rise of several prominent conspiratorial communities, such as the QAnon movement in\nthe US [19], the white supremacist ideology on Stormfront [20] or the global incel (involun-\ntary celibates) community on Reddit and specialised forums [21]. The recent rise in terrorist\nattacks and violent riots perpetrated by far-right sympathisers, from the 2011 Norway at-\ntacks to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, highlighted the security risks\nintertwined with an empowered and vocal online extremist movement [22, 23]. However,\ndespite the urgency to understand better the content being shared on such platforms and\nthe user interactions that arise, the scientific literature related to the social cohesion and the\nnarratives being shared within these communities is still scarce.\nThis thesis aims to improve our understanding of this burgeoning online phenomenon,\nby mapping the alt-tech ecosystem and looking at the impact these new platforms have on\nthe overall online environment. Our contributions can be summarised into four main angles.\nFirst, we provide an overview of several alt-tech platforms, and the events that prompted\nonline communities to migrate to these ecosystems. By looking at Voat, Gettr and Koo,\nwe provide a clear understanding of the unintended impacts of deplatforming policies, the\nvelocity of a collective migration and the user engagement that is cultivated afterwards on the\nalt-tech platform. Second, we look at the user engagement that spans across these platforms\nand within mainstream platforms and provide a clear comparison of the content being shared\non an established platform, versus the one disseminated on the alt-tech platform. Our\nanalysis provides a nuanced overview of the consequences that deplatforming has in curbing\nthe exposure to hateful and/or misleading narratives for a wider audience. Third, we also\nstudy how users engage on alt-tech platforms, by looking at the impact that social factors,\nsuch as language, social status and group belonging, play in shaping the interaction network.\nFinally, we provide extensive datasets of user-created content and user-to-user interactions\ntaking place on several alt-tech platforms, by making them publicly accessible. Our hope\nis that it will provide the resources required by other researchers to look at other social\nphenomena emerging on alt-tech platforms. Our datasets contain information about user\nprofiles, but also fine-grained metadata related to user-generated content and the interactions\ntaking place within the community, thus providing a longitudinal overview of the platforms\u2019\nuser base.\nOur research focuses on a question that is extremely time-dependent, as the major de-\nplatforming events that took place over the last few years had an immediate ripple effect\non the alt-tech ecosystem. In order to precisely understand their impact, our research uses\nunique datasets, comprising user profiles and user-to-user interactions taking place on alt-\ntech platforms. For instance, chapter 3 is based on user profiles, community profiles and\nuser posts and comments from Voat, from the platform\u2019s launch in 2014 up to its shutdown\n16\nin 2020 [24]. Therefore, we can identify peaks of registrations and activity over the lifetime\nof the platform and can compare it with events of interest taking place on Reddit. Like-\nwise, chapter 4 uses a more granular dataset for Gettr, another US-centric alt-tech platform,\ncomprising user profiles, posts, comments, but also likes and shares taking place on the plat-\nform. As such, this dataset allows us to map passive interactions on Gettr, and therefore\nto understand the role that lurkers play in alt-tech environments. A similar dataset has\nbeen collected for Koo, an Indian-based alt-tech platform whose community spans Nigeria\nand Brazil as well [25, 26]. Chapter 5 provides an overview of the dataset, whereas research\nquestions related to the role of linguistic and cultural factors in Koo\u2019s interaction patterns\nare tackled with this dataset in chapter 6. Each study is based on novel unique datasets\nof unprecedented size and coverage of the studied systems. The data used throughout our\nresearch was collected by using open-access APIs provided by the platforms, and the data\nwas subsequently made available to the academic community through data-sharing services.\nThe research presented in this thesis relies on several analytical tools to identify patterns\nof interest in user-to-user interactions and platform dynamics. Network analysis is used in\nchapters 3, 5 and 6 to map the interaction network on Voat and Koo, and highlight the\nhomophilic behaviour that strongly dominates user-to-user interactions on both platforms,\nin terms of ideology and language respectively. Statistical ecology tools, such as the Kaplan-\nMeier curve and alpha and beta diversity metrics, are used in chapters 4 and 6 to better\nunderstand how engaged users are on the platform over time, and how their interactions\npredominantly take place within their social circle. Time-series analysis is also used in\nchapters 3, 4 and 6 to map the impact of deplatforming events in established platforms on\nthe registration peaks that are observed by their alt-tech competitors, further highlighting\nthe speed at which collective migrations take place after a community gets banned from a\nmainstream platform. Natural Language Processing algorithms are used in chapters 4 and 5\nto identify the most salient topics discussed within communities from the US, Brazil, India\nand Nigeria that settled on alt-tech platforms. Our findings offer a unique understanding of\nthe narratives that are cultivated on alt-tech platforms, and a comparison with the topics\nidentified from Twitter activity in Gettr offers some insights on the discourse taking place\non both mainstream and alt-tech platforms. We also employ techniques to analyse the news\necosystem that arise on alt-tech platforms in chapters 4 and 5, with a more detailed study\nof the reliability of popular news outlets and their monopoly on the news ecosystem that\na user is exposed to on alt-tech platforms. Finally, we use toxicity analysis in chapter 4 to\nquantify the toxicity of the content posted by several user cohorts on Gettr over time, and\nhow different the level of toxicity is compared to Twitter activity.\nThe thesis is structured around three main questions, detailed below, with each chapter\ntackling one of the questions. Chapter 2 provides a broader overview of the social media\necosystem and its recent evolution. The main literature around deplatforming, online radi-\ncalisation and social dynamics within social media is also presented. Chapters 4 and 6 are\nalso accompanied by their additional material, which provides the reader with more in-depth\nanalysis and robustness checks.\n17\nChapters 3 and 4: How do alt-tech platforms react to massive deplatforming from estab-\nlished platforms?\nOne of the leading causes for the surge of popularity within the alt-tech ecosystem is\nthe ban of influential figures and communities from established platforms, leading them to\nseek refuge with an unregulated competitor [27]. Some of these platforms have become very\nproficient at recruiting disenfranchised actors, who helped skyrocket their prominence in the\noverall ecosystem [28].\nTo approach this question, we will look at two alt-tech platforms, namely Voat and\nGettr. While both were founded with similar intentions, their initial capital was drastically\ndifferent: Voat was started as a student project, whereas Gettr had substantial backup from\nconservative politicians in the US and Brazil from day one [29]. Both, however, benefited\nfrom major bans taking place on Reddit and Twitter respectively. Voat became a hub for\nQAnon-related communities after their ban from Reddit in 2017 [30], whereas right-wing\npersonalities, such as Joe Rogan and Marjorie Taylor Greene, cemented Gettr\u2019s place in the\nUS far right ecosystem [31]. In chapters 3 and 4, we identify the popularity of both platforms\nin the wake of the deplatforming events that took place on their mainstream competitors.\nAfterwards, we assess the user engagement they nurture, by looking at the user interaction\nnetwork and the most salient topics that are cultivated.\nThe content of these chapters is based on publications [I] and [II].\nChapter 5: How does the alt-tech ecosystem evolve outside of the West?\nDespite being often portrayed as a Western phenomenon, alt-tech platforms have also\nbecome strong contenders in the online ecosystem for many other nations. This rise is pri-\nmarily fueled by a desire to disentangle themselves from US-dominated platforms, where\nnon-English speakers are often marginalised in terms of language support and content mod-\neration [32]. Moreover, several countries have enacted policies to block US platforms from\nbeing accessed within their territory, such as China\u2019s Golden Shield Project [33] and Russia\u2019s\nstriving for digital sovereignty [34].\nOur analysis will focus on Koo, an Indian-based platform that quickly garnered support\nfrom the dominant national political party. With its initial aim being to embody a \u201clanguage\nfirst\u201d philosophy, where every user should be able to express themselves in their mother\ntongue, Koo ended up attracting international governments, following their disagreements\nwith Twitter\u2019s content moderation. As such, Koo began to threaten the US-based platforms\u2019\nhegemony with its international outlook that spanned India, Nigeria and Brazil.\nThe content of this chapter is based on publication [III].\nChapter 6: What kind of social ecosystem arises on an alt-tech platform?\nAfter a community has been banned from a social media platform, there is an urgent\nneed for its members to congregate on another platform. The process is often spearheaded\n18\nby a few leader figures, resulting in an overall resilience against deplatforming policies [35].\nHowever, due to their nature as a safe haven for banned users, alt-tech platforms are likely\nto attract communities with extremely diverse ideologies, and they might not be able to\ncohabit on a similar outlet. For example, after being banned from Reddit, members of the\nr/The_Donald subreddit, who were strong supporters of Donald Trump\u2019s political stances,\nmigrated to Voat [36]. However, they were soon to be censored by other communities already\npresent on the platform, leading them to move instead to their own message board [37].\nAs such, there is a need to understand how communities, which migrate to a similar\nalt-tech platform from various contexts, end up sharing a digital space. Our analysis looks\nat Koo, the Indian social platform that attracted communities from India, Nigeria and\nBrazil. By looking at language use from each active user, our aim is to map the presence of\ncross-linguistic interactions, which would indicate that there is an avenue for communities,\nemerging from very different cultural settings, to communicate beyond the linguistic barrier\n[38].\nThe content of this chapter is based on publication [IV].\nOverall, our research improves our understanding of the online social ecosystem, and the\nimpact of alt-tech platforms on online behaviours. This thesis is based on a very recent social\nphenomenon, and can therefore act as a stepping stone to further clarify the role that alt-tech\nplatforms play in aggregating radicalised users on an unregulated online space. Interesting\navenues for future research can explore the impact of government policies against alt-tech\nplatforms, especially in a context where several of these platforms have refused to comply\nwith direct orders to remove some of its content [39]. Some of these questions will be further\ndiscussed in chapter 7, where we review the main findings of this thesis, as well as potential\nstudies that could further improve our results.\n19\nChapter 2\nBackground\n2.1 Social dynamics on social media\nSince their advent in the early 2000s, online social platforms have changed the way we\ninteract within our community and with a global audience. By offering the opportunity\nfor anyone to produce new content and share it to an international public, social media\nhas revolutionised the dynamics that lead to the rise of online communities [40, 41]. Many\nstudies have highlighted how our online interactions follow a strongly assortative pattern,\nwith communities being moulded around collective identities [42], shared hobbies [43] and\nsimilar political leanings [44]. The ability to instantly connect with like-minded individuals\nhas made social platforms pivotal in shaping activist movements, related to social causes\n[45] or aiming to raise awareness about humanitarian disasters [46].\nOn the other side, this pattern of preferential attachment has also exacerbated the polar-\nisation observed in online spaces. Previous studies have shown that online polarisation has\nled to a fragmentation of the online debate along partisan lines [47], given birth to online\necho chambers [48], and has bolstered uncivil behaviour towards one\u2019s political opponents\n[49]. This trend has been shown to be gamed by outside actors, whose aim is to hijack\ndemocratic processes by further dividing users along their political opinions [50].\nPrevious research has also delved into the role that social media platforms play in dis-\nseminating and amplifying misinformation towards a wider audience. Public exposure to\nmisleading information has been particularly critical during major political events, such as\npresidential elections [51] or national referendums [ 52]. This phenomenon is further exacer-\nbated by the role played by state actors [53] and grassroots movements [54], which capitalise\non their online audience to promulgate their agenda and gain political leverage [55].\nAs a result of the role played by social media in distributing misleading content, re-\nsearchers have audited the algorithms used by major social platforms to recommend content\nto their users, and have found that recommender systems are systematically nudging users\n20\ntowards misleading or problematic content [56, 57,58]. This behaviour is partially explained\nby the popularity bias that governs modern recommender systems, namely that overall pop-\nular content is being recommended more often than personalised content [59]. Recommender\nsystems are also burdened by an exposure bias, with some users being over-represented in\nthe content pool and therefore more often recommended than others [60].\nAs mentioned in the introduction, online platforms have started investing in content\nmoderation systems [61], forcing them to become de facto curators of the content shared on\ntheir services [62]. As such, platform administrators have been constantly navigating the\nethical line between censoring free speech, in favour of keeping their community safe from\nharmful or misleading content [63].\nThere is a growing debate regarding the best strategies that should be enforced by social\nmedia companies to adopt a sound platform governance policy [64], most notably with respect\nto the use of automated systems [65] instead of human moderators [66], with other systems\ncombining both with a human-in-the-loop approach [67]. However, one of the most divisive\nquestions relates to the punishments that should be applied to any user who infringes the\nplatform\u2019s terms of service [68]. One of the most adopted strategies is to reduce the visibility\nof content that has been flagged as being controversial or harmful [69], or even ban repeated\noffenders from the service altogether [70].\n2.2 Deplatforming\nIn the wake of extremist movements on social platforms and the increasing social and political\npressure for site administrators to be held accountable for the content that is shared on their\nservices, mainstream platforms have started clamping down on users and communities that\ninfringe their terms of service. Bans have been used to remove users who were involved in\ncyberbullying [71], disinformation campaigns [72], and hate speech [73]. This strategy has\nbeen mostly aimed towards controversial public personalities, in the hope that the lack of a\nfigurehead for the movement would reduce collective engagement with offensive speech [74].\nDeplatforming has been shown to effectively curb the use of toxic language on mainstream\nplatforms and to tackle online safety concerns [70]. However, its long-term consequences have\nbeen undermined by the rise of an alternative online ecosystem, with platforms catering to\ncommunities that have been banned from established platforms. From its infancy in the\nearly years of the web2 environment, sparked by message boards, such as 4chan [75] and\nStormfront [20], the alt-tech ecosystem now counts a plethora of platforms that have managed\nto attract a more significant user base [76]. In the US, platforms such as Gab [77, 78],\nParler [79, 80], and Truth Social [81, 82] have grown to become US-centric powerhouses\nfor conspiratorial movements such as QAnon [83 ] and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d [84 ] allegations,\nwhereas the phenomenon has also become prevalent in Europe, with Odysee, Telegram and\nBitchute [85, 86].\nWhereas alt-tech platforms used to only host fringe communities, they rose to prominence\n21\nin several political circles, by offering a safe space for members to interact without any\nscrutiny from content moderators [16]. As such, studies have highlighted their use as a\nrecruitment ground for extremist movements [ 87], due to the laissez-faire behaviour of the\nplatform owners [12]. The rise of populist movements on alt-tech platforms has also been\ncorrelated with the amplification of anti-democratic narratives [88] leading, in some cases,\nto political riots [89, 90].\nAlternative platforms have also become a privileged venue for online extremist movements\nto raise funds from their followers. After being banned from crowdfunding platforms such as\nPatreon, GoFundMe, and Kickstarter [91], far right movements relied on their counterparts\nin the alternative ecosystem, such as Hatreon and Wesearchr [92]. This solution has allowed\nfringe actors to raise enough capital to fund controversial research projects [93 ], or to cover\nlegal expenses for lawsuits [94]. The scale of the crowdsourcing potential of fringe outlets\nfurther highlights the potential for extremist movements to tap into the alt-tech ecosystem\nto mobilise their followers. It is essential to note that some misinformation superspreaders\nare also leveraging their online influence to earn an income via their content. These finan-\ncial incentives to spread misleading information have notably been identified within wellness\ninfluencers on Instagram [95] and YouTube channels [96] involved in spreading anti-vaccine\npropaganda. Hoax stories related to the 2016 US presidential election have also been finan-\ncially profitable for several online figures through ad revenues [97]. As such, we need to also\ntake into consideration the financial drivers that can lead influencers to migrate to alt-tech\nplatforms with their followers, after having been banned from established outlets.\n2.3 Online radicalisation\nBy offering access to a trove of content and the possibility to connect with like-minded\nindividuals, online services have also facilitated the interconnection between users who share\nsimilar fringe opinions related to racial issues, public health and anti-immigration policies\n[98]. With the opportunity to aggregate on a similar platform, such communities have\nbecome new recruiting grounds for extremist movements, now able to groom newcomers\nwho are seeking new information [ 99].\nThe RECRO model [100] describes the phases undertaken by an online user, seeking\nalternative narratives related to personal triggers and vulnerabilities ( Reflection andExplo-\nration phases). Their journey might lead them to connect with a community that espouses\na narrative that conflicts with the mainstream dogma ( Connection phase), leading the user\nto adopt similar views and to seek new information to reinforce their new internal narrative\n(Resolution phase). Finally, they become themselves a messenger of the community, leading\nnewcomers to follow the same radicalisation pipeline ( Operational phase). This pipeline has\nbeen observed in practice within anti-vaccine communities on Reddit and Facebook [101].\nSimilarly, the 3N model highlights the three main psychological drivers that lead people\nto espouse extremist opinions [102]. The first component, Needs , represents all the social,\n22\npsychological or emotional motives that the person seeks to satisfy by joining a radical\nmovement. The second one, Narratives , groups every storytelling tool, such as conspiracy\ntheories, used to frame an in-group / out-group dichotomy between the extremist community\nand mainstream social movements. Finally, the last one, Networks , highlights the social\npressure and the sense of belonging that arises once a person becomes strongly intertwined\nwith other members of the extremist community. Overall, the 3N model emphasises the role\nthat radicalisation plays in bringing purpose to isolated individuals, by providing them with\na belief system and a support network. The 3N model has notably been used to study online\nsocial networks, such as the impact of conspiracy theories on group dynamics on Twitter\n[103].\nMoreover, this phenomenon has been exacerbated by a growing fear over social media\ncensorship [104], leading users to seek information in less reputable sources to fight off the\ninformation vacuum in established social media platforms - a social phenomenon often called\nthe Streisand effect [105]. The lack of available information regarding major events trigger the\nexploration phase of the RECRO model described previously. This process has been shown\nto be a strong magnet for conspiratorial communities after collective traumatic events [106],\nand to lead young men to adopt radicalised viewpoints to offset personal grievances [107].\nMore specifically, conspiracy theories are a powerful medium to lure new recruits and build\na collective narrative, centred on a distrust of mainstream institutions. Previous research\ndefines conspiracy theories as \u201cradicalising multipliers\u201d, due to their propensity to demonise\nthe out-group, label voices of moderation as being part of the conspiracy, and spur their\nmembers to violent action [108].\nThe last phase of the radicalisation process suggested in [100] is the operational phase\n- when a newly radicalised individual becomes themselves a messenger of the movement,\nby means of violent protest or by becoming part of the recruitment pipeline [ 109]. In the\nlatter case, social media has been extensively used by extremist movements to amplify their\nnarrative [110], reach out to socially vulnerable users [111] and to coordinate their actions\n[112]. This strategy was employed by several extremist movements across the globe, from\nISIS\u2019s digital strategy [113] to Pegida in Germany [114]. Moreover, thanks to the ubiquity\nof social platforms in our day-to-day interactions and the communities we identify with,\nextremist movements have been able to tap more massively on other scenes to subvert their\nnarratives in mainstream spaces, for example through the musical scene [115] or combat\nsports [116 ].\nOnline social platforms have also been shown to be intricately involved in the radical-\nisation pipeline, by providing their users with content that reinforces their biases. Several\nstudies have identified the role played by YouTube\u2019s recommender system [117, 118] into\nrecommending more extreme content to their users over time.\nOne of the leading questions that will be tackled in this work is the role that alt-tech\nplatforms play in fueling more users into the radicalisation pipeline. By offering an online\nspace where violent and controversial content is unmoderated, alt-tech platforms have been\n23\nshown to be incubators of content that promotes violent extremism [119]. Moreover, by\nhosting communities that have been banned from mainstream competitors, alt-tech platforms\nare allowing extremist groups to retain an online presence and promote their narratives\nin a welcoming space [120]. Our analysis will provide further evidence of the mechanisms\nemployed by alt-tech platforms to attract, retain and radicalise users, particularly for political\ngains.\n2.4 Mainstreaming of fringe opinions on alt-tech plat-\nforms\nThe web 2.0 paradigm, which rose in the aftermath of the dotcom bubble, has led to the\nrise of a new online ecosystem, where the content is dominantly user-generated and publicly\nshared by the site provider. The rise of the web 2.0 has been strongly associated with the\nadvent of an empowerment of social movements [121], which are now able to share their\ngrievances with a wide audience, metastasise into online grassroots activism [122] and raise\nawareness about social and environmental challenges [123].\nHowever, studies have also highlighted the pervasive role played by social media in nor-\nmalising and amplifying hateful narratives, by laundering fringe opinions into the mainstream\ndiscourse [124, 125]. A recent example of such a process is the \u201cIt\u2019s Okay to be White\u201d cam-\npaign, which was kickstarted on 4chan in 2017, before becoming an innocuous message used\nby white supremacists in political discourses [126]. Online platforms have become a major\ntool in providing an audience to extremist narratives, more so by providing radicalised com-\nmunities with a safe space to weave their narrative [127]. One of the pervasive effects of\nsimilar social campaigns is the normalisation of extremist opinions in the public sphere, such\nas hate speech against minority groups [128] or the spread of conspiracy theories [129].\nDespite being aggressively banned from mainstream social outlets, extremist communities\nare still able to capitalise on the alt-tech ecosystem to weave an international network of\nlike-minded individuals and to further widen their audience [130, 131]. While established\nplatforms are still being weaponised by extremist groups to optimise the exposure to their\nnarratives, alternative outlets increasingly became pivotal to share radicalised discourse that\nwould be \u201ccensored\u201d on mainstream platforms [132 ], leading to a more politicised and radical\ndiscourse to become the norm on unmoderated platforms [78].\nAlt-tech platforms have also started to become a conduit for right-wing narratives, mean-\ning that extremist opinions are getting intertwined with moderate right-wing political stances\n[133]. For example, Rumble hosted the GOP debate in 2023 [134], highlighting an alliance\nbetween mainstream political movements and what was once seen as a fringe online move-\nment. Similarly, politicians who are active on both mainstream and alt-tech platforms further\nblur the line between extremist and established conventions [135]. These strategies make it\nmore socially acceptable for larger crowds to align with discriminatory - and often violent -\npolitical stances [136]. This mainstreaming of fringe opinions is operated in a similar fashion\n24\nthat David Duke, an influential member of the Ku Klux Klan, funnelled white supremacist\nclaims in the Republican bloodstream while running to become Louisiana\u2019s State Represen-\ntative in 1989 [137 ]. His own chapter of the movement, named the \u201cKnights of the Ku Klux\nKlan\u201d, aimed at shifting the ideology of the movement into more acceptable focus points, by\nbranding itself as a \u201cwhite civil rights organisation\u201d [138].\nThis work aims to further understand how alt-tech platforms are instrumental in shifting\nthe Overton window - a concept adopted in political sciences to represent the range of policies\nthat are publicly acceptable for a politician to endorse at a given time [139]. To do so, we\nlook at the most prevalent topics within political communities and compare their prominence\nwithin alt-tech and mainstream platforms, in order to identify attempts to inject political\nstances into the public mind.\n2.5 Social media beyond the West\nWhile the previous studies were heavily focused on the rise of online populist movements in\nthe Western hemisphere, similar trends have been observed internationally, with a similar\nposition leveraged by the growing alt-tech ecosystem. Several political leaders from large\nnations, such as former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro or Indian Prime Minister Narendra\nModi, have incorporated alt-tech platforms into their political strategies, in order to share\nmisleading or hateful narratives about their political opponents [140, 141].\nCombined with the fact that state-of-the-art content moderation systems deployed on\nsocial platforms are mostly optimised to work with English text [142], there is a growing\nfeeling of disenfranchisement among non-Western communities, leading alt-tech platforms\nthat offer support for vernacular languages to become valid competitors on the social media\nmarket [38].\nThis phenomenon is all the more crucial in India, where social media platforms have been\nextensively used by the dominant political party as a social mobilisation tool. Following a\nconflict with Twitter in 2021, after the platform refused to comply with takedown requests\nfrom the Indian government [143], the country\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi has been\nshaping a stricter governance of online services in the country [144]. As a pioneer in social\nmedia usage for political campaigning [145], the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with Modi\nas its leader, has been an early adopter of Indian-made social platforms, in a bid to increase\nits presence on non-English dominated social media outlets [146]. Previous studies have\nstressed out the role that harmful speech [147] and disinformation [148] play in the BJP\u2019s\nsocial media apparatus. As such, their presence on unregulated platforms, willing to take\ndown any content that is flagged by the government [149], raises concerns related to the\ndemocratic process and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities in India.\nThe work presented in this thesis aims to further explore the opportunities that alt-tech\nplatforms leverage by hosting non-Western communities. By looking at the rise of Koo, an\nIndian-based social platform, we provide a clearer picture of the growing adoption of the\n25\nalt-tech ecosystem as a legitimate venue for major political movements around the world\n[38,150].\n2.6 Online lurking behaviour\nDespite a significant fraction of the population worldwide being registered on at least one\nsocial media platform [151], this does not imply that they are actively contributing to the\ncontent shared online. Indeed, when considering the users visiting a social platform, most\nof them would be labelled as lurkers , meaning that they browse on the platform, read the\ncontent shared by their peers, but rarely actively take part in a conversation. In the U.S.,\nresearch suggests that almost half of the adult users on Twitter are lurkers [152], although\nmost estimates posit that this category encompasses 90% of the users [153].\nDespite their lack of contribution to the production of novel content, lurkers still play an\nimportant role in the social media ecosystem. Rather than being active members of their\ncommunity, they can be seen as active listeners, reflecting on the content they encounter\nonline [154]. Moreover, a previous study has shown that lurkers can be mobilised by online\npolitical movements [155], whereas specific reward schemes can be efficient at \u201cdelurking\u201d\nusers [156]. To quantify their structural role in the social network, several centrality metrics\nhave been defined to rank lurkers within a community [157].\nDue to the nature of these communities, we can expect lurkers to abound on far-right\nplatforms. Previous research suggested that newcomers on extremist forums often aspire to\nbecome full members of the community, and are therefore keen to listen and learn the best\nways to earn their peers\u2019 respect [158]. Moreover, when comparing violent to non-violent\nonline right-wing extremist groups, one notices that lurkers are more prevalent in the violent\ngroups [159].\nThe collective engagement becomes all the more toxic when considering smear campaigns\nsuch as Gamergate , an anti-feminist campaign within the gaming community that started in\n2014 [160]. Hateful narratives are more likely to lead to an engaged community [161], raising\nmore concerns regarding the security risks that could arise within these communities once\ntheir members metastasise into an engaged collective.\nOur analysis provides insights on the user engagement that takes place across alt-tech\nplatforms, more specifically by looking at the unbalance in content production among users.\nOur results suggest that hyperactive users leverage their position within the community to\nhold a monopoly over the collective discourse, further deepening the divide between content\nproducers and consumers.\n26\n2.7 Studied platforms\nThe alt-tech ecosystem has become an evolving phenomenon over the last few years, with new\nplatforms weaponising the global health crisis related to Covid-19, and the related conspiracy\ntheories, to grow their audience [162]. Although this thesis aims at providing novel insights\nrelated to the systemic impact alt-tech platforms leverage in the online ecosystem, our work\nwill focus on a few case studies. One of our central objectives is to improve the access to\nextensive datasets within the academic community, to allow other research groups to carry\nout their own study on the alt-tech ecosystem. Therefore, we publicly released the data we\ncollected from each platform studied in this thesis.\nThe following subsections provide the reader with historical and social context related to\neach of the platforms that will be discussed later on.\n2.7.1 Voat: Countering Reddit\u2019s community bans\nLaunched in 2005, Reddit is a social news aggregation platform, where users can create and\njoin communities of interest, called subreddits . These communities offer the opportunity for\nusers to create posts, which can then be interacted with by their peers. Subreddits are also\nresponsible for moderating any content that is being shared, with the task usually carried out\nby volunteers. In order to curb anti-social behaviour taking place on the platform, Reddit\nadministrators and moderators are able to quarantine a subreddit, an intervention implying\nthat the targeted subreddit will still be accessible and members will have the possibility to\nstay active, however the community will not appear as search results for any query on the\nplatform. Combined with the decentralised moderation system operated on Reddit [163], the\nplatform\u2019s interventions led to problematic communities becoming less civil against Reddit\nstaff and other subreddits [164].\nFrom 2015, Reddit became less tolerant towards subreddits that were repeatedly violat-\ning their anti-harassment policies. Communities such as r/fatpeoplehate, whose aim was\nto ridicule influencers from the body positivity movement, and r/The_Donald, a subred-\ndit catered for Donald Trump supporters, were among the communities banned for their\nproblematic behaviour [165, 166]. This led their thousands of members to be left without\nan outlet to network and keep their communities alive. However, they were soon welcomed\non Voat, a Reddit clone founded in 2014 by Atif Colo as a Reddit free-speech alternative\n[167]. By capitalising on Reddit\u2019s moderation policies, Voat managed to attract a significant\nnumber of banned subreddits, leading to a community of more than 100,000 users settling\non the platform.\nFollowing the ban of QAnon-related subreddits, Voat was endorsed by influential leaders\nof the movement as their next destination, and the platform\u2019s community became mainly\ncomposed of QAnon sympathisers [168]. This led the platform to earn its reputation as a\nfar-right hub, with a strong focus on the QAnon mythos and Trump-related paraphernalia\n[169]. More importantly, the Voat saga led to a reassessment of the pernicious impact that\n27\nbanning an online community can have in terms of the usage of toxic speech [170] and the\nhealth of the overall social media ecosystem [171].\nOur work looks at the collective organisation that arises within a subreddit after getting\nbanned and the velocity at which these communities migrated to Voat [130]. Afterwards, we\nprovide some insights into the news ecosystem, showing the advent of an epistemic bubble\non the platform - a place where sources are filtered by gatekeepers within the community,\nto only share resources that align with the dominant narrative of the community [172].\nMoreover, we look at the structure of the interaction network on Voat and highlight the\nexistence of siloed communities within the platform, suggesting that extreme communities\non Voat scarcely interact with the overall community.\n2.7.2 Gettr: The US far-right\u2019s political outlet\nFollowing the wave of anti-institution sentiments that were exacerbated by the Covid-19\npandemic, members of the US Republican Party became infamous for inflaming their sup-\nporters around extremist narratives [173]. Some members of Congress, such as Georgia\u2019s\ncongressional incumbent Marjorie Taylor Greene and Colorado\u2019s Lauren Boebert, rose to\nprominence among far-right circles for endorsing extremist opinions related to social issues\nand anti-immigration policies [174]. However, in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrec-\ntion and Trump\u2019s ban from Twitter, politicians on the far-right end of the spectrum started\nquestioning the agenda governing social platforms, which they accused of being biased in\nfavour of the Democrats [175].\nAs such, the alt-tech ecosystem became an attractive online environment to share political\nmessaging without the risk of censorship. Gettr, launched in July 2021, was created by Jason\nMiller, Donald Trump\u2019s former spokesman, with the intention to host a political dialogue\nthat would be deemed as being misleading or harmful on established platforms [89]. Gettr\nwas quickly joined by members of the US right-wing ecosystem, such as former White House\u2019s\nchief strategist Steve Bannon and InfoWars executive Alex Jones. However, the platform also\ncapitalised on the strong ties between the Trump and Bolsonaro families and was endorsed\nby former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, along with members of his cabinet [176].\nIn the following months, Gettr managed to extend its popularity in the overall social\nmedia ecosystem by attracting political figures and online influencers, such as podcaster\nJoe Rogan [177] and far-right French politician Florian Philippot [178]. With a collective\ndiscourse mostly revolving around Republican talking points [179], Gettr aimed to cultivate\na community that is sympathetic with Trump\u2019s political stances, while also expanding be-\nyond the US by sponsoring political rallies in Brazil [180]. Gettr\u2019s influence in Brazilian\npolitics climaxed after Bolsonaro\u2019s loss at the November 2022 presidential election against\nhis opponent, Lula. Following a call of arms that was broadcast on Gettr by prominent\nUS conservative celebrities [181], such as Steve Bannon, Bolsonaro supporters stormed the\nBrazilian Congress on January 8, 2023, in a public riot strongly reminiscent of the events\nthat took place at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 [182].\n28\nAfter Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of X, formerly known as Twitter, and Donald Trump\u2019s launch\nof Truth Social in 2022, Gettr has suffered several financial blows and is allegedly close to\nshutting down, after massive layoffs took place in the company in January 2024 [183].\nOur study looks at Gettr\u2019s ability to capitalise on deplatforming events taking place on\nTwitter, by measuring the influx of new users and their degree of engagement on Gettr [89].\nMoreover, we also take a deeper look at users who are active on both Gettr and Twitter, to\nmeasure their propensity to target their political opponents on Twitter, and their usage of\ntoxic language on both platforms.\n2.7.3 Koo: A Twitter competitor outside the Western hemisphere\nIn the last few years, we also witnessed the growth of social media platforms outside of\nEurope and North America. These new communities are tapping into a demographic market\nthat is often underfunded by established platforms, and are therefore threatening the US\nhegemony in the social media market. One of the most interesting developments is within\nthe Indian market, where new platforms are providing support to vernacular languages,\nthus opening their doors to non-English speakers. Traditional platforms have been shown\nto underinvest in minority languages, leading underrepresented linguistic communities to be\nmore exposed to harmful and misleading content [184, 185]. This fallacy is often caused by\na lack of resources in said languages, challenging the possibility to train automated content\nmoderation systems to flag problematic content [ 186].\nKoo had become a flagship platform for the \u201cIndian-made\u201d ecosystem - aiming at offering\nan alternative to US-dominated social platforms to non-English speakers across India. After\nwinning the Atmanirbhar App Innovation Challenge - a contest launched by the Ministry\nof Electronic & IT - Koo was labelled as one of the promises of the start-up community\nto create a \u201cworld class Made In India App\u201d [187]. Moreover, the platform\u2019s investments\nin supporting Indian vernacular languages allowed Koo to capitalise on its national status\n[188]. One of the platform\u2019s advertisement campaign, named \u201c#KooKiyaKya\u201d, showcases\nthe opportunity for every Indian user to express themselves in their mother tongue on Koo\n[189].\nAside from India, Koo had also been able to market itself on the international market,\nnotably in Nigeria and Brazil. Strong investments in the support for vernacular languages\nturned the platform into a cherished outlet for then Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari,\nas well as Brazilian president Lula [25].\nDue to its close ties with the BJP government, Koo had been accused of fostering the\npopulist narratives that drive Narendra Modi\u2019s government policies [190]. For example,\ninvestigations have shown that Koo was used to share divise and hateful narratives in the\nrun-up to the 2024 Indian elections, in June 2024 [191].\nDespite the endorsements from the dominant political movement in India and its ambi-\ntions to rival Twitter in terms of online outreach, Koo struggled to keep users active in the\n29\nlong term. Its usage had plummeted in the last year, forcing the platform to lay off a large\nportion of its employees [192]. In June 2024, the platform underwent a funding crisis, with\nsalaries being suspended for its entire workforce [193]. This was closely followed with Koo\nshutting down definitely on July 3, 2024, after running out of funds to keep their services\nafloat [194].\nOur work provides a longitudinal analysis of Koo\u2019s popularity over the years, and the\nscale of the migrations taking place in India, Nigeria and Brazil, that fueled the platform\u2019s\nuser base. By analysing cross-language interactions taking place on the platform, we show\nthat minority language speakers were consigned to the periphery of the interaction network,\nindicating that they were heavily segregated from Hindi- and English- speakers. Moreover,\nconversations taking place within a linguistic community ddid not significantly overlap with\nother linguistic groups, indicating that languages on Koo were strongly siloed, despite the\nplatform\u2019s ambition to become a meeting hall for vernacular language speakers.\n30\nChapter 3\n\u201cI Can\u2019t Keep It Up.\u201d\nA Dataset from the Defunct Voat.co\nNews Aggregator\nNote: Throughout this chapter, I decided to censor the name of an online community, which\ncorresponds to a racial slur.\nVoat.co was a news aggregator website that shut down on December 25, 2020. The site\nhad a troubled history and was known for hosting various banned subreddits. This chapter\npresents a dataset with over 2.3Msubmissions and 16.2Mcomments posted from 113K\nusers in 7.1Ksubverses (the equivalent of a subreddit for Voat). Our dataset covers the\nwhole lifetime of Voat, from its developing period starting on November 8, 2013, the day it\nwas founded, April 2014, up until the day it shut down (December 25, 2020).\nThis work presents the largest and most complete publicly available Voat dataset, to\nthe best of our knowledge. Along with the release of this dataset, we present a preliminary\nanalysis covering posting activity and daily user and subverse registration on the platform\nso that researchers interested in our dataset can know what to expect.\nOur data may prove helpful to false news dissemination studies as we analyse the links\nusers share on the platform, finding that many communities rely on alternative news press,\nlike Breitbart and GatewayPundit, for their daily discussions. In addition, we perform\nnetwork analysis on user interactions finding that many users prefer not to interact with\nsubverses outside their narrative interests, which could be helpful to researchers focusing on\npolarisation and echo chambers. Also, since Voat was one of the platforms banned Reddit\ncommunities migrated to, we are confident our dataset will motivate and assist researchers\nstudying deplatforming. Finally, many hateful and conspiratorial communities were very\npopular on Voat, which makes our work valuable for researchers focusing on toxicity, con-\nspiracy theories, cross-platform studies of social networks, and natural language processing.\n31\n3.1 Introduction\nSocial networks are a primary tool in today\u2019s society. They offer countless opportunities for\npeople around the world to connect in various ways, find jobs, entertain themselves, catch up\non world happenings, etc. At the same time, social networks sometimes offer a \u201csafe-house\u201d\nfor people that want, among other things, to connect to like-minded individuals towards\nsharing hate and toxicity [164, 195], discussing controversial matters [196], and spreading\nmisinformation and disinformation [197].\nMainstream social networks suffer from users and communities that organise these con-\nversations on their platforms. A common \u201csolution\u201d the administrators resort to is to ban\nthem\u2013 deplatforming . A social network that is known to have taken this action many times is\nReddit, which banned more than 7Ksubreddits [198] from its platform; the first one being\nin 2014 [199].\nResearch on deplatforming shows that users that had their communities banned met on\nforums and even got more toxic than what they used to be [200]. Other than forums, banned\nusers also move to social networks that allow controversial discussions. One of the platforms\nthat many banned Reddit communities decided to migrate to was Voat.\nVoat was a Reddit-esque social network founded in April 2014 and shut down in December\n2020 [24]. Similar to Reddit, discussions on Voat are divided into various channels\u2013 subverses \u2013\nthe equivalent of a subreddit. Users can subscribe to as many subverses they wish but\ncannot moderate more than ten to prevent users gaining undue influence on the platform.\nUser registration on Voat requires only a unique username and a password. Newcomers can\nupvote, downvote, and comment on existing submissions but cannot create new submissions\nunder subverses until they achieve a certain amount of upvotes on all of their comments.\nSince its foundation, Voat gradually gained popularity over its years of operation, es-\npecially after every Reddit cleansing [167, 201, 202, 203]. Overall, Voat is known for\nhosting banned extreme communities and users, providing a safe space for like-minded in-\ndividuals to share their ideas \u201cfreely.\u201d Voat has attracted the interest of researchers be-\nfore as it hosted communities like /v/fatpeoplehate, /v/CoonTown, and /v/N***** [204],\n/v/TheRedPill [205], /v/GreatAwakening [168], etc.\nData Release. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and\nmost complete dataset of Voat. We release a dataset [206] that consists of over 18.6Mposts\nfrom 113Kusers in 7Ksubverses over the lifetime of Voat (November 2013 - December\n2020). More specifically, our dataset is four fold as it contains the title, body, and metadata\nof submissions; content and metadata of comments; user profile data; and subverse profile\ndata.\nRelevance. Our dataset provides several opportunities to the research community. First,\nVoat was evidently the place many banned users and communities moved to after being\nbanned from other platforms [204, 207]. To this end, our dataset can assist researchers\n32\nthat focus on deplatforming and user migration. Also, our dataset may aid researchers\ndeepen our understanding on how and when these communities choose their new \u201chome\u201d\nafter a ban. Second, our dataset covers numerous offline events like the 2016 and 2020\nUS Presidential Elections and debates, Brexit, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s arrest, and various terrorist\nattacks and unrest around the world that can prove helpful in further analysis of these events.\nThird, since Voat was a supporter of online freedom of expression for extreme and hateful\ncommunities, it contains a variety of slang language and toxic content that can be useful\ntowards understanding hateful communities.\nChapter organisation. The rest of the chapter is organised as follows. First, we briefly\nexplain what Voat is and how it works in Section 3.2 before going through its history in\nSection 3.3. Then, we describe the process of parsing the data released by the Archive team\nat the Internet Archive Wayback Machine (IAWM) platform, along with the complimentary\ncollection of additional user and subverse data in Section 3.4. We then describe the structure\nof our dataset in Section 3.5 and provide a statistical analysis of the dataset (Section 3.6),\nfollowed by reviewing related work (Section 3.7). The chapter concludes with Section 3.8.\n3.2 What was Voat?\nVoat was a Reddit-esque news aggregator launched in April 2014. The mascot of Voat\nresembles an angry goat, which was designed and freely offered to the website by a user of\nthe site.\nSubverses. Discussions on Voat occur in specific groups of interests called \u201csubverses.\u201d\nUsers could create subverses on-demand before June 2020, when the administrators disabled\nthis functionality. When a user creates a subverse, they become its owner, hence having\ncomplete authority over the subverse: they can deactivate the subverse and appoint other\nco-owners and moderators. The moderators can delete submissions and comments posted\nby users and even ban users from posting on the subverse. The owners and moderators can\nalso allow users to post anonymously in their subverse, which replaces the posters\u2019 username\nwith a random multi-digit number; not unique to each user. To prevent users from gaining\nextreme influence on the platform, Voat limits the number of subverses one can own or\nmoderate.\nUsers. Voat proclaimed itself as a free-speech platform that offered its users anonymity.\nWhen newcomers register a new account, Voat does not require any personal details to verify\nthe account, like an email address or phone number. A user can insert a username and a\npassword to register, but if they forget their password, there is no way to recover the account.\nAfter registering a new account, users can subscribe to subverses of interest, comment,\nupvote, and downvote the comments and submissions but cannot post new submissions. To\npost a new submission, they first need to acquire ten Comment Contribution Points (CCP).\nTo do so, newcomers post comments on existing submissions trying to collect a net score\n33\nof ten upvotes on all of their comments (one downvote cancels one upvote). The privilege\nof posting submissions is not guaranteed as users may lose it if their CCP falls below ten.\nAlthough this functionality may discourage users from being toxic to each other, it might\nalso prevent users from debating their opinions as others may disagree and downvote them.\nVoat users often refer to themselves as \u201cgoats\u201d due to the platform\u2019s mascot.\nSubmissions and voting system. Voat was a news aggregator platform, hence users can\ncreate a new submission by posting a title and a description, accompanied by a link to a news\nsource, optionally. If the poster provides a link, the submission\u2019s title becomes a hyperlink\nto the source website. The domain of the source website appears next to the submission\u2019s\ntitle, along with the poster\u2019s username, and the date and time the submission was posted.\nSimilar to Reddit, Voat offers a hierarchical, tree-like commenting system: other users\ncan comment on the submission and the comments of other users. Users can upvote or\ndownvote the submission or other users\u2019 comments. In contrast with Reddit, Voat displays\nthe total number of upvotes and downvotes a submission or a comment received. Also, the\ndownvote functionality on Voat is not the same as Reddit\u2019s: downvoted submissions and\ncomments alert the moderators of spammy or illegal content so they can take action. This\nfunctionality enforces the establishment of echo chambers as users usually downvote content\nthat does not align with their beliefs. This usually results in the downvoted user to either\nlosing their submission posting privilege or even being banned from the subverse.\nContent visibility. Voat attempted to provide its users with some ephemerality without\ndeleting its content, but hiding it instead. Voat subverses filter submissions under three tabs,\nnamely, hot, new, and top. Each subverse has 500 active submissions in 20 pages (0 to 19).\nHot submissions are the ones that are currently active and discussed, new submissions are the\nones that were posted most recently, and top submissions are the most popular submissions\nof the subverse (many comments). Many subverses disabled the functionality of these tabs,\nand the submissions shown across all three tabs are often the same, just in a different order.\nWe note that our dataset does not contain the tab of submission\u2019s as tabs are merely filters\nand often change based on the status of the submission, e.g., from new to hot.\nWhen a user creates a new submission on a subverse, it would typically appear first on\nthe new tab on page 0. At the same time, the last submission of page 19 is archived but not\ndeleted, meaning if one knows the link to that submission they can still reach it but cannot\ncomment or vote it.\nVoat API. Voat supported a JSON API service for some time, but its maintenance stopped\nin October 2020. To collect the submissions of a subverse, one had to request the API of a\nspecific page number (0 to 19) of a subverse\u2019s tab. The response of the API would be the\n25 submissions of that page without their comments. To collect the comments, one needs to\nrequest them using the submission ID number, in which the API responds with 25 comments\nat a time.\nThus, to collect all the submissions from a subverse, one needs to request all 20 pages\n34\nfor the three tabs separately from the API. As explained by [168], the API does not list the\narchived subverses and does not respond to requests where the page is above 19. However,\nif one knows the submission ID and the subverse it was posted in, they can request the\nAPI for that specific submission. Since submission IDs on Voat are incremental, one could\ntheoretically collect all of Voat\u2019s submissions by requesting the API for each submission ID\nincrementally for more than 7.5K subverses; that is 7.5K requests, in the worst case, to\ncollect a single submission. To the best of our knowledge, no study or work managed to\ncollect the full Voat dataset.\nSearchVoat. A website not associated with Voat, named searchvoat.co, used to collect the\nVoat submissions and comments for its users to browsea. The site does not support an API\nand does not allow web scraping. After Voat shut down, the site became a news aggregator,\nsimilar to Voatb.\n3.3 Voat\u2019s Troubled History\nIn this section, we present Voat\u2019s history as we believe it highlights the significance of our\ndataset. WhoaVerse was the original name of the website and it was founded in April 2014.\nThe website was a hobby project of Atif Colo (Voat username @Atko). Justin Chastain later\njoined Colo as a co-founder (username @PuttItOut). The founders advertised the website as\nan alternative social network focusing on freedom of expression and speech, which satisfies\nits users\u2019 needs and wants. In December 2014, WhoaVerse changed its name to Voat and\nmarked its mascot as an angry goat.\nIn June 2015, after Reddit banned various hateful subreddits [167], including /r/n*****\nand /r/fatpeoplehate, many Reddit users started registering accounts on Voat. The sudden\ninflux of users overloaded the site, causing temporary down time [208].\nOn June 19, 2015, Voat\u2019s web hosting service, Host Europec, canceled Voat\u2019s contract\nclaiming that the site is publicising abusive, insulting, youth-endangering content, along\nwith illegal right-wing extremist content [209]. Some days later, PayPal froze Voat\u2019s pay-\nment processing services [210]. In response, Voat shut down four subverses, two of which\nhosted sexualised images of minors and the founders attributed the shutdown to political\ncorrectness [211]. The site moved to a different hosting provider and started accepting cryp-\ntocurrency donations.\nIn July 2015, Reddit banned a popular administrator that caused another influx of Red-\ndit members registering with Voat, leading to more downtime. In an interview, Colo said\nthat they \u201cprovide an alternative platform where users would not be censored and still say\nwhatever they want\u201d [212]. Voat was the target of DDoS attacks many times and experienced\nahttps://searchvoat.co/search.php\nbhttps://searchvoat.co/forum/\nchttps://www.hosteurope.de/en/\n35\nnumerous failures during its six years of operation. The most significant attack was in July\n2015 [213]. Voat, Inc. became a registered corporation in the US in August 2015. Although\nVoat was based in Switzerland, the U.S. seemed like the best option as explained by Colo\nin a post: \u201cUS law with regards to free speech, by far beats every other candidate country\nwe\u2019ve researched.\u201d\nIn November 2016, more users relocated to Voat after Reddit banned the /r/pizzagate\nconspiracy theory subreddit [201]. In January 2017, Colo resigned as CEO of Voat due\nto time availability restrictions and was replaced by Chastain. Chastain ran a fundraiser\ncampaign in May 2017 after announcing that Voat might have to shut down due to financial\nissues; Voat managed to stay online.\nIn November 2017, Reddit banned its incel community (/r/incel), and many of its fol-\nlowers reportedly moved to Voat [202]. About a year later, on September 12, 2018, Reddit\nbanned numerous subreddits dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which again caused\nmany QAnon adherents to migrate to Voat [168].\nIn April 2019, Voat\u2019s CEO Chastain asked Voat users to stop threatening people as he\nhad been contacted by a \u201cUS agency\u201d about the threats posted on the websited. In response,\nVoat users were not pleased to hear that Voat was working with agencies to remove Voat\ncontent and \u201climiting\u201d the site\u2019s freedom of expression. Specifically, the first comment on\nthe submission was an anti-Semitic slur, calling for the extermination of Jews [214].\nFinally, on December 22, 2020, Voat announced again, now for the last time, that it\nwould shut down due to lack of fundinge. Chastain explained that he had been funding the\nsite himself since March 2020 but had run out of money. On December 25, 2020, Voat shut\ndown and its last submission was posted by Chastain, noting: \u201c@Atko made the first post\nto Voat, so I am making the last\u201df.\nIn Table 3.1, we list some aforementioned Reddit bans that probably affected Voat\u2019s\nactivity. Some of these bans previously captured researchers\u2019 interest. We use these bans in\nour analysis in Section 3.6 to show whether Voat\u2019s activity was indeed affected.\n3.4 Data Parsing and Data Collection\nThis section details the methodology and tools employed for our data collection infrastruc-\nture.\nSubmissions and Comments . Following Voat\u2019s shutdown on December 25, 2020, the\nArchive Teamgreleased a set of Voat snapshot captures in Web ARChive (WARC) for-\ndhttps://searchvoat.co/v/Voat/3178819\nehttps://searchvoat.co/v/announcements/4169936\nfhttps://searchvoat.co/v/Voat/4174956\ngFor more details about the Archive team, see wiki.archiveteam.org\n36\nNo Date Ban\n1 May 9, 2014 /r/beatingwomen [215]\n2 Sep 6, 2014 /r/TheFappening [215]\n3 May 7, 2015 /r/n***** [204]\n4 Jun 6, 2015 /r/fatpeoplehate [204]\n5 Nov 23, 2016 /r/pizzagate [201]\n6 Nov 7, 2017 /r/incel [202]\n7 Mar 15, 2018 /r/CBTS_Stream [203]\n8 Sep 18, 2018 /r/GreatAwakening [168]\nTable 3.1: Reddit bans that reportedly affected Voat\u2019s activity.\nCount # Users # Subverses\nSubmissions 2,334,817 80,063 7,616\nComments 15,731,754 153,827 7,515\nSubverses 7,094\nUsers 108,451\nTable 3.2: Number of submissions, comments, user profiles, and subverse profiles in the\nIAWM dataset.\nmat [216], hosted on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine (IAWM). These WARC cap-\ntures include snapshots the IAWM captured over the lifetime of Voat. A WARC format\nfile consists of single or multiple WARC records (snapshots), and it supports, among other\nthings, the access and scraping of archived data. The files also hold revised and duplicated\nsnapshots [217].\nTo parse these snapshots into structured data, we set up a Python script to parse the\nsubmissions and comments. In our case, every WARC file is a collection of various Voat\nsnapshots the IAWM captured. To facilitate the smooth parsing of the WARC files, we\nused the warcio Python libraryh. This library offers a convenient and reliable way to read\na WARC file by streaming every entry included in the file and automatically detecting the\npayload . The payload contains the capture itself, i.e., the HTML DOM tree code of the\nplatform. Each WARC file includes the snapshot of the entire platform for a specific time\nand date, that is, thousands of submission pages for millions of submissions.\nhhttps://pypi.org/project/warcio/\nSubmissions Comments Users Subverses\nTotal 2,380,262 16,263,309 113,431 7,095\nTable 3.3: Released dataset.\n37\nOur parser captured the HTML DOM tree code of each page included in the WARC\nfiles serially. Then, it passed the HTML DOM tree to a function that uses the beautifulsoup\nPython library to read and store in JSON format the data and metadata of the submissions\nand comments, i.e., submission title and content, number of upvotes and downvotes, com-\nments, etci. We ensure that our parser only stores the latest submission version, as WARC\nfiles have duplicate data.\nWe note that although many languages appear in our dataset, the overwhelming majority\nof posts use the English language. In addition, our parser does not capture or store any visual\nmedia, like videos and pictures, since such files are not included in the snapshots. Hence,\nour dataset is not suitable for researchers focusing on visual media analysis.\nUser and subverse profiles. To complement our dataset, we also collected user and\nsubverse profiles. A user profile includes data like username and registration date, whereas a\nsubverse profile consists of data like subverse creation date, description, etc. To collect this\ndata, we built a crawler using the IAWM APIj, beautifulsoup, and HTML requestsk.\nEvery user and subverse profile URL is unique, but they all start the same way: voat.co/u\nfor the former and voat.co/v for the latter. First, we requested the IAWM API for all the\nsnapshots whose URLs start like user or subverse URLs. We then collected the responses\nand parse them into JSON format, storing the latest snapshot the IAWM has in its database\nfor every unique username and subverse profile URL.\nThe above process results in the dataset summarised in Table 3.2. We collected a dataset\nthat consists of more than 2.3Msubmissions posted by 80Kusers in 7.6Ksubverses, and\nover15.7Mcomments posted by almost 154Kusers. Note that IAWM does not have the\nprofiles of about 500 subverses and hence we only manage to collect the profiles of 7.1K\nsubverses ( 6.8%loss). In addition, we collected almost 108.5Kunique user profiles.\nData collected via Voat API. In an attempt to complete our dataset, we merged it with\nthe data collected for the [168] study. For that study, we collected 176Ksubmissions and\n1.45Mcomments posted from 28Kusers in 241subverses. Our data collection infrastructure\nused Voat\u2019s API between May 2020 and October 2020, when Voat stopped the maintenance\nof its API. We found 45.5Ksubmissions and 532Kcomments that were missing from the\nIAWM archive and incorporated them in the released dataset.\nSome subverses on Voat offered anonymity to their users by replacing their username\nwith a random eight-digit number (not a unique number for every user). The total number\nof users that commented or posted a submission (Table 3.2) does not include anonymous\nor deleted users. Hence, we assume that Voat\u2019s known user base is 155Kusers, at least,\nbased on the data we collected from the IAWM. It is impossible to know the exact Voat\nuser base since Voat never shared the complete list of user profiles, even when it supported\nihttps://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/\njhttps://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/\nkhttps://pypi.org/project/requests-html/\n38\na data API service; to collect a user\u2019s profile, one needs to know the username. This means\nthat we cannot acquire user profile data of \u201clurkers.\u201d Assuming the total known number of\nusernames is 155K, we estimate that about 27.1%of the total users\u2019 profile data ( 41.6K)\nis either missing, or deleted profiles. However, [168] show that 13% of the 15Kusers being\nactive in QAnon discussions deleted their profiles. Considering that many usernames were\ndeleted every day on Voat, we estimate that this dataset offers the best representation of\nVoat\u2019s user base to date. Incorporating [168] user data with ours, we found 5Kadditional\nuser and 1subverse profiles. The final dataset presented and released with this work is\ndetailed in Table 3.3.\nFair Principles. The data released and presented in this chapter aligns with the FAIR\nguiding principles for scientific data, as described belowl:\n\u2022Findable : We assign a unique constant digital object identifier (DOI) to our dataset[206]m.\n\u2022Accessible : Our dataset is openly accessible.\n\u2022Interoperable : We use JSON format to store our dataset since it is widely used for\nstoring data and can be used in various programming languages. We also provide a\ndetailed description of our dataset\u2019s format in Section 3.5.\n\u2022Reusable : We provide all the available metadata along with our dataset and we exten-\nsively document them in this chapter, in Section 3.5.\nEthical Considerations. The data collected, presented, and released with this chapter\nare available on the Wayback Machine and also used to be accessible (without the need of a\nregistered account) on Voat before it went down. The collection and release of this dataset\ndoes not violate Voat\u2019s or Wayback Machine\u2019s Terms of Service. Although some subverses\non Voat allowed users to post anonymously, the overwhelming majority did not offer this\nfunctionality. Hence, we collect user profile data of 114Kusers. The only identification of\nthese user profiles is the unique pseudo name, which is not personally identifiable information.\nAnalysis of the activity generated on Voat to other services could potentially be used to de-\nanonymise users. We note that we followed standard ethical guidelines [218] and made no\nattempt to de-anonymise users.\n3.5 Data Description\nWe now present the structure of our dataset, available at [206].\nOur dataset consists of submission, comment, user profile, and subverse profile data. We\nrelease our data in various newline-delimited JSON files ( .ndjson )n. Each line in a .ndjson\nfile consists of a JSON object that holds various keys and values. Specifically, we release\n7,616.ndjson files, one for every subverse, that hold the submission data. Similarly, we\nlhttps://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\nm10.5281/zenodo.5841668\nnhttp://ndjson.org/\n39\nrelease 7,515.ndjson files that have comment data. We inspect our dataset for the missing\n101subverses\u2019 comments and find that these subverses have no comment activity, only a\nsmall number of submissions. Also, a single .ndjson file is released for user profile data, and\nanother for subverse profile data. In total, we release 15,133.ndjson files. Table 3.4 lists\nthe keys, value data type, and description of our dataset files.\nWe choose to release the submission and comment data separately for every subverse as\nwe believe it facilitates researchers that want to focus on specific communities.\nWe also use JSON to release our dataset as it is among the most optimal ways to store and\nshare data as it has extensive documentation and is supported by all popular programming\nlanguages.\nKey\nValue data type Description Key\nValue data type Description\nsub\nverse_name_submissions.ndjson (7,616 files) subverse_name_comments.ndjson (7,515 files)\ntitle\nstring Submission\u2019s title body\nstring Comment content\nbody string Submission\u2019s content user\nstring Poster\u2019s username\nuser string Poster\u2019s username time\nstring Time of comment\ntime string Time of submission date\nstring Date of comment\ndate string Date of submission upvotes\ninteger Number of upvotes\nupvotes integer Number of upvotes downvotes\ninteger Number of downvotes\ndownvotes integer Number of downvotes comment_id\ninteger Comment ID\ndomain string Linked domain depth\ninteger Depth level\nlink string Submission\u2019s URL subverse\nstring Subverse\u2019s name\nsubmission_id integer Submission\u2019s ID root_submissi\non integer Parent submission ID\nsubverse string Subverse\u2019s name\nuser_profiles.ndjson\n(1 file) subverse_profiles.ndjson (1 file)\nuser\nstring Username subverse\nstring Subverse\u2019s name\nreg_date string Registration date subscriber_co\nunt integer Subscriber count\nmoderates list of strings Moderated subverses about\nstring Subverse\u2019s description\nowns list of strings Created subverses date_created\nstring Subverse\u2019s creation date\nTable 3.4: Description of the keys and data value types.\n3.6 Data Analysis\nIn this Section we provide statistical analysis and visualisation of our dataset.\nPosting Activity. First, we show the overall posting activity on Voat. Figure 3.1 shows\nthe number of submissions and comments per day on the platform. The vertical red dotted\nlines represent the events listed in Table 3.1. Although the platform was officially launched\nin April 2014, the first-ever submission was posted by @Atko on November 8, 2013, on the\n/v/voatdev subverse, that focused on the development of Voat, and at the time, only seven\nusers were posting.\nThe total number of submissions in 2013 is only 61. These submissions primarily include\ndiscussions between @Atko and @PuttItOut in the /v/voatdev subverse. When the platform\nwas launched in 2014, the total number of submissions peaks to 5,268, then 276Kin 2015,\n40\n08-201311-201302-201405-201408-201411-201402-201505-201508-201511-201502-201605-201608-201611-201602-201705-201708-201711-201702-201805-201808-201811-201802-201905-201908-201911-201902-202005-202008-202011-202002-202105-202110100100010000# of posts12 34 5 6 7 8\nVoat shuts downSubmissions\nCommentsFigure 3.1: Number of all submissions and comments per day on Voat.

Overall, there was no significant increase in activity on the platform after\n2016.\nThe most active day on the site is July 10, 2015, with 5.5Ksubmissions. Manual in-\nspection of our dataset indicates that discussions on that day focuses on Donald Trump,\nvaccine legislation, Reddit\u2019s CEO Ellen Pao resigning, and other world happenings. This\ndate is very close to the date Reddit banned hateful communities like /r/fatpeoplehate and\n/r/n***** [167]. Shortly after Reddit banned these communities, Voat experienced heavy\ntraffic and downtime [219].\nRegarding comment activity, only 99comments were posted in 2013, 13Kin 2014, 1.6M\nin 2015, 1.8Min 2016, 2.1Min 2017, 2.4Min 2018, 3.8Min 2019, and 3.3Min 2020 Again,\nthe date with the most comments on the platform is July 10, 2015, with 37.5Kcomments.\nIn addition, we show the overall activity on Voat in the top ten most subscribed subverses,\nnamely, /v/AskVoat, /v/GreatAwakening, /v/QRV, /v/fatpeoplehate, /v/funny, /v/news,\n/v/politics, /v/theawakening, /v/videos, and /v/whatever, in Figure 3.2. We present this\nanalysis to show how active the most popular subverses on Voat were, since we believe that\nresearchers interested in our dataset might consider these findings useful. The vertical red\ndotted lines on the figure indicate the bans listed in Table 3.1. When the Reddit refugee\ncrowd joined Voat (ban number 1, 3 and 4 from Table 3.1) many general discussion subverses\nlike /v/AskVoat, /v/news, /v/politics, /v/videos, /v/funny, and /v/whatever became more\nactive, indicating that this new influx of users bolstered the overall activity on the platform.\nInterestingly, not all banned subreddits appeared on Voat shortly after a Reddit ban\nfrenzy. The subverse /v/GreatAwakening was created on January 1, 2018, nine months\nbefore Reddit banned QAnon subreddits (ban no. 8). This subverse was the 10th most\npopular subverse when Voat shut down.\nQAnon discussion on the platform boomed when /v/theawakening and /v/QRV first\n41\n09-201312-201303-201406-201409-201412-201403-201506-201509-201512-201503-201606-201609-201612-201603-201706-201709-201712-201703-201806-201809-201812-201803-201906-201909-201912-201903-202006-202009-202012-202003-202110100# of submissions12 34 5 6 7 8\nVoat shuts downv/AskVoat\nv/GreatAwakening\nv/QRV\nv/fatpeoplehatev/funny\nv/news\nv/politicsv/theawakening\nv/videos\nv/whatever(a) Submissions\n09-201312-201303-201406-201409-201412-201403-201506-201509-201512-201503-201606-201609-201612-201603-201706-201709-201712-201703-201806-201809-201812-201803-201906-201909-201912-201903-202006-202009-202012-202003-2021101001000# of comments12 34 5 6 7 8\nVoat shuts downv/AskVoat\nv/GreatAwakening\nv/QRV\nv/fatpeoplehatev/funny\nv/news\nv/politicsv/theawakening\nv/videos\nv/whatever\n(b) Comments\nFigure 3.2: Seven day average number of a) submissions and b) comments per day on the top\n10 most subscribed subverses on Voat.

These three subverses turned out to be among\nthe top 5 most active subverses on the platform, with /v/QRV being the most active in both\ndaily submissions and comments on the whole Voat, within only ten days after being banned\nfrom Reddit [220].\nThe figures discussed in this subsection support the reports that Voat was among the\nmain hubs for Reddit migrating communities. In addition, Figure 3.2 shows that other\nthan general discussion subverses, the most subscribed subverses focused on hate speech\n(/v/fatpeoplehate) and conspiracy theories (/v/QRV, /v/theawakening, /v/TheGreatAwakening).\nSubmission Engagement.

In Figure 3.4 we plot the number of daily user\nand subverse registrations. The vertical dotted lines indicate bursty periods detected using\nKleinberg\u2019s burst detection algorithm [221]. Kleinberg\u2019s algorithm models a time-series as\nan automaton, switching between two states: q0, where events take place at a slow rate, and\nq1, with events happening at a faster rate. By looking at the rate of events taking place at\neach time period, Kleinberg defines a cost function that the time-series needs to reach to\nmove up to the state q1.\nWe first define the baseline probability of an event taking place as p0=R\nD, where Ris\n43\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021100101102103# of subverses/usersUsers\nSubversesFigure 3.4: Number of users and subverses registered per day.

The green\ndashed lines indicate bursty periods within the user registration curve, computed using the\nKleinberg\u2019s burst detection algorithm\nthe number of events taking place at a specific time, and Dis the total number of events\nin the time-series. The probability of the bursty state is defined as p1=s\u00b7p0, where sis a\ncoefficient indicating how high the rate of events needs to be to enter a bursty state.\nThe cost of transitioning from state q0andq1is defined as the sum of the goodness-of-fit\nbetween the observed proportion and the expected probability of each state, which we sum\nwith the transition cost defined as\n\u03c4=\u03b3\u00b7n (3.1)\nWhere \u03b3represents the difficulty of transitioning into higher states, nis the number of\ntime points.\nThe bursty points are shown on Figure 3.4, when we set s= 3and\u03b3= 2. We notice that\nmost of the bursty periods strongly match with the days when major subreddits were banned\nfrom Reddit. More precisely, there are three bursty points in 2015, on May the 9th, June\nthe 11th and July the 7th. The first date matches with the ban date of /r/n*****, whereas\nthe two others closely follow the time when /r/fatpeoplehate was banned from Reddit. Also,\nduring the summer of 2015, Reddit changed their free speech and content policy [222 ] and\nthe founder noted that \u201cReddit was not created to be a bastion of free speech.\u201d\nLater on, the identified bursty peaks on November 23, 2016 and September 13, 2018,\nare strongly related with the dates when /r/pizzagate and /r/CBTS_Stream were banned,\nalthough we notice that users from /r/CBTS_Stream migrated to Voat shortly before they\nwere banned from Reddit. This was prompted by the ban of other QAnon-related subreddits,\n44\nmost notably when r/GreatAwakening was banned on September 12, 2018.\nWhile the peaks in registration overlap with significant bans that took place on Reddit,\nour analysis does not provide a glimpse of the velocity that one can observe when looking\nat singular deplatforming events. To fill this gap, we performed an Event Study Analysis\n(ESA), a statistical tool allowing us to compare the number of registrations that Voat ex-\nperienced on the days prior and leading to a subreddit being deplatformed to an expected\nbaseline. To do so, for four specific bans that took place on Reddit (namely /r/fatpeoplehate,\n/r/CBTS_Stream, /r/incel and /r/GreatAwakening), we compute the average number of\nregistrations that took place on Voat in the two months prior to the ban as our historical\nbaseline, and we compare this average to the number of daily registrations in the two weeks\nbefore and after the ban. The number of abnormal registrations therefore correspond to the\ndifference between the observed number of registrations and the historical baseline.\nAs shown on Figure 3.5, the velocity of the platform migration is especially noticeable\nwhen looking at /r/fatpeoplehate and /r/incel, where the spike of abnormal registrations\ntakes place in the four days following the ban, before plateauing at a lower level. This\nfurther suggests that, at a time when Voat was not yet known as a haven for banned Reddit\ncommunities, users would gradually join Voat after the ban took place. Interestingly, when\nlooking at both QAnon related subreddits (/r/CBTS_Stream and /r/GreatAwakening), we\nnotice that the number of abnormal registrations also increases in the days before the ban is\nenforced, indicating that the communities were anticipating to be deplatformed from Reddit.\nThe influx of new users sharply decreases right after the ban, indicating a higher level of\ncoordination in the collective migration than for /r/fatpeoplehate and /r/incel.\nThis analysis provides a glance at Voat\u2019s user base and subverse changes over the years.\nIt is apparent that Reddit influenced Voat\u2019s activity and that the platform was among the\npreferred Reddit alternatives for banned users.\nLinks. Since Voat is a news aggregator platform, we analyse the domains the users posted\non the site to show what kind of content the userbase of Voat consumed.\nFor each submission that redirects users to other domains, we retrieve the name of the\nsubverse the submission is posted in, and the external link it redirects to. We count how\nmany times a domain is shared in a community, keeping only the subverse and domain pairs\nthat are the most recurrent in the dataset. Figure 3.6 displays an alluvial diagram showing,\non the left, the considered subverses and, on the right, the top web domains shared on this\nsubverse.\nMost of the links that redirect users to Reddit were posted in /v/MeanwhileOnReddit.\nThe subverse focusing on body-shaming, /v/fatpeoplehate, redirected users to Instagram,\nYouTube, and image sharing services (websites where users can upload images and share\nthe link on other platforms). The /v/news subverse linked YouTube, Voat, online press\noutlets, and archiving services links. It is known that users in fringe communities avoid\nsharing the direct link to a website and prefer an archive link instead to avoid monetising\n45\n15\n 10\n 5\n 0 5 10 150500100015002000Abnormal Registrationsr/fatpeoplehate\n15\n 10\n 5\n 0 5 10 15050100150200250300350r/CBTS_Stream\n15\n 10\n 5\n 0 5 10 15\nDays from Event02004006008001000Abnormal Registrationsr/incel\n15\n 10\n 5\n 0 5 10 15\nDays from Event025050075010001250150017502000r/GreatAwakeningFigure 3.5: Number of abnormal registrations that took place on Voat in the lead-up to four\nmajor bans on Reddit (/r/pizzagate, /r/CBTS_Stream, /r/incel and /r/GreatAwakening).\nThe number of abnormal registrations was computed using the Event Study Analysis frame-\nwork, with a considered baseline of two months before the ban. The gray line represents the\nhistorical average of bans in the two-months period.\nthe website [223]. The majority of the alternative news links (Breitbart, GatewayPundit,\nand Zero Hedge) are posted on /v/news and /v/WorldToday. Most of the Twitter links on\nthe website were posted in /v/QRV and /v/GreatAwakening. Most of the tweets include\nDonald Trump\u2019s tweets and other political discussions on Twitter (now X).\nOverall, Voat users shared links to other social networks like Twitter and Instagram.\nNews on the website was shared via legitimate online press outlets and other alternative\nnews outlets, along with archiving services links. Most of the images on the platform were\nshared on /v/funny, /v/fatpeoplehate, and /v/whatever.\nUser Interactions. We now take a deep look into Voat\u2019s user ecosystem. We attempt to\nshow how users form clusters based on the subverses they most often engaged with (posted\na submission or a comment) to show whether the userbase of Voat is homogeneous or not.\nFurther analysis on Voat\u2019s user base may shed light on what content users prefer to see on\nVoat and whether most Voat\u2019s subverses focused on hateful and politically incorrect content.\nAs shown in [30, 168], some users are responsible for a large amount of content being\nshared in some communities, leading to imbalances, influencing the content users consume\non the platform. By analysing each user\u2019s interactions on Voat, we hope to obverse how\nall these various communities blended after a mass migration from Reddit, or if Voat was\n46\nFigure 3.6: Alluvial diagram, displaying the top domain - subverse pairs on Voat. The width\nof the link indicates how many times the domain was shared on the subverse.\nnothing more than an aggregate of small, selective echo chambers.\nIn Figure 3.7 we plot a graph network where nodes represent users, and the edges sym-\nbolise their interactions. For example, users are linked together if they participated in the\nsame conversation, i.e., they both commented on the same submission, or one of them is the\nsubmitter while the other commented. The weight of the edge is given by the number of\ninteractions shared by the two users, and the colour represents the subverse where the user\nparticipated the most.\n47\nFigure 3.7: User and subverse interaction ecosystem.\nThe network is composed of a giant cluster, where most subverses are mixed together.\nThis cluster includes /v/politics, /v/news, and /v/whatever, which is expected since these\nare general discussion subverses, and it is likely that many users meet there for general\ndiscussion. However, some subverses are strongly isolated in the network. For example,\nthe /v/NeoFAG (yellow) community shows that most users tend to only engage within that\nsubverse. Similarly, /v/GreatAwakening (red) and /v/theawakening (dark blue) seem to be\nclustered together and somewhat interacting with /v/pizzagate (dark green). Some users\nthat engage with these three subverses also engage in the general discussion subverses, which\nis aligned with the findings of [168]. Last, /v/fatpeoplehate (brown) users also seem to form\n48\nSub\nverse EI-Homophily Index\np\nolitics 0.50\nnews 0.40\nwhatever 0.23\ntheawakening 0.01\nGreatAwakening -0.25\npizzagate -0.49\nfatpeoplehate -0.61\nNeoFAG -0.74\nTable 3.5: Average homophily index between subverses and members.\ntheir own cluster while infiltrating the general discussion subverses.\nTo measure the homophily of these communities, we used the EIhomophily index, which\nis a metric that indicates how many members of a network favour in\u2013group interactions rather\nthan out\u2013group ones. Given a specific node with Eexternal edges, i.e., edges with nodes\nfrom the out\u2013group, and Iinternal edges, i.e., edges with nodes from the in\u2013group, the EI\nhomophily index is given by the equation EI= (E\u2212I)/(E+I).\nAn index EI= +1 indicates that the node only interacts with members of the out\u2013group,\nwhereas EI=\u22121applies to nodes that only interact within their in\u2013group. Table 3.5 lists\nthe average EIhomophily index of the members of the subverses highlighted in the legend\nof Figure 3.7.\nUsers who are very active on subverses like /v/politics and /v/news have a high average\nEIhomophily index, meaning they mostly interact with users from the out\u2013group. The\nopposite can be said for the /v/theawakening, /v/GreatAwakening, /v/pizzagate, and espe-\ncially, /v/NeoFAG and /v/fatpeoplehate. These communities do not converse much outside\ntheir social group. The EIindex is almost zero for /v/theawakening, meaning its users\ninteract as much with the out\u2013group as with the in\u2013group. By looking at the community,\nthis can be explained by the fact that users from the communities gravitating around the\nQAnon narrative, i.e., /v/theawakening, and /v/GreatAwakening, are more connected than\nother communities. As a result, the external edges can be nothing more than crossovers\nbetween these two subverses. The userbases of /v/NeoFAG and /v/fatpeoplehate seem to\nbe the ones that only prefer to interact with members of their community.\nThe isolation of a few communities on Voat can further be described by looking at the\ndistribution of the EI-Homophily index within a subverse, as shown on Figure 3.8. As\nexpected, we notice that the communities that are isolated in the interaction network also\nhave a distribution skewed towards negative values. On the other side, most of the subverses\n49\npeak at positive values of the EI-Homophily index, indicating that they belong to the giant\ncomponent of the network.\n1.5\n 1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\nHomophily0246810pdfv/GreatAwakening\nv/NeoFAG\nv/fatpeoplehatev/pizzagate\nv/theawakening\nFigure 3.8: Distribution of the EI-Homophily index within subverses on Voat. Some of the\nsubverses are highlighted in colour, whereas the others are plotted in gray.\nWe present this analysis to motivate researchers studying user interactions and echo\nchambers. Further research using our dataset may shed light on whether Voat was a bas-\ntion of echo chambers or not, along with what narratives users within these communities\nexchanged.\n3.7 Related Work\nIn this section, we present existing work focusing on Voat, and other dataset papers similar\nto ours. Voat attracted the interest of researchers over the past years, especially after Reddit\nstarted banning communities in 2015. Although some studies mention that their dataset is\navailable upon request, these datasets only include data from a couple of subverses that cover\na short period of time. To the best of our knowledge, our Voat dataset is: 1) the only one to\nbe openly and publicly available online; and 2) the most complete and largest one, covering\nthe whole history of Voat, along with data of the users that ever posted a submission or a\ncomment on the platform.\nVoat research. [224] collect data from various platforms, including Voat and Reddit and\nperform computational analysis to identify the primary motivations that drive users to move\nto other platforms. [204] collect data from 4chan, Reddit, MetaFilter, and Voat and build a\nmodel to detect abusive content online. Subverses used in this work include /v/CoonTown,\n50\n/v/N*****, and /v/fatpeoplehate, all focused on hate towards individuals of specific body or\nrace characteristics, created on Voat shortly after the 2015 Reddit bans [167]. Similarly, [205]\ncollect data from Reddit, Voat, and three online forums to train a classifier that detects\nhateful speech. Their Voat dataset includes data from /v/CoonTown, /v/fatpeoplehate, and\n/v/TheRedPill. A study on deepfakes finds that pornographic deepfakes are mainly created\nfor circulation within the community [225]. The study uses data from Voat\u2019s /v/DeepFake\nand the site mrdeepfakes.com, which both were created after Reddit banned the subreddit\n/r/DeepFakes in 2018 [226].\n[227] compare the features of 872K comments from /v/politics, /v/television, and /v/travel,\nto Reddit and 4chan comments building a classifier that predicts the origin of the comments\nbased on its style and content. [ 168] collect 0.5M posts from /v/GreatAwakening, /v/news,\n/v/politics, /v/funny, and /v/AskVoat to provide an empirical exploratory analysis of the\nQAnon community on Voat. They find, among other things, that /v/GreatAwakening is not\nas toxic as the general discussion subverses. Finally, [169] compare Voat\u2019s /v/GreatAwakening\nand /v/news posts to 4chan, 8kun, Reddit, and Q drops (posts posted by \u201cQ,\u201d the master-\nmind behind the QAnon conspiracy theory) on a large scale study on QAnon. They find\nthat Voat posts are as threatening as Q drops and that content creators on Reddit and Voat\nonly consist of a small portion of the total community.\nOther datasets. One of the largest Reddit datasets is the one of [228], which presents\nan archiving platform that collects Reddit data and makes them available to researchers\nsince 2015. The same platform also published over 27.8K channels and 317M messages from\n2.2M users from Telegram [229]. [77] release a dataset of 37M posts, 24.5M comments, and\n819K user profiles collected from Gab. [230] published a dataset consisting of 183M posts and\n13.25M user profiles from Parler, a Twitter (now X) alternative. Last, [207] present a dataset\nwith over 3.3M threads and 134.5M posts from the Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) of the\nimageboard forum 4chan.\n3.8 Conclusion\nIn this work, we present and release a Voat dataset comprising more than 2.38Msubmissions\nand16.2Mcomments posted from 113Kusers in over 7KVoat subverses. We combine data\ncollected from Voat API and IAWM released archives to complete the dataset to the best\nof our ability. Voat shut down on December 25, 2020, and its data are now otherwise\ninaccessible. In this work we also perform a preliminary analysis of the released dataset so\nresearchers interested in it can know what to expect.\nOverall, we hope this work further motivates and assists researchers focusing on deplat-\nforming and how users organise migrations to other platfroms. In addition, our dataset\ncould also help answer numerous questions about how \u201cfree\u2013speech\u201d sites operate, e.g., do\nmoderators ban users that express opinions other than the ones aligned with the narra-\ntives of a subverse? How do users vote and how toxic are they towards such content? Do\n51\nsites like these incentivise users to form echo chambers? What kind of content do users\nin these communities consume, etc.? Also, our dataset could assist multi\u2013platform studies\nto understand similarities and differences of different communities. Last, since Voat was a\nbastion of free-speech, we are confident that access to our dataset could assist researchers\ntowards training algorithms in natural language processing and detecting hate speech, fake\nnews dissemination, conspiracy theories, etc. Finally, other than quantitative work, we hope\nthat the data can also be used in qualitative studies of specific events, social theories, and\ncommunities.\n52\nChapter 4\nThe Systemic Impact of Deplatforming\non Social Media\nIntroduction\nVoat\u2019s case study in the previous chapter highlights the velocity at which communities mi-\ngrate to an alternative platform, after being banned from established social media outlets.\nThis resilience against deplatforming policies raises a few questions related to the efficiency\nof such interventions from social media administrations. Not only does it indicate that com-\nmunities can seamlessly regroup on free speech-friendly platforms, but alt-tech platforms are\nweakly regulated and poorly monitored, with evidence to suggest that they allow violent\nnarratives to develop and thrive [231, 232, 233, 234,235, 236, 237].\nIn this chapter, we present a unique dataset which further enhances our understanding\nof online collective displacements, focusing on a matched cohort of users who migrated from\nTwitter to Gettr, a Twitter-clone that has attracted many of Twitter\u2019s most high-profile\nsuspended accounts including US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor-Greene, media executive\nSteve Bannon, and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Unlike Voat, Gettr leveraged a roster\nof influencers within the Republican sphere in the US and in Brazil, and has become an\nattractive online outlet.\nOur dataset presents the near-complete evolution of Gettr from its founding in July 2021\nto May 2022 including 15M posts from 785,360 active users who have posted at least once. Of\nthese users, 6,152 are verified, 1,588 of which self-declare as active on Twitter (see Methods).\nFor these 1,588 self-declared Twitter users with a verified Gettr account, we download their\nTwitter timeline from July 2021 to May 2022 totalling 12M tweets and retweets. These users\nrepresent the \u201c matched \u201d cohort, with analysis of their Gettr posts (Twitter tweets) referred to\nas \u201cmatched Gettr \u201d (\u201cmatched Twitter \u201d) below. A manual check of these accounts confirms\nthat 95% of matches across the two platforms are accurate, corresponding to the same\n53\nindividual or organisation (see Appendix). For the remaining verified Gettr users, we use\nthe Twitter API to identify those accounts which have been suspended from the platform,\nassuming accounts share the same username on both platforms, totalling 454 accounts who\nconstitute the \u201c banned \u201d cohort. Finally, all remaining users who are not verified on Gettr\nare part of the \u201c non-verified \u201d cohort.\nIn the remainder of the chapter, we will overview account activity and retention on Gettr,\nshowing that the banned cohort are 5 times more active than the matched cohort. Despite\nthis, our results will show that these two cohorts are structurally mixed on Gettr, sharing the\nsame politically homogenous audience and posting similar content. Using matched cohort\ntweets, we will show that Gettr is generally representative of the US far-right, and that\nmatched users are more toxic on Twitter than they are on Gettr. We find little evidence\nto support the view that users become more toxic as a result of their extended use of the\nfringe platform. Finally, we will highlight how Gettr had a global impact, outlining the\nstructural changes in the Portuguese-language Gettr network that emerged in the run up to\nthe January 2023 riots in Brazil.\nResults\nUser acquisition and activity\nWe start by analysing how the three cohorts of \u201cmatched Gettr\u201d, \u201cbanned\u201d and \u201cnon-verified\u201d\nusers joined Gettr. Figure 4.1A shows that user registrations were largely steady over\ntime with two exceptions where registrations peaked: (i) July 2021 when the platform was\nfounded, and (ii) January 2022 after the suspension of Marjorie Taylor-Greene and Robert\nMalone on Twitter [238], and following the announcement by Joe Rogan that he would be\nopening a Gettr account [239].\nIn Figure 4.1B, we show the fraction of accounts from each cohort who are active on any\ngiven day. For the matched cohort, we present their activity on both Gettr and Twitter.\nFocusing on the non-verified cohort, we see that a growing user base does not correlate with\nthe growth of an engaged community, with, on average, 4% of the non-verified cohort active\non any given day. On Gettr, 10% of the matched cohort are active on average, likely exceeding\nthe value for the non-verified cohort because verified social media users are typically more\nactive than other users [240]. However, on Twitter the matched cohort are significantly\nmore active with 69% of accounts active any given day. The activity of the matched cohort\non Twitter is stable, with no evidence of a reduction in activity following the January 2022\nsuspensions. For the banned cohort on Gettr, activity approaches the baseline of the matched\ncohort on Twitter, with 53% active daily, 5-times larger than for the matched cohort on Gettr,\nand 13-times larger than the non-verified cohort. These results are qualitatively robust if\nwe consider exclusively English-language accounts or Portuguese-language accounts, the first\nand second largest Gettr demographics, respectively (see Appendix). A previous study has\nalso shown a similar increase in activity for banned Twitter and Reddit users active on Gab\n54\n101103105RegistrationsA\n2021-07 2021-10 2022-01 2022-040.00.20.40.6Active usersBMatched Gettr\nBannedNon-verified\nMatched T witterFigure 4.1: User registrations and daily activity for each cohort.

(B) 7-day moving average of the proportion of users from each cohort\nwho were active on Gettr on a given day. The percentage of the matched cohort active on\nTwitter is also shown (dashed brown).\n[241].\nUser retention on Gettr\nWe now focus on the retention of users on Gettr. In Fig. 4.2, panels A and B show the\nsurvival curves for the proportion of users who remain active a certain number of days after\nregistration (see Methods) for key registration months (July 2021 and January 2022 where\nregistrations peaked, see Fig. 4.1), while panel C shows the average retention of users in each\ncohort over time. Survival curves for other registration months are shown in the Appendix\nand follow the same pattern with higher banned retention than matched retention. The\nmatched cohort are consistently active on Twitter with no evidence that users stop using the\nplatform over time: 90% of the matched cohort are active in the first month covered by our\ndataset (07/21), and 98% of these users remain active in our dataset\u2019s final month (04/22).\nThis highlights that the matched cohort are established Twitter users who are committed to\nthe platform.\nFigure 4.2 shows that the banned cohort have the highest retention on Gettr, independent\nof the month in which they joined the platform, whereas the non-verified cohort and the\n55\n0\n 200\nDays\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0Percent SurvivalA July cohort\n0\n 100\n 200\nDays\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0Percent SurvivalB January cohort\n2021-07\n 2021-09\n 2021-11\n 2022-01\n 2022-03\n 2022-05\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0Activity durationCMatched Gettr Banned Non-verified\nRogan leavesFigure 4.2: User retention for key registration months and average retention by\nregistration date over time.

For the highlighted registration months,\nwe note that the January curves fall off at a sharper rate than the July curves. For the July\ncohort, half of the newly registered users from the non-verified cohort become idle after 216\ndays, compared to only 68 days for the January cohort.\nThe event which clarifies these differences is the Marjorie Taylor Greene deplatforming on\nTwitter. This deplatforming was denounced by Joe Rogan who opened a Gettr account on\nJanuary 2, 2022, resulting in a large migration of his supporters, and supporters of Marjorie\nTaylor Greene, to Gettr. However, after criticising the platform\u2019s policies [242], Rogan\n56\nquit the platform on January 12. This ten-day period highlights how a single celebrity\u2019s\nendorsement resulted in a large migration to Gettr. However, the subsequent denouncement\nby Rogan not only resulted in many new users quitting the platform (those from the January\n2022 cohort in panel B), but also resulted in many existing users quitting, see dashed line\nin panel A. Importantly, members of the banned cohort who registered in July 2021 did not\nleave Gettr at an enhanced rate after January 2022. This highlights that users who had the\noption to return to Twitter did so, but those who could not (due to suspension) continued\nto use Gettr.\nCompared to previous Gettr studies which showed that users become idle shortly after\nregistration [243], possibly due to the lack of engaging content [244], our results reveal the\ndiscrepancy between users banned from Twitter and users who remain active on Twitter,\nindicating that Gettr was most successful at retaining users who had lost their Twitter audi-\nence. Our results also show that deplatforming events of exceptional prominence can induce\na significant influx of accounts into a fringe platform, but not necessarily a corresponding\noutflux from the dominant mainstream platform.\nGettr structure and content\nIn order to further clarify differences between banned and matched users, we now focus on\nthe structure and content of the Gettr social network. We start by generating a topic model\nusing Gettr posts [245] (see Methods). A table of topics and their description is provided in\nthe Appendix. This shows that content on Gettr is dominated by issues of broad relevance\nto the US political right including (1) Covid-19 \u2013 one sixth of all Gettr content, approaching\none third in some months \u2013 (2) deplatforming from Twitter and other social media platforms,\n(3) accusations of election fraud and the January 6th insurrection, and (4) broader issues\nregarding gender, abortion, gun-control, the US supreme court, and race.\nMost topics discussed on Gettr are prominent in tweets authored by the matched cohort,\nhowever, three themes are disproportionately prominent on Gettr: (i) Accusations of elec-\ntion fraud surrounding the 2020 US election, (ii) resistance to Covid-19 vaccine mandates,\nparticularly in relation to the \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d protests in Canada, and (iii) the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine. These are topics which are known to have been targets of the Twitter\ncontent moderation team [246 ,247, 248].\nWe now measure whether the banned and matched cohorts are structurally segregated (or\npolarised) to assess whether the cohorts share the same, or different, audiences on Gettr. This\ncheck is important since there is no a priori reason to assume that the banned and matched\ncohorts are drawn from the same ideological group. We measure structural segregation (or\npolarisation) using the latent ideology, a well established method which constructs a synthetic\nideological spectrum from user interactions on the platform [249, 250, 251] (see Methods).\nThis measure orders the network of interactions between a set of influencer accounts (the\nbanned and matched cohorts combined) and a set of accounts who interact with them (the\nnon-verified cohort). By merging the banned and matched cohort into a single group, we can\n57\nmeasure differences in how the non-verified cohort interact with banned and matched users\nin an unbiased manner based on purely structural factors. Note that we exclude a small\nnumber of non-USA based accounts from the influencer set to avoid geographical conflation\n(see Methods).\nThe distribution of the latent ideology for the banned and matched cohort, and for the\nnon-verified cohort, is shown in Fig. 4.3A. Both distributions are unimodal according to\nHartigan\u2019s diptest [252]. We observe that the banned and matched distribution falls within\nthe bounds of the broader non-verified distribution. The banned and matched distribution\nis, however, significantly narrower, a feature indicative of the network centrality of these\nusers who play a central role in the general Gettr discussion. Non-verified Gettr users are\nfound both at the core of the Gettr discussion and at the peripheries. The central role of\nbanned and matched users is expected since verified social media accounts typically attain\nhigher engagement than non-verified accounts [253, 254].\n58\n2\n 0 2\nLatent ideology0.00.51.01.5User densityA\nNon-verified\nBanned + Matched Gettr\n2021-08 2021-10 2021-12 2022-02 2022-040.00.10.20.3Median toxicityB\nNon-verified\nMatched GettrBanned\nMatched T witter\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150\nDays since first post0.00.10.20.3Median toxicityC\nNon-verified\nMatched GettrBanned\nMatched T witterFigure 4.3: The latent ideology of Gettr users, and the toxicity of Gettr posts and\nTwitter tweets.

(C) The median toxicity of posts authored a fixed number of days\nafter a user first posted on Gettr (or Twitter; 14-day moving average). There is minimal\nevidence of a meaningful increase in user toxicity due to extended Gettr use (see Appendix).\n59\nThe unimodal ideology, and the central position of the matched and banned cohorts,\nindicates that these users share a common audience on Gettr; segregated audiences would\nappear as a multi-modal ideology distribution (see examples in [250, 251]).\nContent toxicity and twitter mentions\nWe now focus on the toxicity of posts from each user cohort, shown in Fig. 4.3B. Toxicity is\ncalculated using the Google Perspective API [2] (see Methods). The panel shows the median\ndaily toxicity of each cohort. Across the observation period as a whole, and by applying\na bootstrapping procedure to ensure equal sample sizes (see Methods), we find that posts\nauthored by the non-verified cohort are more toxic than posts by the matched cohort (KS-\ntestD= 0.36,p= 1.3\u00d710\u221257), and than posts by the banned cohort (KS-test D= 0.32,\np= 8.0\u00d710\u221247). We also find that the tweets authored by the matched cohort are more\ntoxic than Gettr posts authored by the matched cohort (KS-test D= 0.23,p= 8.7\u00d710\u221223).\nHowever, the difference between the toxicity of posts for the banned cohort and matched\ncohort on Gettr is not statistically significant (KS-test D= 0.06,p= 0.09).\nIn order to assess whether individual users are becoming more toxic over time due to\ntheir extended Gettr use, we plot the median toxicity of posts authored a fixed number of\ndays after each user first posted on Gettr (or first posted on Twitter during our observation\nperiod), as shown in Fig. 4.3C. For the non-verified cohort, the gradient in the change of\nthe toxiciy over time is not significantly different from zero (see Appendix). For the other\ncohorts, there is a statistically significant but very small non-zero gradient in the toxicity\nover time. However, this gradient is negligible when considered in the context of the much\nlarger inter-quartile range of post toxicity values for each cohort (see Appendix).\nTogether, the results for the latent ideology, topic modelling, and toxicity show that,\nalthough there are significant differences in activity and retention between the banned and\nmatched cohorts on Gettr (see Figs. 4.1 and 4.2), there is little that distinguishes their\naudience and content. This result confirms previous research which shows that fringe plat-\nforms are politically homogeneous; platforms with this property may be referred to as \u201cecho-\nplatforms\u201d [48, 255]. In contrast, mainstream platforms are often politically diverse, but\nwith opposed political groups confined to echo-chambers [48, 251, 254, 256, 257, 258, 259].\nConsidering the toxicity of posts for each topic, we find that topics with dispropor-\ntionately high toxicity are related to race (e.g., Black Lives Matter; median post toxicity\n[lower and upper quartile] = 0.40 [0 .31,0.52]), focus on female US Democratic politicians\n(0.38 [0 .18,0.58], and discuss gender issues ( 0.38 [0 .24,0.51]). All three topics are known to\nattract abusive content on social media [260, 261,262].\nWe now explore possible reasons why the matched cohort are more toxic on Twitter than\nthey are on Gettr. To do this, we analyse the Twitter accounts mentioned in tweets authored\nby the matched cohort. For each mentioned account, we compute the ratio between the\nnumber of users from the matched cohort who quote-tweet that account and the number of\n60\nusers from the matched cohort who quote-tweet or retweet that account. This ratio (referred\nto as the \u201cquote-ratio\u201d throughout) is instructive since there is evidence that retweets are\noften (but not exclusively, journalists being a known exception) used to endorse the message\nof the original author [251, 263], whereas quote tweets allow a user to comment on a message\nin either a positive, negative, or neutral manner. Negative \u201cquoting\u201d behaviour is a known\nmethod of communication with ideological opponents across polarised environments [264,\n265]. Hence, a low quote-ratio (i.e., the account is disproportionately retweeted) indicates\ngeneral endorsement by the matched cohort of users, whereas a high quote-ratio (i.e., the\naccount is disproportionately quote-tweeted) indicates that the matched cohort are more\nlikely to disagree with and hold a negative view of this account.\nFigure 4.4 shows the toxicity of tweets authored by the matched cohort, binned according\nto their quote-ratio. We count each mentioner-mentionee pair only once for quote-tweets\nand once for retweets to avoid bias from highly active accounts, and only include accounts\nmentioned by at least five matched users. This reveals (i) that tweets authored by the\nmatched cohort mentioning any Twitter account are more toxic than tweets which do not\nmention another account, and (ii) that tweets authored by the matched cohort are more\ntoxic if they mention an account with a high quote-ratio than if they mention accounts with\nlower quote-ratios.\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9\nQuoted / (Quoted or Retweeted)0.00.10.20.3T oxicity\nFigure 4.4: Toxicity of tweets authored by the matched cohort mentioning other\nTwitter accounts, binned according to their quote-ratio.

(D) The same news media\norganisations, but broken down according to whether they are classified as a reliable or\nquestionable by MBFC. Vertical lines mark the median of each distribution. Annotations\nindicate mentioned accounts of particular interest (see text).\n62\nTo better understand this result, we plot the distribution of the quote-ratio broken down\ninto four groups. Figure 4.5A shows the distribution of all users mentioned by the matched\ncohort, and the distribution for Twitter accounts who are also part of the matched cohort\n(i.e., a matched account mentioning another matched account). Three individuals are marked\non the figure: (1) Republican 2022 Senate nominee Herschel Walker, the user with the low-\nest quote-ratio of prominent mentioned accounts ( >100unique mentions), (2) Democratic\nspeaker of the house Nancy Pelosia, the user with the largest quote-ratio ( >100unique\nmentions), and (3) Elon Musk, the account with the most unique mentions.\nFigure 4.5B shows elected US political accounts mentioned by the matched cohort, la-\nbelled using the dataset in [266], broken down by party affiliation. This shows that Re-\npublican politicians are disproportionately retweeted (i.e., endorsed) by the matched cohort,\nwhereas Democrats are disproportionately quote-tweeted. The individuals marked on this\npanel are political outliers; Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger are the Republican politicians\nwith the highest quote-ratios ( >10unique mentions), whereas Tulsi Gabbardband Kyrsten\nSinema are the Democratic politicians with the lowest quote-ratios ( >10unique mentions).\nThis shows that these politicians do not align with the dominant position of their par-\nties. Consequently, the matched cohort are more likely to endorse the Democratic outliers,\nand more likely to negatively quote-tweet the Republican outliers; Liz Cheney and Adam\nKinzinger have been referred to as RINOs (\u201cRepublicans in name only\u201d) by their far-right\nopponents [267, 268].\nFigure 4.5C shows the news media organisations mentioned by the matched cohort, group-\ning them according to their political leaning as classified by Media Bias / Fact Check (MBFC;\nsee Methods). Previous research confirmed that MBFC classifications are similar to classi-\nfications from other reputable media rating organisations [269]. Finally, Fig. 4.5D repeats\nthe analysis in panel C, but groups media outlets according to whether MBFC labels them\nas reliable or questionable.\nUsing the distribution of all mentions (the \u201cany user\u201d curve in Fig. 4.5A) as the baseline\nbehaviour of the matched cohort, we find that, when tested using a two-sample Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test, only the distributions of far-right media organisations in panel C (KS-test\np-value = 0.24>0.01; Cohen\u2019s d= 0.20) and questionable media organisations in panel D\n(KS-test p-value = 0.29>0.01; Cohen\u2019s d= 0.05) are not significantly different from the\nbaseline (see Appendix). This observation aligns with previous research showing that the\nUS political right on Twitter are more likely to share questionable news sources, and are\nmore likely to be suspended [270].\nThe Democrat politicians distribution has the largest statistical difference to the all-\nmention baseline (KS-test p-value = 3\u00d710\u221216<0.01; Cohen\u2019s d= 2.34). With the exception\nof Tulsi Gabbard, no Democratic politicians has a known Gettr account; 132 are mentioned\non Twitter by the matched Gettr cohort. In contrast, 32 Republican politicians have been\naSpeaker of the house during the timeframe of our dataset\nbDemocrat during our analysis timeframe; left the Democratic party in October 2022.\n63\nactive on Gettr; 151 are mentioned on Twitter by the matched Gettr cohort.\nCombining the evidence from the topic modelling and from the quote-ratio in Fig. 4.5\nindicates that the matched cohort are aligned with the US far-right, often quote-tweeting,\nbut not retweeting, their Democratic political opponents and moderate Republicans. In\nconjunction with the latent ideology in Fig. 4.3, this suggests that Gettr as a whole is\ngenerally representative of the US far-right. These results suggest that the ability to mention\none\u2019s political opponents on Twitter is part of the reason that the matched cohort are more\ntoxic on Twitter than they are on Gettr where direct interactions with political opponents\nare not possible [271, 272].\nDiscussion & Conclusion\nIn this chapter, we have analysed self-declared user-level matching to study the ban-induced\nplatform migration from Twitter to Gettr. First, we showed that the banned cohort of users\ndeplatformed from Twitter are more active on Gettr, and have higher platform retention,\nthan the matched cohort who remain active on Twitter. Second, we revealed that Gettr\ncontent primarily discusses themes relevant to the US political right. Topics overepresented\non Gettr are known to have resulted in account suspensions on Twitter. Third, we showed\nthat the matched and banned cohorts share the same politically homogeneous Gettr audience.\nFinally, we found that matched users are more toxic on Twitter than they are on Gettr, and\nthat these toxic tweets often directly mention political opponents. We find little evidence of\na meaningful increase in user toxicity over time.\nThe fact that the banned and matched cohorts appear similar in every regard, apart from\ntheir activity and retention on Gettr, is evidence of the systemic impact of deplatforming.\nFringe platforms offer a safe haven where deplatformed users are free to capitalise on their\nsupporters following suspension from Twitter. However, in this politically homogeneous\nenvironment, users are essentially confined to an ideological \u201cecho-platform\u201d [48, 255] where\nthey cannot engage and confront their political opponents. Our results hint that this ability\nto interact with opponents may be part of Twitter\u2019s appeal for far-right social media users,\nalthough more work is needed to fully clarify this observation.\nWhen users are banned from mainstream platforms, they become wholly dependent on\nthe fringe alternatives (despite Gettr also suspending some users, notably white supremacist\nNicholas Fuentes [273]). This may pose a societal risk since fringe platforms are believed\nto facilitate the emergence of radical narratives and the spread of hate speech [79, 90]. A\nlack of monitoring can, therefore, mean that signs of collective upheaval are missed. The\nBras\u00b4 \u0131lia insurrection, which took place in January 2023 following Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat in\nthe presidential election, is an example of this, as the election fraud allegations were widely\nspread by Steven Bannon\u2019s podcast The War Room , streaming regularly on Gettr while being\nbanned from Twitter [181, 274]; an analysis provided in the Appendix shows how Portuguese\nlanguage Gettr activity rose in the weeks preceding the riots.\n64\nThese results complement and add to existing work which considers the effect of main-\nstream deplatforming on users\u2019 behaviour on Gab primarily on the basis of content analysis\n[241]. However, while the Gab study finds an increase in user toxicity over time, we find\nlittle evidence of a similar increase on Gettr. This difference may indicate that changes in\ntoxicity (or lack thereof) depend on the fringe platform used after suspension, rather than\non deplatforming itself, but more work is needed to validate this hypothesis in the context\nof the wider social media ecosystem.\nIt is important to contextualise the scope of our findings, whose limitations are avenues\nfor future work. First, the current study only considers the migration from Twitter to\nGettr, since users of other platforms do not declare their Twitter use as standard. If data\nbecomes available, future work should extend scrutiny to multiple other platforms, ideally in\na unified study. Second, the Gettr matching feature only applies to verified users, a subset\nof the users who migrated from Twitter to Gettr. Analysing non-verified users migrating\nacross platforms would clarify the differential impact of deplatforming on content creators\nas opposed to consumers. Finally, we cannot study tweets from the banned cohort since\nthis data is not publicly available. Analysing this content would explain why some users are\ndeplatformed, but others are not.\nOverall, our study highlights how Gettr struggles to compete with Twitter when users\nhave free choice to use either platform. However, the decision by Twitter to deplatform a\nuser impacts how those users view Gettr as an alternative. We anticipate that future work\nwill build on these observations and speculate that other fringe platforms will likely show\na similar dependence on their mainstream competitors. This work is urgently needed given\nthe potential risks posed to democracy by poorly regulated social media [275, 276].\nMethods\nGettr data\nThe data used for this study has been collected using GoGettr [277], a public client developed\nby the Stanford Internet Observatory to give access to the Gettr API. This API allows to\nquery user interactions, including the posts they like or share. User profiles were initially\ncollected through a snowball sampling, by using highly popular accounts on the platform\nas seed users, and using the API to query their follower and following list, before repeating\nthe same process for a random sample of the newly retrieved users. Repeating this process\nmany times ensures that our dataset is near-complete for the studied time period.\nTo attract more users from Twitter, Gettr previously offered a feature that would auto-\nmatically import a user\u2019s tweets upon creating an account. However, due to Twitter blocking\nthis capability on July 10, 2021 [278], Gettr had to discontinue this feature. To ensure the\naccuracy of our results, any posts imported before July 10, 2021, and any Gettr post whose\ntimestamp precedes the account\u2019s creation date were removed from our dataset.\n65\nTo ensure our case study on the Brazilian right encompasses the Bras\u00b4 \u0131lia insurrection, we\nexpanded the data collection time frame for any user associated with the Brazilian commu-\nnity. The data collection was run in July 2022 for every user whose profile we have retrieved,\nand in January 2023 for the users in the Brazilian cohort.\nTwitter data\nFor each verified Gettr account where the Gettr API references their Twitter followers in\nthe account metadata, we check that the Twitter account with the same username is active\nusing the Twitter API (see https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-a\npi/academic-research ). We identify accounts who were previously active on Twitter but\nare now banned from the \u201cHTTP 403 Code 63\u201d error message corresponding to suspended\nTwitter accounts. Other error messages are used for protected or not found accounts. Our\nstudy does not consider users banned from Twitter who did not join Gettr, or joined Gettr\nusing a different username to their original Twitter username.\nFor each active account we download their Twitter timeline including all tweets and\nretweets in the period July 2021 to May 2022. This totals approximately 12 million tweets.\nData was collected between September and October 2022, preceding Elon Musk\u2019s amnesty\nof suspended Twitter accounts.\nUser labelling\nThroughout our analysis, we label verified Gettr users as being either \u201cmatched\u201d or \u201cbanned\u201d,\ndepending on whether their corresponding Twitter account is active or suspended. Any\nverified user who decided to link their Twitter account on their Gettr page has their Twitter\nfollower count displayed on their profile, which can also be retrieved from the Gettr API. We\nstress that this self-declaration permits cross-platform matching since users can \u201creasonably\nexpect\u201d that their Gettr accounts will be associated with their Twitter accounts.\nTo match accounts across platforms, we assumed that users picked the same username\non both Gettr and Twitter, and we used the Twitter API to retrieve their Twitter activity.\nA user is classified as \u201cbanned\u201d if the Twitter user endpoint returned an error indicating that\nthe account has been suspended (Error \u201cHTTP 403 Code 63\u201d).\nTo validate the accuracy of this matching process, we manually check whether matched\naccounts correspond to the same organization or individual on both Gettr and Twitter (see\nAppendix). This reveals a 95% matching accuracy. Note that following Elon Musk\u2019s amnesty\non banned accounts, approximately one third of accounts in the banned cohort have been\nreactivated. Of the top 100 most followed accounts on Gettr from the banned cohort, 33\nhave been unbanned on Twitter following the Musk amnesty, and all 33 are an exact match\nfor the same individual or organisation across the two platforms. However, due to the\ndiscontinuation of the Twitter API for academic purposes, the detailed analysis of these\nunbanned accounts on Twitter is not possible.\n66\nFor data privacy reasons, all analysis of users across platforms is aggregated at the cohort\nlevel; we do not present results for individual users.\nCalculating account survival\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate is a tool used to quantify the survival rate of a population (in\nour case, users active on a social platform) over time. For each time step t, we measure how\nmany users become indefinitely inactive, and we quantify the survival rate as\n\u02c6S(t) =/produc display\nti\u2264t/parenlef Big\n1\u2212di\nni/parenrigh Big\n, (4.1)\nwhere direpresents the number of users who became inactive at time ti, and niis the\nnumber of users who are still active up to time ti. Greenwood\u2019s formula is used to estimate\nthe confidence interval for the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survivor function. For the study\ntime t, the standard error is given by\n/ha widerSE 2(t) =/radicalBigg\n\u02c6S2(t)/summa iondisplay\nti\u2264tdi\nni(ni\u2212di). (4.2)\nTopic Modelling\nGettr and Twitter content is analysed using the BERTopic topic modelling library [245].\nThis method extracts latent topics from an ensemble of documents (in our case Gettr posts\nand Twitter tweets). The base model uses pre-trained transformer-based language models\nto construct document embeddings which are then clustered.\nThese methods are known to struggle with very short documents which are common on\nmicro-blogging sites. Hence, we train our topic model using exclusively Gettr posts which\nare longer than 100 characters. To avoid any single user dominating a specific topic, we limit\nthe training set to no more than 50 posts from any given user.\nLatent ideology\nTo calculate the latent ideology on Gettr, we use the method developed in [249, 250] and\nfiltering procedures from [251]. The method uses a bipartite approach where it classifies\nGettr accounts as influencers or regular users. It then generates an ordering of users based\non the interaction patterns of regular users with the influencer set. In the current chapter,\nwe select the matched and banned user sets as our influencers, and the remaining set of\nGettr users as our cohort of regular users.\nTwo factors can conflate the latent ideology: (1) account geography, and (2) a lack of user-\ninfluencer interactions. Since we are interested in the segregation of the banned and matched\n67\ncohorts based on political ideology, the former is problematic because country-specific com-\nmunities on social media can appear structurally segregated from a related community in\nother countries, even if they are politically aligned. For this reason, we remove a small num-\nber of accounts associated with the UK and China from our set of Gettr influencers. In the\nlatter case, a lack of user-influencer interactions can be problematic since influencers with\nfew user interactions appear as erroneous outliers when computing the latent ideology, often\nbecause they do not take active part in the conversation. Hence, we restrict our influencer\nset to the 500 banned and matched accounts who receive the largest number of interactions\nfrom other users on Gettr. In the current study, we consider any interaction type including\ncomments, shares and likes. The latent ideology is robust as long as the number of influencers\nused is larger than 200 accounts [251].\nIn order to assess the modality of the ideology distributions, we use Hartigan\u2019s diptest.\nThis approach is used to identify polarised social media conversations and echo-chambers\n[250, 251]. Hartigan\u2019s diptest compares a test distribution against a matched unimodal\ndistribution to assess distribution modality [252].\nThe test computes the distance, D, between the cumulative density of the test distribu-\ntion and the cumulative density of the matched unimodal distribution. The D-statistic is\naccompanied by a p-value which quantifies whether the test distribution is significantly dif-\nferent to a matched unimodal distribution. A p-value of less than 0.01indicates a multimodal\ndistribution.\nToxicity analysis\nThe toxicity of Gettr and Twitter content is computed using the Google Perspective API [2],\nwhich has been used in several social media studies to assess platform toxicity [83, 279, 280].\nGiven a text input, the API returns a score between 0 and 1, indicating how likely a\nhuman moderator is to flag the text as being toxic. For our analysis, we used the flagship\nattribute \u201ctoxicity\u201d, which is defined as \u201c[a] rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment\nthat is likely to make people leave a discussion\u201d [281].\nWhen computing statistics for the toxicity of each user cohort, we apply a bootstrapping\nprocedure to avoid erroneous results from variable cohort sizes. This is important since the\ndistribution of post toxicity is fat tailed; there are far more posts with low toxicity than\nhigh toxicity. Therefore, a smaller set of posts from a user cohort may have a lower median\ntoxicity, purely due to sampling effects. To avoid this conflation, bootstrapping is employed\nwhere equally sized samples are drawn from each cohort (usually 100posts), and the median\ntoxicity is computed for each sample. Then, the sampling procedure is repeated 100times\nto compute the median and inter-quartile range for the sampled post toxicity.\n68\nNews media classification using Media Bias / Fact Check\nFor the quote-ratio analysis in Fig. 4.5, we identify the Twitter handles of news media outlets\nand classify their political leaning using Media Bias / Fact Check (MBFC; see https:\n//mediabiasfactcheck.com/ ). Ratings provided by MBFC are largely similar to other\nreputable media rating datasets [269].\nMBFC classify news outlets under seven leaning categories: extreme left, left, center-left,\nleast (media considered unbiased), center-right, right, extreme right. To ensure that we have\nenough news media outlets to enable the quote-ratio analysis, we group these classifications\ninto four larger groups: Left \u2013 (extreme left, left, center-left), Least \u2013 (least), Right \u2013 (center-\nright, right), Far-right \u2013 (extreme right). Note that we have chosen to use the terminology\n\u201cfar-right\u201d instead of \u201cextreme-right\u201d since the former is more common in the academic\nliterature.\n69\nChapter 5\nThe Koo Dataset: An Indian\nMicroblogging Platform With Global\nAmbitions\nPrevious chapters have emphasised the increasing influence leveraged by alt-tech platforms in\nthe overall social media ecosystem. However, our analysis so far mostly revolved around US-\nbased communities. Therefore, there is a growing need to understand how alt-tech platforms\nthrive beyond Western nations.\nKoo, a microblogging platform based in India, had emerged as a major new social network\nhosting high profile politicians from several countries (India, Brazil, Nigeria) and many\ninternationally renowned celebrities. This chapter presents the largest publicly available Koo\ndataset, spanning from the platform\u2019s founding in early 2020 to September 2023, providing\ndetailed metadata for 72M posts, 75M comments, 40M shares, 284M likes and 1.4M user\nprofiles. Along with the release of the dataset, we provide an overview of the platform\nincluding a discussion of the news ecosystem on the platform, hashtag usage, and user\nengagement. Our results highlight the pivotal role that new platforms play in shaping online\ncommunities in emerging economies and the Global South, connecting local politicians and\npublic figures with their followers. With Koo\u2019s former ambition to become the town hall for\ndiverse non-English speaking communities, our dataset offers new opportunities for studying\nsocial media beyond a Western context.\nIntroduction\nLaunched in India in 2020, Koo had grown to become the second largest microblogging\nplatform worldwide [282], and had attracted a number of political communities who have\nbeen critical of Twitter for censoring their discourse [283]. Most notably, Koo had become\na leading social platform used by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the governing political\n70\nparty in India.\nGiven the dominance of the BJP on Koo, the platform appeared to be similar to many\nother alt-tech platforms with a focus on right-wing politics. However, beyond India, Koo\nhad successfully attracted a politically diverse set of users, including both supporters and\nopponents of former Nigerian president Buhari, and of Brazilian president Lula. This success\nhighlights how Koo had the potential to move beyond the politically homogeneous model\nof most alt-tech platforms to become a major politically heterogeneous venue for both po-\nlitical and apolitical discussions across multiple countries, challenging the US social media\nhegemony.\nData Release. In this work, we present the most extensive Koo dataset currently\navailable, including 71.7M posts, 74.6M comments, 283.5M likes, 40.0M shares, and 1.4M\nuser profiles. Our dataset spans from Koo\u2019s launch in early 2020 up until September 2023.\nDue to the ability to paginate through a user\u2019s complete timeline to access historical activity\nvia the API, we are confident that our dataset provides a near-complete overview of the\ninteractions carried out by users who were actively using the platform.\nRelevance. Our dataset provides researchers with the opportunity to study an alt-\ntech platform based in India which had attracted an international community of high-profile\npoliticians and celebrities, primarily from India, Brazil and Nigeria. With BJP politicians\nheavily endorsing Koo, our dataset enables the study of political rhetoric through the analy-\nsis of the political content shared online. Previous research has shown that the BJP promote\nislamophobic [284] and populist [285] rhetoric. It is therefore of interest to consider whether\ntheir claims on Koo aimed to polarise opinions and stoke hate in their audience. Moreover,\nwith many news outlets shared on Koo, the dataset will enable the study of political dis-\ncourses through an analysis of the alignment between news media outlets\u2019 editorial line and\nthe national political parties\u2019 ideologies [286, 287]. Finally, the dataset can contribute to\ncross-platform comparisons of political rhetoric.\nChapter organization. In this chapter, we first explain Koo\u2019s structure before detailing\nits impact on the social media ecosystem. Second, we describe the method used to query\nposts, interactions and user profiles from Koo\u2019s public API before describing the structure\nof our dataset. Finally, we present results which provide an overview of the Koo platform,\nbefore discussing our results and the importance of our dataset in the conclusion.\nWhat was Koo?\nKoo was a multi-lingual microblogging platform launched in early 2020 by Bombinate Tech-\nnologies, a company based in Bangalore, India. Social interactions on Koo worked in a very\nsimilar way as interactions on other microblogging platforms (e.g., X): Users could create an\naccount and then follow, or be followed by, other users. User profiles could be personalised\nwith a profile-picture and additional information including a user description, personal title,\nand links to other social platforms. User profiles also displayed the account username and\n71\ncreation date.\nOnce logged in, users could submit public posts, called koos. A user could like a post,\ncomment on it, or share it (a rekoo ). Koo also provided the ability to translate a koo to many\nlanguages. Since March 2023, the platform had integrated ChatGPT in a bid to increase the\nnumber of users actively creating content for the platform [288].\nFigure 5.1 provides an example of a post on Koo. Posts had a 500 character limit and\nmight include images and videos. The panel under each post indicated how many times the\nkoo had been commented, liked and shared by other users, and allowed the viewer to share\nthe koo on other platforms. The profile panel, located above the koo, displayed the user\u2019s\nusername and their self-indicated title. The yellow tick at the right of the username, known\nas the yellow tick of eminence, was granted by Koo administrators to accounts considered\n\u201csignificant representative[s] of the Voices of the World\u201d [289]. Other users could earn a green\nbadge by self-verifying their account.\nThe demographics of Koo\nKoo aimed at becoming a central outlet for non-English speaking communities online by\ntargeting countries where the uptake of traditional social media has been low [290]. The\nplatform had experienced three key surges in user registrations. First, in February 2021\nIndian users joined Koo following an open conflict between Narendra Modi\u2019s cabinet and\nTwitter, after the government ordered Twitter to remove more than 1,000 accounts they\nalleged were responsible for spreading misinformation around the Indian farmers\u2019 protests\n[290]. Many government officials and celebrities endorsed the platform in the wake of the\nconflict, including the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath and cricket player\nVirat Kohli. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his support for Koo but\ndid not sign up on the platform [291]. Previous research has highlighted that about 80% of\nthe politicians who signed up on Koo are members of the BJP [292]. Consequently, Koo had\nbeen accused of supporting nationalist politics in India, despite its attempts to attract other\npolitical parties [149].\nSecond, in June 2021, Twitter temporarily suspended then Nigerian president Muham-\nmadu Buhari from the platform after he threatened his political opponents with violence.\nThis led Buhari\u2019s government to instate a nationwide Twitter ban on June 5, 2021 [293].\nAfterwards, Koo experienced a significant uptake among Nigerian government officials and\ncivilians, both supporters and opponents of the Buhari regime, leading the platform to roll\nout accessibility for the main vernacular languages spoken in Nigeria [25]. Koo quickly gained\nlegitimacy within the country, becoming an official channel of communication for the govern-\nment alongside Facebook and Instagram. Twitter was reinstated in Nigeria in January 2022,\nafter they agreed to conditions set by the Nigerian government [294], leading to a reduction\nin Koo\u2019s usage from 289,000 monthly active Nigerian users to 40,000 by September 2022\n[295].\n72\nFigure 5.1: An example of a koo. The main panel includes the original post in Hindi,\nits translation in English and an image. The top panel provides information about the\nposter, including their user handle, profile picture, their self-declared title, the yellow tick\nof eminence (if applicable), and the post creation date. The bottom panel allows logged-in\nusers to comment, share or like the post. Koo provides additional icons to share posts on\nother platforms.\nFinally, in November 2022, shortly after Twitter was purchased by Elon Musk, Koo\nattracted a large Brazilian community following a Koo-related linguistic pun posted by Felipe\nNeto, a Brazilian YouTuber and online influencer [26]. Consequently, Brazilian president\nLuiz In\u00b4 acio Lula da Silva and many of his supporters joined Koo; Lula gained over 50,000\nfollowers in less than 4 hours [296] with Koo becoming the most downloaded app on the\nApple App Store and the Google Play Store for a few days [297].\nTable 5.1 shows the total number of posts, comments, likes and shares made in the top\n10 languages on the platform, as well as the percentage of posts made in each language.\nHindi makes up about half of the total messages, highlighting the dominance of the Indian\ncommunity on Koo. English, Portuguese and Nigerian English are the only non-Indian\n73\nlanguages which had significant use on the platform.\nLanguage Posts Ratio (%) Comments Likes Shares\nHindi 35,074,082 48.9 33,762,199 141,851,555 22,710,161\nEnglish 21,341,502 29.8 15,364,430 59,405,972 10,745,495\nPortuguese 4,933,641 6.88 9,747,183 51,323,645 1,521,073\nTelugu 2,127,279 2.97 2,218,213 1,975,845 104,001\nKannada 1,889,473 2.63 3,700,669 5,972,733 859,069\nMarathi 1,286,933 1.79 913,997 5,237,631 128,886\nTamil 1,268,948 1.77 376,721 1,262,414 82,940\nBengali 1,194,315 1.67 1,031,905 2,912,268 203,597\nGujarati 1,014,200 1.41 504,975 2,991,499 103,317\nNigerian English 610,568 0.85 1,076,604 1,893,175 571,813\nTable 5.1: The top 10 languages used on Koo. The ratio indicates the percentage of the\ntotal number of posts written in each language. Columns indicate, for each language, the\nnumber of comments, likes and shares associated with the language.\nFocusing on high-profile Koo users, Table 5.2 shows the fraction of users with a green\n(verified) or yellow (account of eminence) badge for the 10 largest linguistic communities\non Koo. Over a quarter of Portuguese-speaking users had received a green badge, the\nlargest percentage for any linguistic community, indicating heavy use of Koo\u2019s self-verification\nfeature. In contrast, only 0.33% of Nigerian English accounts were self-verified. Hindi-\nspeaking users also displayed a high level of adoption for the self-verification process. For\neach linguistic community, only a small fraction of accounts were awarded the yellow tick of\neminence, with a slight bias favouring Indian communities.\nLanguage Self-Verified (%) Accounts of Eminence (%) User Profiles\nHindi 10.8 0.79 552,941\nEnglish 7.33 1.37 212,244\nPortuguese 27.96 0.5 178,471\nTelugu 4.05 0.35 16,265\nKannada 2.95 0.93 25,547\nMarathi 5.81 0.63 11,226\nTamil 5.3 1.15 5,021\nBengali 5.66 0.34 14,619\nGujarati 5.51 0.58 9,931\nNigerian English 0.33 0.31 17,184\nTable 5.2: Ratio of self-verified accounts and those with a yellow tick of eminence for the\ntop 10 linguistic communities on Koo. The table also indicates the number of user profiles\nprovided for each linguistic community.\nStudies have shown that two accounts who share a common set of social media inter-\n74\nactions typically share similar political or ideological views [251, 298]. To map these con-\nnections on Koo, we construct the co-occurrence network of Koo users with the account of\neminence badge following the methodology outlined in [298], see Fig. 5.2. Each node in the\nco-occurence network corresponds to a single eminent user, coloured according to their modal\npost language. Two eminent users are connected by an edge if their posts were liked by at\nleast 50 common users. For visual clarity, we only show the giant connected component, and\neminent users with edges to at least two other users.\nThe network shows that clusters are strongly influenced by linguistic factors: prominent\nusers were more likely to be part of a similar social circle on Koo if they predominantly used\nthe same language on the platform. Aside from the isolated Portuguese-speaking cluster and\nthe Nigerian English speaking users, eminent users speaking Kannada, Telugu and Gujarati\nare also slightly disconnected from the English/Hindi dominant community. However, there\nis little evidence of structural polarization within linguistic communities on Koo, unlike on\nTwitter (now X) [298].\nData Collection\nKoo\u2019s API. Koo provided a public API, which could be accessed by sending a GET request\ntohttps://www.kooapp.com/api/ . All data included in this dataset was retrieved by\nquerying the user profile endpoint: knowing a user ID or account handle, the API provided\nspecific endpoints to retrieve their posts, comments, shares and likes.\nUser Profile Collection. In order to collect a user\u2019s activity, we first need to retrieve\ntheir profile to get their user ID. We started with a short list of manually collected high-profile\nusers, including prominent politicians, who were active on Koo. Through their interactions\non Koo (see below) we identify any user they had interacted with. We query the user profile of\nthese accounts, and repeat this process iteratively, collecting more users through a snowball\nsampling method until we retrieve no new user profiles. A limitation of this data acquisition\nstrategy is that we do not capture lurkers on Koo (users who used Koo passively). However,\nwe do capture all the interactions for every user who interacted with any account in the giant\nconnected component on Koo. The user profiles provided by the API included information\non a user\u2019s username, display name, profile description and manually entered title.\nUser Activity. Given a user ID, Koo\u2019s API provided specialised endpoints to query the\nuser\u2019s posts, comments, shares and likes. The endpoints were respectively profile/createdKus ,\nprofile/commentsKus ,profile/rekooKus andprofile/likedKus , with the user ID pro-\nvided as a query parameter. We paginate through the results to ensure that all of a user\u2019s\nposts and interactions are collected.\nEthical Considerations. The data released with this chapter was collected using Koo\u2019s\npublic API, in accordance with the platforms\u2019 Terms of Service. Koo did not offer the\npossibility for users to make their account private, therefore the data we are releasing contains\npublicly accessible information only. We do not release metadata related to geolocation. All\n75\nFigure 5.2: Co-occurrence network of accounts of eminence. Two eminent users are\nconnected by an edge if at least 50 accounts on Koo interact with both of them. Nodes\nare coloured according to modal account language. Node shapes differentiate Indian and\nnon-Indian languages.\ndata released are available publicly and results are aggregated across accounts. To ensure\nthat our data collection pipeline and data sharing complies with the relevant regulations,\nwe have completed a Data Protection Impact Assessment which has been approved by our\ninstitution.\n76\nSimilar to the Voat dataset described in Chapter 3, we ensured that the released dataset\naligns with the FAIR principles, to provide the scientific community with a comprehensible\nand usable dataset.\nData Description\nWe now present the structure of the dataset, available on a public repository [141]. We release\nthe metadata related to each type of user activity, as well as the user profiles, in separate\nJSON files. Table 5.3 indicates, for each user activity, the fields included in the JSON\nschema, including the data type of each field and a short description. For user convenience,\nwe provide language-specific files for each interaction type. In total, we release 34 files for\ncomments, shares and likes, and 43 files for the posts. This difference is due to small linguistic\ncommunities with fewer than 5 posts and no other interaction types.\nResults\nIn this section, we provide a quantitative overview of Koo including (1) an analysis of user\nengagement over time (2) an analysis of Koo\u2019s news media ecosystems, and (3) an analysis\nof user content. These results offer a more in-depth description of Koo\u2019s growth within the\ndigital platform ecosystem and its potential to harbour a unique online community.\nUser retention. Previous studies have shown that, although alternative platforms are\nsuccessful at attracting a large number of user registrations, many newcomers do not remain\nactive on the platform and become idle within days of registering [89 ,243]. Figure 5.3A\nshows the number of posts, comments, shares and likes, recorded on a daily basis on Koo.\nFigure 5.3B shows the daily number of active users over time.\nAfter steady growth in 2020, the platform experienced a jump in activity in February\n2021, attributed to BJP officials signing up on Koo with their followers. The daily activity\ncount starts plateauing afterwards, but does not experience any substantial decrease. We\nsee a second major increase in activity in November 2022 after Brazilian celebrities endorsed\nKoo, although activity levels quickly return to levels observed before the Brazilian migration.\nUser engagement and activity does not fall substantially after any of the spikes in user\nregistrations. This result may indicate low retention amongst users who joined Koo during\nthe major collective migrations, a pattern that has been observed in other alt-tech outlets\n[89,130].\nNews ecosystem. Next, we look at news media URLs shared on Koo. Previous studies\nhave highlighted the emergence of online ecosystems where users are only exposed to a\nlimited selection of sources, often due to information-filtering mechanisms [299, 300]. This\nphenomenon is commonly referred to as an epistemic bubble and has been implicated in\nonline radicalisation processes [172] and populist discourses [301]. The question of news\n77\nKey\nType Description\nlanguage_co\nde_posts.json (43 files)\nid\nstring ID of the post\ncreatorId string ID of the user who created the post\ntitle string Content of the post\ncreatedAt int UNIX timestamp of the post\nhandle string Handle of the user who created the post\nlanguage_co\nde_likes.json (34 files)\nid\nstring ID of the liked post\ncreatorId string ID of the user who created the post\ncreatedAt int UNIX timestamp of the like\nhandle string Handle of the user who posted\nliker_id string ID of the user who liked\nlanguage_co\nde_comments.json (34 files)\nid\nstring ID of the commented post\ncreatorId string ID of the user who created the post\ntitle string Content of the comment\ncreatedAt int UNIX timestamp of the comment\nhandle string Handle of the user who posted\ncommenter_id string ID of the user who commented\nlanguage_co\nde_shares.json (34 files)\nid\nstring ID of the shared post\ncreatorId string ID of the user who created the post\ncreatedAt int UNIX timestamp of the share\nhandle string Handle of the user who posted\nsharer_id string ID of the user who shared\nk\noo_users.json (1 file)\nid\nstring ID of the user\nhandle string Handle of the user\ntitle string Self-given title\ndescription string Profile description\ncreatedAt int Timestamp of the account creation\nTable 5.3: Description of the metadata in each data file.\ndiversity is of particular interest in the case of an Indian social platform that aimed to host\na wide range of cultural backgrounds. Previous studies have underlined the ethical issues\nthat arise when religious events are covered in a controversial way by mainstream outlets\nthat do not promote media secularism [302, 303].\nTo measure the news ecosystem for each linguistic community, we separate posts into\nlanguages for the news media analysis. This approach allows us to map the news ecosystem\nshared among users who predominantly used the same language on the platform. Compar-\ning the results across languages demonstrates an outlet\u2019s ability to seep through language\nbarriers. Figure 5.4 shows the top 20 online domains shared on Koo and their respective\nprevalence within the major linguistic communities on the platform. We notice a strong\ntendency for Hindi news outlets to be part of the top domains on Koo, as Hindi speakers\n78\n102105Daily activityA\n1 2 3\nPosts\nCommentsLikes\nShares\n04-2020 07-2020 10-2020 01-2021 04-2021 07-2021 10-2021 01-2022 04-2022 07-2022 10-2022 01-2023 04-2023102104Active usersB\n1 2 3Figure 5.3: Daily activity and number of active users.

A user is considered\nactive if they created a new post or if they commented, shared or liked an existing post. The\ndashed lines indicate the events that led to the major collective migrations on Koo, namely\n1) the Farmers\u2019 Protest in India; 2) Twitter getting banned in Nigeria and 3) Elon Musk\u2019s\npurchasing Twitter and the subsequent Brazilian migration.\nrepresented almost half of Koo\u2019s user base. However, some websites were also broadly shared\nwithin other linguistic communities. This is the case of ETV Bharat , an Indian news channel\nthat is available in 11 major Indian languages. Social media platforms, such as YouTube\nand Facebook, were also widely shared across linguistic communities.\nSome news outlets are found to be very popular amongst smaller Indian linguistic com-\nmunities. This is the case for Eenadu , the most prominent daily newspaper in Telugu. Along\nwith Sakshi , it reaches more than 70% of the Telugu-speaking audience [304]. For the Tamil-\nspeaking community, the lesser-known news media OneIndia was widely shared. OneIndia\nhad been very prolific on Koo and had garnered a large following by systematically sharing\nlinks to its articles, thereby outranking some of the better known Tamil newspapers such as\nDinakaran .\nInterestingly, when looking at Nigerian English speakers, the most shared outlet is Peoples\nGazette , an online newspaper launched in 2020 that has led several investigations about cases\nof corruption in Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government [305]. The second most shared news\noutlet among Nigerian English speakers (exc. YouTube and Telegram) is The Punch , the\nmost widely read newspaper in Nigeria, which is also highly critical of Buhari\u2019s politics [306].\n79\nThese findings suggest that the Nigerian government was also followed by its dissenters when\nit migrated to Koo in June 2021 and had a less prominent influence on the relevant news\necosystem than their political opponents.\nPortuguese speakers widely shared links to social media platforms, with Instagram,\nYouTube and Koo links being the most shared websites. These are followed by G1 Globo , one\nof the most popular news outlets in Brazil. Similar to the other major newspapers in Brazil,\nGrupo Globo , the conglomerate that owns G1 Globo , was highly critical of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s\npolitical stances [307]. However, the network has also been accused of delegitimizing Lula\nand other leaders of the Workers\u2019 Party, such as former president Dilma Rousseff [308]. In\na similar fashion as for Nigeria, these results suggest that the Brazilian community on Koo\nshared news media content which is primarily antagonistic to the current political regime.\nHowever, the Brazilian migration also included media actors that are supportive of Lula\u2019s\nregime. The second most shared news platfom within the Brazilian community is Diario\ndo Centro do Mundo , a left-leaning digital news outlet criticised as \u201ccharlatans hired by the\nWorkers\u2019 Party\u201d [309].\nThe dominance of specific news outlets within linguistic communities, particularly in\nIndia, suggests that Koo may not have harboured, or been conducive to, a social environment\nthat cultivated media pluralism. Media pluralism has often been defined as a hallmark of\na healthy democracy [310], while also being an important tool for tackling misleading news\n[311]. To measure news diversity, we compute the Gini coefficient for the set of web domains\nshared by each linguistic community on Koo. A Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that only\none news source was being shared within the community, whereas a coefficient of 0 would\nrepresent perfect equality across all news sources. Figure 5.5 shows the Gini coefficient for\neach linguistic community, plotted against its population size. The figure shows that larger\nlinguist communities on Koo tend to have a Gini coefficient close to 1. This further highlights\nthe dominance of individual news media outlets in each of these communities.\nHashtags analysis. Next, we look at the conversations that was hosted on Koo. Pre-\nvious studies focused on the US alt-tech ecosystem have shown that populist themes are\nwidely discussed in culturally homogeneous communities [312]. To identify the most salient\ntopics users discuss, we perform an analysis of the hashtags shared by the major linguistic\ncommunities on Koo. Often used to bring visibility to a specific topic, hashtags have been\nshown to play an instrumental role on several social platforms, both in political campaigning\nand to rally citizens to activist movements. These social phenomena have been extensively\nstudied in India [313, 314], Nigeria [315, 316] and Brazil [317, 318].\nTable 5.4 shows the 20 most shared hashtags for the Hindi, English, Nigerian English and\nPortuguese speaking Koo communities. For Hindi and English speakers, we note that the\nmost popular hashtags gravitate around Indian matters (#kooforindia, #india), suggesting\nthat the English-speaking community were largely based in India. Most Hindi and English\nhashtags relate to national politics and economic matters (#narendramodi, #HindiNews,\n#Budget2022), which further highlights that Koo had succeeeded in hosting a sustainable\n80\nAssamese\nBengali\nEnglish\nEnglish (NG)\nGujarati\nHindi\nKannada\nMalayalam\nMarathi\nOriya\nPunjabi\nPortuguese\nT amil\nT eluguwww.news18.comt.cowww.jagranjosh.comwww.hindustantimes.comtamil.oneindia.comwww.naidunia.comwww.latestly.comaapkarajasthan.comhindi.news18.combit.lyfb.watchwww.facebook.comwww.republicworld.comyoutube.comwww.kooapp.comwww.youtube.comwww.jagran.comwww.eenadu.netyoutu.bewww.etvbharat.com\n100101102103104105106Figure 5.4: Top-shared web domains and their prevalence in the dominant linguis-\ntic communities.

Finally, this analysis highlights interest\nin Rampal Singh Jatain (#Sat_Bhakti_Sandesh, #SantRampalJiMaharaj), an Indian reli-\ngious cult leader who has been previously arrested for murder [319]. He signed up on Koo\nin August 2020 and had garnered more than 330k followers.\nThe Nigerian English-speaking community prominently used hashtags related to the Twit-\nter ban and the migration to Koo in June 2021 (#letskoo, #bantwitter, #nigeriatwitterban).\nFurthermore, many hashtags also mention locations in the country, such as cities (#kano,\n#kaduna, #lagos) or regions (#arewa). These results show that the Twitter ban remained\na major topic of debate, and that Nigerian users attempted to rebuild their social network\non Koo by connecting with peers located in the same region of the country. National politics\nwere also discussed (#Buhari, #buharitrain, #OsinbajoDay) and highlight the presence of\nboth pro- and anti-Buhari cohorts on the platform.

The dotted green line shows the linear fit for the correla-\ntion between the population size and the Gini coefficient. The linear regression has a slope\na= 0.134, with a 95% confidence interval [0.104,0.164]\nthen Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, hailed by grassroots campaigners as the right candidate\nto take over \u201cthe good works already started by Muhammadu Buhari\u201d [320]. In contrast, the\n#buharitrain hashtag is used on social media to criticise president Buhari\u2019s railway project\nbetween the capital city of Abuja and its airport, with the investment considered a failure\n82\n[321].\nThe hashtags used by the Brazilian community highlight a desire from users to connect\nwith their peers on Koo (#koobrasil and #sdv, Portuguese slang for \u201cfollow me back\u201d on\nsocial platforms). This is further suggested by the prominence of hashtags related to Elon\nMusk\u2019s purchase of Twitter (#elonmusktwitter, #layoffs, #riptwitter). The initial migra-\ntion indeed occupied a significant space in the Brazilian conversation, with other prominent\nhashtags related to the linguistic pun that triggered the migration to Koo (#brasilnokoo,\n#tomandonokoo) [26]. Unlike the Indian and Nigerian communities, none of the most\nprevalent hashtags in the Brazilian community are related to contemporary political top-\nics. Instead, mentions of the 2022 FIFA World Cup (#copadomundo2022, #fifaworldcup,\n#vaibrasil) and general conversations (#memes, #humor, #art) are more common. These\nresults highlight that the Brazilian migration, unlike the Indian and the Nigerian ones, was\nnot initially politically motivated.\nOverall, the hashtags indicate that the main communities on Koo were all involved in\nconversations relating to the events which triggered their communities\u2019 respective migrations\nto Koo. This highlights the impact that social media deplatforming can have on online\ndiscourses [89]. The stark difference in the prominence of political hashtags between the\nBrazilian community and the Nigerian / Indian communities underlines that the initial\nmotivations leading to a platform migration can be both political and apolitical, and can\nheavily impact the dominant discourses that subsequently emerge on alt-tech platforms.\nHindi English Nigerian\nEnglish P\nortuguese\nHash\ntag Ratio (%) Hash\ntag Ratio (%) Hash\ntag Ratio (%) Hash\ntag Ratio (%)\nk\noooftheday 0.77 k\noooftheday 0.62 nigeria\n5.41 k\noobrasil 4.46\ncomedy\n0.72 india\n0.37 letsk\noo 3.38 brasilnok\noo 3.78\nmemes\n0.71 memes\n0.32 Nigeria\n2.34 k\noo 3.77\nmemeoftheda\ny 0.71 India\n0.31 ban\ntwitter 1.42 copadom\nundo2022 3.61\ndailymemes\n0.42 k\noo 0.31 k\nano 1.32 brasil\n2.94\nBudgetmemes\n0.37 comedy\n0.30 k\nanoconnect 1.14 tomandonok\noo 2.56\nSain\ntRampalJi 0.31 k\nooforindia 0.29 k\noo 1.04 meme\n1.57\nHindiNews\n0.29 memeoftheda\ny 0.28 k\naduna 1.01 k\noonobrasil 1.42\nk\noo 0.25 narendramo\ndi 0.27 lagos\n0.95 ript\nwitter 1.30\nSan\ntRampalJiMaharaj 0.25 motiv\nation 0.25 arew\napeeps 0.87 memes\n1.13\nSat_Bhakti_Sandesh*\n0.24 dailymemes\n0.25 nigeriat\nwitterban 0.82 elonm\nusktwitter 0.79\nindia\n0.24 trending\n0.23 k\nooyouropinion 0.81 h\numor 0.78\nMpNews\n0.20 Budget2022\n0.20 june12\n0.80 la\nyoffs 0.77\nen\ntertainment 0.20 Budgetmemes\n0.19 arew\nakooconnect 0.78 k\noobr 0.75\nNa\nvabharat 0.19 Cric\nket 0.18 ifollo\nwback 0.67 fifa\nworldcup 0.75\nNan\n0.19 news\n0.18 Osin\nbajoDay 0.67 copadom\nundo 0.64\nk\nooforindia 0.18 CO\nVID19 0.18 co\nvid19 0.66 v\naibrasil 0.56\niplauction2022\n0.18 Sain\ntRampalJi 0.17 Buhari\n0.64 Brasil\n0.54\nnarendramo\ndi 0.18 San\ntRampalJiMaharaj 0.17 Arew\na 0.64 sdv\n0.54\nk\nookiyakya 0.18 life\n0.15 buharitrain\n0.63 art\n0.53\nTable 5.4: Top hashtags used on Koo.

The whole dataset was collected via Koo\u2019s undocumented\npublic API.\nOur analysis highlights the growth of a multi-lingual, cross-country online ecosystem,\nwith collective migrations to the platform often spearheaded by influential politicians. Many\nnarratives on the platform related to the events which triggered the initial migrations to Koo,\nresulting in prominent debates on the national political landscape of India and Nigeria, and\nto a lesser extent Brazil. For India, Koo content was heavily biased in support of the ruling\nBJP party. In contrast, both the Nigerian and Brazilian communities on Koo shared pro-\nand anti-Government content, although the Brazilian Koo discussion was less political than\nthe others.\nThese collective migrations highlight how the success of an alt-tech fringe platform can\nbe intimately linked to the decisions made by mainstream platforms and to platform- or\nregulator-driven deplatforming events (e.g., because Twitter banned users, or because regu-\nlators banned Twitter) [89]. Catering to these communities, Koo had become a prominent\nvenue for political and social debates for several communities. However, despite a lack of news\nmedia and content diversity, and unlike most alt-tech fringe platforms, Koo had had success\nin attracting a politically heterogeneous user-base beyond India in both Nigeria and Brazil.\nThis sets Koo apart from other emerging platforms based outside the US - especially those\nin China and Russia where politicians have emphasised the need for \u201cInternet sovereignty\u201d\n[322] - in that their ambition is to expand beyond their home jurisdiction. Consequently,\na platform like Koo has the potential to challenge the current dominance of US-based so-\ncial media platforms, a change which may have important consequences for social media\nregulation.\nWe anticipate that this dataset will support further research investigating digital ecosys-\ntems based outside the US, and how they impact political campaigning and news sharing.\nThis is particularly important given the role Koo played in the 2024 Indian elections, which\ntook place from April 19 to June 1 [323]. A study reports that the platform\u2019s moderation\nteam did not react to openly hostile content, even after it was reported by the researchers\n[324]. With the hateful content reported targeting mostly female politicians and the Mus-\nlim community, this is further evidence that Koo allowed divisive and hateful content to\nproliferate on their service.\nFinally, given Koo\u2019s linguistic diversity, we hope that our dataset will motivate researchers\nto further develop computational tools for studying social media narratives and news media\nsharing in underrepresented languages. This work will be crucial to enable a robust analysis\nof the online news media ecosystem, misinformation, and its potential impact on political\ncampaigns across diverse markets.\n84\nChapter 6\nHow Language, Culture, and Geography\nshape Online Dialogue: Insights from\nKoo\nIntroduction\nThe social media ecosystem, which has historically been Western-focused [325], has evolved\nsignificantly in recent years, with a rapidly growing number of the active users from non-\nWestern countries and the Global South [326]. Despite this shift in demographics, major\nsocial media platforms such as Twitter (now X) and Facebook lack adequate support for\nmany major vernacular languages [327] (e.g., in South-East Asia [328]), with platforms con-\ntinuing to prioritise Western audiences. For instance, investments into English-language\ncontent moderation on X, Facebook and Instagram still heavily outstrip investments into\nmoderation tools for other language\u2019s [329], indicating that platforms are less equipped to\ntackle, and are (arguably) less concerned about, harmful content posted in languages other\nthan English. This is despite documented evidence that social media can play a key role\nin election campaigns, and the fact that India, the World\u2019s largest democracy which went\nthrough a major political election in June 2024, has become the largest market in terms\nof users for many leading social platforms including Instagram [330], Youtube [331] and\nFacebook [332].\nThis persistent failure to support many communities beyond the West was the raison\nd\u2019etre of Koo, the Indian-based social platform discussed in the previous chapter. Koo\naimed to champion a \u201clanguage-first\u201d approach, where each user is able to express themselves\nin their native language when connecting with their peers [333]. By upscaling their auto-\ntranslate tool, Koo aimed to offer an inclusive experience to speakers of less widely utilised\nlanguages, a feature not prioritised on the dominant US-based platforms. Indicative of this,\nKoo used to support 20 of India\u2019s 22 official languages, whereas X (previously Twitter)\n85\nonly supports 5 [334]. By appealing to political leaders across countries, mostly from India,\nNigeria and Brazil, including some who have criticised US-based social media platforms,\nKoo had managed to attract a geographically diverse user-base, becoming the second largest\nmicroblogging platform globally after X [282, 335] before its shut down in July 2024 [194].\nAs such, it occupied an influential position in the social media ecosystem and offers a unique\nopportunity to study the role of language on social media.\nAlthough often defined as an alt-tech platform, Koo had attracted a more international\nuser base than US-based alt-tech platforms [130, 241, 336] leading to a more diverse com-\nmunity. Here, we extend this work by focusing explicitly on the role that language plays in\nshaping the structure of a non-Western social platform.\nPrevious social media studies have considered the role of language in shaping online\ninteractions, but not in the context of India. Researchers have studied linguistic trends on\nTwitter (now X) and found that English-speaking posts were dominant on the platform when\nit mostly attracted users from Western nations [337, 338], whereas the usage of English be-\ncame less prevalent when considering non-Western countries [339, 340]. Moreover, following\nthe growth of communities outside English-speaking nations, different linguistic communi-\nties were shown to interact differently with a social platform\u2019s features, leading to distinct\nsocial structures [341]. However, despite the subsequent globalisation of social media, the\nformation of dyadic ties on Twitter was found to be strongly correlated with the linguistic\nbackground of a user, even between different English-speaking countries [298, 342]. Studies\nhave also considered the influence of bilingual social media users on interaction networks,\nand whether users post in languages other than a platforms dominant language [343 ,344].\nLanguage diversity was further quantified by using geolocation data to map the language di-\nversity in the Greater Manchester [345]. More recently, studies have compared literacy levels\nacross regions on Facebook [346]. Our research contributes to this literature by studying an\nonline platform striving to host vernacular languages, in the hope to harbour a sustainable\nmulti-lingual community.\nWith 22 nationally-recognised languages, and over 100 languages with more than 10,000\nnative speakers, India is a unique case study to assess the impact of linguistic pluralism\non user-to-user interactions online. India\u2019s linguistic history has been the focus of several\nstudies, looking into the national linguistic landscape [347], the patterns of communication\n[348] and the socio-economic ramifications of a complex linguistic environment [349], but\nmany of these methods have not been applied in the context of social media. Moreover, the\nrich linguistic composition of India also allows for an analysis of language use at a national\nscale, before looking at linguistic communities across several countries. Similar observations\nare valid for Nigeria, one of the other countries where Koo was adopted by government\nofficials, where multilingualism plays a major role in social interactions in several areas\n[350], with about 500 vernacular languages spoken across the country [351].\nIn the remainder of this chapter we first assess the impact of the various collective mi-\ngrations to Koo which shaped the platform into a multilingual venue. We then study how\n86\npolitical incentives to migrate to Koo led to different degrees of user engagement over time.\nAfterwards, we look at the topology of the interaction network, while assessing the impact of\nthe language barrier to foster cross-cultural communities. Finally, we look at user mobility\nacross linguistic landscapes and how this relates to the richness of a community\u2019s online\nconversation, as well as the shared discourse between language pairs. Our findings suggest\nthat linguistic and cultural factors were instrumental in bridging communities on Koo, with\nfew interactions taking place across communities with different linguistic backgrounds.\nResults\nPlatform migration and user retention\nWe begin by examining Koo\u2019s popularity over time in the online ecosystem. Figure 6.1 shows\nthe daily number of registrations on Koo, from the launch of the platform in 2020 until early\n2023. Major political and social events, which had an impact on Koo\u2019s outreach, are marked\nas dashed lines.\nThe first significant peak in registrations can be seen in February 2021. India was in the\nmidst of the farmers\u2019 protest, a popular movement against a new set of laws adopted by the\nParliament of India in September 2020. These events triggered a conflict between the Indian\ngovernment and Twitter (now X) after BJP (the ruling political party) officials pressured\nTwitter to ban accounts linked to the popular movement [352]. Members of the government\nand BJP supporters in India subsequently signed up to Koo, as Twitter did not comply with\ntheir requests, and invited their community to follow suit [353]. As seen on the figure, the\npolitical movement managed to increase Koo\u2019s user base substantially [190]. The platform\u2019s\nwillingness to comply with content take down orders issued by the government made Koo\nmore attractive to BJP politicians, thereby cementing the dominance of BJP narratives on\nthe platform [353].\nThe second burst in registrations dates from June 2021, when Nigerian then-President\nMuhammadu Buhari banned Twitter from the country and registered on Koo with members\nof his government [354], after Buhari\u2019s tweets were deleted for inciting violence against\nhis political opponents [355]. Koo experienced a wide adoption from government officials in\nNigeria, prompting the platform to hire vernacular speakers for content moderation purposes\nin Nigeria [25]. The government was also followed by a large number of Nigerian users who\nsubsequently signed up to Koo, leading to an uptick in registrations. However, Koo had little\nsuccess in attracting Nigerian celebrities or influencers, unlike in India where the platforms\ngained support from Bollywood actors and prominent cricket players [290]. Previous research\nhas shown that celebrities\u2019 endorsement can catalyse a massive migration towards alt-tech\nplatforms [89].\nThe last major peak in registrations took place in November 2022, shortly after Twitter\nwas purchased by Elon Musk.

The dashed lines indicate, in order: the migration of BJP\npoliticians and their supporters following the Indian Farmers\u2019 Protest in February 2021; the\nmigration of the Nigerian government after Twitter was banned in the country in June 2021;\nthe Brazilian community joining Koo in November 2022 after Elon Musk purchased X.\nfollowers on Twitter, advertised his migration to Koo on Twitter (now X), which led to his\nfollowers signing up to the platform as well [26]. This collective movement was strengthened\nwhen Brazilian President Lula also registered on Koo [296]. In total, Koo\u2019s user base grew\nsubstantially in Brazil, with the Koo app downloaded over 1 million times in the space of 48\nhours [356].\nThese three events have shaped the major linguistic communities on Koo. As shown in\nthe previous chapter, each collective migration had temporarily boosted the daily activity on\nKoo, allowing the platform to become a serious competitor in the social media marketplace.\nA breakdown of the registration numbers broken down by language is also provided in the\nAppendix, showcasing the influx of Hindi, Nigerian English, and Portuguese users.\nTo assess the success of linguistic migrations, we measure user retention, i.e. how many\nusers within a cohort are still active after a given number of days. Throughout our analysis,\nwe match each user with the language they used the most when posting and commenting on\nthe platform.\nFigure 6.2 shows the Kaplan-Meier estimator, a tool used to visualise the retention curve\nof a population over time, computed for each linguistic community on Koo. Given a linguistic\ncommunity, the Kaplan-Meier estimator indicates how many users were still active on Koo,\n88\na given number of days after they registered on the platform. The figure indicates that\nboth Brazilian and Nigerian communities have a much lower retention than other linguistic\ncommunities on Koo, with 50% of the cohort becoming inactive within 16 days and 23 days\nof signing up to the platform, respectively. In contrast, it took 131 days to reach the same\nlevel of user retention when considering Hindi-speaking users, thus highlighting a strong\ndifference in user engagement across linguistic communities and countries. The smaller\nlinguistic clusters also display a higher survival rate than the Brazilian and Nigerian users,\nwhich suggest that the sustainability of a community does not only depend on its population\nsize.\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\nDays0.00.20.40.60.81.0RetentionHindi\nEnglishPortuguese English (Nigeria)\nFigure 6.2: Heterogeneous user retention for various linguistic communities.\nKaplan-Meier survival curves for the main linguistic communities on Koo, showing the frac-\ntion of users who remained active after a given number of days. For each user, we define \u201cday\nzero\u201d as being their registration date on Koo. Other linguistic communities are displayed\nin grey. The retention curve is displayed until the day that fewer than 1% of users from a\nlinguistic community remain active.\nThe lack of long-term adoption in the Nigerian community can be explained by a pop-\nular resistance to the Twitter ban that was instated by Buhari\u2019s government in June 2021.\nNigerian users managed to bypass the ban shortly after it was instated, with VPN usage\nbecoming more common nation-wide [354]. Moreover, Koo did not receive sustained support\nfrom the Nigerian government. Muhammadu Buhari lifted the ban on Twitter in January\n2022, after the platform and his government settled on an agreement [ 294]. Buhari stopped\nbeing active on Koo shortly afterwards, as did most of the government members who joined\nthe platform. Koo\u2019s monthly active users in Nigeria fell by over 90%, suggesting that the\nplatform failed to establish a foothold as sustainable as their popularity in India [295].\nIn the case of Brazil, the migration was not, primarily, triggered by political motivations\nin the same way as for India and Nigeria, but rather by a linguistic pun involving the word\n89\n\u201ckoo\u201d in Portuguese, although Brazilian President Lula did join the platform during its initial\ngrowth-phase. However, in general, the Brazilian community and Brazilian celebrities did\nnot stay as engaged on Koo, when compared to celebrities from India [357]. Both Felipe\nNeto and Lula, who were the main drivers of the Brazilian migration on Koo, stayed active\non Twitter and their followers can therefore still follow their feed without requiring access to\nKoo. Previous research has shown that users are less active on alt-tech platforms if they can\nstill reach out to their followers via a mainstream outlet [89]. As of November 2023, Lula is\nstill sporadically active on Koo, whereas Felipe Neto\u2019s last interaction dates to May 2023.\nThese results suggest that collective migrations to an alternative social platform can have\nmixed levels of success, depending on the motivations triggering the migration and the degree\nof approval it garners across the community. The Indian migration exemplifies the birth of\na sustainable community on Koo, as it was led by government officials and garnered support\nfrom both national celebrities and BJP supporters. The Nigerian government followed a\ndifferent pattern, where the low support for the X ban outside of Buhari\u2019s supporters led to\na short-lived retention for most Nigerian users who signed up on Koo. In the same fashion,\nthe Brazilian community shows a low level of user retention, which can be explained by a\nlack of social incentives to shift the political discourse to an alternative platform, and away\nfrom the dominant US-based platforms.\nLanguage-use in the Koo interaction network\nWe now focus on user interactions on Koo and the landscape that emerges on a platform\nwhere many languages and cultures coexist, following individual migration decisions.\nFigure 6.3A shows an interaction network, where two users are connected if they inter-\nacted (i.e. one of the users liked, shared or commented the other\u2019s post) on Koo, with the\nweight of an edge proportional to the number of interactions between a pair of users; for\nsimplicity we treat the interaction network as undirected. The network layout, generated\nwith a force-directed graph drawing method, highlights the strong segregation between sev-\neral linguistic communities: Portuguese-speaking users (yellow) mostly interact with other\nPortuguese-speaking users, and likewise, Hindi-speaking users (blue) mostly interact with\nother Hindi-speaking users. On the other hand, the English-speaking cohort (green) acts as\na bridge between Hindi, Portuguese and Nigerian English speakers (purple), as well as the\nsmaller cohorts that can be seen in the periphery of the graph.\nThe network indicates a strong homophilic behaviour, meaning that users will mainly\nengage with members of their own linguistic community. Koo\u2019s auto-translate feature, which\nallows users to translate any post to the language of their choice, does not seem to mitigate\nthe language assortativity that we observe on the platform. Homophilic patterns have been\nobserved in many online social spaces, for example when considering information diffusion\ndynamics [358], community formation [359], and in political interaction networks [298].\nWe can highlight this homophilic behaviour by computing the k-cores of the network.\n90\nAHindi\nEnglish (Nigeria)English\nPortugueseOther\nB\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nk12EntropyC\nKoo\nNull ModelFigure 6.3: The Koo interaction network and the impact of linguistic homophily\non the network\u2019s structure. Each node represents a user, and two nodes are connected\nif one of the users interacted with the other user\u2019s content. Users are coloured accord-\ning to their modal language on the platform. The main linguistic communities are the\nHindi-speaking users (blue), English-speaking users (green), Nigerian users (purple) and\nPortuguese-speaking users (yellow). The layout is generated by using a force-directed graph\ndrawing method. A) The total interaction network. B) The k-core of the interaction network\nwith k= 150 . C) The Shannon entropy of the modal language of the nodes belonging to the\nk-core of the graph, with respect to the value of k. The entropy of the interaction network\nis compared to the value obtained in a null model, where we shuffle the modal language\nassociated to each node in the network.\nGiven a network, its k-core for k\u2208Nis defined as the sub-graph in which all vertices\nhave a degree greater than or equal to k.k-core analysis offers a deeper view into the\ntightly connected components of a network, therefore identifying the nodes that are strongly\ninterconnected or play an influential role in the overall network structure [360]. Figure 6.3B\nshows the interaction network from figure 6.3A but filtered so that only the k\u2265150core is\nshown. This threshold allows us to filter out the periphery of the network, by only keeping\nthe 5% most strongly connected nodes of the network.\nThis visualisation offers a better overview of the tightly interconnected components within\nthe interaction network, with a strong core of English-speaking and Hindi-speaking users.\nConversely, the Brazilian and Nigerian clusters are more isolated. The k-core also highlights\n91\nthat users belonging to smaller linguistic communities are scarcely included in the core of the\nnetwork, with 95% of the core users belonging to the Hindi, English, Nigerian English and\nPortuguese-speaking clusters. This analysis further underlines that highly connected clusters\nmostly involve users who speak one of the dominant languages on the platform. Looking at\nthe English-speaking community, we note that it is principally connected to Hindi speakers\nin the k-core, highlighting the instrumental role that the English language plays in Indian\npolitical communications [361]. On the other hand, both the Nigerian and the Brazilian\ncommunities dominantly communicate in their native language and are therefore isolated in\nthek-core.\nTo quantify the connection between linguistic communities, we generate the k-core for\nall values of kfor which the k-core exists. We retrieve the modal language of each vertex\nincluded in the k-core and compute the Shannon entropy, to evaluate whether the k-core\nencompasses a diverse range of languages or is primarily dominated by a few major languages\n[362, 363]. Once we have computed the k-core, we retrieve the modal language of each user\nincluded in the core and calculate the entropy of the list of languages. Figure 6.3C displays\nthe resulting entropy with respect to k. We notice that higher values of klead to a lower\nentropy in the language composition of the k-core, suggesting that dense interactions on Koo\ntake place mostly within homogeneous linguistic clusters.\nTo ensure that the lack of diversity in high-degree interactions is a characteristic of the\ninteraction network on Koo, and not an erroneous finding, we define a null-model of the\nnetwork, where the modal language is shuffled for the nodes in the network (preserving the\nlanguage prevalence distribution), and the Shannon entropy is computed again for each value\nofk. Figure 6.3C displays the median Shannon entropy for each value of k, after running\nthe null-model 1000 times. We notice that the entropy for the null-model does not sharply\ndecrease for higher values of k, which reveals that this sharp decline in language diversity\nwithin the k-core is indeed a distinctive feature of the Koo interaction network. These\nfindings further indicate that cross-linguistic interactions on Koo are rare with respect to\nsame-language interactions.\nTo measure the prevalence of a linguistic community within the k-core for any value of\nk, vertices in the network can also be defined by their coreness, i.e., the maximum value of\nkfor which they still belong to the k-core. In the Appendix, we show the distribution of the\ncoreness of the users belonging to each linguistic community. Our analysis reveals that only\nHindi- and English-speaking users are included in the highest cores. This result indicates\nthat, despite the presence of a rich linguistic landscape on the platform, strong interaction\nties on Koo are mainly driven by linguistic homophily, and that cross-linguistic interactions\nare rare.\nLanguage homophily and multilingual activity\nThe structure of the interaction network indicates that the linguistic background of a user\nstrongly influenced their interaction patterns on Koo. Previous studies have highlighted\n92\nthat many ties in social networks are strongly assortative, i.e., they connect individuals who\nshare similar attributes in terms of cultural background or social status [364]. Language\nassortativity has been previously found to influence mating decisions [365], friendship ties\namong adolescents [366], and political communication between countries using a common\nlanguage [298].\nWhen considering a diverse population such as the Koo user base, a question to consider\nis the interaction patterns for members of minority linguistic groups. Previous studies have\nshown that minority groups in organisations rely on out-group interactions to be connected\nto the centre of the network [367], whereas belonging to an underrepresented social group\nleads to a stronger in-group identity in friendship networks [368]. As such, we will next look\nat linguistic behaviours on Koo, by measuring the propensity for users to interact within\ntheir linguistic community on the platform. We will also evaluate a user\u2019s likelihood of using\ntheir modal language when interacting with their peers on Koo.\nTo measure a user\u2019s adherence to their modal language relative to their propensity to\nuse other languages, we define the commitment: given a user with N posts in their modal\nlanguages and M posts in other languages, the commitment is given by\nC=N\nN+M. (6.1)\nCommitment has previously been used in linguistic studies to assess the adoption of new\nlinguistic norms, indicating that outdated norms are still persistently used by a minority of\nthe population [369 ]. Similar findings have been highlighted in ethnographic studies looking\nat the adoption of new spelling rules in both Spanish and English-speaking nations [370, 371].\nThe literature therefore suggests the potential for smaller-scale communities to survive in a\nlinguistic setup, despite the rise of a dominant linguistic framework.\nThe average commitment of a linguistic community, plotted against its population size,\nis displayed on Figure 6.4A. We notice a strong tendency for the average commitment of\na user to their modal language to increase as the population size of their community in-\ncreases. Among the highlighted communities, Nigerian English speakers display the highest\naverage commitment ( C= 0.90), and English-speaking users also display a high level of com-\nmitment ( C= 0.84), despite their role as a bridging community between other languages.\nPortuguese and Hindi speakers also have a high commitment ( C= 0.87andC= 0.88, re-\nspectively), which indicates that their communication on Koo mostly relied on their modal\nlanguage, emphasising the absence of cross-language interactions. However, smaller linguis-\ntic communities display a lower commitment to their modal language. For example, Indian\ncommunities, such as Odia speakers ( C= 0.73), and non-Indian clusters such as Spanish\nspeakers ( C= 0.74), are less committed to their modal language. This finding highlights the\nneed to communicate in other languages in order to be part of a community on the platform.\nThe attractiveness of a language has previously been modelled by its number of speakers\n[372] suggesting that smaller linguistic communities are less likely to attract new speakers,\n93\nthus fuelling their need to use other languages in order to be connected to core conversations\non the platform.\n101103105\nUsers0.40.60.81.0Commitment (avg)A\n101103105\nUsers0.5\n0.00.5Homophily (avg)B Hindi\nEnglish (Nigeria)\nEnglish\nPortuguese\nOther\nFigure 6.4: EI-Homophily and language commitment and the impact of a commu-\nnity\u2019s size on its sustainability. Number of users belonging to a linguistic community\nplotted against A) their commitment to their modal language, and B) their EI homophily\nindex. Both metrics are averaged by the number of users for whom the language measured\nis their modal language. The coloured dots represent the Hindi-speaking community (blue),\nEnglish (green), Portuguese (yellow) and Nigerian English (purple). The dashed line indi-\ncates an average homophily equal to 0.\nThe high level of commitment observed for the major linguistic communities, along with\nthe topology of the interaction network, shows that there is a strong trend for interactions\non the platform to involve two users with a similar linguistic background. To measure\nwhether social interactions on Koo mostly took place within the confines of homogeneous\nlinguistic clusters, we use the External-Internal (EI) homophily index [373]: given a node in\nthe interaction network with E edges to their out-group (in this case, interactions with an-\nother linguistic community) and I edges with their in-group (members of the same linguistic\ncommunity), their EI homophily index is given by\nEI=E\u2212I\nE+I. (6.2)\nA node which only interacts within their in-group (same language) therefore has EI=\n\u22121, whereas a node which only interacts with their out-group (different languages) has\nEI= 1. The EI-homophily index has previously been used to measure people\u2019s tendency to\ninteract with their politically-aligned peers on social media [374] and those sharing a similar\nvaccination status [375], with both studies showing an overall trend for people to cluster in\nhomogeneous groups. A social network where the majority of interactions are intra-group\nlinks (i.e. with the EI-homophily index close to -1) is referred to as being homophilic , whereas\n94\nit is referred to as heterophilic if the network displays several inter-group interactions (i.e.\nwith an EI-homophily index close to 1).\nThe EI-homophily, averaged for each linguistic community by considering the modal\nlanguage of each user, is shown in Figure 6.4B, and plotted against the size of each language\u2019s\npopulation. We notice that small communities have a positive homophily index, indicating\nthat members of small linguistic clusters interact mostly with other linguistic communities.\nOn the other hand, with the exception of the English-speaking community, larger linguistic\ncommunities are more involved in in-group interactions, leading to a negative EI-homophily\nindex. For example, Portuguese-speaking users have an average EI-homophily index of \u22120.94,\nwhereas it is equal to \u22120.66for the Hindi-speaking users. This finding highlights the existence\nof siloed communities on Koo, where users\u2019 interactions were strongly influenced by language\nsimilarities. The strong assortativity with respect to language is further displayed in the\nlayout of the interaction network in Figure 6.3A, where we see how disjointed the Portuguese-\nspeaking and Hindi-speaking communities are with respect to other linguistic communities.\nLooking at the average EI-homophily index for English-speaking communities in Figure\n6.4B, we notice a stark difference between Nigerian English speakers ( EI=\u22120.64) and other\nEnglish speakers ( EI=\u22120.15). This can also been observed in the interaction network\nin Figure 6.3A, where Nigerian English-speaking users are disconnected from the core of\nthe network, whereas English speakers are strongly involved in cross-language interactions,\nleading to a higher average EI-homophily index than for Hindi and Portuguese speakers.\nThus, the English language acted as a lingua franca on Koo, allowing users from diverse\nlinguistic backgrounds to engage in inter-community interactions. However, the contrast\nin homophily between Nigerian English and English speakers also highlights that language\nwas not the only factor playing a central role in shaping the interaction network. Cultural\nsimilarities are also influential in bridging users together on a social platform. Communities\ncan be structured around specific salient topics of conversation related to the cultural and\npolitical landscape of a country, another feature of a platform hosting diverse demographics\nthat we investigate below. Moreover, it is likely that most of the English speakers on Koo\n(excluding those who speak Nigerian English) had an Indian focus, due to the ubiquity of\nthe English language in India\u2019s public affairs [376].\nThese findings can also be confirmed by looking at the distribution of the EI-Homophily\nindex for each linguistic community, displayed in Figure 6.5. In line with our previous\nobservations, we notice that a majority of users from the Nigerian, Brazilian and Hindi-\nspeaking communities have an EI-Homophily index of -1, and were therefore only interacting\nwith members of their linguistic community. Meanwhile, English-speaking users have a more\nbalanced distributions, whereas smaller linguistic communities are more likely to aggregate\nat positive values for the index, therefore indicating their propensity to interact outside of\ntheir linguistic cluster.\nThe homophilic patterns observed in the interaction network suggest that communication\nacross linguistic communities was rare on Koo. However, our analysis does not take into\n95\n1.5\n 1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\nHomophily01234567pdfEnglish\nEnglish (Nigeria)Hindi\nPortugueseFigure 6.5: Distribution of the EI-Homophily index, for each linguistic community on Koo.\nThe major linguistic communities are highlighted in colours, whereas all the other commu-\nnities are plotted in gray.\naccount users who communicated on the platform in more than one language, and therefore\nbelonged to more than one linguistic community on the platform. To measure the propensity\nfor users to switch between languages, we map languages as the nodes of a network, with\nweighted edges representing the number of users who posted in both languages on Koo. This\nlayout follows the principle of a global language network (GLN), which allows us to quantify\nindirect communications between pairs of languages by looking at the number of speakers\nthey share [377]. By considering the number of modal speakers in two linguistic communities\nand the number of speakers they share, we use the phi coefficient to measure the association\nbetween the two languages. For two languages iandj, their phi coefficient \u03a6ij[377] is given\nby:\n\u03a6ij=MijN\u2212MiMj/radicalbig\n(MiMj(N\u2212Mi)(N\u2212Mj)), (6.3)\nwith Nbeing the total number of users, MiandMjbeing the number of speakers of lan-\nguage iandjrespectively, and Mijbeing the number of bilingual speakers for languages i\nandj. A positive phi coefficient indicates that the number of bilingual speakers between\nlanguages iandjis higher than what could be expected based on their representation in\nour dataset, whereas a negative value indicates that the co-occurrence of both languages is\nunderrepresented relative to the size of the communities. This metric therefore allows us to\nassess whether there is a stronger connection between two linguistic communities on Koo,\nthan is expected due to chance alone.\nTo ensure that the link between two linguistic communities is significant, we use the t\n96\nstatistic, defined as:\ntij=\u03a6ij\u221a\nD\u22122/radicalBig\n1\u2212\u03a62\nij, (6.4)\nwhere the degree of freedom Dis defined as D=min(Mi, Mj). As all the linguistic com-\nmunities we consider in our analysis have at least 20 modal speakers, we set D= 20. By\nsetting p= 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the number of links between two\nlanguages in the global language network is not statistically significant, if tij\u22651.72(one-\ntailed t-test). Any significant link in the network indicates that there are significantly more\nbilingual speakers between two languages than expected by chance.\nFigure 6.6A displays the value of the phi coefficient between the main languages used on\nKoo. We notice that there is a positive association between the Indian languages used on Koo.\nDespite being strongly homophilic, the Hindi-speaking community has a positive correlation\nwith several Indian languages, such as Gujarati and Marathi. Smaller linguistic communities\nin India also show a strong symbiosis in the network: languages such as Telugu, Kannada,\nTamil and Assamese are strongly connected to one another, indicating that speakers of less\nprominent Indian languages on the platform were more likely to also communicate on Koo\nusing another national language. Our findings are aligned with the results of the 2011 Indian\nlanguage census, indicating a large number of bilingual and trilingual speakers among the\nsmaller linguistic communities in the country [378]. On the other hand, both the Nigerian\nEnglish and Portuguese-speaking communities have a negative correlation with respect to\nevery other linguistic community, English excepted.\nFigure 6.6B shows the results of the t-statistic, with significant links in the global language\nnetwork highlighted in blue. We notice that both the Brazilian and Nigerian communities\nshare non-significant links with the smaller linguistic communities on Koo, indicating that\nthere is not a meaningful number of users who used both Portuguese or Nigerian English and\nanother language on Koo - with the exception of English, which is significantly correlated to\nall languages. These results further suggest that the Brazilian and Nigerian communities were\nstrongly isolated when it comes to language mobility, whereas a shared cultural background\nenabled Indian language speakers to navigate through different linguistic communities. While\nenhancing the access to posts written in a user\u2019s non-native language, the auto-translate\nfeature on Koo did not appear to incentivise users to interact in languages outside their\nhome country.\nDiscourse richness and similarity across languages\nWhat about content? A natural question is whether stronger ties between two linguistic\ncommunities also implies that their respective discourses were similar. Moreover, some of\nthe linguistic communities being larger than others, we hypothesise that a larger community\nshould have a richer discourse. Studies have shown that the size of a community defines its\npropensity to sway the discussion topics in another community [379], and that nurturing a\nlocal discourse can allow a local community to claim their own governance [380].\n97\nAssamese\nBengali\nEnglish\nEnglish (Nigeria)\nGujarati\nHindi\nKannada\nMarathi\nPanjabi\nPortuguese\nT amil\nT eluguAssameseBengaliEnglishEnglish (Nigeria)GujaratiHindiKannadaMarathiPanjabiPortugueseT amilT eluguA\nAssamese\nBengali\nEnglish\nEnglish (Nigeria)\nGujarati\nHindi\nKannada\nMarathi\nPanjabi\nPortuguese\nT amil\nT eluguAssameseBengaliEnglishEnglish (Nigeria)GujaratiHindiKannadaMarathiPanjabiPortugueseT amilT eluguB\n0.5\n0.00.5Figure 6.6: Global language network and multilingual activity.

A link is considered significant if\np <0.05.\nTo answer these questions, we use diversity measures defined in ecology, which were de-\nfined to assess the richness of an environment by looking at the presence of various species\nand their respective prevalence [381], as well as how often these species can be found across\ndifferent environments [382]. These methods were also previously used in linguistics research,\nfor example to measure linguistic diversity between Canadian cities [383 ]. For our analysis,\nwe consider hashtags used within a linguistic community as a proxy for the discourse. Hash-\ntags have been shown to occupy a different linguistic function than words, sharing similarities\nacross languages [384], thus allowing us to capture narratives shared by various linguistic\ncommunities on Koo. Hashtags are also a more reliable signal to measure the overlap of\nnarratives across linguistic communities than plain text, as hashtags can be identified with-\nout the need to compare textual data from different languages. Our approach is further\nmotivated by the presence of several low-resource languages - i.e. languages for which the\noverall scientific community lacks a large enough corpus to train NLP models - in our corpus,\nwhich are known to be under-represented in many large language models and can therefore\nlead to unreliable text classification [385].\nTo assess the richness of the discourse within a linguistic community, we use the alpha\ndiversity, a measure used in ecology to quantify the diversity (or richness) of an environment,\nby looking at the species that are included in the observed ecosystem. In our case, we\n98\ncompute the alpha diversity of hashtags used by a linguistic community using the Chao1\nestimator. We can also estimate the propensity for two linguistic communities to discuss\nsimilar topics by computing the beta diversity, another measure that assesses the number\nof species that are found in two different environments. Using the hashtags, we measure\nthe beta diversity of the discourse between two linguistic communities with the Bray-Curtis\ndissimilarity index.\nTo measure the richness of the discourse within a linguistic community, we compute the\nalpha diversity with the Chao1 estimator \u02c6SChao 1, which aims at providing a lower-bound\nestimation of the number of unseen species, in order to assess the total number of unique\nhashtags used by a linguistic community from our observations. The Chao1 estimator is\ndefined as:\n\u02c6SChao 1=/bracelef Bigg\nS+N\u22121\nNs2\n1\n2s2s2>0\nS+N\u22121\nNs1(s1\u22121)\n2s2= 0, (6.5)\nwhere Sis the total number of hashtags, Nis the number of unique hashtags and siis the\nnumber of hashtags that appear at least itimes in the observations. This formula, however,\nonly takes into account hashtags that appear once or twice in a linguistic community. To\nextend the amount of information used to estimate the richness of the conversation, we\ncompute the improved Chao1 estimator \u02c6SiChao 1, which aims at correcting the first-order bias\nof\u02c6SChao 1by also including the number of triplets s3and quadruplets s4. The improved\nChao1 estimator is defined as [386 ]:\n\u02c6SiChao 1=\u02c6SChao 1+N\u22123\n4Ns3\ns4\u00b7max/parenlef big\ns1\u2212N\u22123\nN\u22121s2s3\n2s4,0/parenrigh big\n. (6.6)\nFigure 6.7A shows the improved Chao1 estimator for each linguistic community plot-\nted against its population size. We measure a strong correlation ( R2= 0.92) between the\ntwo variables, with bigger communities displaying a richer use of hashtags than smaller ones.\nThere is, however, a non-negligible fluctuation in the measured richness for linguistic commu-\nnities that share a similar population size, especially when looking at mid-sized communities.\nTo look more closely at this disparity, we display on figure 6.7B the improved Chao1\nestimator per user, plotted against the population size. Points are coloured to highlight\nthe Indian official languages. Interestingly, we notice that for a similar population size, the\nratio is higher for Indian languages than for non-Indian languages (with English, a language\nwidely used in Indian administration, being the exception).\nThese findings suggest that, with similar population sizes, Indian language speakers will\ngive rise to a richer discourse on Koo than a non-Indian based linguistic community. These\nfindings are especially insightful when considering that the Portuguese and Nigerian English\nspeaking users were involved in far less rich conversations than their Indian peers, showcasing\nKoo\u2019s struggle to become a significant microblogging platform outside its native India [295].\n99\nThe presence of a rich discourse among Indian communities does not necessarily indicate\nthe existence of a national cohesion. The \u201cdivide and rule\u201d policy, implemented by British\nimperials in India from 1857 to the country\u2019s independence in 1947, to sow divisions be-\ntween ethnic groups in the country, led to long-standing cultural cleavages [387] and to the\nemergence of a communal, rather than national, sense of identity [388]. We can assess the\ninfluence of these divisions between communities on narrative content using the Bray-Curtis\ndissimilarity index [389 ], a measure of beta diversity, defined as\n\u03b2AB=/summa ion ex \ni|pA\ni\u2212pB\ni|/summa ion ex \ni(pA\ni+pB\ni), (6.7)\nwhere pA\niandpB\nirepresent the relative frequency of hashtag iin the linguistic communities\nA and B, respectively. \u03b2ABprovides us with a measure of the dissimilarity between the two\nenvironments: if the two linguistic communities use no similar hashtags, their dissimilarity\n\u03b2ABwill be 1, whereas it will be equal to 0 if they use exactly the same hashtags.\nFigure 6.7C shows the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the discourse in two linguistic\ncommunities. We notice that the Portuguese and Nigerian communities have a high dissim-\nilarity when compared to the other languages, which indicates that there is a low overlap\nin the hashtags shared by Portuguese and Nigerian English speakers with respect to other\nlinguistic communities. This finding further confirms their status as isolated clusters.\nLooking at the Indian languages, we also notice a higher similarity shared between a\nfew national languages, namely Gujarati, Bengali, Hindi and Marathi. These four languages\nare Indo-Aryan languages, thus sharing more linguistic similarities with each other than\nwith Dravidian languages such as Telugu and Kannada. These results therefore outline the\nexistence of a Sprachbund , a set of languages that share many similarities in their structure\n[390]. This concept seeps within the online discourse on Koo, where we saw a strong affinity\nbetween languages that share similar roots. Overall, Indian languages shared a more similar\ndiscourse with each other than with non-Indian languages on the platform, which might\nexplain why the conversation was richer amongst these communities.\nDiscussion & Conclusion\nIn this chapter, we have analysed the emergence of a multi-lingual ecosystem on Koo, a mi-\ncroblogging platform based in India, which was shaped by successive migrations prompted\nby political and social events in India, Nigeria, and Brazil. We first looked at the impact\nof collective migrations to Koo in India, Nigeria and Brazil, and measured their respective\nsuccess by comparing their impact on the daily registrations on Koo and their user retention\nover time. Second, we looked at the user interaction network and showed a strong linguistic\nsegregation within isolated communities and the propensity for Hindi- and English-speaking\nusers to be more central in the overall network. Third, we measured the average commit-\nment and homophily for each linguistic community, and showed that linguistic communities\n100\nwith larger user-bases are more likely to be self-sufficient and dominantly display in-group\ninteractions, with English being the exception due to its universal use across cultural com-\nmunities. Fourth, we generated the global language network and highlighted the importance\nof linguistic crossovers between Indian languages. In contrast, Portuguese-speaking users\nonly significantly overlap with English speaking users. Finally, we measured the richness\nand dissimilarity of linguistic clusters and noticed a strong interconnection across Indian\nlanguages, which also have a richer discourse than other communities with a comparable\npopulation size.\nOur study offers a first insight into the emergence of a multi-lingual alt-tech platform,\nwhere the co-existence of diverse linguistic communities was driven by independent collective\nmigrations. Despite Koo\u2019s ambitions to unite the non-English speaking world under a single\nbanner, the language divide we measure both in terms of interactions and discourse similarity\nsuggests that these communities were growing concurrently on the platform but without a\nstrong tendency to overlap. While major languages could still thrive and be used by a\nsustainable community, less prevalent languages ended up being marginally used, leading\ntheir speakers to be less involved in the major conversations taking place on the platform.\nThese findings might indicate that minority linguistic communities are disenfranchised from\nthe central political discourse on social media. Previous inquiries have already raised concerns\nabout the access to many public services in India for local language speakers [391]. Koo used\nto support 20 of India\u2019s 22 official languages, in a country with 122 languages listed in the\nnational constitution.\nOur analysis highlights the growth of the digital market in the Global South, which is\noften overlooked by the academic literature. Koo pledged to offer an online space cater-\ning to non-English speaking users and managed to attract key political figures from major\nemerging economies, leading the platform to become a serious competitor to X [392]. More-\nover, our research adds more nuance to the literature on alternative platforms that has been\nmostly focused on right-wing narratives. Koo was used by both the Indian and the Brazil-\nian governments, representing contrasting political orientations. However, the Indian and\nBrazilian communities on Koo were shown to hardly interact with one another, indicating\nscarce engagements across the political spectrum. Koo\u2019s struggles to attract members of po-\nlitical parties other than the BJP and their allies in India highlights the difficulties alt-tech\nplatforms face in building an online space for politically diverse communities [149]. This\nis further exacerbated by the recent rise of policies related to digital sovereignty across a\nnumber of countries, which compromised Koo\u2019s ambition to become a unifying platform for\ncommunities outside the West [393 ].\nOur findings are limited by several factors, which can be explored in future studies. First,\nour analysis is restricted to Koo, which was the most popular microblogging platform based in\nIndia, and the second most popular India-based social platform in general (after ShareChat).\nSocial platforms based in other nations in the Global South may display different structural\npatterns and should also be studied. Future studies may also consider extending our analysis\nto other popular platforms based in India including ShareChat, 2go and Line. Second,\n101\nour analysis relies on the language identified by Koo\u2019s automated system for each post\nand comment on Koo. This may be problematic given that automatic language detection\nhas various levels of reliability depending on the source language [394]. Further work may\nconsider the accuracy of Koo\u2019s language identification pipeline, and whether it results in\nspecific biases in our analysis. Finally, our work focuses on a static overview of Koo\u2019s\ninteraction network by looking at all the user activity that took place over the four years\nstudied. This ensures that we are able to fairly compare diverse linguistic communities who\njoined Koo at different times. However, an analysis of the temporal evolution of communities\non Koo would be equally valuable, in particular to identify how the network evolved following\neach collective migration.\nOverall, our study improves our understanding of social interaction patterns within mul-\ntilingual communities by looking beyond western social platforms. We anticipate that our\nwork will inspire more research on the global social media ecosystem, to ensure that our\nfindings with respect to alternative platforms are nuanced by cultural and linguistic factors.\nFinally, our analysis stresses the need to develop a wider range of tools to analyse social\nmedia content in minority languages, many of which are currently underrepresented on the\ninternet, and understudied by academics.\n102\n0 2 4 6\nUsers (log)0246Alpha Diversity\n(log)AHindi\nEnglish (Nigeria)\nEnglishPortuguese\nOther\n2 4\nUsers (log)0.00.51.01.5Alpha Diversity / UsersBIndian\nOtherAssamese\nBengali\nEnglish\nEnglish (Nigeria)\nGujarati\nHindi\nKannada\nMarathi\nPanjabi\nPortuguese\nT amil\nT eluguAssameseBengaliEnglishEnglish (Nigeria)GujaratiHindiKannadaMarathiPanjabiPortugueseT amilT eluguC\n0.60.70.80.9Figure 6.7: Discourse richness and similarity across linguistic communities on\nKoo.

With the help of extensive datasets, providing detailed in-\nformation on user-to-user interactions and user-generated content within alt-tech platforms,\nthis work provides a timely comparison of the rise of several platforms, each with their own\nambitions and catering to a specific fringe of the population. Our results illuminate several\naspects of user engagement within alt-tech platforms that were previously understudied in\nthe academic literature, and the main findings can be summarised along three main points.\nFirst, we have improved our understanding of the global impact of deplatforming policies,\nby assessing how platforms such as Gettr, Voat and Koo capitalised on their mainstream\ncompetitors\u2019 bans on problematic communities. Each platform managed to attract a sig-\nnificant user base, by advertising their unregulated stance and their laissez-faire attitude\ntowards content that would result in a ban on mainstream platforms. Moreover, the cases of\nJoe Rogan for Gettr, and Felipe Neto for Koo, highlight how online influencers can leverage\ntheir community by prompting a massive migration towards an alternative platform, even\nif it is not politically motivated. These findings raise a lot of debates related to the gover-\nnance of online platforms, and the need to consider the health of the overall ecosystem when\ndeciding to ban a high-profile user.\nSecond, we have provided novel insights regarding the nature of the communities that\nburgeon on alt-tech platforms, more so after a new user cohort migrates to the platform. For\nGettr and Koo, we have highlighted how specific user cohorts stay more engaged over time\non the alt-tech platform, either because they have been banned from established platforms,\nor because the alternative outlet is specifically catering to their needs. Very interestingly, for\nboth Voat and Koo, we have also identified the birth of echo chambers within the platform,\nwhich can be triggered by ideological differences or by language barriers.\nFinally, we have assessed that the rise of the alt-tech ecosystem in the Global South\n104\nfollows similar patterns of engagement than in Western communities. By looking at Koo\u2019s\ninitial growth in India, and its subsequent expansions in Nigeria and Brazil, we stressed out\nthe role that alt-tech platforms play in hosting nationalist political movements, after they\nran into contentious situations with mainstream platforms\u2019 moderation teams.\nAside from highlighting the alt-tech platforms\u2019 opportunistic attitude towards deplat-\nforming policies, our research also provided some insights on the role they play in radicalis-\ning their communities, in an online environment promoting free speech and amplifying fringe\nopinions. As such, Voat became a central hub in the dissemination and the study of the\nQAnon mythos [30], whereas Gettr was used by Bolsonaro supporters to sustain the threat\nof an election fraud, leading to the insurrection that targeted the Brazilian parliament in\nJanuary 2023. We hope that our work will motivate more research to look at the online social\nmedia environment as a whole, rather than focusing on a single platform in the ecosystem.\nOur main findings provide some explanations with respect to the rise of the alt-tech\necosystem over the last few years, as it morphed into an online venue for extremist political\nmovements to gather support from their followers, either by crowdsourcing their actions or by\norganising demonstrations and riots. More fundamentally, our research can be summarised\nin three central findings.\nAlt-tech platforms capitalise on massive deplatforming events from established platforms,\nby welcoming disenfranchised communities.\nIn chapters 3, 4 and 6, we established that alt-tech platforms\u2019 popularity primarily stem\nfrom their welcoming attitude towards communities that have been banned from mainstream\nplatforms, or which feel censored by the platforms\u2019 moderation team. Voat\u2019s growth over\nthe years is strongly punctuated by the bans that took place on Reddit, whereas both Gettr\nand Koo invested in high-profile politicians and influencers to attract new users.\nOur findings raise some essential questions about the efficiency of deplatforming as a\nmoderation policy. While it protects a vast majority of the active users of a platform from\nbeing exposed to harmful content, it provides unregulated alternative outlets with a signifi-\ncant flow of adopters, leading users to online echo chambers, where they are more likely to\nbe radicalised and mobilised. Alt-tech platforms are also scarcely monitored by law enforce-\nment and the academic community, which explains why telltale signs of a mobilisation for\nthe US Capitol Riot did not raise any alarm within police forces or the U.S. Department\nof Homeland Security [395]. Moreover, as discussed in chapter 2, alt-tech platforms have\nbecome an ideal breeding ground to foster extremist ideologies, which are rarely challenged\nby a dissident voice within the platform.\nThe growth of the alt-tech ecosystem follows very similar trends in the Global South\nthan within Western nations, by welcoming communities that feel censored by established\nplatforms.\nAs mentioned in chapters 3 and 4, Voat and Gettr earned their status in the social media\necosystem by fostering far-right leaning communities, predominantly from the US, after they\n105\nhave been deplatformed from established platforms. As such, they swiftly profiteered off any\nmajor ban taking place on Reddit and Twitter respectively, and ended up hosting a diverse\nrange of sub-communities.\nOn the other side, as covered in chapter 5 and 6, Koo strove to be a safe venue for diverse\nethnic groups and political opinions. However, by hosting the BJP after the farmers\u2019 protest\nin India, the platform struggled to attract politicians from diverse political leanings [149],\nthus displaying a lack of political plurality.\nOur results indicate that the alt-tech platform\u2019s role in the digital ecosystem mostly lies\nin its proclivity to act as a safe haven for online communities that have been censored or\nbanned by mainstream platforms, while also catalysing the rise of conformist online societies.\nAlt-tech platforms have evolved to become a patchwork of fragmented clusters, where siloed\ncommunities can coexist without any cross-interaction taking place.\nIn chapter 3, we looked at the interaction network between the users on Voat, highlighting\nthe existence of a few siloed subverses, whose interactions with the overall user base are very\nsparse. These communities all moved from Reddit after being banned, and subsequently\njoined Voat. However, their proclivity towards online harassment, hate speech and conspiracy\ntheories prompted them to act as outliers on the alt-tech platform, highlighting that users\non such platforms do not adhere to unified boundaries with respect to toxic behaviour.\nMeanwhile, in chapter 6, we showed that the interaction network on Koo is strongly\nshaped by linguistic preferences, where users are more likely to interact with their peers\nif they predominantly use the same language. This phenomenon is further exacerbated by\ncultural differences, as we notice that Nigerian and Brazilian users are strongly isolated\nfrom their Indian peers. Meanwhile, the English language acts as a lingua franca and plays\na pivotal role in political communication on the platform, despite Koo\u2019s ambition to host\nnon-English speaking communities across the world.\nOverall, our results illuminate several aspects related to user engagement on alt-tech\nplatforms, and the role it plays in shaping their group identity. We hope that these insights\nwill help inform policies around deradicalisation strategies [396], content moderation on\nsocial media and the growing need to monitor extremist groups online.\nThe work presented in this thesis was initially motivated by the rise of bans taking\nplace on established social media platforms and a lack of evidence regarding their efficiency.\nDeplatfroming has several positive consequences, such as the decrease in toxic language used\non the platform where the ban took place [70]. Moreover, due to their smaller size, alt-tech\nplatforms do not provide influential figures with an audience of a scale similar to the one\nthey can interact with on mainstream outlets [241]. As such, deplatforming is a successful\npolicy when considering the audience of the platform enforcing the bans, as its users see their\nexposure to anti-social behaviour being decreased. However, I argue that, in the light of the\nresults shown in this thesis, deplatforming mostly implies moving the problematic users to\nnew platforms, where toxic behaviour is condoned and oftentimes encouraged. As such, it\n106\nmakes it much harder for law enforcement to monitor these communities and their propensity\nto be involved in riots or lone wolf terrorism. More importantly, any user who becomes\nactive on alt-tech platforms will no longer be exposed to nuanced and conflicting opinions,\ndecreasing the odds of disrupting their radicalisation journey. Instead of capitalising all\ntheir efforts on identifying and banning problematic communities, I would urge platforms\nto consider implementing interventions that aim at deradicalising users, such as the nudges\nthat X (then Twitter) tested in 2021 to incite users to avoid using toxic speech [397 ].\nWhile our findings offer a major improvement to our understanding of the online extremist\necosystem, they also signpost several new avenues that need to be investigated in future\nresearch. We provide the reader with some potential research questions, that would further\nsolidify our expertise in online radicalisation.\nHow do radicalised users stay engaged across platforms?\nWhile deplatforming used to imply an initial ban from a mainstream platform, the recent\ngrowth of the alt-tech ecosystem spurred many political actors to be active on both main-\nstream and alt-tech platforms. However, due to the difficulties, both technical and ethical,\nin matching user accounts between platforms, there is little evidence to indicate whether\ntheir discourse follows similar patterns on both platforms. A leading hypothesis suggests\nthat their discourse would be more toxic on alternative outlets, as they have to navigate es-\ntablished platforms\u2019 moderation policies to avoid being banned [171]. However, our analysis\nof Gettr highlights a higher propensity to use toxic speech on Twitter rather than Gettr,\nfor some user cohorts. As such, more analysis is required to unravel whether there is also a\nstrong difference in terms of the narratives being shared on both mainstream and alt-tech\nplatforms. An alternative explanation, which we explored for Gettr and which was also\nstudied with Parler [398], motivates the increase in hate speech on mainstream platform\nby the hostility that arises when extremist users interact with members of their out-group.\nMoreover, future work could build upon previous studies related to crowdsourcing within\nextremist movements [399], to assess whether content shared on alt-tech platform is more\nlikely to include links to crowdfunding platforms.\nDo alt-tech platforms share a common narrative, with communities coordinating across\nplatforms?\nOne of the growing concerns related to the alt-tech ecosystem is that platforms seem to\nmetastasise into an organic environment, running parallel to the mainstream social media\necosystem. For example, a previous study underlined how white supremacist servers on Dis-\ncord were strongly interconnected in the run-up to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville,\nVirginia [131], with similar interaction patterns identified for the QAnon community [19].\nWith extensive datasets now publicly available for a significant number of alt-tech plat-\nforms, an essential question to investigate relates to assessing their similarity in terms of\noverall discourse, news ecosystem and patterns of user engagement. By doing so, we would\nbe able to assess whether alt-tech platforms lead to a similar social hierarchy, with a strong\n107\ndivide between content producers and consumers. A comparative analysis would also provide\nsome valuable insights on the factors that lead some alt-tech platforms to become successful\nonline venues, whereas others struggle to keep an engaged community.\nHow does a user\u2019s behaviour change over time after they join an alt-tech platform?\nAs mentioned in chapter 2, users who join online extremist communities are likely to\nundergo an extensive radicalisation process, triggered by their exposure to alternative, often-\ntimes hateful narratives, until they become themselves messengers of the movement. Scholars\naimed to understand whether this process leads to a shift of socialisation patterns outside\nof the extremist communities, with the evidence highlighting an adoption of far-right vo-\ncabulary and symbols within three months of exposure [400]. These results indicate that\nthe process, starting from the initial exploration phase to the adoption of a fully radicalised\nideology, is very swift and leads to a shift of a person\u2019s group identity.\nThese findings can be further explored by comparing how the adoption of a social iden-\ntity varies across platforms. For example, brigading is a common phenomenon on Reddit,\nwhere one community starts invading another subreddit by spamming with posts and com-\nments that further their agenda. This phenomenon has been extensively studied on Reddit\n[171, 401], but there has not been further research, aiming at investigating this phenomenon\noriginating from other alt-tech platforms. Such a study could further broaden our under-\nstanding of the anti-social collective behaviours that are promoted on alt-tech platforms, the\nnature of their targets and the tools they use to game the mainstream platform\u2019s algorithm.\nOverall, this thesis brought a more nuanced of the impact that deplatforming policies\ncan have not only on a single platform, but on the overall social media ecosystem. As the\nalt-tech ecosystem is constantly growing and there is more appetite for influential politicians\nto become involved with these communities, there is an urgent need to understand how these\nplatforms act as facilitators when users are following a radicalisation pipeline and whether\ndeplatforming might lead disenfranchised communities to end up on non-moderated and\nnon-monitored platforms. Aside from the risks that such a process might lead to an even\nmore divided society, previous events have showcased how the online radicalisation process\ncan also lead to offline unrest or violence.\n108\nChapter A\nAppendix to Chapter 4\nA.0.1 Manual account labelling\nOur primary analysis heavily relies on Gettr users voluntarily disclosing their corresponding\nTwitter accounts, enabling us to conduct a cross-platform comparison of their activities. To\nensure the accuracy of account matching, we manually examined the 300 accounts with the\nhighest follower count on Gettr, out of the 1588 matched users we have in the cohort. The\nmain aim is to confirm that the accounts on both platforms belong to the same person.\nManual matching is a subjective judgement based on whether an account uses the same, or\nsimilar, handle on both platforms, the same, or similar, profile picture, and uses the same, or\nsimilar, profile biography. Out of the 300 accounts checked manually, 285 were successfully\nmatched, corresponding to a 95% match rate. This match rate is comparable to the match\nrate found in previous studies using a similar method [241].\nFollowing Elon Musk\u2019s amnesty on suspended accounts on Twitter announced in Novem-\nber 2022 [402], we also manually checked the 100 banned accounts with the highest follower\ncount on Gettr. 33 of these accounts have since seen their ban being lifted on Twitter, thus\nconfirming that Elon Musk did indeed offer such an amnesty to banned users. Interestingly,\nwe noticed that many of these accounts share very similar narratives, primarily centred to\nDonald Trump\u2019s political propaganda and conspiracy theories revolving around Covid-19.\nDue to changes in the policy related to the Twitter API, we cannot study the activity of\nthese accounts on Twitter after their ban has been lifted.\n109\nA.0.2 User acquisition and activity\nOne of the main findings of our analysis is that banned users are, on average, more active\nthan non-verified or matched users, a first indicator that the banned cohort is more likely to\nbenefit from being able to register on fringe platforms with a less stringent moderation policy.\nIn particular, we notice that matched users are seven times more active on Twitter than on\nGettr, wheras banned users are five times more active than matched users on Gettr. To\nensure that our results are not conflated with the presence of various linguistic communities\nin the platform, we run the same analysis separately for the two major demographics on\nGettr, i.e. by considering only the English- and Portuguese-speaking users. The results for\nthe English-speaking community are displayed on figure A.1, and show very similar trends\nthan when considering the platform as a whole. Most notably, we still notice a peak of\nregistrations in January 2022, related to Joe Rogan announcing his account on Gettr and\nwhich had a large impact on US-based users. Figure A.1B also shows a larger propensity for\nbanned users to be active on Gettr, when compared to matched and non-verified users.\nFigure A.2 shows the same results with the Portuguese-speaking cohort. An interesting\nobservation on figure A.2A is the absence of a peak of registrations in January 2022. This\nsuggests that Joe Rogan\u2019s social media outreach mostly consists of English-speaking users,\nand therefore his registration on Gettr did not lead to a surge of Portuguese-speaking users\non Gettr. However, there is a noticeable peak of registrations in September 2021, which is the\nresult of Gettr\u2019s involvement in the Brazil CPAC 2021, with its CEO Jason Miller traveling\nto Brazil to attend the event [180]. Figure A.2B highlights how banned users within the\nBrazilian community are also more active on Gettr than the other cohorts.\n110\n101103RegistrationsA\n2021-07 2021-10 2022-01 2022-040.00.20.40.6Active usersBMatched Gettr Banned Non-verified Matched T witterFigure A.1: User registrations and daily activity for each cohort - English-speaking\ncohort.

To ensure that our results\nalso hold for any other month in our dataset, we compute the Kaplan-Meier estimate for\nevery month up to April 2022, by separating the user cohorts mentioned in the main analysis\n(banned, matched and non-verified users). The results of the analysis are shown in figure\nA.3. We notice that banned users are more likely to be active on the platform for a longer\nperiod of time, regardless of the considered registration month, whereas users in the matched\nand non-verified cohorts become inactive shortly after joining Gettr.\n0 2000.00.51.0Percent survivalA August cohort\n0 2000.00.51.0B September cohort\n0 2000.00.51.0C October cohort\n0 2000.00.51.0D November cohort\n0 200\nDays0.00.51.0Percent survivalE December cohort\n0 100\nDays0.00.51.0F February cohort\n0 100\nDays0.00.51.0G March cohort\n0 100\nDays0.00.51.0H April cohortMatched Gettr Banned Non-verified\nFigure A.3: User retention for other registration months (A) Kaplan-Meier survival\ncurves for each user cohort showing the fraction of accounts who registered in August 2021\nwho remain active on Gettr a given number of days after registration for the banned cohort\n(blue), matched cohort (green) and the non-verified cohort (orange).

The top 20 topics of classified Gettr content are shown in Table A.1 alongside\na representative Gettr post for each topic extracted automatically by BERTopic. Using the\nsame model, we classify matched Twitter content using the same model; the promimence of\neach topic on both Gettr and Twitter is shown in Table A.2, with the ratio column indicating\nwhether a topic is over- or under-represented on Gettr relative to Twitter. We list the median\ntoxicity of posts classified as part of that topic on Gettr and on Twitter in table A.3.\nThe topic modelling reveals that content on Gettr is dominated by topics of significant\nrelevance to US politics, and in particular of relevance to the political right. Topic 1 (Covid-\n19, vaccines) corresponds to approximately one sixth of all classified content on Gettr, with\nthis value approaching a third in some months. Topic 2 focuses explicitly on discussions\naround major social media platforms referencing the political right being deplatformed from\nFacebook and from Twitter.\nIt is worth considering those topics which are found disproportionately on Gettr, relative\nto the matched Twitter dataset. This includes topics related to the war in Ukraine (No.\n3), the Canada Convoy protests which related to Covid-19 vaccine mandates (No. 4), and\nthe 2020 US election and alegations of voter fraud, particularly in Arizona (No. 10). These\nare topics which are known to have been targets of the Twitter content moderation team;\nseveral accounts were suspended for (1) sharing pro-Russian content during the Ukraine war\n[246], (2) sharing Covid-19 misinformation [247 ], and (3) for supporting the January 2021\ninsurrection following the 2020 US elections [248]. Consequently, it is not surprising that\nthese topics are more prominent on Gettr than they are on Twitter (note that we do not\nhave access to deleted Twitter content). If we consider the toxicity of topics, we find that\ntopics with disproportionately high toxicity are topic 20 on race and Black Lives Matter,\ntopic 16 on female US Democratic politicians, and topic 14 on gender issues.\n114\nNo. T\nopic Represen\ntative post\n1 Co\nvid-19, Vaccines, Virus, Fauci\"More\nproof the jab doesn\u2019t work as whoopiiiigasbag\u2019s overweight triple vaxxxed\nass gets hijacked by the cofraud-19!\"\n2 T\nwitter, Gettr, Facebook, Musk\"F\nacebook is censoring conservatives like crazy.

The Gettr toxicity is computed using all Gettr posts. The Twitter toxicity is\ncomputed using only posts from the matched cohort. On both Gettr and Twitter, the two\ntopic with the largest toxicity are topic 20 relating to race and topic 14 relating to gender.\nTopics regarding Democrat politicians are also disproportionately toxic.\n117\nA.0.5 Cohort toxicity over time\nIn Fig. 3C of the main manuscript, we show the median toxicity of posts authored a fixed\nnumber of days after a user authored their first post on Gettr (or after their first post in\nour observation time window on Twitter). To rigorously assess whether post toxicity is\nincreasing or decreasing over time, we compute a linear fit ( y=ax+b, where aandbare\nslope and intercept parameters) of the normalised daily toxicity using ordinary least squares.\nTo compute an error on the fit, we compute a bootstrapped median of each daily median\ntoxicity 100 times using 50% of the data with replacement, resulting in 100 individual fits\non the daily normalised toxicity graph. This results in median fitting parameters (95%\nconfidence interval in square brackets) for each cohort of:\n\u2022Non-verified: a= 0.0007 ,[\u22120.0157 ,0.0139] units toxicity per year. b= 0.1687 ,\n[0.1643 ,0.1732] .\n\u2022Banned: a=\u22120.0091 ,[\u22120.0152 ,\u22120.0022] units toxicity per year. b= 0.0503 ,\n[0.0482 ,0.0530] .\n\u2022Matched Gettr: a=\u22120.0120 ,[\u22120.0137 ,\u22120.0103] units toxicity per year. b= 0.0450 ,\n[0.0443 ,0.0458] .\n\u2022Matched Twitter: a= 0.0100 ,[0.0072 ,0.0127] units toxicity per year. b= 0.0787 ,\n[0.0775 ,0.0801] .\nRelative to the inter-quartile range of the post toxicity across our observation period, the\nmedian yearly change in toxicity for each cohort corresponds to:\n\u2022Non-verified: 0.0007 /0.31\u22480.2%.\n\u2022Banned: 0.0091 /0.13\u22487%.\n\u2022Matched Gettr: 0.0120 /0.09\u224813%.\n\u2022Matched Twitter: 0.0100 /0.18\u22486%.\nThis clearly shows that linear fits for the annual change in cohort toxicity are significantly\nsmaller than the daily variability in post toxicity within each cohort. Consequently, we can\nconsider the annual change in toxicity for each cohort negligible in the context of the expected\nfluctuations in post toxicity.\n118\nA.0.6 Quote-ratio Statistics\nStatistics for the difference between the all user quote-ratio distribution shown in Fig. 5A\nof the main chapter and each subdistribution is shown in table A.4. For each statistical\ncomparison we use a 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess the difference between\nthe test distribution and the all user distribution. The table provides the Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test and corresponding p-value. A p-value less that p= 0.01indicates that the test\ndistribution is significantly different to the all user baseline. To quantify the magnitude of\nthe difference between the distributions, we use a non-parametric analogue of the Cohen\u2019s d\neffect size. A verbal descriptor for the effect size is provided according to the rules of thumb\nin [4]. Using this terminology quantifies the difference between the all-user baseline and\nquestionable media sources as very small (and not statistically significant). In contrast, the\ndifference between the all-user baseline and Democrat politicians is statistically significant\nand described as huge according to the Cohen\u2019s d rule of thumb.\nDistribution KS Statistic KS p-value Cohen\u2019s d Cohen\u2019s d descriptor\nMatched cohort 0.22 2.8e-35 0.28 Small\nRepublicans 0.32 1.8e-11 0.56 Medium\nDemocrats 0.63 3.1e-16 2.33 Huge\nFar right 0.23 0.24 0.20 Small\nRight 0.21 0.002 0.43 Small\nLeast 0.52 1.3e-13 1.16 Large\nLeft 0.55 7.1e-35 1.41 Very large\nReliable 0.44 1.3e-41 1.15 Large\nQuestionable 0.15 0.29 0.05 Very small\nTable A.4: Statistics for the difference between the all user baseline distribution in Fig.\n5 of the main chapter, and each subdistribution listed in the left-most column.

Here we investigate whether there is evidence for this role in the\nGettr interaction network.\nFirst, we study the power imbalance in the Portuguese language network by measuring\nthe Gini coefficient of the degree distribution, shown in Fig. A.4A. The figure shows that the\nGini coefficient peaked in the run-up to the Bras\u00b4 \u0131lia riots, which is evidence that a handful of\nusers were responsible for shaping the collective narrative of the Portuguese language Gettr\ncommunity [405, 406].\n0.550.600.650.70Gini coefficient4 1 3 2A\n2021-09 2022-01 2022-05 2022-09 2023-010.000.010.020.03Transitivity4 1 3 2B\nFigure A.4: Evolution of the interaction network in the Brazilian community.\nAnalysis of the daily interaction network, generated by considering any interaction within a\n1-day window. (A) Gini-coefficient of nodes in the giant connected component. (B) Tran-\nsitivity of the giant component. Dashed lines correspond to key events related to Brazilian\npolitics and Gettr\u2019s involvement: (1) 2021 CPAC Brazil Conference, (2) the \u201cAto pela terra\u201d\ndemonstration organised in Bras\u00b4 \u0131lia against Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cPackage of Destruction\u201d laws [3],\n(3) the Brazilian presidential election, and (4) the Brazilian Congress attack in Bras\u00b4 \u0131lia.\nWe now study grassroots engagement, measured by computing the transitivity of the\nGettr interaction network, see Fig. A.4B. This measure increases when a community of users\ndensely interact with one another [407, 408]. The figure shows that network transitivity\n120\npeaked during CPAC 2021, where the Bolsonaro regime and Gettr shaped their close alliance\n[180], and in the days leading up to the Bras\u00b4 \u0131lia riots. Applying a Portuguese-language topic\nmodel to the network reveals that users were discussing accusations of rigged elections and\nclaims of a corrupt media in the lead up to the riots.\nThe peak in both the Gini coefficient and the transitivity shows that leading Bolsonaro\nallies successfully capitalised on accusations of election fraud to generate a grassroots move-\nment on Gettr in the wake of Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat in the Brazilian elections. These results\noffer new quantitative insights which build on journalistic reports of Gettr\u2019s role in the riots.\nCritically, our results show that even when a platform appears largely inactive, a community\nof idle users can be mobilised within a short time period leading to real world harms. Note,\nhowever, that we cannot claim a direct link between deplatforming induced migrations to\nfringe social media and Gettr\u2019s potentially harmful role during the Brazilian insurrection.\n121\nA.0.8 Portuguese-language Topic Modelling\nOur analysis on the Brazilian community on Gettr being focused on the impact online\npropaganda can have on offline upheavals, we provide the same analysis of the most salient\ntopics mentioned by that community as we did for the English-speaking users. We use\nBERTopic to identify the key topics that shape the conversation within that linguistic cohort.\nThe dominant ones are listed in table A.5. The topic modelling indicates that election\nfrauds allegations are strongly discussed among the Brazilian community, which confirm\nthe suspicions that Gettr was a key player in spreading that narrative. Notably, messages\nabout the elections represent about 3.7% of the messages (No. 2), whereas Lula is strongly\naccused of stealing the elections (No. 4). Moreover, several actors who allegedly contributed\nin covering up the fraud, such as the mainstream media (No. 9) [409 ] or the Supreme\nFederal Court (No. 11) [410], are recurrently mentioned. Some of the key members of the\nBrazilian far-right circle, who are verified users on Gettr are also widely discussed within\nthe community (No. 17). Interestingly, several of these topics are also disproportionately\nfound within the English-speaking community (see table A.2). Some examples are the Covid-\nrelated conspiracy theories (No. 6), the Ukrainian war (No. 10), and the moral panic around\nabortion (No. 8). These findings further reinforce the overlap between the populist right in\nthe United States and Brazil, and indicate that such narratives are platform-centric rather\nthan bound to a specific demographic.\n122\nNo. Topic Gettr %\n1 Brazil, People, Country 14\n2 Polls, Fraud, Vote, Elections 3.7\n3 Lord, God, Jesus Christ, Truth 3.5\n4 Thief, Bandit, Lula, Crime 3.4\n5 War, Military, Patriots, Freedom 2.1\n6 Health, Vaccines, Covid-19, Pfizer 1.7\n7 Inflation, Salary, Economy, Budget 1.3\n8 Children, Abortion, Gender, Pedophilia 1\n9 Media, Press, Fake News, Journalists 1\n10 Ukraine, Russia, Putin, NATO 0.9\n11 Supreme Federal Court, Ministers, Constitution 0.7\n12 Camp, Concentration Camp, Elderly, Children 0.6\n13 Christians, Church, Pope, Satan 0.6\n14 China, Communist Party, Covid-19 0.6\n15 Patriots, Insiders, Terrorists, Left 0.6\n16 Media, Press, Brazil, Truth 0.6\n17 Jair Bolsonaro, Flavio Bolsonaro, Carla Zambelli, Carlos Jordy 0.5\nOther N/A 10.7\nOutliers N/A 54\nTable A.5: Topics which correspond to more than 0.5% of posts on Gettr in the\nBrazilian community.

We show that these additional registrations also led\nto an increase of activity coming from these groups, by breaking down the daily activity\nby linguistic communities. Figure B.1 displays the moving average of daily registrations for\neach linguistic community. As we can see, the peaks that we noticed previously are indeed\ncaused by the BJP migration, the Nigerian ban on Twitter and the Brazilian community\nmoving to Koo. Interestingly, each peak also leads to a moderate growth of interest among\nother linguistic communities.\n102RegistrationsEnglish\nEnglish (Nigeria)Hindi\nPortuguese\nJan\n2021Jan\n2022Jan\n2023Jul Jul Jul103Registrations\n(cumulative)\nFigure B.1: Registration activity from linguistic communities.

Despite the increasing prevalence of propaganda con-\ntent on the Internet, few attempts have been made by AI re-\nsearchers to analyze such content. We introduce the task of\nmultimodal propaganda processing, where the goal is to au-\ntomatically analyze propaganda content. We believe that this\ntask presents a long-term challenge to AI researchers and that\nsuccessful processing of propaganda could bring machine un-\nderstanding one important step closer to human understand-\ning. We discuss the technical challenges associated with this\ntask and outline the steps that need to be taken to address it.\n1 Introduction\nSince the beginning of this century, significant progress has\nbeen made in the area of Sentiment Analysis and Opinion\nMining on processing opinionated documents. Recent years\nhave seen a surge of interest in processing a particular type\nof opinionated documents: persuasive documents. Work in\nthis area is typically done under the umbrella of Argument\nMining, in which the core task is to uncover the argumen-\ntative structure of a persuasive document. Specifically, the\ngoal is to (1) identify the main claim, the claims, and the\npremises (i.e., supporting evidences) expressed in the given\ndocument, and (2) determine the relationships among them\n(e.g., identify which premises support which claim).\nWork on argument mining has so far focused on process-\ning legal text (Moens et al. 2007; Wyner et al. 2010; Walker\net al. 2018), persuasive student essays (Persing and Ng 2016;\nStab and Gurevych 2017), and Oxford-style debates (Or-\nbach et al. 2020; Slonim et al. 2021). Although persuasive\nin nature, propagandistic articles (i.e., articles that aim to in-\nfluence public opinion via disseminating biased and/or mis-\nleading information) have received relatively little attention\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP). This is somewhat\nsurprising given the growing prevalence of computational\npropaganda, an \u201cemergent form of political manipulation\nthat occurs over the Internet\u201d (Woolley and Howard 2018).\nFrom a research perspective, automatic processing of propa-\nganda presents a number of challenges to AI researchers:\nCopyright \u00a9 2023, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.Multimodality. One characteristic that distinguishes pro-\npaganda content from other persuasive texts is that the for-\nmer is often multimodal, comprising both text and images.\nAs the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. In\nmultimodal propaganda, it is often the images that are most\neye-catching and which create the biggest psychological im-\npact on the reader. Although the text usually plays a support-\ning role, there are many cases where the image(s) could not\nbe understood properly without the supporting text. How to\ncombine the information derived from the two modalities to\nproperly understand propaganda is an open question.\nDeep understanding of text and images. Propaganda\nprocessing takes argument mining to the next level of com-\nplexity. As noted above, argument mining involves (1) ex-\ntracting the claims and premises from the associated text\nand (2) identifying the relationships (e.g., support, attack)\namong them. For the kind of texts that NLP researchers have\nfocused on so far (e.g., legal text, Oxford-style debates), the\nclaims and premises are typically clearly stated. In contrast,\nthe main claims and possibly some other supporting claims\nin propagandistic articles are often intentionally omitted, so\nwe are faced with the additional challenge of recovering\nthese hidden messages. Moreover, while the arguments in le-\ngal texts, essays, and debates can largely be interpreted liter-\nally, we often have to read between the lines when interpret-\ning the text and images in propaganda content. For example,\nwhen given a picture of Russian soldiers killing Ukrainian\ncivilians, current Computer Vision (CV) technologies would\nbe able to produce a caption about this killing event, but if\nthis picture appears in propagandistic articles, we probably\nneed to infer the motive behind this picture (e.g., gaining the\nworld\u2019s sympathy and support for Ukraine), which is cur-\nrently beyond the reach of today\u2019s technology.\nThe need for background knowledge. Historical or cul-\ntural background knowledge may be needed to properly pro-\ncess propaganda content. For instance, given a propagandis-\ntic article with a picture showing a Palestinian social unrest\nevent in the West Bank, the author may want to instill fear\namong the Israelis. However, without the knowledge of the\nlong-standing conflict between the Palestinians and the Is-\nraelis, one may not be able to understand the author\u2019s intent.\nPersuasion by deception. As noted above, argument min-\ning researchers have focused on processing legal text, es-\nsays, and debates, where virtually all claims are established\nThe Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-23)\n15368\nFigure 1: An advertisement published by the White Motor Company in 1965.\nusing persuasion strategies like logos (i.e., through logical\nreasoning), pathos (i.e., through an emotional appeal), and\nethos (i.e., through the speaker\u2019s authority or status). In con-\ntrast, the persuasion strategies used in propaganda are more\nsophisticated, often involving logical fallacies and framing.\nAutomatic processing of propaganda content could have\nimportant societal ramifications. In many cases, people are\nnot aware that they are being brainwashed by propaganda\ncampaigns, and this could lead to life-threatening conse-\nquences. One of the most compelling examples would be the\nISIS propaganda and recruitment in 2014 (Farwell 2014),\nin which ISIS successfully recruited many people from all\nover the world, particularly those from the European Union,\nto go to Syria to serve as soldiers and sex slaves. Within the\nU.S. propaganda is typically manifested in the form of polit-\nical manipulation campaigns with the goal of swaying pub-\nlic opinion. In fact, political manipulation campaigns have\ndoubled since 2017 (Bradshaw and Howard 2018), and in-\ncreased efforts of disinformation should be expected as the\nU.S. midterm elections draw near (DiResta et al. 2018).\nIn this paper, we present the novel task of multimodal pro-\npaganda processing, where the goal is to analyze propaganda\ncontent by extracting relevant information from the differ-\nent modalities present in the content, identifying the persua-\nsion devices and tactics that are used in different portions of\nthe content, and eventually generating the message(s) being\nconveyed. We believe that time is ripe for AI researchers to\nwork on this task. From a societal perspective, given the in-\ncreasing influence that propaganda content has on our daily\nlives, it is more important than ever for us to be able to\nunderstand propagandistic articles. From an AI perspective,\ndeep learning technologies have enabled revolutionary ad-\nvances in machine understanding. It is time to examine how\nrobust these technologies are when applied to a task as chal-\nlenging as multimodal propaganda processing.2 Examples\nIn this section, we explain why multimodal propaganda pro-\ncessing is interesting and challenging via two examples.\nExample 1\nFigure 1 presents an advertisement published by the White\nMotor Company in 1965 aiming to establish the superior-\nity of the American truck transportation road networks to\ntheir Soviet counterparts. The advertisement shows on the\nleft side the stone-surfaced roads being used for transporta-\ntion in the USSR and the paucity of paved roads in the coun-\ntry, and it shows on the right side the modern highways along\nwith a map of the USA that is full of road networks. The text\nstates that (1) the distribution system by trucks was only one\nof the examples where the USA was superior to the USSR,\nand (2) the restrictions imposed by many states in the USA\nconcerning truck sizes prevented motor truck transportation\nfrom operating to its full potential.\nHuman perception. Human readers need to possess cer-\ntain knowledge in order to process the propaganda content\nin this advertisement. First, they have to have some geol-\nogy knowledge to discover that the two maps are at different\nscales, which make the USA look larger than the USSR in\nterms of land mass. Second, they need to be aware of the\noversimplifying language \u201cSOVIET WAY - USA WAY\u201d,\nwhich implies that the Soviets adopted the American way\nof transportation. No evidence was provided to substantiate\nthis claim, however. Third, they need to pay attention to the\ndeceptive language in the text. While the advertisement con-\ntains a road map of the USSR and an estimated length of\npaved road in the country, the sources were never given and\nhence the information could be far from accurate.\nSeveral propaganda devices and tactics are involved in\nthis advertisement (see Section 3 for the list of devices and\n15369\n(a)                        (b)\n(c)                        (d)                       (e)\nFigure 2: Some pages of the En Guardia magazine. Fig-\nure 2(b) covers two pages.\ntactics). First, the large font size associated with the title and\nthe subtitle as well as the oversimplifying language in them\nsignal the use of the Binary Reduction tactic, which em-\nploys the false-dilemma logical fallacy. Second, the use of\nlanguage to depict that the Americans are superior in many\nways (e.g., \u201cOur higher standard of living\u201d, \u201cfor all the su-\nperiority of our American highways\u201d, etc.) signals the All-\nencompassing tactic, which is a sort of rhetoric that often\nappears as window dressing for a larger point. Third, the sen-\ntence \u201cAmerica has the advantage of maximum efficiency\nand economy\u201d employs the Cultural Signaling tactic, call-\ning on America\u2019s values of efficiency and success. Finally,\nthe text gives \u201cbest estimates\u201d of the USSR\u2019s road network,\nwhich is a case of the Card Stacking device, where only par-\ntial facts are used to defend a statement.\nChallenges. It is non-trivial to automatically process the\npropaganda content in this advertisement. The key chal-\nlenges stem from the need to (1) process multimodal infor-\nmation extracted from the images and the text; (2) exploit\nbackground knowledge to unveil hidden information; (3) in-\nterpret the use of different font styles and text sizes to high-\nlight specific pieces of information; and (4) understand the\nhidden information conveyed in the images (e.g., the differ-\nence in scaling between the two maps).\nExample 2\nDuring World War II, the U.S. propagandists sought support\nfrom the Latin Americas by publishing a high-quality Span-\nish periodical En Guardia. Figure 2 shows six pages from\nthe first issue of En Guardia. Each page has its own propa-\nganda messaging. Figure 2(a) is the cover of the magazine,\nwhich shows two naval ships moving fast in the ocean. The\ntitle \u201cEn Guardia\u201d and the subtitle \u201cPara la defensa de las\nAm\u00b4ericas\u201d translate into \u201cOn Guard\u201d and \u201cFor the defense of\nthe Americas\u201d respectively. Figure 2(b) shows a naval shipin the ocean with a scope pointing at the ship. The main\npoints in the caption of 2(b) translate into \u201cThe American\nnavy must and will keep the seas free, and will protect mer-\nchant ships against the danger of bombardment\u201d. Figure 2(c)\nshows a merchant ship and discusses the importance of mer-\nchant ships in delivering goods and troops to all parts of the\nAmericas. The boldfaced sub-caption translates into \u201cAmer-\nica means 21 nations\u201d. Figure 2(d) shows a ship while Fig-\nure 2(e) focuses on the training and the sheer size of the U.S.\nNavy. Most importantly, these pages need to be considered\nas a sequence in order to obtain the full messaging, which\nis that \u201cMaritime commerce in the Americas is under immi-\nnent threat, and protecting the oceans from the enemy is vital\nto western hemisphere interests. However, the U.S. navy has\nthe best equipment and personnel to deal with such a threat.\u201d\nHuman perception. A human reader with the appropriate\nbackground would interpret these pages as follows. First, the\ncover points out the main theme of the magazine by using\nthe eye-catching subtitle \u201cFor the defense of the Americas\u201d,\nwhich proposes a sense of shared identity and immediate\ndanger. The warship depicted on the cover is moving fast in\nthe ocean, as the water below it is splashing high, suggesting\nsomething is happening immediately. Second, Figure 2(b)\nshows an exaggerated scaling of a gun scope on the left and\na ship that is being pointed to by the scope on the right. This\nwould naturally take all the attention of the reader. Third,\nFigure 2(c) repeats the sense of a shared identity by saying\n\u201cAmerica means 21 nations\u201d. Finally, Figures 2(d) and 2(e)\nshow that the U.S. has the equipment and the personnel to\ndeal with the danger threatening free commerce.\nNext, we analyze the propaganda devices and tactics used\nin these pages. Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(d) all use the Vi-\nsual Scaling tactic, which is concerned with evoking emo-\ntional understanding (e.g., fear, power, etc.) by using im-\nages. These images also use the Card Stacking device, as\nthey do not explicitly point out who is threatening the Amer-\nicas. Figure 2(c) uses two devices: (1) Band Wagon, which\nimplies that all of the countries in the Western Hemisphere\nare a collective and should work together; and (2) Glitter-\ning Generalities, where a \u201cvirtue word\u201d (in this case, the\nimpressiveness of U.S. merchant ships) is being used to cre-\nate positive emotion and acceptance (of the U.S. military in-\nvolvement) without examination of evidence.\nChallenges. Automatically processing propaganda in this\nexample is even harder than that in the first example since\nproper understanding depends heavily on visual clues rather\nthan textual information. For instance, a machine needs to\nunderstand that (1) in Figure 2(b), the scope was enlarged\nto an exaggerated size and was pointing at the ship; (2) in\nFigure 2(d), the picture was taken at an angle that makes the\nship look substantially larger than other objects in the back-\nground, with the intent of showing off the military might of\nthe U.S.; and (3) these images need to be considered as a\nsequence in order to get the full messaging.\n3 Corpus Creation and Annotation\nIn this section, we outline the initial steps needed to address\nthe task of multimodal propaganda processing.\n15370\nCorpus Creation\nGiven the recent advances in CV and NLP, we propose to\napproach this problem by building a machine learning (ML)\nsystem. Appropriately annotated corpora are critical to the\nsuccessful application of any ML systems. Since the goal\nof the multimodal propaganda processing task is to analyze\npropaganda content, we need data instances that correspond\nto examples of propaganda. Since we do not have a system\nfor automatically identifying propaganda content, it would\nbe best for us to begin data collection by looking for web-\nsites or publications that are known to publish propagan-\ndistic materials. A possible source of historical propaganda\nwould be the En Guardia magazine described in the previ-\nous section. So far, we have applied OCR to every page of\nevery issue of this magazine and have used these articles to\nassemble the first version of our corpus.\nIn order to assemble a corpus that contains contemporary\npropagandistic articles, we propose to exploit the content\npublished on some fact-checking websites. For example,\nPolitifact1verifies the accuracy of claims made by elected\nofficials. Those claims that were marked as inaccurate would\nconstitute a good set of candidates of propagandistic articles.\nWe can then manually go through these candidates to iden-\ntify propaganda content. Similar websites include Full Fact2,\nFactCheck3, and Media Bias/Fact Check4.\nAnnotation Tasks\nNext, we define a set of annotation tasks that we believe\nwould be helpful for analyzing propaganda content. The an-\nnotations we obtain via these tasks will provide the data\nneeded to train models for processing propaganda content.\nTask 1: Propaganda device and tactic detection and ra-\ntionale generation. The first task concerns identifying\nthe propaganda device(s) and tactic(s) used in propaganda\ncontent. The \u201cSeven Propaganda Devices\u201d (Childs 1936;\nSproule 2001), a well-known propaganda theory, defines\nseven propaganda devices that represent the seven persua-\nsion strategies commonly used in propaganda, including:\nBand Wagon, Card Stacking, Glittering Generalities, Name-\nCalling, Plain Folks, Testimonial, and Transfer.5We identify\nthe device(s) used in the text portion and the image portion\nof the multimodal input separately. Note that more than one\ndevice can be used for a given piece of text or image.\nIn addition, we extend our annotation scheme by includ-\ning a set of propaganda tactics, which serve to underscore\nthe methods of employing the devices. The set of tactics we\nhave identified include: Extremism, All-encompassing, Rep-\netition, Visual scaling, Binary Reduction, Cultural Signal-\ning,Prestige Signaling, Pandering, and Innuendo.\nFinally, we provide the rationale behind each device label\nand each tactic label we assign to the given propaganda con-\ntent. A rationale is a natural language description of why the\ncorresponding device/tactic label is assigned based on the\n1https://www.politifact.com/\n2https://fullfact.org/\n3https://www.factcheck.org/\n4https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\n5Other propaganda theories can also be used.information extracted from the input. As we will see, ratio-\nnale generation could improve model interpretability.\nTask 2: Domain-independent message detection with ra-\ntionales. Inspired by existing propaganda theory regarding\nthe content of an article (Ellul 1973; Altheide and Johnson\n1980), we detect the types of the (possibly hidden) messages\nconveyed by the author in our second task. The messaging in\nthis task is domain-independent and attempts to communi-\ncate a broad idea to provoke an emotional reaction. An initial\nset of message types we identified includes: Might, Fear, In-\nspiration, Urgency, Unity, Teamwork, Patriotism, Superior-\nity,Abundance, Reciprocity, Sacrifice, Masculinity, Ingenu-\nity,Virtue, Progress, Security, Reassurance, Fun, and Same-\nness. We expect this list to grow as we identify additional\ntypes. Multiple message types may be applicable to a given\npropaganda content. As in Task 1, in this task the rationale\nbehind each annotated message will be annotated.\nTask 3: Domain-specific message detection with ratio-\nnales. Like Task 2, Task 3 also concerns identifying the\ntypes of messages conveyed by the author, but the message\ntypes in this task are domain-specific and therefore would\nneed to be redesigned for each new domain. For wartime\npropaganda such as those that appear in En Guardia, the\nmessage types could include: Military Strength, Industrial\nProduction, US-Latin American Cooperation, US culture,\nUS Leadership, WW2, Pan-Americanism, War preparation,\nEconomic Interests, Gendered messaging, Civilian contribu-\ntions, and Common Culture. Again, multiple message types\nmay be applicable to a given propaganda content. As in\nTasks 1 and 2, in this task the rationale behind each anno-\ntated message will be annotated.\nTask 4: Main message generation with rationales. This\ntask concerns generating the main message conveyed by the\nauthor in natural language. As in the first three tasks, here\nthe rationale behind the main message will be annotated.\nTask 5: Background knowledge. As noted before, back-\nground knowledge may be needed to properly interpret pro-\npaganda content. The background knowledge needed will be\nannotated in the form of natural language sentences.\nTask 6: Image captioning. Existing image encoders may\nfail to encode all the details of an image, particularly when\nthe image contains abstract concepts. To mitigate the diffi-\nculty of accurately extracting information from images, we\npropose an auxiliary task, image captioning, where we anno-\ntate the information present in an image in natural language\nso that the resulting caption is an equivalent textual repre-\nsentation of the image. With these annotations, we can train\na model to first caption an image and use the resulting cap-\ntion in lieu of the original image for further processing.\nSample Annotation\nWe propose to annotate each propagandistic article in the\nform of an argument tree, which is the representation used\nby argument mining researchers to represent the argumenta-\ntive structure of a persuasive document (Stab and Gurevych\n2014). In an argument tree, the root node corresponds to the\nmain claim of the document, and each child of a node cor-\nresponds to a piece of supporting evidence (which can be a\nclaim or a premise) for the parent. In other words, each edge\n15371\nProtecting the oceans from enemies is vital to western\nhemisphere interests in maintaining free maritime commerce.\nInferenceLegends\nR\nD: Card Stacking  \nT: Visual ScalingD: Card Stacking  \nT: Visual ScalingT2: Fear\nD: TransferT2: Security T3: Economic Interests T3: Enemy Atrocities\nD: Transfer R2 R3 R5 R6\nR4 R4 R1 R1R7R R\nRationale extracted from\nimages (yellow)/text\n(blue)/both images and\ntext (red)\nT: t T: t\nTask annotations extracted\nfrom images/textMain messageFigure 3: Sample argument tree for the input taken from Figure 2(b).

R1: A gun scope is pointing at a ship, which creates a sense\nof danger, hence Visual Scaling. However, who is holding the gun is unclear (partial information), hence Card Stacking. R2:\nA sense of Fear created by the gun scope. R3: the image depicts a (potential) crime of bombardment, hence Enemy Atrocities.\nR4: Use the idea of the U.S. protecting maritime commerce to justify other U.S. military involvements, hence Transfer. R5:\n\u201cLa armada norteamericana ... proteger \u00b4a a los buques mercantes\u201d means \u201cthe American army will protect merchant vessels\u201d,\nwhich suggests a sense of Security. R6: \u201cLos oc \u00b4eanos no son barreras, sino las amplias rutas del comercio mundial\u201d means \u201cthe\noceans are the routes of world trades\u201d, which focuses on Economic Interests. R7: Since the image suggests threats to maritime\ntrades, while the text suggests the U.S. will protect maritime trades, we can get the overall message by combining them.\ndenotes a support relation. A leaf node always corresponds\nto a premise, which by definition does not need any support.\nTo enable the reader to understand how to annotate a pro-\npagandistic article as an argument tree, we show in Figure 3\nthe argument tree that should be produced for input taken\nfrom Figure 2(b). As we can see, the root node contains the\nmain message (see Task 4). It has five children, which im-\nplies that it is supported by five pieces of evidence, includ-\ning the domain-independent and domain-dependent mes-\nsages derived from the image, the domain-independent and\ndomain-dependent messages derived from the text and the\nrationale associated with the main message, which is also\nderived from the text. For each of the first four children,\nthere are two child nodes, one corresponding to its rationale\nand the other corresponding to the device(s) and tactic(s)\nused. The fifth child, which is a rationale, is a leaf node.\nNote that a rationale always appears in a leaf node, the rea-\nson being that rationales are derived directly from either the\nimage or the text (or both) and therefore do not need any\nsupport. The remaining nodes in the tree can be interpreted\nin a similar fashion. Note that the annotations for Tasks 1\u20135\nwill always appear as nodes in the tree.\n4 Models\nGiven a dataset annotated using our annotation scheme, we\ncan train a model to perform the six annotation tasks. Given\nthe recent successes of neural models in NLP, we propose to\nemploy neural models for our task. As a first step, we can\nemploy existing models and design new models for this task\nif needed. There are several considerations.\nMultimodal vs. unimodal models. Since our input is\nmultimodal and composed of text and image(s), it would\nbe natural to train a multimodal model assuming three in-\nputs: two of them correspond to the two modalities andthe remaining one encodes the background knowledge base\n(assembled using the background knowledge annotated for\neach training instance, for example). The images can be\nencoded using a visual encoder such as ResNet (He et al.\n2016) and ViLBERT (Lu et al. 2019), whereas the text in-\nputs (including the background knowledge base) could be\nencoded using a neural encoder such as SpanBERT (Joshi\net al. 2020). The outputs from the encoders can then be con-\ncatenated together for further processing.\nAlternatively, one can employ a unimodal model where\nwe caption the image first (Task 6) with the help of an ob-\nject detection system (e.g., YOLO (Redmon et al. 2016)) and\npossibly an off-the-shelf image captioning system (e.g., X-\nTransformer (Pan et al. 2020), VinVL (Zhang et al. 2021)).\nAs noted before, the caption is supposed to be an equivalent\ntextual representation of the corresponding image. The cap-\ntion can then be encoded by a text encoder, and the resulting\nrepresentation can be concatenated with the encoded outputs\nfrom the text side for further processing.\nJoint vs. pipeline models. Should we adopt a pipeline ar-\nchitecture where we first train a model for each task inde-\npendently of the others and then apply the resulting models\nin a pipeline fashion? For instance, given multimodal pro-\npagandistic articles, we can first train a model to caption the\nimage (Task 6), as described above. After that, we can train a\nmodel to identify the device(s) and another model to identify\nthe tactic(s) (Task 1). To improve model interpretability, the\nrationales can be predicted jointly with the corresponding\ndevice(s)/tactic(s). We can similarly train models to predict\nthe domain-independent and domain-specific labels (Tasks 2\nand 3) jointly with their rationales by using all of the avail-\nable information predicted so far (e.g., the tactics and de-\nvices, the caption). Finally, we can train a model to predict\nthe main message (Task 4).\n15372\nRecall that pipeline models are prone to error propaga-\ntion, where errors made by an upstream model will propa-\ngate to a downstream model. To mitigate error propagation,\nwe can consider joint models. Specifically, we can train one\nmodel to perform all of the six tasks jointly. Joint models\nallow the different tasks involved to benefit each other via\na shared input representation layer. The major downside of\na joint model is that the resulting network (and hence the\ncorresponding learning task) is typically very complex.\nPre-trained models. A key challenge in the automatic\nprocessing of propaganda is the need for background knowl-\nedge. While we have access to background knowledge\nthrough the manual annotations obtained as part of Task 5, it\nis conceivable that the amount of background knowledge we\nneed will far exceed what these annotations can provide. A\npotential solution to this background knowledge acquisition\nbottleneck is pre-training. More specifically, researchers in\nNLP have shown that a vast amount of general knowledge\nabout language, including both linguistic and commonsense\nknowledge, can be acquired by (pre-)training a language\nmodel in a task-agnostic manner using self-supervised learn-\ning tasks. Self-supervised learning tasks are NLP tasks for\nwhich the label associated with a training instance can be de-\nrived automatically from the text itself.6Because no human\nannotation is needed, a language model can be pre-trained\non a large amount of labeled data that can be automati-\ncally generated, thereby acquiring a potentially vast amount\nof knowledge about language. Many pre-trained language\nmodels have been developed and widely used in NLP, such\nas BERT (Devlin et al. 2019), XLNet (Yang et al. 2019),\nRoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019), ELECTRA (Clark et al. 2020),\nGPT-2 (Radford et al. 2019), T5 (Raffel et al. 2020), and\nBART (Lewis et al. 2020). These models have been shown to\noffer considerable improvements on a variety of NLP tasks.\nTo acquire the background knowledge needed for pro-\ncessing the articles in En Guardia, for instance, we can pre-\ntrain a language model on as many unannotated articles in\nEn Guardia as we can collect. The resulting model can then\nbe optimized for a specific task by fine-tuning its parameters\nusing the task-specific labeled data we obtained via our an-\nnotation process in the standard supervised fashion. While\nthere has been a lot of work on developing pre-trained lan-\nguage models, the development of multimodal pre-trained\nmodels that can understand both text and images, which is\nwhat we need for multimodal propaganda processing, is a\nrelatively unexplored area of research.\n5 Related Work\nMemes. Memes are user-created pictures, often accompa-\nnied by text, that are used to express opinions on all kinds\nof topics. Similar to propaganda messaging, memes typi-\ncally require background knowledge for proper interpreta-\ntion. Memes are widely used in political manipulation cam-\npaigns as a tool for conveying propaganda messaging (Far-\n6A well-known self-supervised learning task is Masked Lan-\nguage Modeling (MLM) (Devlin et al. 2019). Given a sequence\nof word tokens in which a certain percentage of tokens is masked\nrandomly, the goal of MLM is to predict the masked tokens.well 2014; Forelle et al. 2015; Bradshaw and Howard 2018;\nDiResta et al. 2018). Hence, unveiling hidden information\nfrom memes is highly related to processing propaganda mes-\nsaging from images and text. There has been recent work\nthat aims to build a model to detect a rich set of propaganda\ntechniques in memes (Dimitrov et al. 2021).\nDocument-level unimodal misinformation analysis.\nSeveral publicly-available datasets are composed of news\narticles labeled with whether they contain misinformation.\nFor example, in the TSHP-17 dataset (Rashkin et al. 2017),\neach article is labeled with one of four classes: trusted,\nsatire, hoax, and propaganda, whereas in the QProp\ndataset (Barr \u00b4on-Cede \u02dcno et al. 2019), only two labels are\nused: propaganda and non-propaganda. Da San Martino\net al. (2019), on the other hand, develop a corpus of news\narticles labeled with the propaganda techniques used.\nTheir corpus enables the study of multi-label multi-class\nclassification task in propaganda identification.\nMultimodal misinformation classification. Some re-\nsearchers have examined the task of multimodal propaganda\nidentification. For instance, V olkova et al. (2019) construct a\ndataset consisting of 500,000 Twitter posts classified into six\ncategories (disinformation, propaganda, hoaxes, conspira-\ncies, clickbait, and satire) and build models to detect mis-\nleading information in images and text. While this attempt\nseeks to perform a shallow analysis of tweets, we propose to\nperform a deep analysis of propaganda content, which would\nlead to the generation of the hidden messages conveyed.\n6 Concluding Remarks\nWe presented the task of multimodal propaganda processing\nand discussed the key challenges. Below we conclude with\nseveral other issues that are also relevant to the task.\nPropaganda identification. While we have focused on\nanalyzing propaganda content, it is equally important to\nidentify such content. Although we did not explicitly discuss\nhow such content can be identified, a system that can analyze\npropaganda content could also be used for identifying such\ncontent. More specifically, if the system determines that no\npersuasion devices and tactics were being used in the given\ncontent, it could imply that the content is not propagandis-\ntic. Another possibility would be to train a model to distin-\nguish propaganda content from non-propaganda content on\nour corpus of propaganda articles and other non-propaganda\narticles collected from the Internet.\nDomain transferability. Since the models described thus\nfar are trained on domain-specific annotations (i.e., the back-\nground knowledge from Task 5 and the domain-specific la-\nbels from Task 4), they are necessarily domain-specific. To\nfacilitate their application to a new domain, especially when\nlabeled training data in the new domain is scarce, we can\nexplore domain adaptation techniques.\nEthical considerations. Care should be taken to ensure\nthat propaganda processing technologies would not be mis-\nused by people to attack their political opponents by in-\ntentionally using a propaganda processing system to draw\nwrong conclusions or generate propaganda content aiming\nto achieve their personal agenda, for instance.\n15373\nReferences\nAltheide, D.

We show that comments on articles from unreliable news websites are posted more\noften in right-leaning subreddits and that within individual subreddits, comments, on average, are 32% more\nlikely to be toxic compared to comments on reliable news articles. Using a regression model, we show that\nthese results hold after accounting for partisanship and baseline toxicity rates within individual subreddits.\nUtilizing a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, we further show that as the toxicity of subreddits\nincreases, users are more likely to comment on posts from known unreliable websites. Finally, modeling user\ninteractions with an exponential random graph model, we show that when reacting to a Reddit submission\nthat links to a website known for spreading unreliable information, users are more likely to be toxic to users\nof different political beliefs. Our results collectively illustrate that low-quality/unreliable information not only\npredicts increased toxicity but also polarizing interactions between users of different political orientations.\nCCS Concepts: \u2022Human-centered computing \u2192Collaborative and social computing ;Empirical studies\nin collaborative and social computing ;\u2022Information systems \u2192Web Mining ;\u2022Networks \u2192Online\nsocial networks ;\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: Misinformation, Toxicity, Political Polarization, Reddit, Online Communi-\nties\n1 INTRODUCTION\nContent Warning : This paper studies online toxicity. When necessary for clarity, this paper\nquotes user content that contains profane, politically inflammatory, and hateful content.\nOver the last decade, misinformation, incivility, and political polarization have corroded the\npublic\u2019s trust in democratic institutions [ 17,25,51,52,55]. Despite their shared roles in dis-\nrupting discourse and stoking political division, misinformation, online toxicity, and polariza-\ntion are separate phenomena, and their complex interaction remains debated and somewhat un-\nclear [ 20,29,32,36,54,95,125,134,138]. For instance, recent work from Quattrociocchi et al. [ 105]\nfound that on that X (formerly Twitter), toxic language is equally distributed across conversations\nregardless of the presence of reliable or unreliable news. Similarly, Cinelli et al. found that \u201cthere\nare no significant differences between the proportions of hate speech detected in comments on\nvideos from questionable and reliable channels\u201d on YouTube [ 29]. In contrast, Mosleh et al. [ 97,98]\nfound that false headlines on Twitter are correlated with increased toxicity and Dicicco et al. [ 35]\nfound that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories emerged amongst users who\nregularly employed toxic language.\nIn this work, we investigate the interplay of toxicity, partisanship, and unreliable information in\na more controlled environment: Reddit. In contrast to prior work, which has studied unstructured\nplatforms like Twitter and YouTube [ 101,115], Reddit communities have relatively distinct and stable\npolitical and toxicity norms [ 84,94,110], allowing for more direct study of the complex interplay\nof toxicity, partisanship, and unreliable information. By investigating individual communities,\nquantifying their level of political engagement, and identifying internal differences between and\nwithin them, we analyze the extent to which partisanship, polarization, and unreliable news predict\nAuthors\u2019 addresses: Hans W.

A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nincreased toxicity. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, which has been limited to explicitly\npolitical settings, we analyze a diverse set of subreddits, measuring the influence of misinformation\non toxicity while accounting for the \u201cpoliticalness\u201d of each community [ 94]. Concretely, we ask the\nfollowing research questions:\n(1)Do Reddit posts linking to articles from unreliable websites have increased toxicity in their\nengagement? How do subreddit norms (e.g., political partisanship) predict toxicity?\n(2)Does unreliable news exacerbate toxic interactions between users with political partisanship\ndifferences (i.e., affective polarization)?\nTo answer these questions, we measure the levels of toxicity, political partisanship, and propensity to\npost articles from websites known to spread misinformation on Reddit over 18 months (January 2020\nto June 2021). We determine the number of toxic comments within each subreddit and from\nindividual users using the Google Jigsaw API [ 2], a commonly deployed classifier for identifying\ntoxic language. Then, utilizing a Word2Vec approach from Waller et al. [ 141], we approximate\nthe partisanship and \u201cpoliticalness\u201d of a subset of subreddits and users along the US left\u2013right\npolitical spectrum. Finally, we utilize previously curated lists of reliable and unreliable news\nsites to determine the levels at which communities and users link to websites known to spread\nmisinformation. From these calculations, we analyze the relationships between toxicity, political\npartisanship, and misinformation:\nRQ1: Toxicity, Partisanship, and Unreliable Information. We first determine whether there\nare distinct levels of user political partisanship and toxicity in the comments that respond to\narticles from unreliable versus reliable news outlets. We find that comments posted on articles\nfrom unreliable websites are on average 32% more toxic within individual subreddits and 25% more\ntoxic across Reddit as a whole than comments responding to reliable websites. Fitting a linear\nregression against the average toxicity of users\u2019 comments, we find that the \u201cpoliticalness\u201d/level of\npolitical engagement, each subreddit/community\u2019s toxicity norms, and prominently whether a post\ninvolves a low-reliability news website predict the toxicity of conversations. Finally, we show that\nas subreddits become more toxic, users are more likely to comment on unreliable news articles. In\ncontrast, submissions linked to reliable sources are less likely to be engaged with in more toxic\ncommunities.\nRQ2: Engagement with Unreliable News Source\u2019s Predicting Inter-Political Strife. Having\nidentified that users who comment on unreliable sources are more likely to post toxic comments\nthan those who respond to reliable website posts, we examine the role of political partisanship in\nthese toxic interactions. We find that users who comment under Reddit submissions to unreliable\nsources have a higher rate of inter-partisan toxicity compared to users who comment under reliable\nsources (1.38 odds ratio) and on Reddit generally (1.19). Indeed, users who comment on unreliable\ndomain submissions are more likely to respond to users of different political views in a toxic manner\nand to reciprocate toxic comments aimed at them.\nAltogether, we show unreliable websites\u2019 role in promoting toxicity on Reddit. Our work, one\nof the first to examine the relationship between unreliable news sources, toxicity, and political\npartisanship within and between different communities of varying levels of political engagement\nillustrates the need to fully understand the complex interactions between these phenomena so that\nplatforms can better understand and address toxicity online.\n2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we detail key definitions, provide background on Reddit, and overview prior works\nthat analyze the effects of misinformation, toxicity, and political polarization on social media.\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 3\n2.1 Terminology\nBuilding on extensive prior work on misinformation, toxicity, and political polarization [ 28,58,61,\n130], we utilize community-accepted definitions of the following terms:\nReliable and Unreliable Domains. As in previous studies [ 9,59,61,70,77,90,143], we define\nmisinformation as information that is false or inaccurate regardless of author intention. Similarly,\nwe define unreliable domains as websites that regularly publish false information about current\nevents and that do not engage in journalistic norms such as attributing authors and correcting\nerrors [ 4,9,26,61,67,100,123,149]. Conversely, we define reliable domains as websites that\ngenerally adhere to journalistic norms including attributing authors and correcting errors; altogether\npublishing mostly true information [61, 67, 149].\nOnline Toxicity and Incivility. Given our use of the Google Jigsaw Perspective API [ 2], we use\ntheir definition of toxicity: \u201c (explicit) rudeness, disrespect or unreasonableness of a comment that is\nlikely to make one leave the discussion. \u201d\nPartisanship. We define partisanship as users\u2019 and communities\u2019 place on the US left\u2013right political\nspectrum [ 113]. We note the limitation of this definition given the variety of political views within\nthe US. However, in line with previous work [ 64,116,117], we utilize this definition, which largely\nfits much of US-centered political discussion, to understand how right-leaning and left-leaning\nusers and communities interact with one another and news.\nAffective Political Polarization: Affective political polarization is the tendency of individuals to\ndistrust and be negative to those of different political beliefs while being positive towards people\nof similar political views [37].\n2.2 Reddit\nReddit is an online social media platform composed of millions of subcommunities known as\nsubreddits [ 3,23]. Subreddits are dedicated to specific topics, ranging from politics (r/politics) and\nscience (r/science) to Pokemon (r/pokemon). Depending on the community, users can submit news\narticles, opinions, images, and memes as submissions . Underneath these submissions, other users\ncan comment or reply to comments from other users. Anyone can create a subreddit and subred-\ndits are moderated by Reddit content policies, subreddit-specific rules, and implicit community\nnorms [ 23,42,75]. Subreddit norms vary widely [ 144] and encompass political behaviors, tolerance\nto misinformation, and toxic behavior [23, 75, 110, 144].\n2.3 Partisanship and Polarization\nPeople, both in real life and on the Internet, tend to associate with like-minded people [ 13,14,\n60,62,71,81,106]. Wojcieszak et al. [ 146] find that while the majority of political discussions\nonline are between participants who share the same viewpoint, many users doenjoy conversations\nwith people with different viewpoints [ 128]. Despite this, past works have found that social media\nplatforms are one of the drivers of political polarization [ 20,22,65,81]. Sunstein, Garett et al.,\nand Quattrociocchi et al. all argue that the \u201cindividualized\u201d experience offered by social media\nplatforms comes with the risk of creating \u201cinformation cocoons\u201d and \u201cecho chambers\u201d that accelerate\npolarization [ 50,107,129]. Conover et al. [ 30] find that Twitter/X\u2019s structure fosters increased\nlevels of politically polarized conversations. Bessi et al. [ 16], examining the behaviors of 12 million\nusers, find that partisan echo chambers are driven by the algorithms of both Facebook and YouTube.\nTorres et al. [ 131] find the specific Twitter behavior of \u201cfollow trains\u201d induce highly politically\npolarized behavior on the platform.\nIn a similar vein, prior work has found that the increased political polarization engendered\nby social media causes several negative downstream effects including the increased sharing of\n4 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nmisinformation and toxic online behaviors. Imhoff et al. [ 74], for example, find that political\npolarization is associated with beliefs in conspiracy theories. Ebling et al. [ 39] similarly find that\npolitical partisanship levels on social media are associated with medical misinformation about\nCOVID-19. Other studies have further interrogated the adverse effects that social media has\nhad on the democratic process due to the increased political polarization associated with social\nmedia [57, 103, 134, 135].\n2.4 Misinformation\nMisinformation has increasingly become a major aspect of the conversations on social media [ 9,\n48,53]. Even after controlling for cascade size, Juul and Ugander find that false information\nspreads deeper and wider on Twitter/X than true information [ 80]. Furthermore, misinformation\noften convinces those who are exposed to it. A large percentage of US adults were exposed to\nmisinformation stories by social media during the 2016 election [ 9] and many believed these false\nstories [ 8,59]. As COVID-19 spread throughout the world, online misinformation and conspiracy\ntheories became a major hurdle to curbing its spread [114, 124].\nTo prevent the spread of misinformation, recent research has focused on tracking and stemming\nits flow [ 61,134]. For example, Mahl et al. [ 93], track the spread of 10 conspiracy theories on Twitter,\nidentifying one of the largest conspiracy theorist networks. Ahmed et al. [ 5] use a similar approach\nto track the spread of COVID-19 and 5G conspiracy theories. They find well-known misinformation\nwebsites were some of the largest sources spreading these conspiracy theories on Twitter. Gruzd [ 58]\nfound that a single Tweet about how COVID-19 was a hoax, spurred an entire conspiracy theory,\neventually prompting large groups of people to film their local hospitals to prove that COVID-19\nwas not real. In addition to network-based approaches, others have used advancements in natural\nlanguage processing to identify and track misinformation. Hanley et al. [ 63], for example, utilize\nsemantic search to identify and track Russian state-media narratives on Reddit. Fong et al. [ 44]\nutilized linguistic and social features to understand the psychology of Twitter users that engaged\nwith known conspiracy theorists. Finally, several works have performed in-depth case studies on\nthe spread of specific false narratives: Wilson and Starbird et al. look at the Syrian White Helmets\non Twitter and B\u00e4r et al. look at the spread of QAnon on Parler [19, 145].\n2.5 Toxicity\nOnline toxicity takes many forms including threats, sexual harassment, doxing, coordinated bullying,\nand political incivility [ 46,47,92,130]. Toxic comments, in particular, are one of the most common\nforms of hate and harassment online [ 130] and are seemingly an inescapable part of social media [ 31,\n85,99,130,147]. Past studies have found that 41% of Americans and 40% of those globally have\nexperienced bullying or harassment online [ 38,130]. Facebook estimates that 0.14\u20130.15% of all\nviews on their platform are of toxic comments [ 41]. This type of incivility, in addition to damaging\nonline conversations, has been found to also damage civil institutions [ 17,135] having dangerous\nreal-world implications. For example, Fink et al. [ 43] find that politically charged anti-Muslim hate\nspeech on Facebook in Myanmar was a prominent aspect preceding the Rohingya genocide.\nTo limit toxicity, platforms have designed and implemented a variety of safeguards [ 1,2,41].\nOther researchers have further performed in-depth studies on users\u2019 behavior to understand\nabusers and victims of abuse. For instance, Founta et al. [ 45] identify a set of network and account\ncharacteristics of abusive accounts on Twitter. Hua et al. [ 69] look at properties of the accounts\nthat have heavily negative interactions with political candidates on Twitter. Finally, Chang et al.,\nXia et al., Zhang et al., and Lambert et al. all look at the set of causes that make conversations\nunhealthy or toxic [88, 148, 150, 151].\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 5\n2.6 The Interplay of Misinformation, Online Toxicity, and Political Polarization\nSeveral works have attempted to understand how political partisanship, online toxicity, and misin-\nformation interact. Online toxicity, for instance, has been heavily associated with increased political\npolarization and misinformation [ 29,134]. Rajadesingan et al. [ 109], find that political discussions\nin non-overtly political subreddits often lead to less toxic conversations. Cinelli et al. [ 29], show\nthat misinformation about COVID-19 on YouTube promoted hate and toxicity. Chen et al. [ 25],\nutilizing network-based analysis, find that misleading online videos often lead to increased incivility\nin their comments. Separately, Rains et al. [ 108] find that political extremism is a major factor\nin toxicity online. De Francisci Morales et al. [ 33] find, most markedly that the interaction of\nindividuals of different political orientations increased negative conversational outcomes. Similarly,\nKim et al., Kwon et al., and Shen et al. find that exposure to negative conversations increases\nobservers\u2019 tendency to further engage in incivility [ 83,87,125]. Finally, Imhoff et al. [ 74] find that\npolitical polarization is a key aspect of people\u2019s belief in false narratives. However, despite this\npanoply of research, it is unclear how political partisanship and toxicity interact in the presence\nof misinformation and across political environments. In this work, we seek to understand this\ndynamic.\n2.7 Present Work\nWhile several previous works have studied partisanship and affective polarization [ 33,40,94],\nfinding evidence of inter-partisan hostility, these works has been limited to explicitly politically-\noriented spaces and do not study the influence of unreliable information or misinformation. As\nshown by Rajadesingan et al. [ 109] and Mamakos et al. [ 94], political discussions frequently take\nplace in non-overtly political subreddits. Limiting the study of how partisanship and unreliable\ninformation affect users\u2019 discussions to only overly political subreddits, as in past works, can thus\ngive an incomplete picture of user behavior. As found by Efstratiou et al., different subreddits can\nhave different \u201cecho chamber-like\u201d behaviors and inter-partisan discussions depending on their\npoliticalness [40].\nOur work seeks to understand how partisanship and unreliable news sources that spread largely\nnon-factual information contribute to this toxicity and user engagement in both political and non-\npolitical contexts and within individual subreddits/communities. Given that our work quantifies the\npoliticalness and other characteristics of a subreddit or a user utilizing the methodology outlined\nby Waller et al. [ 141], we can account for this factor in contributing to toxicity and explore how\nunreliable sources interact in different subreddit environments and across different community\nstandards. By examining how these unreliable and reliable sources differ in toxicity both within\nand between individual subreddits and across subreddits of different types of politicalness, we seek\nto understand the extent to which unreliable news promotes toxicity and engagement among users\nof different political orientations.\n3 DATASETS AND METHODS\nIn this section, we provide an overview of our datasets and describe how we calculate the political\npartisanship of users and subreddits, how we determine the toxicity of posts and comments, and\nhow we identify user interactions with unreliable and reliable website sources.\n3.1 Reddit Dataset\nWe study 18 months of Reddit comments and submissions from January 2020 to June 2021, which we\ncollect using Pushshift [ 15]. Altogether, we gather 2.2 billion comments and 491 million submissions.\nEach comment and submission includes its timestamp, author\u2019s username, subreddit, and the\n6 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nconversation thread where the comment was posted. We note that all data was collected before\nPushshift fell outside Reddit\u2019s Terms of Service in April 2023. Using this data, we reconstruct the\nconversation threads for each user and subreddit.\nAs in Kumar et al. [ 84], given that many Reddit comments labeled as toxic are simply sexually\nexplicit and contained within 18+ communities, we exclude 18+ subreddits from our study. As\nargued by Kumar et al. [ 84], while toxic behaviors do occur within these subreddits, the explicit\nallowance of sexually explicit language leads to a large number of false positives, complicating\nanalysis. In addition to filtering out 18+ subreddits, we limit our analysis to English-language\nmisinformation and thus filter our dataset using the whatlanggo Go language library1to only\nEnglish-language comments. Finally, given the model that we utilize to detect toxicity, we limit\nour analysis to comments that are 15\u2013300 characters in length [ 85]. Finally, to ensure that the user\nand subreddit characteristics that we extract are robust, we only calculate statistics for subreddits\nwith at least 100 comments and users that posted at least 5 comments. Altogether, our final dataset\nconsists of 327M Reddit submissions, 1.6B comments, and 15.5M users from 57.2K subreddits.\n3.2 Unreliable and Reliable Domain Dataset\nTo analyze how users interact with misinformation, we first gather a set of unreliable and re-\nliable websites (as a control). Specifically, we aggregate a list of unreliable/misinformation and\nreliable/authentic-news domains from Media-Bias/Fact-Check.2We consider websites as \u201cunreli-\nable\u201d if their factfulness rating from Media-Bias/Fact-Check is \u201cLow\u201d or \u201cVery Low\u201d; conversely,\nwe consider a website as \u201creliable\u201d if its factuality rating from Media-Bias/Fact-Check is \u201cMostly\nFactual\u201d, \u201cHigh\u201d, or \u201cVery High\u201d. We include \u201cMostly Factual\u201d in this category given that it includes\nwebsites like cnn.com and washtingtonpost.com. To ensure consistency, we further cross-reference\nthese two lists of websites against news websites previously gathered by Iffy News,3OpenSources,4\nPolitifact,5Snopes,6Melissa Zimdars,7and Hanley et al. [ 64]. Our final list of misinformation\noutlets consists of 1,054 websites, which encompass sites like theconservativetreehouse.com and\ninfowars.com [ 64]. Separately, our list of reliable news sites consists of 3,754 websites from across\nthe political spectrum, including sites like cnn.com and nytimes.com.\n3.3 Approximating the Partisanship of Subreddits and Users\nTo approximate the political partisanship of subreddits and Reddit users, we adopt the neural\nembedding approach described by Waller et al. [ 140,141], which learns subreddit and user embed-\ndings/vectors based on the interaction data of users within subreddits. This is such that a high\ncosine similarity between two users would indicate that the two users comment/post in similar\nor the same subreddits; conversely, a high similarity between two subreddits would indicate that\nthey share similar user bases. By computing subreddit and user similarity scores along a political\npartisanship dimension created when training the Wor2Vec model, as in Waller et al. [ 141], this\napproach enables the approximation of the partisanship of users and subreddits. We utilize this\napproach as it allows us to avoid biases in previous manual labels of the political orientation of\nsubreddits and because it allows us to label the orientation. Specifically, as in Waller et al. [ 141], we\napply the Word2Vec algorithm to our Reddit data where subreddits are treated as \u201cwords\u201d and users\n1https://github.com/abadojack/whatlanggo\n2https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\n3https://iffy.news/index\n4https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus\n5https://www.politifact.com/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/\n6https://github.com/Aloisius/fake-news\n7https://library.athenstech.edu/fake\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 7\nare treated as \u201ccontexts\u201d. In this approach, every individual instance of a Reddit user commenting\nor submitting in a given subreddit is considered a word-context pair. Upon aggregating these\nword-context pairs, we subsequently train a Word2Vec using skip-gram with negative sampling\noutputting the vector embedding for each subreddit and for each user.\nFrom our vector embeddings, as specified by Waller et al. [ 141], we identify the political partisan-\nship dimension elicited by the Word2Vec to then categorize the political orientation of individual\nsubreddits and users. More concretely, after extracting our embeddings, we identify two simi-\nlar communities that differ primarily in the our dimension of interest; in this case, r/democrats\nand r/conservative. From the Word2Vec embeddings sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 and sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 that we\nelicited from these subreddits, we then compute the political partisanship dimensional vector\npr1=sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 \u2212sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 . To ensure that the political dimension that we are studying is\nnot overly specific to our seed communities of sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 and sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 , we subsequently\nidentify other pairs of similar communities whose difference vector has a high cosine similarity\nto our political partisanship dimensional vector pr1(i.e., other pairs of communities that differ\nprimarily in political partisanship direction). For example, in our work, other pairs of commu-\nnities that differed primarily along our political dimension included: r/liberalgunowners and\nr/gunpolitics, r/climatechange and r/climateskeptics, and r/askaliberal and r/askaconservative. As\nin Waller et al. [ 141], we average thee vectors to get our final partisanship dimensional vector pr1\n=sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 \u2212sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 using 10 unique political pairs.\npr=1\n1010\n\u2211\n\ud835\udc56pr\ud835\udc56 (1)\nTo project individual subreddits onto the political partisanship dimension, we compute the\ncosine similarity between a given community\u2019s Word2Vec embedding sr\ud835\udc5f\u21d1\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc66_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 and the\ncomputed political partisanship dimension prvector. To make these values more interpretable, as in\nWaller et al. [ 141], we determine the z-scores for each community\u2019s projected value on the political\npartisanship dimension. This is such that a community with a z-score of -1 could be interpreted\nas having a leftward stance with a political partisanship level of 1 standard deviation below the\nmean subreddit. As in Waller et al. [ 141], in addition to calculating the political partisanship of\nindividual subreddits, by taking the sum of the vectors of our communities utilized to compute\nthe political dimension, rather than the difference, we can also determine the \u201cpolitical\u201d-ness of\nindividual subreddits and communities. This measure assesses the level of political engagement of\na community or user, rather than pinpointing their position on the political spectrum. For example,\nthe r/law subreddit, while not particularly partisan (-0.19 \ud835\udf0e), is over two standard deviations above\nthe mean for politicalness (2.10 \ud835\udf0e).\nWe lastly note that given the many individual hyperparameters utilized within Word2Vec models\n(e.g., embedding size, down-sampling threshold, starting learning rate, etc...), we perform a grid-\nsearch on these parameters and subsequently validate the political partisanship scores those of\nWaller et al. [ 141]. We select the model with partisanship scores that have the greatest Pearson\ncorrelation with those provided by Waller et al.8We detail the hyperparameters and the values\nthat we optimize over in Appendix A.\n3.4 Identifying Toxic Comments and Approximating User and Subreddit Toxicity\nTo approximate the toxicity of Reddit users and subreddits, we utilize the Perspective API, a set of\nout-of-box toxicity classifiers from Google Jigsaw [ 2] that has been utilized extensively in prior\n8We do not utilize the political partisanship scores provided by Waller et al. [ 141] given that their study is limited to\n10,006 ubreddits and given that they do not provide vectors or partisanship scores for individual users.\n8 Hans W. A.

Subreddit and User Toxicity scores\u2014We determine the toxicity norms for subreddits with at least\n100 comments and for users with at least 5 comments. Each user and subreddit has distinctive toxicity\nnorms, posting toxic comments at different rates. At a threshold of 0.80, most users and the subreddit\u2019s usual\ncomments/posts are not considered toxic by the Perspective API SEVERE_TOXICITY classifier.\nworks [ 85,110,118]. Each classifier takes comments as input and returns a toxicity score of 0.00\u2013\n1.00; the closer a comment\u2019s score is to 1, the more likely the comment is to be toxic. In line with\nprior work, to consider a comment as toxic, we utilize a threshold of 0.80 on the SEVERE_TOXICITY\nclassifier [ 27,88]. As found by Kumar et al. [ 84,85], utilizing this particular classifier, while limiting\nrecall, provides an acceptable precision for identifying toxic online content.\n3.5 Ethical Considerations\nWithin this work, we focus on identifying trends in how subreddits interact with misinformation,\nlevels of toxicity, and levels of political polarization. While we do calculate toxicity and polarization\nlevels for individual users, we do not analyze specific users, we do not publish their usernames,\nand we do not attempt to contact or deanonymize them. We note that the Reddit submissions and\ncomments analyzed in this work were public and available through the Pushshift API [15].\n4 TOXICITY AND PARTISANSHIP IN MISINFORMATION POSTS\nIn this section, we examine the relationship between Reddit submissions utilizing unreliable\ninformation sources and their corresponding partisanship, toxicity, and user engagement ( i.e.,\nnumber of comments). Using reliable news submissions as a control and accounting for the types of\nsubreddits where posts to unreliable sources appear, we measure whether Reddit posts that link to\nknown unreliable information sources predict increased toxicity.

Altogether,\nwe find 633.59K submissions of unreliable news websites and a corresponding set of 5.29 million\ncomments and 7.55 million submissions that link to our set of reliable websites and 267 million\ncorresponding comments. We list the most frequently linked websites and subreddits that most\ncommonly link to our sets of sites in Table 1. Altogether, hyperlinks to unreliable websites were\nposted in 9,462 subreddits and to reliable websites in 29,673 subreddits (8,611 subreddits had links\nto both). The difference in the magnitude of submission is likely due to the greater popularity and\nwidespread appeal of reliable mainstream news compared with alternative, fringe websites [ 64].\nIndeed, utilizing the Alexa Top Million list from March 1, 2021 [ 7], we find that 991 reliable news\nwebsites (26.39%) were in the top 100K websites compared to 139 unreliable websites (13.19%).\nFor the rest of this section, while using partisanship, politicalness, and toxicity averages com-\nputed from our full Reddit dataset (see Section 3), we analyze the set of Reddit submissions and\nReddit comments that involve unreliable and reliable website submissions. We additionally remove\nAutoModerator comments and comments from accounts labeled as \u201cbots.\u201d\n4.1 Differences Between Unreliable and Reliable Website Submissions\nAcross our dataset, we find that 1.26% of all comments within our datasets were classified as toxic\n(i.e., Perspective SEV_TOX score>0.80), 1.24% of comments under reliable website submissions\nwere considered toxic, and 1.55% of comments on unreliable submissions (a 25% relative increase).\nHowever, as previously mentioned, these comments are largely posted in different communities\non Reddit and likely by different users. Performing a comparison across individual subreddits, we\nfind that there remains a mean absolute percentage increase of 0.35% (32.2% relative increase) in\ntoxicity ( \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216) for toxicity on unreliable news articles compared to reliable news articles.\nIn this section, we thus determine the differences between subreddits and users that interact with\nreliable versus unreliable news to understand this increase in toxicity.\nSubreddits. As seen in Table 2, on average, the subreddits where unreliable website submissions\nare posted are 1.13 standard deviations more right-leaning on the US political spectrum than those\nof reliable websites. This accords with previous research that has found that right-leaning users and\necosystems are more likely to spread misinformation [ 79]. However, we also observe that unreliable\nwebsite submissions tend to be posted in subreddits that are typically 0.75 standard deviations\nless political than reliable website submissions. For example, r/StreetFighter, a subreddit dedicated\n10 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nUnreliable Reliable Cohen\u2019s D\nAvg.

We determine different characteristics of the subreddits, commenters, and submitters that interact\nwith reliable and unreliable website submissions and subsequently determine the Cohen\u2019s effect size between\nthese values for unreliable news submissions and reliable news submissions. We perform Mann-Whitney U\ntests to ensure that the differences in the averages between unreliable and reliable website submissions are\nsignificant. We perform two-sample proportion tests for the percentages. Note, we performed a Bonferonni\ncorrection to assess whether values were significant, but all p-values tested were \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216and significant.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n|Post Age - Submitter Age|(Years)0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7Densityreliable=4.32\nunreliable=2.57\nUnreliable Domain Submitters\nReliable Domain Submitters\n(a) Age of Submitters\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n|Post Age - Commenter Age|(Years)0.0000.0250.0500.0750.1000.1250.1500.175Densityreliable=5.25\nunreliable=4.88\nUnreliable Domain Commenters\nReliable Domain Commenters (b) Age of Commenters\nFig. 3. Younger accounts are much more likely to submit and comment on unreliable website submissions.\nto the video game Street Fighter (politcalness=-0.47 \ud835\udf0e) contained 409 submissions to 4chan.org\nand r/MMA (politcalness=-0.43 \ud835\udf0e), had 81 links known Russian propaganda website rt.com [ 21]\nand far-right conspiracy site infowars.com [ 136]. Unreliable website submissions tend to be in\nsubreddits with higher average toxicity (2.01% vs. 1.40% of comments), which may explain the\nhigher likelihood of toxic comments in response to misinformation posts.\nSubmitters. In line with prior work, we find that users who submit unreliable websites articles as\nReddit submissions tend to be more right-leaning (-0.04 \ud835\udf0evs. -0.19 \ud835\udf0e), tend to be less political (-0.01 \ud835\udf0e\nvs. 0.49 \ud835\udf0e), tend to have slightly more toxic comments (0.93% 0.90%), and tend to have younger\naccounts (Table 2). Performing a subreddit pairwise comparison ( i.e., comparing the users who\nsubmitted unreliable websites in one subreddit to the users who also submitted reliable websites in\nthesame subreddit), we indeed find that users that submit unreliable websites tended to be more\nright-leaning (Cohen\u2019s D = 0.26, \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test), were\nvery slightly more political (Cohen\u2019s D = 0.01, \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216), and were slightly more toxic overall\n(0.12% absolute percentage increase, \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216).\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 11\nWe further observe that submitters of unreliable website hyperlinks tend to have younger\naccounts. As argued elsewhere, when posting inflammatory, revealing, or otherwise sensitive\ninformation [ 11,84,89], Reddit users often utilize disposable \u201cthrow-away\u201d accounts that are used\nonly to post this information anonymously. Indeed, as seen in Figure 3, within our dataset, we\nfind that while only 0.88% of reliable website submissions are submitted within the first week of\nan account\u2019s lifespan, 2.64% are submitted in the first week for unreliable websites (we perform a\nproportion test and find this difference to be significant \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216).\nCommenters. Commenters on unreliable website submissions tend to be slightly more right-\nleaning (0.56 \ud835\udf0evs. 0.09 \ud835\udf0e), slightly less political (0.20 \ud835\udf0evs. 0.25 \ud835\udf0e), but slightly more toxic (1.48% vs.\n1.36%). Performing a subreddit pairwise comparison ( i.e., comparing the users that commented\non unreliable websites in one subreddit to the users who commented on reliable websites in the\nsame subreddit), we find that the users who comment on unreliable websites have no significant\ndifference (using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in partisanship nor toxicity, but do differ\nslightly in politicalness (Cohen\u2019s D = -0.07). We thus see that after accounting for the subreddit,\nthat is largely the same type of users that comment on unreliable and reliable website submissions\nwithin a given subreddit . Despite seeing that within subreddits the users of similar partisanship and\ntoxicity post on unreliable and reliable news submissions, again performing this subreddit pairwise\ncomparison, we find as previously reported that there is a mean absolute percentage increase of\n0.35% (32.2% relative increase) in toxicity ( \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216) for unreliable submissions within each\nsubreddit. This illustrates that despite similar users participating in conversations surrounding\nunreliable and reliable news within a given subreddit, unreliable news comments tend to have\nmore toxic language.\nAs for submitters (Figure 3), we find that commenters on unreliable website submissions have\nyounger accounts than those for reliable website submissions (4.88 years vs. 5.25 years). We note\nthat, as with submitters, this may partially explain the increased toxicity of unreliable submission\ncommenters. Plotting the age of accounts versus the proportion of toxic comments in Figure 3a, we\nobserve that age is indeed correlated with the toxicity of commenters, with (as expected) unreliable\nnews websites having the highest toxicity overall regardless of the age of the account.\nModeration and Removed Comments. A potential confounder that can cloud our analysis is the\nactivity of Reddit moderators. Reddit moderators are members of particular subreddit communities\nwho help set rules and norms and help moderate content [ 10]. When a moderator on the Reddit\nplatform removes a comment, the comment is replaced with \u201c[removed]\u201d and other Reddit users can\nno longer view the comments. Altogether, 14,642 comments were removed from our set of unreliable\nwebsite submissions and 3,305,138 comments were removed from our set of reliable website\nsubmissions. As seen in Table 2, on average, reliable website submissions are more moderated\ncompared to unreliable website submissions (with an average of 2.00% comments being removed\ncompared to 2.82%). However, again performing a subreddit-wise pairwise comparison, we find\nthat within the subreddits where both reliable and unreliable submissions appear, unreliable news\ncommenters are actually moderated more heavily (Cohen\u2019s D = 0.37, \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216using the\npaired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This indicates, within subreddits that have both unreliable and\nreliable domain hyperlinks that unreliable ones are moderated more heavily; conversely, outside of\nthese subreddits, these unreliable website submissions are moderated more leniently. For example,\nwithin the r/bicycling subreddit, while 2.01% of reliable domain comments were removed, 19.35% of\nunreliable domain comments were removed. In contrast within the r/bitchute, where there were no\ncomments on reliable news domain hyperlinks, only 0.50% of comments were removed (BitChute\nis an alternative to YouTube known for hosting toxic and conspiratorial content [133]).\n12 Hans W.

Model of the toxicity of the comments in Reddit submissions. We fit a linear model to model the\npercentage of toxicity in each of the Reddit threads that contained a reliable domain or an unreliable domain\nin the submission. We perform backward selection based on the AIC to prevent overfitting.\nWe lastly examine the cases where a moderator left a comment or interacted with users in the\nsubreddit. As seen in Table 2, across all our submissions, moderators were involved in slightly more\nsubmissions in unreliable domain submissions, either as the submitter or as a commenter. We find\nthat the comments of submissions that had a moderator/admin involved were less toxic than those\nthat did not (1.04% vs. 1.66% for unreliable website submissions; 0.70% vs 1.12% for reliable website\nsubmissions). Performing a subreddit-wise pairwise comparison on the proportions of submissions\nper subreddit that had moderator involvement, we again see that unreliable news websites were\nvery slightly more likely to have a moderator involved (Cohen\u2019s D =0.05, \ud835\udc5d<1\u00d710\u221216using the\npaired Wilcoxon signed-rank test).\nSummary. In this section, we showed that links to websites known to spread unreliable information\nare correlated with higher toxicity: toxic comments under unreliable website submissions are posted\nat a rate of 1.55% while toxic comments in response to reliable website submissions are posted at a\nrate of 1.24%. Within individual subreddits, we find that on average, the toxicity rate increases on\naverage by an absolute 0.35% (32.2% relative increase). In addition, we observed that users who\npost and comment on misinformation are right-leaning.\n4.2 Prediction of Toxicity by Use of Unreliable Sources and Partisanship\nHaving seen the higher toxicity in response to unreliable website submissions, we now examine\nhow the factors previously examined interact with one another to collectively predict toxicity.\nSetup. We fit a linear model to understand how each of the features previously considered (Table 2)\npredicts the average toxicity comments responding to Reddit submissions. Specifically, we fit our\nmodel against the percentage of toxic comments in our 633.59K unreliable and 7.55M reliable website\nsubmissions. To ensure that our model does not overfit, we run a backward variable selection [ 34]\nbased on the Akaike information criterion [ 6] accounting for interaction between our variables.\nWe detail the variables and their found coefficients in Table 3.\nResults. As seen in Table 3, even after accounting for subreddit and user conditions, we see that\nthere is increased toxicity on Reddit in response to an unreliable website submission. Indeed, our\nmodel finds this variable to have the fourth largest coefficient ( \ud835\udefd=1.30\u00d710\u22123) in predicting\nthe overall toxicity of Reddit conversation, behind only overall subreddit toxicity, commenters\u2019\npropensity for toxicity, and the commenters\u2019 politicalness. Our fitted model further finds, as\nexpected from our previous analysis, that moderator involvement is associated with reduced\ntoxicity ( \ud835\udefd=\u22125.00\u00d710\u22125). This again reinforces that moderator involvement on the Reddit\nplatform is indeed associated with decreased measured toxicity [ 132]. As would further be expected,\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 13\nour model determines that subreddit toxicity ( \ud835\udefd=2.80\u00d710\u22123) and average toxicity of the users\nthat comment ( \ud835\udefd=1.02\u00d710\u22122) on a given submission is associated with increased toxicity within a\ngiven submission\u2019s comments. This further shows that the toxicity norms in particular subreddits\ndoaffect [110] how users interact.\nOur model determines that as subreddits become more political, ( i.e., are more aligned along\nthe US political spectrum) overall toxicity decreases. While this result is limited to posts that are\ncentered around news articles, increased politicalness of subreddits in the context of news articles\nappears to have a slight mitigating effect on toxicity. For example, as previously noted, the r/law\nsubreddit, while not being particularly partisan (-0.19 \ud835\udf0e), is over two standard deviations above the\nmean for politicalness (2.10 \ud835\udf0e) and only 0.49% of the subreddits\u2019 comments are considered toxic. We\nfurther see that this is the case when examining the interaction between commenter politicalness\nand subreddit politicalness ( \ud835\udefd=\u22124.00\u00d710\u22124), and the partisanship of individual commenters\n(\ud835\udefd=\u22121.00\u00d710\u22123). We hypothesize, as found in Rajadesingan et al. [ 110] that as subreddits become\nmore aligned to the political spectrum and their users further become aligned to the politicalness\nof the subreddit or community, stronger community norms are built and overall toxicity decreases.\nHowever, like Mamakos et al. [ 94], we find that as the overall partisanship, rather than simply\nthe politicalness of users and subreddits, increases, the toxicity of conversations increases ( \ud835\udefd=\n2.00\u00d710\u22124). Finally, again, as in Mamakos et al. [ 94], we find that as commenters become more\npolitical and engage in political discussions ( \ud835\udefd=1.50\u00d710\u22123), particularly if they engage in both\nright-leaning and left-leaning discussions and subreddits they tend to have increased toxicity and\nspread more toxic content on the Reddit platform.\nSummary. In this section, after fitting a linear regression model utilizing backward elimination,\nwe find that after accounting for partisanship and other commenter and subreddit-level factors,\nunreliable website submissions predict increased toxicity on Reddit. Our linear model further\nidentifies that a subreddit\u2019s level of political engagement along the US spectrum and toxicity norms\nalso play a role in predicting toxicity.\n4.3 Prediction of Engagement via Toxicity, Use of Unreliable Sources, and Partisanship\nHaving shown how the use of unreliable sources predicts increased toxicity on Reddit, we now\ndetermine some of the factors that may induce users increased engagement with unreliable websites\nand their information. Namely, having seen that unreliable sources are associated with more\ntoxicity and more politically right-wing environments compared to reliable sources, are toxicity,\npoliticalness, and partisanship correlated with more engagement with misinformation?\nSetup. To measure user engagement with unreliable and reliable website submissions, we utilize the\nnumber of comments that each submission receives.9As before, to properly model the number of\ncomments, we remove comments from Reddit \u201cauto moderator\u201d or explicitly \u201cbot\u201d labeled accounts.\nAltogether, we analyze our set of 633.59K unreliable website submissions, our set of 7.55M reliable\nwebsite submissions, and each of these sets\u2019 associated comments.\nTo model the number of comments on submissions, we utilize a zero-inflated negative binomial\nregression [ 112]. Within our model, each observation data point represents a single submission and\nits associated number of posted comments. We utilize a zero-inflated negative binomial regression\nas it appropriately models our set of count data. Unlike a Poisson model, which is often utilized\nto model count data, negative binomial regressions do not make the strong assumption that the\nmean of the data is equal to the variance [ 96]. (Some submissions garner thousands of comments\nwhile others garner none.) We further utilize the zero-inflated version of this regression given the\n9We utilize the number of comments rather than the number of upvotes/downvotes because Pushshift often fails to keep\nup-to-date information about the number of votes for submissions [15].\n14 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nheavy preponderance of submissions that do not receive any comments. After removing comments\nfrom auto moderators and bots, 61.50% of our reliable website submissions within our dataset did\nnot receive any comments, and 81.67% of our unreliable website submissions did not receive any\ncomments. A Poisson or normal negative binomial model would be unable to correctly model this\nbehavior.\nWe finally note that zero-inflated negative binomial regressions return two sets of coefficients.\nOne set of coefficients, the zero-inflated coefficients, estimated using logistic regression, reports the\nprobability that the given submission would receive zero comments as a function of the covariates.\nPositive coefficients for these zero-inflated coefficients indicate that increases in the predictor\nvariable make the submissions receiving zero comments more likely. Thus the more negative a\ncoefficient, the more the given covariate correlates with inducing at least 1 comment. The second set\nof coefficients, the negative binomial coefficients, model the number of comments as a function of\nthe covariates. For these coefficients, positive coefficients indicate that the larger the corresponding\ncovariate, the more comments that submission was likely to have received. We thus, in our analysis,\ncan understand how different covariates affect the probability that a given submission will receive\nanycomments andhow these same covariates affect the number of comments received. As factors\ninfluencing the number of comments, we utilize:\n(1) the submitter\u2019s admin/moderator status\n(2) the relative age of the account that posted the submission\n(3) the submitter\u2019s partisanship\n(4) the submitter\u2019s politcalness\n(5) the submitter\u2019s account\u2019s age\n(6) the submitter\u2019s toxicity\n(7) the subreddit\u2019s partisanship\n(8) subreddit\u2019s politcalness\n(9) the subreddit\u2019s toxicity\n(10) the average number of comments per submission of the subreddit\nWe again utilize backward variable selection based on the AIC for selecting variables.10\nResults. We now give an overview and describe some of the implications of our results using our\nnegative binomial regression to predict levels of user engagement based on levels of politicalness,\npartisanship, toxicity, and the use of unreliable news articles.\nSubmitter Admin/Moderator Status. For unreliable website submissions, we find that when a\nmoderator posts the submission they are more likely to get at least one comment compared to\na non-moderator account ( \ud835\udefd=\u22121.25). In contrast, for reliable website submissions, we find that\nthese moderator or admin accounts are less likely to gain at least one comment compared to\nnon-moderator accounts ( \ud835\udefd=0.20). For both unreliable and reliable website submissions, however,\nwe observe that when admin or moderator accounts post, do gain posts, they are more likely to\nreceive more comments than normal accounts. This largely accords with moderators\u2019 role on the\nplatform when making announcements in subreddits on which users then comment [91].\n10We spot-check our results to ensure that the higher the average number of comments in a given subreddit, the more likely\na submission is to see comments andthat this average correlates with more comments on submissions. In other words, we\ncheck that submissions in subreddits where users comment more, also see receive comments. As seen in both Tables 4 and 5,\nfor both unreliable and reliable website Reddit submissions, as the average number of comments in a subreddit increases, (1)\nthe more likely a submission is to receive comments and (2) the more comments it is likely to receive. Having observed this\nbehavior, we now examine the rest of the covariates within our fits (Tables 4 and 5).\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 15\nSubmitter Toxicity. Examining the submitting users\u2019 toxicity, we see somewhat similar behaviors\nfor both reliable and unreliable information submissions. Most notably, as the submitting users\nbecome more toxic, for both unreliable and reliable website submissions, they are more likely\nto provoke at least one comment. However, for unreliable website submissions, we observe that\nthe submitter\u2019s toxicity has a much larger effect on the probability of receiving at least one\ncomment( \ud835\udefd=\u221219.47vs.\ud835\udefd=\u22120.06). This illustrates that while for unreliable websites, increased\ntoxicity may induce greater initial engagement, this effect is not as strong for reliable websites.\nHowever, again in both cases, we see that while user toxicity often provokes at least one person to\nreact, we see that this toxicity often does not lead to more comments (the coefficient for unreliable\nwebsites is not statistically significant).\nSubmitter Politicalness. While we observe that for unreliable websites, the higher a user\u2019s politi-\ncalness, the more likely to induce at least one comment ( \ud835\udefd=\u22121.14), there is the opposite effect for\nreliable websites ( \ud835\udefd=2.43).

Fit of our zero-inflated negative binomial regression on the number of comments on our set of\nmainstream URL submissions across different subreddits.\n16 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nReddit users are perhaps being \u201cturned off\u201d and are engaging less with highly ideological users\ncompared to less political users [ 66]. However, we also find that the more political a user becomes\n(if the submission gets comments), the fewer comments unreliable website submissions are likely\nto receive ( \ud835\udefd=\u22120.49) in contrast to reliable website submissions which receive more comments\n(\ud835\udefd=0.22). This illustrates that highly politicized users may be more likely to engender a discussion\namongst users for reliable website submissions, but are less effective at gathering comments for\nunreliable website submissions.\nSubmitter Partisanship. For unreliable websites, we find that the more right-leaning a user, the\nless likely the user\u2019s post is to attract any user comments. Given the right-leaning nature of most\nof the subreddits (0.97 \ud835\udf0e) in which unreliable domain posts are submitted, this could likely be\ndue to these user\u2019s posts being seen as \u201cnormal\u201d and the posts not receiving many comments\n(\ud835\udefd=5.41). In contrast, for reliable news ( \ud835\udefd=\u22120.31), we see that as the submission\u2019s submitter\nbecomes more politically right-wing, the more likely their posts are to receive comments. Given\nreliable website submissions tend to be posted in left-leaning subreddits ( \u22120.17\ud835\udf0e), submissions from\nmore right-leaning users may be seen as more novel resulting in at least one user comment [ 68,\n82]. This also supports prior research that has found that out-group animosity may drive online\nengagement [ 111]. However, despite right-leaning users being able to attract at least one comment\nfor reliable website submission, we also observe, that as the posting user becomes more right-leaning\npartisan ideological, the fewer comments their post is likely to receive ( \ud835\udefd=\u22120.05) [66].\nSubmitter Age. For both unreliable and reliable websites, we find that older accounts are more\nlikely to provoke at least one comment and that the older the account the more comments that its\nsubmission is likely to get. This may indicate that accounts with more history may attract more\nengagement with their posts.\nSubreddit Toxicity. Looking at the subreddit toxicity coefficient in predicting whether a submission\nreceives comments, we see a marked difference between reliable website submissions and unreliable\nwebsite submissions. We see, notably, for misinformation submissions, the more toxic a subreddit\nis, the more likely the submission is to get comments ( \ud835\udefd=\u22120.99). In contrast, for reliable website\nsubmissions, the more toxic the subreddit, the more likely the submission is to not get any comments\n(\ud835\udefd=0.23). Misinformation websites often post inflammatory articles designed to engender angst in\ntheir readership.\nHowever, we further find, for reliable website submissions, that as subreddit toxicity increases,\nthe more comments submissions are likely to garner. In contrast for unreliable website submissions,\nthe more toxic the subreddit, the fewer comments the submission is likely to garner. This reflects\nthat when reliable website submissions get noticed or spark engagement in a toxic community, the\nmore toxic the environment the more users seem to comment and engage with the submissions.\nIn contrast, when articles from unreliable sources are noticed in toxic environments, they do not\nappear to draw extensive interactions. We thus see that reliable website submissions are more\noften ignored in toxic subreddits when compared to unreliable websites, and simultaneously that\nas communities get more toxic, they tend to comment more on reliable information and less on\nunreliable information submissions.\nSubreddit Politicalness. For both unreliable and reliable website submissions, the more political\na subreddit, the fewer users are likely to comment at all ( \ud835\udefd=1.05and \ud835\udefd=0.79. This largely\ndemonstrates again a novelty aspect given that highly political subreddits receive constant news\nupdates. However, for both unreliable ( \ud835\udefd=0.04) and reliable submissions( \ud835\udefd=0.19), we find that\nwhen a submission is commented on, subreddits\u2019 politicalnesses increase the likelihood of more\ncomments. This association is again probably largely a result of the fact that work measures\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 17\nusers\u2019 interaction with reliable and unreliable sources and that subreddits that are more politically\nengaged on the US political spectrum are more likely to be interested in news [ 56] and subsequently\ncomment on posts when they gain traction.\nSubreddit Partisanship. We find that for reliable websites, the more politically right-leaning a\nsubreddit, the less likely it is to gain any comments ( \ud835\udefd=0.51). Rather, as documented by Wang\net al. [142] subreddits like these often ignore more trustworthy sources. We similarly find for\nunreliable websites, the more politically right-leaning, the less likely these posts are to get any\ncomments ( \ud835\udefd=0.64). As before, given the right-leaning nature of most of the subreddits (+0.97 \ud835\udf0e) in\nwhich unreliable domain posts are submitted, this could likely be due to these users\u2019 posts being\nseen as \u201cnormal\u201d. In contrast, for both misinformation and reliable website submissions, we find\nthat as the subreddit\u2019s right-leaning partisanship goes up, the more comments given submissions\nare likely to garner.\n|Subreddit Partisanship - Submitter Partisanship|. For unreliable websites, we find that as the\ndifference between the submitter\u2019s partisanship and the subreddit\u2019s partisanship increases, the\nmore likely the post is to get at least one comment ( \ud835\udefd=\u22120.19). Various works have found that\nusers not aligned to political norms of a given environment [ 110], provoke engagement from\nusers as they become \u201coutraged\u201d by the presented content [ 49,82] and can largely be observed\nhere. We note that we do not observe a similar phenomenon for reliable website submissions\n(\ud835\udefd=0.43), which may result from the reliable website submission being unable to provoke initial\ncomments. However, for reliable website submissions, we find as the difference between the\nsubmitting user\u2019s partisanship and the subreddit\u2019s partisanship increases, the more comments that\nthat submission is likely to get. This indicates that when the reliable submission manages to gain\ninitiate comments, the farther the submitter\u2019s partisanship for the subreddit as a whole, the longer\nthe ensuing conversation. In contrast, for unreliable website submissions, our model finds that\nas the submitters\u2019s partisanship moves further away from the subreddit\u2019s own partisanship, after\ninitially accruing an initial comment, it is less likely to gain additional ones.\n4.4 Summary\nIn this section, we find that submitter toxicity, submitter politicalness, submitter age, subreddit\ntoxicity, and subreddit politicalness all encourage initial interaction with unreliable website sub-\nmissions. In contrast, submitter toxicity and subreddit toxicity play much more muted roles for\nreliable news submissions with the subreddit toxicity actually predicting less initial engagement\nwith reliable news sources. This appears to overall suggest a higher degree of initial engagement\nwith unreliable news outlets in political and toxic settings compared to reliable sources.\nWe further find that moderator involvement, subreddit politicalness, and subreddit partisanship\nall encourage users to have longer sustained interactions with unreliable information while sub-\nreddit toxicity predicts shorter conversations. In contrast for reliable news, we find that subreddit\ntoxicity, subreddit politicalness, and subreddit partisanship all predict increased user engagement\n(if users initially comment at all). This illustrates that while toxic environments may induce initial\nengagement with unreliable news, it does not predict sustained interactions, with the opposite\nbeing true of reliable news.\n5 UNRELIABLE WEBSITES AND POLARIZED TOXIC INTERACTIONS\nIn the previous section, we showed that unreliable website submissions are correlated with in-\ncreased toxicity and that increased toxicity is also correlated with comments on unreliable website\nsubmissions. To understand the user-level dynamics of toxicity in response to unreliable news\nsubmissions, we reconstruct the conversational dyads that exist underneath each Reddit submission.\n18 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\n1.56%1.33%\n1.28%1.49%Right\nLeftLeft\nRight\nTargetAuthor\n(a) Unreliable Website Submission Dyads1.10%0.98%\n1.05%1.12%Right\nLeftLeft\nRight\nTargetAuthor\n(b) Reliable Website Submission Dyads\n1.05%0.87%\n1.10%1.03%Right\nLeftLeft\nRight\nTargetAuthor\n(c) All Submission Dyads\nFig. 4. Percentage of interactions that are toxic in all, unreliable, reliable website submissions for Right and\nleft-leaning authors against Right and left-leaning targets.\nUsing the approach outlined in Section 3.1, we then determine the partisanship, politicalness, and\naverage toxicity of the users in these conversational dyads, mapping out different types of political\ninteractions. From these averages, we label users as right-leaning (greater than 0.5 \ud835\udf0epartisanship) or\nleft-leaning (less than -0.5 \ud835\udf0epartisanship). Then, looking at each conversational dyad, we determine\nif each comment is toxic using the Perspective API (as outlined in Section 3.1). As an example of\nsuch as dyad, in the r/Coronavirus subreddit, a user with a left-leaning bias posted:\nWhy oh why are people spitting on strangers? And can we get some spit for the evil 80 who own\nhalf the planet? No? Ok.\nto which another user with a right-leaning bias replied:\nCome the fuck on. I don\u2019t care what your opinions are or if it was just a really shitty joke. Don\u2019t\nwish for people to catch this, that\u2019s an asshole move right there.\nFor a comparison of how conversations differ between unreliable website and reliable website\ncomments, we finally separate the set of conversational dyads that appear under unreliable versus\nreliable website submissions.\n5.1 Interactions within Unreliable and Reliable Information Ecoysystems\nWe observe (as expected) that many users primarily interact with users of the same partisan-\nship [ 128]: 71.80% of interactions were between users that share the same partisanship-lean. For\nunreliable news submissions, this rises to 83%, and for reliable website submissions, it drops to\n66%. We similarly find that 72.08% of toxic interactions (where a user responded to another user\nwith a toxic reply) were between users who shared the same partisanship leaning among all dyads,\n80.63% for unreliable website submissions, and 63.34% for reliable website submissions. This is likely\nbecause, as previously found, unreliable domains are largely posted in somewhat more insular\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 19\nsubreddits (average partisanship = 0.97 \ud835\udf0e; Table 2) and in communities with higher degrees of\ntoxicity (2.01%; Table 2).\nDespite users largely interacting with users of the same partisanship, we find some increased rates\nof affective polarization between users of different partisanships. As seen in Figure 4, we observe\nincreased toxicity between users of different partisanships for our set of website submissions, with\nthis difference most marked for unreliable website submissions. Indeed calculating the odds ratios\nbetween the percentages of inter-partisanship toxicity against those of intra-partisanship toxicity,\nwe get values of 0.99 across all dyads, 1.19 for unreliable domain dyads, and 1.08 for reliable domain\ndyads. We thus observe a slight increase in inter-partisanship toxicity between users who comment\nunder submissions with attached domain hyperlinks. Further, calculating the odds ratio between\nthe rates of toxicity between unreliable websites and reliable website conversational dyads, we get\nvalues of 1.38 for inter-partisanship toxicity and 1.26 for intra-partisanship toxicity. We thus observe\nthat amongst our set of conversations, there is an even heightened rate of affective polarization for\nunreliable news interactions compared to reliable news interactions.\n5.2 Modeling Toxic Interactions Between Users\nTo concretely show that users of different political stripes are more likely to reply in a toxic manner\nto each other in conversations under unreliable domain submissions, we fit our network data of\ntoxic interactions into an exponential random graph model. An Exponential Random Graph Model\n(ERGM) is a form of modeling that predicts connections ( e.g., toxic interactions) between nodes\n(users) in a given network [ 72]. ERGM models assume that connections are determined by a random\nvariable \ud835\udc5d\u2217that is dependent on input variables. As in Chen et al. [25] and Peng et al. [102], we\nutilize this modeling as it does not assume that its data input is independent; given that, we want\nto model the interactions of polarization, toxicity, this relaxed restriction is key (we have already\nseen that they are largely not independent) [72, 137].\nSetup. Utilizing our ERGM, we predict the probability of toxic interactions between two users\nwithin misinformation submissions as a function of:\n(1) the users\u2019 percentage of toxic comments\n(2) the users\u2019 partisanship\n(3) hthe difference in the author and target\u2019s political polarization\n(4) the users\u2019 politicalness\n(5) the age of the two users\n(6)the reciprocity between the two users ( i.e., if both users had a toxic comment aimed at each\nother)\n(7)the number of comments that the two users have in subreddits in which they both post\ncomments\nWe include the number of comments that the users have made in shared subreddits to account for\nthe fact that users with more overlap in user activity ( i.e., frequent the same subreddits) are more\nlikely to interact with one another. When fitting our models we again utilize backward selection\nand minimize the AIC to determine the variables used in our final models.\nResults. We find that account age, partisanship, and the politicanlness of a given user do not have\nsignificant effects on the likelihood of toxic interactions (removed from fit after minimizing the\nAIC). This indicates that just because a user is highly partisan or political it does not necessarily\nmean that they are likely to engage in toxicity. For all domain interactions, as seen in Table 6, we\nfind that (1) that the more toxic a user, the more likely they are to engage in toxic interactions,\nand (2) that users are more likely to respond in a toxic manner to users who engage with them\nin a toxic manner (reciprocity). Indeed we find that in unreliable website submissions, users are\n20 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nUnreliable Domain Interactions Coeff.

Toxic Unreliable and Reliable Website Submission Interactions. As confirmed in our ERGM, differences\nin the political orientation of users are predictive of increased incivility and toxicity, with users of differing\npolitical orientations more likely to engage in toxic interactions within misinformation submissions than on\nmainstream submissions. Similarly, the higher each user\u2019s toxicity norm, the more they are likely to target\nother users with toxic comments.\nmore likely to reply in a toxic manner to another user if that user has already corresponded with\nthem in a toxic manner ( \ud835\udefd=4.79vs.\ud835\udefd=3.97). However, most importantly, we find that while\nmost toxic interactions occur among users that are politically similar to each other, compared to\nreliable domain interactions, users discussing unreliable website submissions are more likely to send\ntoxic comments to users of different political ideologies than users under mainstream submissions\n(\ud835\udefd=\u22120.20vs.\ud835\udefd=\u22120.29).\nSummary. In this section, we showed that unreliable website submissions not only promote higher\nlevels of toxicity in their comments but are also correlated with increased inter-partisanship toxicity\ncompared to reliable website submissions. Fitting an ERGM to our toxic conversational dyads posted\nin response to misinformation stories, we show that political differences, along with reciprocity\nand each user\u2019s toxicity, drive more toxic interactions.\n6 LIMITATIONS\nIn this work, we used a quantitative, large-scale approach to understand the role of misinformation\nin toxic interactions online. We outline the limitations of our approach in this section.\nUnreliable Information. One of the limitations of our approach is our use of hyperlinks to\ndetermine the presence of unreliable/factually inaccurate information. As we examined much of\nReddit\u2019s 2.2 billion comments, we were unable to take a comment-by-comment-based approach to\nunderstand the levels of unreliable news. As a result, our approach inevitably missed some subtleties\nof unreliable information across subreddits. However, as found in several past works [ 61,67,121,\n139], examining unreliable information from a domain-based perspective enables researchers to\ntrack readily identifiable and questionable information across different platforms and is a reliable\nway of understanding the presence of unreliable information in large communities or websites\n(e.g., subreddits). Our approach thus relies on the presence of largely US-based domains on given\nsubreddits and largely only measures English unreliable information and partisanship. As a result,\nwe cannot simply apply our results to non-English subreddits and non-US-oriented environments.\nHowever, we note, that while our work centers on US-based political environments, as found\nin prior works, highly political environments across different cultures often utilize unreliable\ninformation and often share many of the same characteristics as US ones [ 61,74]. We leave the full\ninvestigation of this phenomenon on Reddit to future work.\nMeasuring Toxicity. Another limitation of our approach, given our use of the Perspective API to\nestimate toxicity, is that it is limited to relatively active users and subreddits. We are only able to\ndevelop, in line with past works, toxicity norms and political estimations for subreddits that have\nat least 100 comments. As such, our results are skewed to more active subreddits and users. At the\nsame time, these subreddits and users make up a large percentage of users\u2019 experiences on Reddit.\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 21\nConfounds, Correlation, and Causation. We lastly acknowledge that while we account for many\nuser-level and subreddit-level features, there may be other hidden confounders. For example, while\nwe attempted to remove automated accounts from much of our analysis by removing accounts\nthat were labeled as \u201cbot\u201d accounts, due to the rapid rise of AI, within Reddit as a whole there\ncould still be automated accounts. We note that we conducted this analysis for data in 2020 and\n2022, before the release of ChatGPT however. We further emphasize that while we work to account\nfor confounders, the results we present describe the correlation between misinformation, political\npolarization, and toxicity; we cannot ascribe causation. However, our results do align with a large\nliterature of similar results [12\u201314] some of which have found causal results.\n7 DISCUSSION\nIn this work, we examined the relationship between unreliable information, political partisanship,\nuser engagement, and toxicity across and within both political and non-political subreddits. Using\npreviously published lists of unreliable and reliable websites, we find that on Reddit, we find that\ncomments posted in response to submissions with hyperlinks to unreliable news websites have\n25% more toxic comments overall (an average of 32% more within individual subreddits). Utilizing\na zero-inflated negative binomial model to model engagement with unreliable versus reliable\ninformation sources, we observe that subreddit toxicity is a major predictor of whether unreliable\ndomain submissions receive comments. This contrasts with reliable domain submissions, where\ntoxicity plays a more muted role, and the more toxic the subreddit, the more likely that reliable\nsubmissions are to not get any comments. Finally, examining how partisanship affects the increase\nin toxicity in response to unreliable information, we find, confirming with an Exponential Random\nGraph Model (ERGM), that articles from unreliable news outlets correlate with increased toxicity\namong users of different political leanings ( i.e., affective polarization).\n7.1 Unreliable Information\u2019s Correlation with Toxicity\nOur work shows that while unreliable websites have much less of a presence on Reddit compared\nto reliable websites (633.6K posts/601 submissions per domain vs 7.55M posts/2010.4 submissions\nper domain), unreliable news websites play a large role on the platform. As documented by others,\noften millions of comments discuss and spread false information [ 122]. In addition to misleading\nusers, unreliable information\u2019s effect on the discourse on these subreddits can often be pernicious\nwith articles from websites known to promote unreliable news increasing inter-political strife.\nIndeed as was seen in Table 2 and was found in our unreliable domain submission dyads, unreliable\ndomain submissions are associated with increased toxicity, particularly among users of different\npartisanship alignments. This largely accords with the work of Dicicco et al. [ 35] that showed that\nusers who comment on YouTube videos promoting COVID-19 conspiracy theories often utilize\ntoxic and vulgar language. Our paper results bolster this work, showing that increased unreliable\ndomains correlate with increased incivility on Reddit. This largely goes to promote and affirm the\nview that unreliable news/misinformation does have a relationship [ 35,97] with user toxicity and\nis not uncorrelated with toxicity [29, 105].\nIn our conversational dyads, we further find that across much of Reddit, unreliable websites\nare correlated with more insular and politically one-sided conversations, while reliable domains\nare correlated with increased discussions between users of different political ideologies (with\nboth increasing inter-political toxicity). Community norms for particular environments appear to\naffect how users engage with different materials. As found with our zero-inflated negative binomial\nmodel, subreddit toxicity norms are also predictive of user engagement with unreliable news articles.\nUnreliable and factually inaccurate, is found within toxic environments. The more toxic/uncivil\na given environment, the more likely at least one person is to engage with misinformation or\n22 Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric\nunreliable sources. However, simultaneously, in more toxic environments, where these posts most\ncommonly appear, these same posts are less likely to gain extensive engagement and a large number\nof comments. This appears to reflect that unreliable news websites often utilize \u201cclickbait\u201d titles that\ninduce readers to initially comment, but then cause the reader to not often thoroughly engage with\nmaterial [ 24,104]. In contrast, in less toxic environments where these posts more rarely appear, if\nthey do gain traction ( e.g., at least one comment), they are more likely to gain more comments.\n7.2 Implications of the Reddit Platform\nOur work indicates that unreliable domains correlate with increased overall toxicity of conversa-\ntions on Reddit, particularly between users of different partisanships. We note that this increased\nrancor persists despite individual subreddits moderating unreliable domain submissions more\nheavily compared to reliable domain submissions. Given the lower prevalence of unreliable sources\nthroughout Reddit compared to reliable sources and the decreased toxicity of conversations with\nmoderator involvement, a potential solution to decrease toxicity may be for Reddit admins (who\nare not already doing so), to engage more thoroughly or to flag submissions that contain hyperlinks\nto known unreliable and specious websites. However, as argued by Bozrath et al. [ 18], different\napproaches for moderating this content in different subreddits however will be necessary. Some\nlarger subreddits already take a machine-learning approach to remove misinformation [ 76] while\nothers take a manual approach that relies on crowd wisdom or individual moderator involve-\nment [ 73,78,119]. However, given that Reddit removed links to Russian state-based propaganda\nin the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian War [ 127] and has previously taken steps to remove highly\ntoxic material and subreddits [ 126], we recommend that Reddit itself also take more proactive steps\nto alert users to unreliable information and to identify new websites and known websites that\npromote unreliable information and flag, label, or remove them from their platform. Further as\nagain found by Bozrath et al. [ 18] moderating one type of misinformation or unreliable source\ncan be similar to moderating other types, allowing Reddit to take a generalized approach to alert\nsubreddits to the presence of unreliable news and propaganda.\nPolitical Echo-Chambers, Politics Discussions, and Reliable News on Reddit. Similar to\npast work, we find that most toxic interactions take place among users of the same political\norientation [ 40]. Reddit specifically creates communities for like-minded people and as a result,\nmost interactions (both toxic and non-toxic interactions) on the platform are between people\nof the same political orientation. However, most interestingly, in the comments of submissions\nwith hyperlinks to reliable news sources, the rate of inter-partisan interactions slightly increases\ncompared to interaction across Reddit. This is in contrast to unreliable domain submissions where\nthe rates of interaction between users and different partisanship decreases. We argue, that if Reddit,\nas a whole, desires to lower levels of political incivility and toxicity on its platform, taking a more\nproactive approach to policing questionable sources could help alleviate these issues. As found by\nGallacher et al. [ 49], toxic online interactions between political groups often lead to offline real-\nworld political violence. Given that unreliable news appears to be correlated with and reinforces\ntoxic interactions between different political groups, this highlights the need to research its effects\nand curtail its spread.\nSub-Standards/Community Norms. We have found throughout this work that subreddits interact\nwith reliable and unreliable sources differently. For example, while more toxic subreddits are more\nlikely to interact with unreliable information sources, the more toxic a subreddit, the more likely\nthe reliable submissions are to not get any comments. We thus find often complex relationships\nbetween different types of subreddits and their interactions with different types of posts. There is\nno one-size-fits-all approach to understanding user engagement and toxicity on Reddit [ 120,152].\nSub-Standards and Mal-Practices 23\nWe thus argue that a subreddit/community-based approach that takes into account the community\nnorms of the community must be taken when trying to understand the information flows within\nit [42]. Similarly, in attempting to prevent engagement with unreliable news on particular subreddits,\nunderstanding their toxicity norms, their political ideology, and who is posting the article within the\nsubreddit is key [ 152]. For example, as found by Zhan et al [ 152], different communities responded\nand engaged with COVID-19 misinformation in widely divergent manners. We thus argue that\napproaches that attempt to understand how users engage with unreliable information (particularly\non Reddit), must take into account the particular nuances of that community.\n8 CONCLUSION\nUnreliable information persists across many different types of subreddits. Its spread furthermore\nseems to be affected by the type of community it is posted in. Unreliable and factually incorrect\nappears to be more likely to gain traction when it is posted in more toxic/uncivil environments.\nFurthermore, the communities with large amounts of unreliable news appear to be more politically\ninsular with more of their interactions occurring between users of similar political orientations. As\nusers become more politically dissimilar when commenting under unreliable information, as found\nwith our ERGM, they are more likely to be toxic/uncivil to one another compared to users who\ncomment under reliable information. Our work, one of the first to examine the relationship between\nunreliable news, toxicity, and political ideology at scale, illustrates the need to fully understand the\nfull effect of unreliable information. Not only does unreliable news mislead people but it also can\nmagnify political differences and lead to more toxic online environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]2021. Twitter.

In this paper, we connect elements of\nnarrativity with fundamental aspects of fram-\ning, and present a framework which formalizes\nand operationalizes such aspects. We annotate\nand release a data set of news articles in the\nclimate change domain, analyze the dominance\nof narrative frame components across politi-\ncal leanings, and test LLMs in their ability to\npredict narrative frames and their components.\nFinally, we apply our framework in an unsu-\npervised way to elicit components of narrative\nframing in a second domain, the COVID-19 cri-\nsis, where our predictions are congruent with\nprior theoretical work showing the generaliz-\nability of our approach.1\n1 Introduction\nNarrative framing is a type of media framing that\nuses elements of narrativity to highlight some as-\npects of a complex issue and condense it into a sim-\nplified \u201cstory\u201d that promotes a particular interpreta-\ntion (Crow and Lawlor, 2016). These elements of\nstorytelling, such as representing an issue through\nthe lens of stakeholders and conflicts rather than di-\nrect description of the facts, make narrative frames\na highly effective device, particularly in the context\nof contested issues such as climate change (Daniels\nand Endfield, 2009; Rodrigo-Alsina, 2019).\nNarrative framing can draw the reader\u2019s atten-\ntion to specific, nuanced aspects of an issue and\ninstill a very precise interpretation that differs from\nthe \u201cdefault\u201d reading inferrable from its generic or\nissue-specific frame. To give an example, the text in\nFigure 1 frames the topic of climate change through\na \u201cPolar Bear\u201d issue-specific frame (Bushell et al.,\n1We release our code, data and annotations at https://\ngithub.com/julia-nixie/narratives .\nGlobal  warming  fail:Study  finds  melting  sea ice is actually  helping  \nArctic  animals\nProponents  of the theory humans  are primarily  responsible  for rising  \nglobal  temperatures  long claimed wildlife  are harmed  significantly  by\nglobal warming , and that unless mankind  stops  producing  significant  \namounts  of carbon -dioxide  emissions,  the world's animals  will not be \nable to thrive . While rising temperatures  have  certainly  put a strain  on\nspecies  in some  parts  of the world,  a new study byresearchers atthe\nUniversity ofSouthern Denmark  suggests  animals  in the Arctic  \nregion  are thriving  because  ofhigher global temperatures .[...]\nUSA Today  recently  declared  theloss ofseaice \"terrifying,\"  but \nglobal  warming sceptics  have  long suggested  these  claims  are \noverblown  when  put into perspective . \nHero\n(denialist \nscientists)\nVillain\n(climate \nadvocates)Focus\n(on Hero)\nCultural\nstory \n(individ.)Fuels conflict (promotes \nharmful pseudoscience)Figure 1: An except from a news article, with hero\nmarked in green and villain in red. Entities that are\nnot main characters are grayed out. The box shows the\nfocal character (here, hero ). The phrases in italic are\ncues which show that the article has an individualistic\ncultural story (\u201cthe nature can fix itself\u201d) and that it fuels\nconflict by actively promoting bad science.\n2017) which describes the negative effects of cli-\nmate change on animals ( rising temperatures have\ncertainly put a strain on species ). However, this\nis not the actual message of the text: it depicts\nclimate scientists as incorrect, while presenting\npseudo-scientists from a hero-like angle. It uses\ndevices of narrative framing to replace the default\ninterpretation arising from a topic-like frame (\u201can-\nimals are victims of climate change and humans\nare villains\u201d) with an opposing idea that animals\nare doing fine and scientists who claim otherwise\nmislead the general public.\nWhile the importance of framing narratives\nfor the communication and perception of news\nhas been widely recognized in the social sci-\nences (Shanahan et al., 2011), automatic fram-\ning analysis still mostly conceptualizes frames in\na topic-like fashion (Ali and Hassan, 2022; Ot-\nmakhova et al., 2024). Recent work in NLP has\nstudied elements of narratives such as characters or\nevents in news reporting (Stammbach et al., 2022;\nFrermann et al., 2023; Gehring and Grigoletto,\n2023; Zhao et al., 2024; Das et al., 2024). However,arXiv:2506.00737v1  [cs.CL]  31 May 2025\nthese studies are either topic-specific, or lose the\nlink to the core mechanism of framing: For fram-\ning to occur, an ambivalent issue must be present\n(Sniderman and Theriault, 2004) and described in\na way that evokes a larger interpretative context\n(schema) which goes beyond information directly\ninferrable from the text (Scheufele and Scheufele,\n2010). As such, beyond the issue itself (aka Ent-\nman (1993)\u2019s \u201cproblem statement\u201d), there are other\nimportant mechanisms that turn a message into a\nframe, such as alluding to the conflict that led to\nthe problem (=its cause), making a moral evalua-\ntion, or suggesting a resolution to it. We present\na general formalization of narrative framing that\ncomprises all these aspects.\nWe do so by integrating elements of narratology\nwith social and media studies on narrative framing,\nto establish a framework which allows to identify\nand structurally represent narrative frames and to\ndistinguish superficially similar frames from one\nanother. First, our framework distinguishes char-\nacter roles, and we show how issue ambivalence\narises when actors in an article are assigned an\narchetypical role (Hero, Villain, Victim) and one\nof the roles is drawn into focus. This emphasis in\nturn evokes a moral evaluation of the personas in\nthe article. As a second component, we position\neach character in terms of exacerbating or resolving\nthe core conflict of the article. Finally, to link the\npresentation in the article to the wider set of associ-\nations and beliefs already existing in the receiver\u2019s\nperception (Nelson et al., 1997), we link our nar-\nrative frames to established \u201ccultural stories\u201d that\ndefine the attitude towards external control and the\nsense of unity with the group (Thompson, 2018).\nFigure 1 illustrates the three components with an\nexample.\nWe apply our framework to analyze media fram-\ning of two distinct public issues \u2013 climate change\nand COVID-19. In particular, we make the follow-\ning contributions:\n1.We define elements of narrativity that are es-\nsential for narrative framing and are aligned\nwith the definition of a media frame and show\nthat our framework applies across topics (cli-\nmate change and COVID-19) and domains\n(news articles and political speeches).\n2.We show that framework enables reliable and\neffective annotation of narrative frames in the\nnews, and improves the automatic detection\nof narratives.3.We release a corpus of articles about climate\nchange annotated with narrative frames, and\nuse it to analyze the distribution of different\nnarrative frames across political leanings.\n4.We test a range of LLMs on their ability to\nautomatically predict the components of our\nframework, leaving room for improvements.\n2 Background\nNarratives in political communication Follow-\ning Fisher (1984)\u2019s seminal paper coining the term\n\u201chomo narrans\u201d to illustrate the importance of story-\ntelling for society, narratives in political communi-\ncation have attracted substantial research attention\n(see also Bennett and Edelman (1985); Patterson\nand Monroe (1998)), exposing its effects from a\ncritical vehicle in deliberative democracy (Boswell,\n2013) to its use persuasive device (Skrynnikova\net al., 2017). Similar to the concept of framing in\ngeneral, a principled and empirically testable defi-\nnition of \u201cnarrative framing\u201d has long been lacking.\nHowever, recent work has progressed in develop-\ning frameworks that are testable and amenable to\ncomputational modeling (Shenhav, 2005; Robert\nand Shenhav, 2014), most prominently the Narra-\ntive Policy Framework (NPF; Jones et al. (2023)),\nwhich we build on in this work. The NPF defines\na set of generalizable structural elements in politi-\ncal/policy narratives, including characters, settings,\nplot and moral evaluation which it uses to charac-\nterise the operation of narratives on the individual,\ngroup and cultural level. The NPF has been par-\nticularly instrumental in studying climate change\nnarratives (Fl\u00f8ttum and Gjerstad, 2017), and identi-\nfying dominant narratives in the discourse (Bushell\net al., 2017; Bevan, 2020). This paper adapts the\nelements of the NPF into a structured framework\ndesigned to support automated prediction.\nNarrative framing and NLP Narrative framing\nintersects the concepts of storytelling and fram-\ning, i.e., the presentation of information in a way\nto evoke a specific association in the audience.\nAutomatic narrative understanding has attracted\nsubstantial attention in NLP (Piper et al., 2021);\nhowever, it has focused mostly on fictional narra-\ntives (Bamman et al., 2014; Iyyer et al., 2016), per-\nsonal narratives in social media (Lukin et al., 2016;\nShen et al., 2023), or specific elements such as\nevent chains (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009). Few\nworks have considered the intersection of stories\nand framing (Levi et al., 2022), or used elements\nof narrativity such as events to improve on topic-\nfocussed framing analysis (Das et al., 2024; Zhao\net al., 2024).\nWhile narrative framing research in the social\nsciences is strongly grounded in the NPF, this\nframework is yet to gain recognition in NLP ap-\nproaches. Closest to our work are Stammbach et al.\n(2022) and Frermann et al. (2023) who study some\nnarrative elements of framing devices (such as enti-\nties framed as heroes or victims), but do not model\nfull narrative frames. In addition to entities Gehring\nand Grigoletto (2023) model relationships between\nthem such as \u201charm\u201d or \u201cprotect\u201d; however, their\napproach does not map the identified elements back\nto more high-level (narrative) frames.\n3 Components of narrative framing\nWe motivate our three core components which de-\nfine a narrative frame. Each component contributes\nto the framing mechanism, by resolving the ambiva-\nlence through assigning moral evaluation to stake-\nholders (Characters), capturing the conflict and res-\nolution aspect of a frame (Conflict and resolution),\nand evoking a wider set of cognitive schemata and\ncultural associations (Cultural stories).\n3.1 Characters\nCharacters and their prototypical roles have been\nstudied extensively in narratology (starting from\nformalist and structuralist approaches such as\nPropp (1968) and Greimas (1987)), and were\nadopted as a simplified hero ,villain , and\nvictim (HVV) triad by social sciences as part\nof Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) (Shanahan\net al., 2018)2. In particular, the NPF prescribes that\na narrative frame should include at least one pro-\ntotypical character , i.e. one or more HVV roles\nshould be filled by a prominent entity. By assigning\nan entity to a particular role, we resolve the issue\nambivalence by conveying our moral judgment of\nthat entity, as required by Entman\u2019s definition of\na frame (Entman, 1993). Essentially, the reader\u2019s\ninterpretation of the article depends on whether\na particular entity (say, climate advocates as in\nFigure 1) is framed as a hero (their actions are\nevaluated as beneficial), a villain (as in Figure 1),\norvictim (of criticism or attacks by denialists).\n2In NLP, character (or agent) identification has attracted\nsubstantial attention, both from the narratology side (see (Piper\net al., 2021)) and, less extensively, from the NPF angle (Fr-\nermann et al., 2023).Often there are multiple candidate entities for\neach HVV role in a text. We follow narratology\napproaches in distinguishing between main charac-\nters and other entities (Jahan and Finlayson, 2019),\nand use the single most central character fulfilling\nthe respective role to represent a narrative frame.\nFigure 1 illustrates this, where the main characters\nare highlighted in color, while less central entities\nare grayed out. Moreover, to be able to compare in-\nstances of a particular narrative frame across texts\nwith different people and events, we abstract away\nfrom specific characters to the stakeholder cate-\ngories (common people, elites, etc.) they represent.\nThe taxonomy of such stakeholders can either be\ninherited from the literature (as we do in Section 4)\nor derived from a corpus in a data-driven way (as\ndemonstrated in Section 5).\nTo fully differentiate narratives, in addition to\nassigning characters to roles, it is necessary to iden-\ntify the focus on either hero ,villain , orvictim ,\nwhich results in \u201cheroic\u201d, \u201cblaming\u201d, and \u201cvictim-\nizing\u201d narrative frames, respectively. For exam-\nple, two distinct narrative frames can both frame\nclimate activists as a hero andgovernment as a\nvillain , but focus either on criticizing the govern-\nment (\u201cblaming\u201d) or praising the efforts of activists\nin opposing it (\u201cheroic\u201d) \u2013 resulting in very differ-\nent messaging.3\n3.2 Conflict and resolution\nConflict/resolution4is a central element of a nar-\nrative frame. It encapsulates the \u201cplot\u201d element of\nthe NPF, and links into Entman\u2019s (Entman, 1993)\ncriteria of framing which state that, among its other\nfunctions, a frame can point to the cause of the\nissue and its underlying conflict, or prescribe a\nresolution. Accordingly, we conceptualize conflict\nand resolution as a four-way distinction: the charac-\nters assigned hero andvictim roles in a narrative\nframe can either fuel conflict (perform actions that\ncause or exacerbate the issue), fuel resolution (per-\nform actions that help to resolve the issue), prevent\nconflict (oppose actions that cause or exacerbate\nthe issue), or prevent resolution (oppose actions\nthat help to resolve the issue).\nIn NLP, relations between characters have a long\n3Examples from Bevan (2020), see narrative frames \u201cThe\ncollapse is imminent\u201d vs \u201cYou\u2019re destroying our future\u201d in\nAppendix E.\n4Here we define it conflict as an underlying cause of an is-\nsue which characters strive to either escalate or resolve, rather\nthan a driving force of a plot (Prince, 2003) or breaking point\nin its canonicity (Bruner, 1991), as understood in narratology.\nhistory of research (Agarwal and Rambow, 2010;\nShahsavari et al., 2020), including studies which\nspecifically looks at conflicts (Han et al., 2019; Ols-\nson et al., 2020). In comparison, our framework\nabstracts away from specific (and often sparse) en-\ntity relations and combines the attitude towards\nthe issue (pro-conflict vs pro-resolution) with the\nlevel of intentionality and direct expression of that\nattitude (i.e. actively perform actions that support\none\u2019s side, or oppose the actions of the other side).\nThis definition of conflict/resolution based on ab-\nstract categories rather than on specific actions or\nevents renders our approach generalizable across\ntopics, as we show in Sections 4 and 5.\n3.3 Cultural stories\nFrames are distinguished from \u201cunframed\u201d types of\ncommunication by their ability to evoke a wider set\nof concepts, associations and judgments which al-\nready exist in the audience\u2019s perception (Scheufele\nand Scheufele, 2010). Narrative frames do this by\nmapping a particular combination of characters and\nconflict/resolution to one of four larger schemata of\ninterpretation, which in social studies are referred\nto as cultural value stories (Thompson, 2018).5\nCultural stories define to what degree our actions\nare controlled by external factors and by the sense\nof belonging to a group (Douglas, 2007). Depend-\ning on the combination of these two factors, a nar-\nrative frame can be fatalist (where people are at the\nmercy of forces outside their control, such as nat-\nural disasters or fate), hierarchical (where people\nare bound by social prescriptions and external con-\ntrol, such as government), individualistic (where\nsocial ties are loose and people reject the necessity\nof external control), or egalitarian (where people\ntake collective action, opposing external control)\n(Figure 2). Cultural stories have been shown to\ndirectly affect public behavior: as an example, indi-\nvidualist and egalitarian stories have been linked to\nworse survival rates than a hierarchical story during\nthe COVID-19 onset (G\u00fcss and Tuason, 2021).\nTo the best of our knowledge, cultural stories, or\nmore generally cognitive and cultural schemata aid-\ning interpretation, have not been explored in NLP.\nHowever, many NLP studies (Finlayson, 2012;\nTangherlini et al., 2020) draw upon related concepts\n5Thus, all narrative frames are stories, i.e. contain elements\nof narrativity such as characters and plot (reduced to conflict\nand resolution). However, not all stories can be used as nar-\nrative frames: in order to so, they need to map to a broader,\npre-existing context dictated by a cultural story.\nFatalist Hierarchical\nIndividualistic Egalitarian\nLow group High group\nHigh external \ncontrol\nLow external \ncontrolFigure 2: Cultural stories across dimensions of external\ncontrol (grid) and belonging to a group\nof narrative archetypes as overarching, culturally\nrepetitive plots or narrative elements (Frye, 1957;\nPropp, 1968). In contrast, we focus on framing and\nits link to a well-defined space of cultural values\nwhich have been shown to affect perception and\nbehavior.\n4 Narrative Framing of Climate Change\nIn the remainder of this paper we apply our frame-\nwork to perform narrative framing analysis on two\ntopics: climate change and COVID-19. First, in\nthis section, we use it to manually annotate the\nthree components of narrative frames in news ar-\nticles, and then map them to established narrative\nframes in the climate change domain. We use this\ncorpus to evaluate the ability of multiple LLMs to\npredict narrative frame components and the frames\nthemselves. Then, in Section 5 we show how the\nframework can be generalized to a domain without\nan established repertoire of narrative frames (politi-\ncian\u2019s speeches on COVID-19), where the goal is\ntodiscover frames rather than classify them.\n4.1 Data selection and annotation\nArticle selection. We manually annotate 100 ar-\nticles randomly selected from an existing dataset\nof news stories on the topic of climate change (Fr-\nermann et al., 2023), originating from a range of\nUS media outlets from different political leanings\npublished between 2017 and 2019.6The articles\nare fairly evenly distributed across political lean-\nings to ensure that the dataset contains a variety of\nnarratives coming from different political groups.\nDetailed statistics are in Appendix A.\nAnnotation process . We use the example in Fig-\nure 1 to explain the steps of the annotation pro-\n6Due to space constraints, this paper covers only our US\ncentric analysis. However, we also release an annotated\ndataset of 100 Australian climate-focused articles from 2024,\nwhich surfaced new narratives with different combinations\nof elements to previously recorded ones. The dataset to-\ngether with its analysis is available at https://github.com/\njulia-nixie/narratives .\ncess. First, we identify candidate entities for the\nhero ,villain , and victim roles, and select at\nmost one main character per role (as described in\nAppendix B). In our example, since hero ,villain ,\nand victim should align with the article\u2019s per-\nspective, we remove potential victims like animals\nsince the author believes they actually benefit from\nhigher temperatures. Then, using an established\ntaxonomy of stakeholder categories for the climate\nchange domain (Frermann et al. (2023); details in\nAppendix C), we map the text spans that represent\ncharacters to labels indicating general classes of\nactors. Thus, we arrive at science experts (from the\nskeptics side) as hero andenvironmental activists\nasvillain . To determine the focus, we rely on\ndiscourse structure of newspaper articles, namely\nthe inverted pyramid where the most important\ncontent is presented first, and the relative propor-\ntion of text devoted to the different roles. Since\nthe title highlights the research of climate skeptics\nand much of the article\u2019s content is devoted to de-\nscribing it, we determine that the focus is on the\nhero . Next, since the article explicitly promotes\ndubious science harmful to the climate (rather than\nonly criticizing actions of climate activists), it fu-\nelsconflict . Finally, as the article implies that\nnature is resilient and no actions are necessary, it\ncorresponds to an individualistic cultural story. Ap-\npendix D provides more details on the annotation\nprocess, instructions, and quality assurance.\nWe apply this process to annotate the structure\nof the narrative frames in our corpus of 100 cli-\nmate change articles, and use the same framework\nto determine the components of known narrative\nframes from the climate change literature (Bushell\net al., 2017; Bevan, 2020; Lamb et al., 2020). Then,\nwe map the article structures to the structures of\nknown narrative frames to arrive at the final narra-\ntive frame label for the article. For example, the\nstructure of the article in Figure 1 points to a de-\nnialist narrative frame \u201cNo need to act\". Overall,\nthis element-wise mapping between the articles\nand the theoretical literature resulted in defining\n16 structurally distinct narrative frames, which are\ndescribed in detail in Appendix E.\nAnnotation quality. Based on the component-wise\nannotation process described above we achieve re-\nliable (in terms of Krippendorf \u03b1among all an-\nnotators) and very strong (in terms of agreement\nwith an expert) inter-annotator agreement on all ele-\nments of the framework. In particular, we achieve a\nKrippendorf \u03b1agreement of 0.76 for hero , 0.67 for\nFuel conflict\nFuel resolution\nPrevent conflict\nPrevent resolution\nLeft bias Left center\nbiasQuestionable\nsourceRight biasEgalitarian\nHierarchical\nIndividualisticFigure 3: Distribution of conflict and cultural\nstory values across political leanings\nvillain , and 0.81 for victim between four anno-\ntators, and Krippendorf \u03b1of 0.78 for focus , 0.82\nforconflict , and 0.80 for Cultural Story between\ntwo annotators.\nSince each narrative frame is derived from a\nunique combination of its elements, the reliable\nannotation of narrative frame components also en-\nsures a more reliable annotation of resulting nar-\nratives than choosing them based on their descrip-\ntion only. To demonstrate that, we compare the\nagreement between narrative labels derived from\ntheir components against agreement in a setting\nwhere annotators chose one out of 16 narratives di-\nrectly based on their descriptions (Appendix D.2).\nThe former leads to substantially higher agreement\n(63% vs 37%). Furthermore, the component-wise\nannotation was significantly faster than direct label-\ning due to the reduced cognitive load of annotators.\nFinal dataset. The final dataset contains 16 climate\nchange narrative frames, as well as their compo-\nnents, and covers the majority of narrative frames\nmentioned in social studies literature. It includes\nframes that are similar on the surface, but differ\nin structure and thus can be used as a challenging\ntest set for narrative frame detection in this domain.\nFull dataset statistics regarding the distribution of\nnarrative frames and their components are provided\nin Appendix G.\n4.2 Dataset Analysis\nWe analyze how the annotated narrative frames and\ntheir components vary across articles from different\npolitical leanings, and their alignment with more\ncommonly used generic frames.\nConflict Economy Human\ninterestMorality Resolution12 years to save the world\nWe are all going to die\nAll talk little action\nCarbon fueled expansion\nClimate solutions won't work\nCollapse is imminent\nDebate and scam\nEndangered species\nEvery little helps\nGore\nNo need to act\nNo sticks just carrots\nOfficials declare emergency\nOthers are worse than us\nT echnological optimism\nVictim blamingFigure 4: Narrative frames vs generic frames\nNarrative frames across political leanings. In-\ndividual narrative components strongly associate\nwith specific political leanings of news outlets: The\noverwhelming majority of right-bias articles are\nframed as preventing resolution (of the climate\ncrisis) and exemplify the individualistic cultural\nstory (Figure 3), while these values do not appear\nat all for left-bias and left-center outlets. More-\nover, right-bias outlets frame scientists as heroes\nmuch more often than other sources (Appendix Fig-\nure 14): they often quote \u2018\u2019fake experts\u201d in support\nof their anti-climate statements (as in Figure 1).\nThe overall narrative labels are more distributed\nacross political leanings (see Figure 13). Taken to-\ngether, this shows that dissecting narrative frames\ninto meaningful components affords more nuanced\ninsights in relation to external metadata.\nNarrative frames vs generic frames. The 100\narticles in our narrative framing corpus were previ-\nously annotated with five generic frames originally\ndefined by Semetko and Valkenburg (2000) (Con-\nflict, Economic, Human Interest, Morality and Res-\nolution). We intersect our labels with those generic\nframes to study the correlation of generic frames\nand narrative frames. Figure 4 shows little sys-\ntematic correlation between generic and narrative\nframes: an article with a particular generic frame\ncan have a variety of different narratives, and vice\nversa. For example, an \"Economy\"-framed article\ncan emphasize the importance of fossil fuels (\"Car-\nbon fueled expansion\" narrative), or focus on the\neconomical effects of climate change (\"12 years to\nsave the world\"). These observations align with the-\noretical works which showed that the same generic\nframe can have different intents (cf. Bushell et al.\n(2017); Shanahan (2007) for \"Economy\" frame),\nand highlights the added insights afforded by a\nnarrative-focused frame analysis on top of generic\nemphasis frames.4.3 Automatic Prediction of Narrative Frames\nand Components\nWe use our dataset to test narrative frame prediction\ncapabilities of LLMs. We define the following\npredictive tasks, given the full article text as input:\n\u2022Choosing the stakeholder category for hero ,\nvillain , and victim (separately for each charac-\nter type) as one of 10 classes ( government ,climate\nactivists , etc.; see Section 3.1). To choose a stake-\nholder correctly, a model needs to perform several\nsteps: determining if an entity is framed as a hero ,\nvillain , orvictim , aggregating mentions of enti-\nties across the text to determine which of potential\ncandidates is a main hero ,villain , orvictim ;\nand finally determining to which stakeholder cate-\ngory this character belongs.\n\u2022Predicting the focus entity out of 3 classes\n(hero ,villain , or victim ). This task tests if\na model can determine if the narrative frame is\n\u201cheroic\u201d, \u201cblaming\u201d, or victim-centered (see Sec-\ntion 3.1).\n\u2022Predicting conflict out of 4 classes ( fuel con-\nflict, fuel resolution, prevent conflict, prevent reso-\nlution , see Section 3.2). A model needs to identify\nthe general intent of the narrative frame (if it pushes\ntowards resolution of the crisis, or exacerbates it),\nand the article\u2019s strategy to do so (by supporting\none side or by criticizing the opposite side).\n\u2022Predicting a cultural story out of 3\nclasses ( individualistic, egalitarian, or hierarchi-\ncal, see Section 3.3)7. To do so, the model needs to\nidentify if the text implies collective vs individual-\nistic action, and approval or disapproval of external\ncontrol (such as from the government).\n\u2022Directly predicting one of 16 narrative\nframes given an article, based on their short de-\nscriptions sourced from the social studies literature\n(full list in Appendix E).\n4.3.1 Models and prompts\nWe use our tasks to test narrative frame prediction\nof 5 base LLMs of different size (GPT4o, Mixtral,\nLlama, Gemini and Claude Sonnet), and one rea-\nsoning LLM (o1).8We set temperature=0 (except\n7Though Section 3.3 introduces 4 cultural stories (Jones,\n2014), the fatalist story is not present in our data set so we\nexclude it from experiments for fair evaluation.\n8Versions used: gpt-4o-2024-11-20, o1-preview-2024-\n09-12, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,\nHero (10) Villain (10) Victim (10) Focus (3) Conflict (4) Story (4) Narrative (16)\nBaseline 0.079 0.08 0.135 0.231 0.135 0.19 0.021\nGPT4o 0.325 0.454 0.266 0.656 0.332 0.574 0.258\no1 0.363**0.527*0.455*0.718**0.549 0.595 0.330*\nMixtral 0.237 0.073 0.257 0.402 0.353 0.431 0.171\nLlama 0.271 0.156 0.336 0.568 0.379 0.449 0.181\nGemini 0.326 0.292 0.230 0.635 0.361 0.482 0.319\nSonnet 0.353 0.530 0.469 0.688 0.399 0.561 0.339\nTable 1: Zero-shot performance of 6 models across 7 narrative understanding tasks (macro-averaged F1).

With the exception of o1,\nwhich shows high variance on most tasks, models\nhave zero or near-zero variance across runs, which\nallows to compare averaged results.9\nThe prompts used for each of the tasks are listed\nin Appendix K.1. The text of the prompts is based\non descriptions of particular classes (stakeholders,\nculture stories, narrative frames etc.) in the social\nscience literature. Prompts for HVV characters\nare domain-specific, i.e. they are based on a list\nof entities important for the climate change do-\nmain (we show how to generalize this approach\nby creating such list automatically in Section 5).\nConversely, prompts for Focus, Conflict, and Cul-\ntural story tasks are domain-agnostic and describe\nthe classes in general terms (e.g., INDIVIDUALIS-\nTIC: this story assumes that the situation cannot\nbe controlled externally, and no group actions are\nnecessary ). We use the most abstract prompts pos-\nsible to ensure the approach is generalizable, but\nwe also found that abstract prompts lead to better\nperformance compared to prompts specifically de-\nscribing how a particular conflict or cultural story\nis manifested in the climate change debate.\n4.3.2 Results\nResults in Table 1 show that no single model con-\nsistently performed best (or worst) across all tasks.\nMixtral and Llama are the weakest, especially in\nstakeholder prediction for for hero andvillain\nwhere both models overpredict entities that are\ngemini-1.5-flash, Sonnet 3.5. Model sizes are provided in\nAppendix F.\n9When comparing with o1-preview-2024-09-12, we used\nthe worst results rather than average to account for large vari-\nance.stereotypical heroes and villains for this topic. For\ninstance, they select \u201cenvironmental activists\u201d as\nheroes and \u201cpollution\u201d as villain, despite the fact\nthat they rarely occur in these roles in our arti-\ncles. In a similar way, they overpredict rare narra-\ntive frames as \u201cCarbon fuelled expansion\u201d which\nclaims that fossil fuels are necessary for the econ-\nomy, presumably due to an over-reliance on surface\ncues (e.g., terms like \u201cfossil fuels\u201d).\nThe strongest models, Sonnet and o1, tie in terms\nof results, though o1 does better in tasks which\nrequire a notion of the overall \u201cgist\u201d of the text,\nsuch as predicting Cultural story and Conflict. Still,\no1 (as well as the other models) does not reliably\ndetect narrative frames based on their description\n(Narrative task) and tends to excessively predict\none class. Thus, despite the fact that human anno-\ntators had a high agreement on narrative compo-\nnents, none of the models reaches comparably high\nperformance. Models are also unable to reliably\ndifferentiate narrative frames based only on their\ndescription, consistent with human performance.\nIn section Section 4.3.3 we examine if the narra-\ntive structure helps the models to predict narrative\nframes better (as it does for human annotators).\nWe perform experiments to optimize the prompt\nand help models learn from examples (see Ap-\npendix I), but they do not lead to performance gains,\nwhich shows the difficulty of the tasks.\nEffect of the number of classes.

To test whether the per-\nformance would increase if the model is asked to\nchoose between a smaller number of classes, we\nselect a sample of three frequent, but similar narra-\ntives \u2013 \u201c12 Years to save the planet\u201d, \u201cWe are all\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7\nGemini GPT4o Sonnet\nBasic prompt Structured prompt + oracle Structured prompt + predictedFigure 5: Predicting narrative frames using oracle\n(human-annotated) and noisy (predicted) labels for their\nhero ,villain ,victim , and focus ; the results are\nmacro-averaged F1.\ngoing to die\u201d, and \u201cGore\u201d (see Appendix E), and\nmodify the Narrative prompt to include descrip-\ntions only of these three classes. However, this\nincreases performance only minimally (from F1\nof 0.258 to 0.270 for GPT-4o) and nowhere near\nthe level for tasks with a comparable number of\nclasses such as Focus and Conflict. Moreover, even\nfor this simplified task there is a tendency to predict\none class, and one of the classes is never chosen\ncorrectly (Figure 20 in Appendix).\n4.3.3 Predicting narrative frames with\ncomponent labels\nIn this section, we explore if using our narrative\ncomponents (such as specifying hero ,villain ,\nvictim , and focus ) can improve narrative frame\nclassification. For these experiments we use three\nmodels (the strongest Sonnet and middle-grade\nGPT-4o and Gemini10) in zero-shot mode. For each\nof the narrative frame definitions we add an infor-\nmal description of typical stakeholders for hero ,\nvillain ,victim (as listed in Appendix E for each\nof the narrative frames) and the focus role (see\nexamples of modified prompts in Appendix K.2).\nNext, for each input article we add labels that\ndenote hero ,villain , and victim stakeholder cat-\negories, as well as focus , to explicitly represent the\nstructure of the narrative frame. As shown in Fig-\nure 5 (orange), with oracle (manually-annotated) la-\nbels the performance improves substantially across\nmodels (most notably in GPT4o). We repeat this ex-\nperiment with noisy labels predicted by the model,\nand again observe gains compared to the prompt\n10We exclude o1 due to its high costs and high variability\nof results between runs.without structure (green in Figure 5). The models\u2019\nbehavior, however, is quite different: For Gemini\nwe observe minimal improvement, while Sonnet\nbenefits least from the structure labels overall, but\ndoes accommodate for the noisiness. GPT4o, de-\nspite being the weakest on this task, benefits most\nfrom structure and noisy labels, achieving substan-\ntially higher performance than the best-performing\nmodel (Sonnet) in this condition. Taken together,\nthis shows that explicit structure \u2013 if of reasonably\nhigh quality11\u2013 is a more reliable cue for predicting\nthe narrative than its description.\nTo examine how introduction of structure affects\nthe narrative frame prediction, and analyze which\nnarrative frames are hard for models to predict even\nwhen they are given correct labels for their charac-\nters, we compare confusion matrices for Narrative\nclassification with a basic prompt (Figure 21 in\nthe appendix), and with a structured prompt and\noracle character labels (Figure 22). We observe\nthat before the introduction of structure the pre-\ndictions are scattered across the matrix; i.e. both\nthe predictions and errors are not systematic. With\nthe structure, however, we see clear patterns of\nconsolidation: first, narrative frames that have a\nunique structure (such as \u201cOfficials declare emer-\ngency\u201d which uniquely frames government as a\nhero ) are now predicted (near) perfectly. Second,\nerrors are now due to confusion of a handful of\nstructurally similar narrative frames, most preva-\nlently two frames that both focus on criticizing the\ngovernment ( villain ), but have different cultural\nstories: \u201c12 years to save the Earth\u201d calls for even\nmore governmental control ( hierarchical ), while\n\u201cAll talk no action\u201d opposes government actions\n(egalitarian ). This example highlights how cul-\ntural stories complement the character role compo-\nnent in our framework, and the importance of each\ncomponent for effectively differentiating between\nnarrative frames. Future work should explore incor-\nporating all components (and not only characters\nand focus) in structured prompts.\n5 Narrative Framing of COVID-19\nIn this section we apply our narrative frame struc-\ntures taxonomy to texts with a different topic and\nstyle \u2013 politicians\u2019 speeches around the onset of\nCOVID-19 \u2013 to demonstrate its generalizability to\nother domains. We show how models and prompts\n11These gains occur only when the labels are accurate\nenough: we observed only minimal gains or drops in per-\nformance when using predictions from less strong models.\ndeveloped within the supervised approach (Sec-\ntion 4) can be applied to analyze narrative frame\ncomponents in an unsupervised way.\n5.1 Dataset and model\nWe collect transcripts of head-of-state addresses re-\ngarding the onset of COVID-19 dating from Febru-\nary to end of July 2020, for three countries: Ger-\nmany (Angela Merkel; N=12), UK (Boris Johnston;\nN=24) and Australia (Scott Morrisson; N=6).12We\nexamine all addresses published during that period\nand select those that were dedicated to COVID-19.\nWe use the most reliable model identified in\nSection 4 (Claude Sonnet 3.5) in a zero-shot set-\nting. Since the prompts for focus ,conflict , and\ncultural story developed in Section 4 are do-\nmain agnostic, we apply them without changes,\nonly substituting the topic name for \u201cCOVID-19\u201d.\nHowever, since the set of stakeholders is likely\nto be different for this topic, we modify the HVV\nprompts by replacing the classes with a list of topic-\nspecific stakeholders. We compile this list auto-\nmatically by generating them from the speeches:\nfirst we ask the LLM to extract and merge enti-\nties which are likely to represent hero ,villain ,\nandvictim , then combine the extracted candidates\nfrom all speeches and cluster them into groups\n(prompts in Appendix L).\nWe arrive at a set of 8 stakeholders, some\nof which are generic and shared with the cli-\nmate change domain ( government, general public ),\nwhile the majority are unique and topic-specific\n(vulnerable population, healthcare , etc). The final\nset of stakeholders corresponds to prominent stake-\nholders previously identified as hero ,villain ,\nvictim in studies on narrative framing in these\nspeeches (Bernard et al., 2021; Mintrom et al.,\n2021).\n5.2 Results\nWe apply our approach to discover differences and\ncommonalities in framing of politicians speeches\nregarding COVID-19.\nFirst, all speeches across all three politicians\nwere identified as hero-focused andpromoting res-\nolution , which is not surprising given the fact that\nthey are all mobilizing narratives that suggest spe-\ncific actions to solve the crisis and praise the role\n12Sources: https://www.bundesregierung.de/\nbreg-en/service/archive/ (official translation into\nEnglish), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/ ,\nhttps://www.pm.gov.au/media .of heroes. Similarly, the villain is consistently\ndetected as \u201cpandemics\", and victim is \u201cgeneral\npublic\u201d, especially \u201cvulnerable populations\u201d, and,\nlater in the period, \u201ceconomy\u201d.\nHowever, the stakeholders that are pinpointed as\nhero differ across politicians: while all of them rec-\nognize the role of \u201chealthcare workers\u201d, Merkel\u2019s\nspeeches also highlight the role of \u201cgeneral pub-\nlic\u201d, and, later in the pandemic, of \u201cglobal efforts\u201d.\nOn the other hand, Morrison\u2019s speeches heavily re-\nvolve around the role of \u201cgovernment\u201d as a hero, as\nwell as \u201cscience experts\u201d. This divergence is in line\nwith prior theoretical analyses of these speeches,\nwhich assert that chancellor Merkel recognized the\nvalue of combined efforts of the German public\nand countries around the globe (Mintrom et al.,\n2021), while prime minister Morrison often used\nreassuring framing relying on the role of science\nin pandemic management and the imagery of Aus-\ntralia as a \u201clucky country\u201d (Bernard et al., 2021).\nSimilarly, the analysis of predicted cultural sto-\nries reveals that Morrison predominantly used hi-\nerarchical cultural stories ( \u2018Government and fol-\nlowing social prescriptions plays the biggest role\nin managing the crisis \u2019), Merkel had a larger pro-\nportion of egalitarian narrative frames than others\n(\u2018We must act as one to combat the crisis\u2019 ), while\nJohnson was the only one who alluded to individ-\nualistic cultural story ( \u2018Take care of yourself and\nyour family\u2019 ). Again, these insights align with pre-\nvious theoretical analyses (Mintrom et al., 2021).\n6 Conclusion\nWe presented a rigorous formalization and taxon-\nomy of components of narrative framing, synthe-\nsizing the NPF and Entman (1993)\u2019s components\nof a frame. Our method allows to inductively de-\ntect narratives from political texts in terms of their\ncharacter roles, focus, conflict, and underlying cul-\ntural story. A high-quality data set of 100 manually\nlabeled articles serves as a benchmark and basis for\nfuture annotation bootstrapping. We showed that\nour framework results in promising improvement\nof automatic narrative prediction with LLMs, lay-\ning a foundation for the important research agenda\nof large-scale studies of the manifestation and ef-\nfects of narrative frames. Moreover, we showed\nthat our framework is generalizable to other top-\nics and can assist in exploratory framing analysis\nwithout requiring a labeled dataset.\n7 Limitations\nWe acknowledge the small size of our data set rela-\ntive to NLP benchmarks, but emphasize the diffi-\nculty of annotating news articles at this level. We\nprioritize depth over breadth, and our data set can\nserve both as a benchmark and a high-quality start-\ning point for bootstrapping other story annotations.\nBecause our approach is inductive / bottom-up\nwe cannot guarantee that the narratives we found\ncover all possible active narratives or reflect the true\nnarrative distribution. However, since our inductive\nnarratives overlapped with a large part of narratives\ndescribed in the literature, we are confident that\nthey are representative and comprehensive.\nAdditional LLM experiments, with larger exam-\nple pools or advanced reasoning techniques may\nlead to further improvements but are outside the\nscope of this work. We showed that incorporat-\ning narrative structure into prompts improves per-\nformance more substantially than models with ad-\nvanced reasoning abilities. Future work, however,\nmay want to combine it with such models and tech-\nniques.\nEthics statement\nThis study was approved by the University of Mel-\nbourne ethics board (Human Ethics Committee\nLNR 3B), Reference Number 2023-22109-37029-\n4, and data acquisition and analysis has been taken\nout to the according ethical standards.

In par-\nticular, journalists often cite the opposing view, and\nthus can mention a set of characters which is differ-\nent from the one aligned with stance. For example,\nin the article in Figure 1, melting ice is a victim of\nrising temperatures, according to the viewpoint of\nclimate activists. However, while the author cites\nthis viewpoint, it does not reflect the main mes-\nsage of the article, so the corresponding entities\nare not considered as potential hero ,villain , and\nvictim . To summarize, the main characters are the\nones framed so by the author/narrator.\n(2) We discard characters that either form the\nbackdrop of the story or are used to illustrate a\nminor (often competing) idea within the main nar-\nRight bias\n30.0%\n(30) Left bias\n28.0%\n(28)\nQuestionable source22.0%\n(22)Left center bias20.0%\n(20)Figure 8: Distribution of articles across political lean-\nings of the outlets\nrative.14For example, in the narrative in Figure 1\nmelting ice or Arctic animals are only included as\na point of tension between the climate activists and\ndenialists but don\u2019t themselves play a major role in\nthe narrative. The main characters are the parties\nexpressing their opinion regarding them.\n(3) The same character can be referred to several\ntimes and be represented with several stakeholders.\nFor example, it is common for news stories to men-\ntion both climate change regulations/policies and\nthe politicians that propose them. In such cases,\ninstead of adding multiple stakeholders for a char-\nacter, we choose the one that was most prominent\nin the context or can be used to infer the other (for\nexample, we would choose policies over politicians\nif the article focuses on them).\n(4) We only consider characters that are active\nin the plot, rather than references to potential or\npast heroes, villains, and victims. For example, a\nnews story that paints Republicans as a villain\nfor not implementing climate change measures15\nconcludes with the following sentence:\nFor 2020 and beyond, climate justice will\nhave to become the most animating issue for\nDemocrats.\nSince the positive impact of Democrats is only\nhoped for or predicted to happen in the future,\nDemocrats are not an active hero , and, overall, the\nhero in this news story is absent. It is important\nnot to assign extraneous entities to the character\nslots, even if they are otherwise empty, as it will\n14We are well aware that news stories are complex in terms\nof interplay of narratives within them and most of them con-\ntain what Fl\u00f8ttum and Gjerstad (2017) refers to as narrative\npolyphony. We intentionally restrict the task to identification\nof the main narrative only as the first step in disentangling\nnarrative complexity.\n15Article 512 in our dataset.\nlater help to differentiate between narratives. For\nexample, here it allows us to distinguish a narrative\ncriticizing the villain from alternative narratives\nwhich depict an active conflict between hero and\nvillain .\n(5) For the same reasons, we do not add stake-\nholders that are only implied but not directly re-\nferred to in the text. For example, we do not add\n\u201cenvironment\u201d as a victim unless it is specifically\nmentioned, though it can be inferred from the ma-\njority of pro-climate action news stories. Similarly,\nthough the stories warning about the dangers of\nclimate inaction are usually inspired by scientific\nevidence, scientists or scientific reports are not a\nhero in them unless they have an active role, as in\nhere16\nClimate report warns of extreme weather, dis-\nplacement of millions without action\nThis allows to differentiate between a narrative\nwhich appeals to authority of scientists (so called\n\u201cGore\u201d narrative) from a similar but often more\nemotionally charged and less \u201cobjective\u201d alarmist\nnarrative (\u201c12 Years to save the world\u201d) (see Ap-\npendix E for detailed description).\nC Stakeholder categories\nWe use the following 10 stakeholder categories\nfrom (Frermann et al., 2023):\nGOVERNMENTS_POLITICIANS: governments\nand political organizations\nINDUSTRY_EMISSIONS: industries, businesses,\nand the pollution created by them\nLEGISLATION_POLICIES: policies and legisla-\ntion responses\nGENERAL_PUBLIC: general public, individuals,\nand society, including their wellbeing, status quo\nand economy\nANIMALS_NATURE_ENVIRONMENT: nature\nand environment in general or specific species\nENV .ORGS_ACTIVISTS: climate activists and or-\nganizations\nSCIENCE_EXPERTS_SCI.REPORTS: scientists\nand scientific reports/research\nCLIMATE_CHANGE: climate change as a process\nor consequence\nGREEN_TECHNOLOGY_INNOV ATION: inno-\nvative and green technologies\nMEDIA_JOURNALISTS: media and journalists\n16Article 537 in our dataset.D Annotation process\nThe annotation was performed in two stages:\nD.1 Stage 1: Annotating hero ,villain , and\nvillain\nDuring stage 1, we employed three external an-\nnotators, all with an academic background in the\nsocial sciences and familiar with the Narrative Pol-\nicy Framework, and one of the authors of the article,\nwho is considered an expert annotator with knowl-\nedge of media discourse and framing. For each\narticle, each annotator had to (1) read it beginning\nto end and (2) identify the main hero ,villain\nandvictim (if any) and record them in free form\nbased on the procedure described in Appendix B.\nThey were also asked to record their reasoning in\nplain text (see an example and annotation interface\nin Figure 9).\nEach of the 100 articles in the dataset was an-\nnotated at least by two external annotators, and all\nof them were in addition annotated by the inter-\nnal expert annotator. Since the annotators were\nasked to specify entities for hero ,villain , and\nvictim in free form, their annotations were not\ndirectly comparable (e.g. \"Biden\" vs \"Joe Biden\"\nvs \"Democrats\"). Thus, to evaluate the annotation\nagreement, as well as to convert the data to a more\nabstract and useful structure (see Section 3.1), the\nexpert annotator mapped the specific characters\nmentioned by each of the annotators to their stake-\nholder classes (Appendix C).\nWe evaluate the agreement between all four an-\nnotators using Krippendorf\u2019s \u03b1, and report the av-\neraged agreement of each of the three external an-\nnotators with the expert. For the latter, we use the\nstandard metrics of agreement rate (=accuracy), Co-\nhen\u2019s \u03ba, and the less commonly used Gwet\u2019s AC1,\nwhich compensates for the high imbalance in data\ndistribution. The resulting inter-annotator agree-\nment statistics can be found in Table 2. Overall,\nwe observe acceptable to strong levels of agree-\nment between all four annotators, as well as very\nhigh average agreement of each of the annota-\ntors with the expert (as judged based on Gwet\u2019s\nAC1). A relatively lower agreement for hero and\nvillain in comparison to victim is explained by\nthe fact that the annotators sometimes chose en-\ntities belonging to different stakeholder types to\nrepresent the same event. For example, a particular\nclimate initiative can be represented both by a par-\nliamentary bill such as New Green Deal (LEGIS-\nFigure 9: Example of stage 1 annotations ( hero ,villain ,victim )\nHero Villain Victim\nKrippendorff\u2019s \u03b1 0.757 0.673 0.812\nAgreement rate 0.852 0.855 0.927\nCohen\u2019s \u03ba 0.783 0.745 0.876\nGwet\u2019t AC1 0.837 0.843 0.914\nTable 2: Inter-annotator agreement for hero ,villain ,\nandvictim annotation\nLATION_POLICIES), and by the group of people\nbehind it (GOVERNMENTS_POLITICIANS). In\ncase of disagreement the final label was chosen\nbased on majority vote.\nD.2 Stage 2: Annotating focus ,conflict ,\nandcultural story\nIn the second stage, the expert annotator annotated\nall 100 articles in terms of their focus ,conflict ,\nandcultural story . Next, a random sample\nof 30 articles was annotated by another internal\nannotator who is also an expert in Narrative Policy\nFramework and framing analysis. The instructions\nfor the annotation and an example of an annotated\narticle are shown in Figures 10 and 11 respectively.\nTo ensure a high quality of the resulting dataset,\nall disagreements were discussed and adjudicated,\nand then the corresponding changes were reflected\nin the samples beyond this calibration study, if\nnecessary.\nTable 3 shows the agreement statistics between\nthe two annotators in Stage 2, using the same met-\nrics as for Stage 1. We observe high agreement\nrates for all three classes, with other scores varying\nslightly due to number of classes and class dis-\ntribution, but all being within the strong or very\nstrong agreement range. Disagreement analysis\nrevealed that there were disagreements on focus\n(between villain andvictim ), when both were\ndiscussed at similar length and depth in the arti-\ncle. For conflict and Cultural story, the disagree-\nments were more systematic (such as confusion\nbetween Fuel Resolution and Prevent Conflict, orFocus Conflict Cultural story\nKrippendorf\u2019s \u03b1 0.780 0.820 0.801\nAgreement rate 0.867 0.867 0.867\nCohen\u2019s \u03ba 0.776 0.817 0.800\nGwet\u2019t AC1 0.810 0.824 0.801\nTable 3: Inter-annotator agreement for focus ,\nconflict , and cultural story annotation\nbetween Hierarchical and Egalitarian stories); the\ninsights arising from the discussion were reflected\nin the final labels and allowed us to refine the def-\ninitions of these concepts for the prompts used in\nLLM experiments.\nAnnotation with vs without narrative frame\nstructure\nWe empirically tested if structural components help\nto differentiate between narratives in human an-\nnotation. Specifically, we compare agreement in\nnarrative detection when using a structure-based an-\nnotation approach (bottom-up; as described above)\nvs using a more traditional approach where the an-\nnotators are asked to classify narratives top-down\nbased on their descriptions.\nFor the structure-based approach, we estimate\nthe agreement based on the sample of 30 articles\nwe used for Stage 2 annotation (see Appendix D).\nIn particular, we assume that both annotators agree\non a particular narrative if they choose exactly the\nsame values for all its components. For the tradi-\ntional approach, we ask two annotators who took\npart in Stage 1 of annotation (and thus did not clas-\nsify any elements of the narrative except for its\ncharacters) to choose a narrative frame for each\narticle based on its description only (as listed in\nAppendix E).\nWe find that annotation using our narrative struc-\ntures resulted in 63% agreement, while top-down\nannotation based on the narrative frame descrip-\ntions resulted in a substantially lower 37%. Thus,\nwe can tentatively conclude that structure-based\nAnnotation Instructions  You will be given a full text of an article about climate change and asked to identify some elements of its narrative structure according to Narrative Policy Framework (NFP).  In NFP , a narrative contains at least one of the following characters: Villain, who is creating some con\ufb02ict/problem; Hero, who is trying to resolve a con\ufb02ict or problem; or a Victim, who is negatively aFected by a con\ufb02ict or problem. Not all of these characters need to be present in a narrative at the same time.  Each article can contain a mixture of narratives and thus have multiple villain-hero-victim sets. However, we can derive the overarching narrative of the article by determining its main hero, villain, or victim. For each of the articles you will see, we have already annotated the main hero, villain, and victim, so that you can focus on the main narrative characters when you do your annotation.  You will be asked three questions:  1. Focus: narratives can have the same characters (hero, villain, victim) but focus on diFerent ones of them. For example, a narrative about negative eFects of pollution on environment can focus either on the villain (criticise policies, governments, industries that cause pollution while mentioning its negative eFects), or on the victim (describe negative eFects on people or nature in detail while also mentioning the culprit). Which of the characters (Hero, Villain, or Victim) is the focus of the narrative?  2. Con\ufb02ict and Resolution:  apart from their characters, narratives in NFP are de\ufb01ned by the con\ufb02ict/problem or its resolution described in them. In our case, the con\ufb02ict/problem is climate change, and resolution is measures against climate change. Thus, a particular narrative can:  FUEL RESOLUTION: propose or describe speci\ufb01c measures, policies, or events that would contribute to the resolution of the climate crisis. FUEL CONFLICT: propose or describe speci\ufb01c measures, policies, or events that would exacerbate the climate crisis. PREVENT RESOLUTION: criticise measures, policies, or events that contribute to the resolution of the climate crisis; or deny the climate crisis PREVENT CONFLICT: criticise measures, policies, or events that exacerbate the climate crisis; or provides the evidence of climate crisis.  Please be mindful that the perspective of the author/narrator and the characters in the story regarding the con\ufb02ict and its resolution can be diFerent; identify and annotate the main perspective which corresponds to the author\u2019s/narrator\u2019s intention.  Does this narrative fuel con\ufb02ict, fuel resolution, prevent con\ufb02ict, or prevent resolution?   3. Cultural story: narratives of climate change are aligned with the following cultural stories, which capture the ideas of the necessity of top-down control vs self-regulation, and the idea of group responsibility vs individual responsibility.  HIERARCHICAL: this story assumes that the nature can be controlled but we need to be bound by tight social prescriptions. The villain is mismanaged society which led to excessive growth, and heroes are impartial scientists or government intervention. INDIVIDUALISTIC: this story assumes that the nature is resilient and will return to equilibrium. Villains here are people who try to control climate change or seek policy changes, and the heroes allow markets to move naturally as individuals compete to create innovative technologies. EGALITARIAN: this story assumes that the nature is fragile and there is little opportunity to correct mistakes. The cause of climate change is overconsumption; villains are pro\ufb01t-driven corporations and anyone who supports status quo, and heroes are groups who seek fundamental changes. FATALIST: the story assumes that the nature cannot be controlled, and climate change is inevitable whatever eForts we make.  Which of the cultural stories (Hierarchical, Individualistic, Egalitarian, or Fatalist) does the narrative align with?

Plans to Get Thousands of Deaths O5 the Books by Changing Its Math Want climate news in your inbox ? Sign up here for Climate Fwd :, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to \ufb01ve people with knowledge of the agency 's plans. The E.P .A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama - era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would signi\ufb01cantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted. The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health bene\ufb01t to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scienti\ufb01cally sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the \ufb01ne particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Fine particulate matter \u2014 the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream \u2014 is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease.\"   Questions:  Considering that in this article the Villain is politicians, and the Victim is general public, answer the following:  1) Which of the characters (Hero, Villain, or Victim) is the focus of the narrative?  Hero   Villain  Victim   2) Does this narrative fuel con\ufb02ict, fuel resolution, prevent con\ufb02ict, or prevent resolution? Fuels con\ufb02ict    Fuels resolution Prevents con\ufb02ict  Prevents resolution  3) Which of the cultural stories (Hierarchical, Individualistic, or Egalitarian) does the narrative align with?

First, we use 5 randomly\nselected samples from our dataset for 5-shot\nlearning with GPT4o model. However, except for\nHero stakeholder identification, where it leads to\nsome gains, it causes overgeneralization to seen\nlabels and thus drop in performance (see Table 4).\nWe observe similar effects when we perform\nLow-Rank Adaption (LoRA) fine-tuning (Hu et al.,\n2021) of Llama.17Similarly, we notice that the\nfine-tuned model tends to overpredict the most\nprominent labels, discarding minor classes.\nWe also use the 5 random samples for a DSPy\nprogram (Khattab et al., 2023) to automatically\ngenerate and optimize reasoning steps for\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

A prominent\ndrawback in generative models for online events is the inability to\ndescribe unpopular items well. This work addresses these shortcom-\nings by proposing dual mixture self-exciting processes to jointly\nlearn from groups of cascades. We first start from the observation\nthat maximum likelihood estimates for content virality and influ-\nence decay are separable in a Hawkes process. Next, our proposed\nmodel, which leverages a Borel mixture model and a kernel mix-\nture model, jointly models the unfolding of a heterogeneous set of\ncascades. When applied to cascades of the same online items, the\nmodel directly characterizes their spread dynamics and supplies\ninterpretable quantities, such as content virality and content in-\nfluence decay, as well as methods for predicting the final content\npopularities. On two retweet cascade datasets \u2014 one relating to\nYouTube videos and the second relating to controversial news arti-\ncles \u2014 we show that our models capture the differences between\nonline items at the granularity of items, publishers and categories.\nIn particular, we are able to distinguish between far-right, con-\nspiracy, controversial and reputable online news articles based on\nhow they diffuse through social media, achieving an F1 score of\n0.945.

The amount of reshares that an item attracts on the\nsocial media platform can consistently influence the total attention\nthat the item receives, also defined as its popularity . Not all content\nis made equal and, intuitively, the capacity to command reshare\ncascades in social media and their characteristics are informative of\nthe content\u2019s type, publisher or even veracity (say for online news).\nIn this work, we characterize online items based on how they are\nshared and diffused through online social media.\nWhen studying what makes diffusion cascades popular, a family\nof point process based models, known as the Hawkes processes,\nhas attracted growing attention [ 37,54]. Most modeling efforts\nconcentrate on learning from popular diffusions, usually discarding\nunpopular ones. For instance, Zhao et al . [54] only study cascades\nwith at least 50retweets. However, to characterize online items it is\nnot feasible to apply the same cascade-level filtering, as all online\nitems generate both \u201csuccessful\u201d and \u201cunsuccessful\u201d diffusions. In\nfact, the latter makes up for a large portion of all cascades, even for\npopular items, due to the long-tailed distributions [21].\nIn this work, we address two open questions relating to charac-\nterizing online items using their social media reshare cascades.\nThe first open question relates to jointly modeling a group of\nheterogeneous cascades of the same item. Popularities are known to\nbe hard to predict, whether one uses discriminative predictors [ 14]\nor generative models [ 41]. This suggests that learning from popular\ndiffusions on an online item leads to modeling bias as it omits the\ndynamics of unpopular cascades. The question is: what represen-\ntations can account for the diffusions of an online item, as\na collection of popular and unpopular cascades? We answer\nthis question in two steps. First, we adopt a new representation\nfor Hawkes point processes that decouples content virality and\ninfluence decay (i.e., the decaying of influence from a reshare ac-\ntion). As a result, we find that the maximum likelihood estimates of\nmodel parameters are also separable, leading to a seprate learning\nover multiple cascades. In the second step, we propose a novel\ndual mixture self-exciting model that captures the diverse diffusion\ndynamics that each online item encounters across a set of cascades.\nOne is a Borel mixture model [ 16] that accounts for the distribution\nof final reshare counts for each cascade in the set, and the other is a\nkernel mixture model that controls the inter-arrival time dynamics\nfor capturing influence decaying dynamics. Fig. 1 illustrates the\nmodel where a group of cascades (left) relating to a video is modeled\nby the dual mixture model (middle) and the two fitted models are\ncombined to form the intensity function of the mixture processes\n(right).arXiv:2001.11132v2  [cs.SI]  16 Aug 2020\nThe second open question is how can we apply the mixture\nmodels to describe online items and predict final content\npopularities? Fitted model parameters and derived quantities are\ncommonly used for analyzing individual reshare cascades [ 37]. One\ncan describe an online item or a content producer by compiling\nthe key parameters of the dual mixture models. In this work, we\nbuild quantities that summarize respectively an item\u2019s content vi-\nrality and influence decay. We also construct diffusion embeddings\nthat describe the item/producer reshare dynamics and can be used\nwith off-the-shelf supervised and unsupervised tools. We deploy\nour methods on two large-scale retweet cascade datasets, the first\nabout YouTube videos and the second around far-right, conspir-\nacy, controversial and reputable online news articles. When using\nthe diffusion embeddings, we find that content producers group\ntogether with respect to video category and publisher virality in\nthe YouTube dataset. For the news dataset, the publishers of rep-\nutable and controversial news form two separable clusters, and\nwe obtain an F1 score of 0.945when using a Gradient Boosting\nMachine to distinguish the two types of news. To accurately predict\nthe final popularities of newly posted items, we fit our proposed\ndual mixture model on the historical information \u2014 how previously\nposted items spread \u2014 and we leverage it for recent items. On both\ndatasets, we show that for individual cascades the dual mixture\nmodels provide improved generalization performance compared to\nindividual cascade fits [ 37] and non-mixture models, especially for\nunpopular cascades. For online items, the model obtains the best\nfinal popularity prediction when compared against feature-based\nregressors and the state-of-the-art generative models [29, 54].\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n\u2022Separable joint learning. We adopt a new representation for\nHawkes processes that separates virality and influence decay,\nwhich leads to a separable learning of model parameters in the\nmaximum likelihood estimates\n\u2022Dual mixture self-exciting processes. We design mixture\nmodels for the two separable model factors \u2014 a Borel mixture\nfor the virality, and a kernel mixture for the influence decay \u2014 in\norder to capture the diverse diffusion dynamics that each online\nitem encounters across a set of cascades.\n\u2022Item characterization and item popularity prediction. We\npropose a set of tools to quantify online items using their spread\ndynamics: derived quantities, and the diffusion embeddings. We\nalso propose methods for predicting item final popularities.\n\u2022Two real-world case studies. On two large retweet datasets,\nwe show our methods are effective for the unsupervised ex-\nploratory analysis of collections of online publishers, and in\npredicting content category \u2014 for example whether a news ar-\nticle is controversial. We also show better generalization and\npopularity prediction performances for unseen items.\n2 RELATED WORK\nGenerative models are commonly employed for modeling temporal\ndiffusions of online information.

Finally, the fitted BMM and KMM are com-\nbined to construct the Hawkes intensity functions.\nsummaries of resharing events together with user features and con-\ntent features [ 5,35]. However, to our knowledge, most of the prior\nwork concentrate on popular cascades, and the complete temporal\ninformation of the unpopular diffusions is rarely considered.\nHawkes processes [ 27] are a class of self-exciting point processes\n\u2014 past events spawn future events \u2014 widely applied in analyzing\nsocial media [ 13,28,53], earthquake aftershocks [ 39], neuronal\nactivity [ 1], online advertising [ 40] and finance [ 4]. The distribution\nof event counts of Hawkes processes has not been explored until\nrecently. While Rizoiu et al . [41] and Daw and Pender [16] are able\nto obtain the distribution under certain assumptions, O\u2019Brien et al .\n[38] show a method to numerically approximate actual event count\ndistributions. Our work enhances the understanding of Hawkes\nprocesses by connecting its log-likelihood function with the event\ncount distribution.\nExisting work leveraging mixture with temporal point processes\nfocuses on two levels. Event-level mixture modeling clusters indi-\nvidual events from a sequence [ 19,52], whereas, as in our work,\nsequence-level mixture modeling identifies clusters of event se-\nquences [ 49]. The prior work most relevant to ours is by Xu and\nZha[51]. Their model integrates Hawkes processes and a Dirichlet\ndistribution for learning event sequence groups. Our work extends\nthe prior literature in several ways. First, we derive two separate\nmixture models from Hawkes processes for modeling content viral-\nity and content influence decay separately. Second, we apply the\nmodels to complete historical diffusion cascades for learning and\nquantifying temporal dynamics of online items.\n3 PRELIMINARIES\nIn this section, we first define diffusion cascades. Next, we introduce\nthe Hawkes processes, together with essential concepts including\nits cluster representation, branching factor, size distribution and\nlikelihood function.\nDiffusion cascades. In online social media platforms, such as\nTwitter, users read content posted by others, and they can re-\nshare it, exposing the content to a broader audience. The initial\nposting event and the following reshare events together consti-\ntute a diffusion cascade . In this work, we analyze groups of cas-\ncades that discuss about the same online items, e.g., an online\nFigure 2: The cluster representation of a Hawkes process.\nEach individual event tiinitiates an inhomogeneous Poisson\nprocess with the intensity function n\u2217\u0434(t\u2212ti)(identical for\nall events). Different generations of events are shown in dis-\ntinct colors; arrows indicate the parent-offspring relation;\nand the event counts at each generation form a branching\nprocess, i.e.,{Z0,Z1,Z3, . . .}.\nvideo [ 42], an image meme [ 30], or a news article [ 43]. Mathe-\nmatically, we denote a cascade idiscussing an online item vas\nHv,i={t0,t1,t2, . . . , tNv,i\u22121}where Nv,i\u22651is the number\nof events in cascade iof itemv,\u2200tj\u2208 Hv,iare event times\non[0,\u221e)relative to t0andt0=0is the initial event time. Let\nHv,i(T),Nv,i(T)represent the event set and the event count be-\nfore time T, respectively, i.e.,Hv,i(T)={tj|tj\u2208Hv,i,tj<T}\nandNv,i(T)=|Hv,i(T)|. The total event count Nv,iis also known\nas the popularity of the cascade i. The popularity of the online item\nvis then the total popularity of all related cascades.\nHawkes processes are special classes of self-exciting point pro-\ncesses in which the occurrence of new events will increase the\nlikelihood of future event happening [ 26]. In Hawkes processes, the\nevent intensity is a function conditioned on the past occurred events\nand we choose the intensity function in a form similar to [54]:\n\u03bb(t|Hi(t))=\u00b5+\u00d5\ntj\u2208Hi(t)n\u2217\u0434(t\u2212tj) (1)\nwhere\u00b5is the background event rate, n\u2217is known as the branching\nfactor ,\u0434:R+\u2192R+is a memory kernel encoding the time-decaying\ninfluence of past events on future events and\u222b\u221e\n0\u0434(\u03c4)d\u03c4=1.\nWhile Eq. (1) is equivalent to existing definitions of Hawkes pro-\ncesses [ 26,31], it explicitly incorporates n\u2217as a model parameter\nwhich simplifies derivations in Section 4. We note that for informa-\ntion cascades (such as retweet cascades on Twitter), there is no back-\nground intensity, as all the retweets are considered to be spawned by\nthe original tweet, i.e., \u00b5=0. Common choices of the memory ker-\nnels include the exponential kernel function [ 50],\u0434EX P(\u03c4)=\u03b8e\u2212\u03b8\u03c4,\nthe power-law kernel [ 37],\u0434PL(\u03c4)=\u03b8c\u03b8(\u03c4+c)\u2212(1+\u03b8), among others.\nWe refer to [29] for a review of kernels used with cascades.\nCluster representation and size distribution. An alternate rep-\nresentation of the Hawkes self-exciting process is a latent cluster of\nPoisson processes, introduced by Hawkes and Oakes [27]. Fig. 2 de-\npicts the cluster representation of an example Hawkes process, with\nhighlighted parent-offspring relations between events. Each event\ngenerates offspring events following an inhomogeneous Poisson\nprocess with the intensity function n\u2217\u0434(t), which means its number\nof offspring follows a Poisson distribution of intensity\u222bT\n0n\u2217\u0434(t)dt.\nWhen T\u2192\u221e , the event counts at each generation \u2014 denoted\nas{Z0,Z1,Z2, . . .}\u2014 produce a Galton-Watson branching process\nwhose offspring distribution is a Poisson distribution with intensityn\u2217[20]. The total size of a Hawkes process can be then computed as\nN=\u00cd\nnZn. This quantity is known as the total progeny number of\nthe branching process, following a Borel distribution [ 8], denoted as\nB(\u03ba|n\u2217)=P[N=\u03ba|n\u2217]=(\u03ban\u2217)\u03ba\u22121e\u2212\u03ban\u2217\n\u03ba!, which holds for n\u2217<1.\nThe mean and variance of a Borel distribution are1\n1\u2212n\u2217andn\u2217\n(1\u2212n\u2217)3.\nThe analysis of Hawkes process size distribution [ 38] and this par-\nticular analytical form [ 16] are both very recent developments on\nthe point process literature.\nParameter estimation. The parameters of a Hawkes process can\nbe estimated by maximizing the likelihood function of a general\npoint process [15]:\nL(\u0398|Hi(T))=e\u2212\u222bT\n0\u03bb(\u03c4|Hi(T))d\u03c4\u00d6\ntj\u2208Hi(T)\u03bb(tj|Hi(T)) (2)\n4 SEPARABLE HAWKES PROCESSES FITTING\nIn this section, we discuss jointly learning a single set of parameters\nfrom a collection of Hawkes realizations.\nLetH={H1,H2, . . .}be a set of independent Hawkes realiza-\ntions, assumed to be generated from the same model parameterized\nbyn\u2217, the branching factor, and \u0398\u0434, the parameter set of \u0434(\u00b7). It\nis then straightforward to estimate n\u2217and\u0398\u0434by maximizing the\njoint log-likelihood function L(n\u2217,\u0398\u0434|H) defined as the sum of\nthe individual log-likelihoods (i.e., the log of Eq. (2)):\nL(n\u2217,\u0398\u0434|H)=\u00d5\nHi\u2208HlogL(n\u2217,\u0398\u0434|Hi) (3)\nAfter plugging Eq. (2) into Eq. (3), we see that the joint log-\nlikelihood function can be rearranged as a sum of two functions\nwith independent parameter sets given\u222b\u221e\n0\u0434(\u03c4)d\u03c4=1andT\u2192\u221e\n(detailed in the online appendix [2]):\nL(n\u2217,\u0398\u0434|H)=L\u0434(\u0398\u0434|H)+Ln(n\u2217|H) (4)\nwithL\u0434a function of \u0398\u0434andLna function of n\u2217:\nL\u0434(\u0398\u0434|H)=\u00d5\nHi\u2208H\u00d5\ntj\u2208Hi,j\u22651log\u00d5\ntz<tj\u0434(tj\u2212tz|\u0398\u0434)(5)\nLn(n\u2217|H)=\u00d5\nHi\u2208Hlogh\n(n\u2217)Ni\u22121e\u2212Nin\u2217i\n(6)\nRegarding the assumption T\u2192\u221e , we show in Section 7 that most\ncascades are complete in practice given a large T. We also note that\nEq. (6) can be solved efficiently and analytically by setting its first\nderivative to 0.\nThe above results indicate that \u0398\u0434andn\u2217can be learned inde-\npendently in two separate phases, by maximizing L\u0434andLn. This\namounts to fitting n\u2217from observed final cascade sizes only, and\n\u0398\u0434from inter-arrival times between events.\nWe note that maximizing Lnis equivalent to the maximum\nlikelihood estimation of the Borel distribution. One can see this by\nexpanding both forms, as shown below:\narg max\nn\u2217\u00d5\nHi\u2208HlogB(Ni|n\u2217)\n=arg max\nn\u2217\u00d5\nHi\u2208H\"\nlog(n\u2217)Ni\u22121e\u2212Nin\u2217+logNNi\u22121\ni\nNi!#\n(a)=arg max\nn\u2217Ln(n\u2217|H) (7)\nwhere we discard the log ratio of constants Niat step (a).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to discuss the\nseparable form of Hawkes parameter estimations and its connection\nto the Borel distribution.\n5 DUAL MIXTURE MODEL\nIn practice, an online item is reshared across a set of diffusion\ncascades of diverse dynamics. In this section, we propose a dual\nmixture model that allows individual cascades to differ one from an-\nother. Given the separability of the log-likelihood functions (Eqs. (5)\nand (6)), we introduce a Borel mixture model (BMM) and a kernel\nmixture model (KMM) to automatically uncover the latent clusters\nof models based on cascade sizes and time intervals. Finally, we\nemploy the fitted dual mixture model to construct item level char-\nacterizations, such as \u02c6n\u2217v,\u02c6\u03b8vand the diffusion embeddings with a\ndistance measure.\nMixture models for Hawkes processes. We are given Hv, a set\nof cascades relating to an online item v, and the number of compo-\nnents kv\u2014 there exist kvlatent generative models with unknown\nrelations to the cascades in Hv. We seek to learn kvgroups of n\u2217\nand\u0398\u0434, and their weights. As indicated in Section 4, we model these\ntwo parameter sets separately using cascade sizes and inter-arrival\ntimes. We denote the obtained model as Mv={MBv,MKv}where\nMBv={(n\u2217\n1,pB\n1), . . . ,(n\u2217\nkv,pB\nkv)},M\u0434\nv={(\u0398\u0434\n1,p\u0434\n1), . . . ,(\u0398\u0434\nkv,p\u0434\nkv).\npB\n1, . . . , pB\nkvandp\u0434\n1, . . . , p\u0434\nkvare the component weights for corre-\nsponding Borel models and kernel functions.\nGiven two mixture models, MBvandMKv, inferred separately\nfrom a group of cascades, we assume the intensity functions of the\ncorresponding Hawkes processes \u2014 Eq. (1) \u2014 are parameterized by\nthe cartesian product of MBvandMKv, i.e.,\nMH\nv={(n\u2217\ni,\u0398\u0434\nj,pB\nip\u0434\nj)|(n\u2217\ni,pB\ni)\u2208MB\nvand(\u0398\u0434\nj,p\u0434\nj)\u2208M\u0434\nv}(8)\nwhere pB\nip\u0434\njgives the component weight. Fig. 1 summarizes the\nmodeling procedure.\nBorel mixture model (BMM). To learn the MBvfor the online\nitemv, we present an EM estimation algorithm [ 17]. A BMM can\nbe fitted on Hvby maximizing the log-likelihood\nLBMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvlogkv\u00d5\nk=1pB\nkB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk)\n|             {z             }\nqB(k,Nv,i)(9)\nAs maximizing Eq. (9) directly suffers from the identifiability is-\nsue [ 7], we apply the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm\ncommonly used for learning mixture models [ 44]. This algorithmoptimizes an alternative lower bound QBMM defined as\nQBMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvkv\u00d5\nk=1pB(k|Nv,i)logqB(k,Nv,i) (10)\nwhere pB(k|Nv,i)is the probability of Nibeing a member of the\nkth model and is updated during the E step. Next we give the update\nformulas for the E and M steps.\nE-step: membership probabilities are updated\npB(k|Nv,i)=qB(k,Nv,i)\n\u00cdkv\nj=1qB(j,Nv,i)(11)\nM-step: n\u2217\nkandpB\nkare updated analytically\n(n\u2217\nk)new=\u00cd\nNv,ipB(k|Nv,i)(Nv,i\u22121)\n\u00cd\nNv,ipB(k|Nv,i)Nv,i(12)\n(pB\nk)new=\u00d5\nNv,ipB(k|Nv,i)\n|Hv|(13)\nParameters are updated iteratively by alternating these two steps\nuntil the convergence of LBMM .\nKernel mixture model (KMM). As we follow similar derivations\nfor obtaining MKv, we note only two differences regarding the defi-\nnition ofLKMM and the update of \u0398\u0434\nk\nLKMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvlogkv\u00d5\nk=1p\u0434\nkf\u0434(Hv,i|\u0398\u0434\nk) (14)\n(\u0398\u0434\nk)new=arg max\n\u0398\u0434\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvp\u0434(k|Hv,i)logf\u0434(Hv,i|\u0398\u0434)\nwhere f\u0434(Hv,i|\u0398\u0434)=\u00ce\ntj\u2208Hv,i\u00cd\ntz<tj\u0434(tj\u2212tz|\u0398\u0434). The\nway(\u0398\u0434\nk)newis solved depends on specific kernel functions. In\nour experiments, we solve this with a non-linear solver, Ipopt [ 46],\nwhere a power-law kernel function is employed.\nEqs. (9) and (14) have respectively linear and quadratic computa-\ntional complexity, however the EM algorithm allows an efficient\nimplementation of the dual mixture model. Detailed derivations of\nthe BMM and the KMM can be found in the online appendix [2].\nDetermining the number of components. Prior literature uses\na number of information criteria for choosing a component num-\nber of mixture models [ 12,32], including the Akaike informa-\ntion criteria (AIC). In our experiments, we employ AIC defined\nas2kv\u22122LBMM to select kvwith BMMs. Note that fitting BMM\nis computationally efficient \u2014 due to the analytical updates of the\nEM algorithm \u2014 which allows one to experiment various values\nforkv. In our experiments, the numbers of components kvgiven\nby AIC are generally between 2and5.\nCharacterizing items using the dual mixture model. We build\nitem-level quantifications based on the dual mixture model fitted\non all cascades relating to the given item. The diffusion embedding\nprovides a fixed length vector describing the information in the\ncomponents of BMM and KMM, while the content virality and\ninfluence decay provide single value summarizations of the two\nmixtures.\nA diffusion embedding constructed from the fitted mixture mod-\nelsMvis a vector of mixture component weights. Taking the power-\nlaw kernel function as an example, we build a diffusion embedding\nin two steps:\n\u2022Parameter discretization: we first discretize the continuous model\nparameters n\u2217,\u03b8andcby separating them into fixed number\nof quantile bins. Given BMMs learned from all observed online\nitems V, we obtain the value of the ith quantile qn\u2217\nifrom the\nweighted samples {(n\u2217\nj,pB\nj)|j\u2208{1, . . . , kv},\u2200v\u2208V}. We use\nthe algorithm provided in [ 25] to compute weighted quantiles.\nSimilarity, we get qc\ni,q\u03b8\nifrom the fitted KMMs.\n\u2022Weight aggregation: we then convert MBvinto a vector of weights\nfor an online item v,mmmn\u2217\nv=[mn\u2217\nv,1, . . .]Twhere each element\nis the sum of weights mB\nv,i=\u00cd\nqn\u2217\ni\u22121<n\u2217\nj\u2264qn\u2217\nipB\nj. Moreover, M\u0434\nv\ncan be encoded as mmmcv=[mc\nv,1, . . .]Tandmmm\u03b8v=[m\u03b8\nv,1, . . .]T.\nIn the end, three vectors ( mmmn\u2217\nv,mmmcv,mmm\u03b8v) are provided for each online\nitem as the diffusion embeddings and can be used with off-the-shelf\nsupervised or unsupervised tools.\nWe also compute the single value summarizations as: \u02c6n\u2217v=\u00cdkv\nk=1n\u2217\nkpB\nk,\u02c6cv=\u00cdkv\nk=1ckp\u0434\nk,\u02c6\u03b8v=\u00cdkv\nk=1\u03b8kp\u0434\nk. We denote \u02c6n\u2217vas\ncontent virality, and \u02c6\u03b8vas influence decay. These are two values of\ninterest showing how viral and how long the influence of an online\nitem stay in online discussions.\nDistance between diffusion embeddings. Given two items de-\nscribed by their respective diffusion embeddings (mmmn\u2217\n1,mmmc\n1,mmm\u03b8\n1)and\n(mmmn\u2217\n2,mmmc\n2,mmm\u03b8\n2), we seek to measure their distance D1,2. We note that\nthe position of elements in the embeddings represents quantiles\nat an increasing order, but common distance measures, such as\nthe Euclidean distance and the cosine distance, ignore such infor-\nmation. For example, given mmmn\u2217\n1=[1,0,0,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7],mmmn\u2217\n2=[0,1,0,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7]\nandmmmn\u2217\n3=[0,0,1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7],mmmn\u2217\n1is intuitively closer to mmmn\u2217\n2than to mmmn\u2217\n3\ninstead of equally close. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein\ndistance [ 3] which accounts for positional information. The Wasser-\nstein distance of order 1 for single dimensional histogram has a\nclosed-form solution defined as W1(MMMn\u2217\n1,MMMn\u2217\n2)=\u00cd\ni|Mn\u2217\n1,i\u2212Mn\u2217\n2,i|,\nwhere MMMn\u2217\n\u00b7=[\u00cd1\nj=1mmmn\u2217\n\u00b7,j,\u00cd2\nj=1mmmn\u2217\n\u00b7,j,\u00cd3\nj=1mmmn\u2217\n\u00b7,j,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7]represents the\ncumulative weights at increasing quantiles. We then define the\ndistance of the pair of diffusion embeddings as\nD1,2=W1(MMMn\u2217\n1,MMMn\u2217\n2)+W1(MMMc\n1,MMMc\n2)+W1(MMM\u03b8\n1,MMM\u03b8\n2) (15)\n6 PREDICTING THE FUTURE OF CASCADES\nIn this section, we show how fitted mixture models can be applied\nto future observations. We describe the evaluation of generalization\nperformance on holdout parts of unseen cascades. Next, we derive\npredictions of final popularities.\nModels for future content. We build mixture models for a newly\npublished item by combining historical fitted models of items V\u03c1\nfrom the same publisher \u03c1, i.e.,\nMB\n\u03c1=\u00d8\nv\u2208V\u03c1{(n\u2217\ni,pB\ni/|V\u03c1|),\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7} ,\u2200(n\u2217\ni,pB\ni)\u2208MB\nv (16)\nM\u0434\n\u03c1=\u00d8\nv\u2208V\u03c1{(\u0398\u0434\ni,p\u0434\ni/|V\u03c1|),\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7} ,\u2200(\u0398\u0434\ni,p\u0434\ni)\u2208MB\nv (17)andM\u03c1={MB\u03c1,M\u0434\n\u03c1}, assuming the new item follows the dynamics\nof its predecessors. Following Eq. (8), we obtain MH\u03c1from M\u03c1. In\nour experiments, we limit V\u03c1to the most recent published items.\nCascade holdout log-likelihood. When fitting a Hawkes process\non a cascadeHi(T)until an observation time T, the log-likelihood\nvalue of the holdout part of this cascade, i.e., HLL =L(\u0398|Hi)\u2212\nL(\u0398|Hi(T)), evaluates the model generalization performance to\nunseen events. For our proposed dual mixture model, we compute\nan expected holdout log-likelihood stemming from the posterior\nmodel probabilities given Hi(T), i.e.,\nE[HLL]=\u00d5\n(n\u2217\nk,\u0398\u0434\nj,pB\nkp\u0434\nj)\u2208MH\u03c1[L(\u0398|Hi)\u2212L( \u0398|Hi(T))]\u00d7\nP[n\u2217\nk,\u0398\u0434\nj|Hi(T)] (18)\nwhere we have: P[n\u2217\nk,\u0398\u0434\nj|Hi(T)]=P[Hi(T)|n\u2217\nk,\u0398\u0434\nj]pB\nkp\u0434\nj\u00cd\nMH\u03c1P[Hi(T)|n\u2217,\u0398\u0434]pBp\u0434\nCascade posterior size distribution. Given a pair of parame-\ntersn\u2217and\u0398\u0434, we are able to derive the posterior size distribu-\ntion givenHi(T)of a cascade i. The future events after time T\nare of two kinds: direct offspring of observed events (their count\ndenoted as Nd\ni) and indirect offspring (children of children, to-\ntal count denoted as Nind\ni). The process generating direct off-\nspring is an inhomogeneous Poisson process of conditional intensity\n\u03bb(t|Hi(T)),t>T\u2014 note that this is not a stochastic function as\nonly the history up to time Tis accounted in the intensity function.\nConsequently, Nd\nifollows a Poisson distribution of the intensity\n\u039bi(T|n\u2217,\u0398\u0434)=\u222b\u221e\nT\u03bb(\u03c4|Hi(T),n\u2217,\u0398\u0434)d\u03c4. Furthermore, each di-\nrect offspring initiated a Hawkes process and its total progeny\nnumber follows a Borel distribution. Given the number of direct\noffspring Nd\ni, the total number of direct and indirect offspring fol-\nlows a Borel-Tanner distribution (also known as the generalized\nBorel distribution) [ 24]:B(\u03ba|n\u2217,Nd\ni)=Nd\ni(\u03ban\u2217)\u03ba\u2212Nd\nie\u2212\u03ban\u2217\n\u03ba(\u03ba\u2212Nd\ni)!for\n\u03ba=Nd\ni,Nd\ni+1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. Its mean,Nd\ni\n1\u2212n\u2217, and variance,Nd\nin\u2217\n(1\u2212n\u2217)3, are\nsimilar to those of a Borel distribution.\nFinally, the posterior cascade size distribution is therefore\nP[Ni=n|Hi(T)]=Ni(T) (19)\n+n\u2212Ni(T)\u00d5\nz=0Poi(z|\u039bi(T|n\u2217,\u0398\u0434))B(n\u2212Ni(T)|n\u2217,z)\nwhere Poi(\u00b7|\u03bb)is the Poisson distribution given intensity \u03bb. Eq. (19)\nleads to a quadratic complexity in computing the final size dis-\ntribution, which is intractable in most real-life scenarios. A nu-\nmerical trick can be applied to reduce the complexity by introduc-\ning a threshold probability \u03f5pand summing until Poi(z|\u039bi(T|\nn\u2217,\u0398\u0434))<\u03f5p.\nOnline item popularity prediction. The final popularity of an\nonline item consists of two parts in prediction: the final popularities\nof current observed cascades and new cascades created in future.\nWe first use past average cascade counts of the publisher \u03c1as\nan estimation of the new cascades that will emerge in future, de-\nnoted as \u02c6C\u03c1. The final popularity of these is thus the mean of a\nBorel-Tanner distribution given \u02c6C\u03c1initial events, i.e.,\u02c6C\u03c1\n1\u2212n\u2217.

Section 7.1 introduces two Twitter\ndatasets used in this work and our experimental setup. Section 7.2\nanalyzes online items using fitted dual mixture models. In Sec-\ntion 7.3 we investigate the predictability of item category. Finally\nin Section 7.4, we evaluate model generalization and popularity\nprediction performances on unseen data.1\n7.1 Datasets\nWe conduct experiments on two large-scale retweet cascade datasets\nconcerning the spread of two types of online items on Twitter:\nYouTube videos ( ActiveRT2017 ) and news articles ( RNCNIX ). The\ncontent category and publisher information are given for each item.\nIn the remainder of this section, we also explain data collection,\npreprocessing and fitting steps.\nDatasets collection. The tweets of ActiveRT2017 and RNCNIX\nwere collected from Twitter public APIs. For ActiveRT2017 , during\n2017, tweets mentioning YouTube videos were obtained by query-\ning for YouTube video url handlers ( youtube.com andyoutu.be ) at\n1The code and dataset can be found at: https://bit.ly/3glRerXthe real-time streaming endpoint2. The video metadata was crawled\nusing a tool provided in [ 48] including video categories, titles, tex-\ntual descriptions and the YouTube channel information (i.e. the\npublisher of the video). We only keep active videos where a video\nis considered as active if it received at least 100tweets and 100\nshares within 120days [ 36]. The tweets of RNCNIX were collected\nby Digital Media Research Centre3. They retrospectively queried\nthe Twitter search endpoint4for tweets mentioning articles from a\nlist of controversial news publishers and a list of leading Australian\nnews outlets [ 9\u201311]. We enriched this dataset with the textual\ncontent of the news articles. For each article, we downloaded the\nwebpage and concatenated the content of the following HTML tags\n\u2014<title> ,<meta name=\u201cdescription\u201d> ,<meta name=\u201ckeyword\u201d> and\n<p>\u2014 that generally contain article titles, descriptions, keywords\nand main text bodies. Throughout this paper, we collectively denote\nYouTube videos (for ActiveRT2017 ) and news articles (for RNCNIX )\nasonline items . Similarly, YouTube channels ( ActiveRT2017 ) and\nnews media website domains ( RNCNIX ) are denoted as publishers .\nWe keep online items that have at least one cascade with at least\n50events. Note that this filtering is different from prior work as,\nfor selected items, we consider all of their cascades regardless of\ntheir event counts.\nOnline item category. YouTube video categories are provided in\nthe YouTube metadata. For RNCNIX , we construct two categories\n(RNIX and CNIX) based on the origin of the publisher: the Rep-\nutable News Index (RNIX) which contains Australian traditional\nnews media such as abc.net.au , and the Controversial News Index\n(CNIX) that regroups news sources that are known for producing\ncontroversial news articles (such as infowars.com andbreitbart.com ).\nTrain-test split. We perform a temporal split of each dataset into\ntwo subsets: the historical cascades and the test cascades. We intro-\nduce a one month gap between the two subsets to make sure that\nall cascades from the historical set are finished before the start of\nthe testing set (as discussed in Section 4). We show in the online\nappendix [ 2] that more than 99% of all cascades in our datasets\nfinish within 30 days. We use the cascades in the historical set to fit\nour dual mixture models, and to produce item-level quantifications.\nWe use the test set to evaluate model generalization and popularity\nprediction on unseen content. Table 1 presents a summary of the\nnumber of items, publishers, cascades and tweets in each dataset,\ntogether with the start and end time periods for the fit-test splits.\nProfiling fitted parameters on training set. We fit the dual mix-\nture model on all cascades relating to the same online item. The\nnumber of mixture components is selected by optimizing the AIC\nscore for BMM. The power-law kernel function is applied for the\n2https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview\n3https://research.qut.edu.au/dmrc/\n4https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview\n(a)ActiveRT2017-Fit\n(b)RNCNIX-Fit\nFigure 3: Density plots of content virality \u02c6n\u2217of BMMs and\ncontent influence decay \u02c6\u03b8of KMMs fitted on two datasets.\nMean and median are shown as red and blue dashed lines.\nKMM, as it is shown to outperform others in modeling online in-\nformation diffusion [ 37]. For each item vin each training dataset\n(ActiveRT2017-Fit andRNCNIX-Fit ), we obtain the fitted BMM and\nKMM parameters, as well as the item-level descriptions introduced\nin Section 5: \u02c6n\u2217v,\u02c6cv,\u02c6\u03b8v,mmmn\u2217\nv,mmmcvandmmm\u03b8v. We set the number of\nquantiles to 10for diffusion embeddings. Fig. 3 shows the parame-\nters distribution for the item virality \u02c6n\u2217(left column) and influence\ndecay \u02c6\u03b8(right column). We see that RNCNIX-Fit presents higher n\u2217\nvalues and higher \u03b8values than ActiveRT2017-Fit (visible in the dis-\ntributions as a whole and in the median values). This indicates that\nnews articles tend to be more viral than YouTube videos on Twitter,\nhowever they stay for shorter in people\u2019s collective memory. This\nis expected, given the fast paced nature of news. Due to space limi-\ntation, we also present in the online appendix [ 2] weighted density\nplots of fitted BMM and KMM parameters where distributions of\ndifferent mixture components are shown.\n7.2 Measurements of online items\nThe parameters of the dual mixture models characterize the online\nitems directly, given that the mixtures are trained on all cascades\npertaining to the same item. In this section, we explore the link\nbetween item categories and publishers, and the fitted dual mixture\nmodels.\nCategory-level overview. First, we investigate whether item cat-\negories can be distinguished using virality and influence decay of\ntheir corresponding items, by studying the relation between the\ndensity distributions of \u02c6n\u2217vand \u02c6\u03b8v. For RNCNIX-Fit (Fig. 4a), we\ndiscretize the range of values for \u02c6n\u2217into 10bins, and for each bin\nwe plot the three-point summaries ( 25th,75thpercentiles and me-\ndian) of \u02c6\u03b8values of online items in RNIX andCNIX . The marginal\ndensities of \u02c6n\u2217and \u02c6\u03b8are plotted on the sides of the main panel, and\nshow that articles from reputable news sources ( RNIX ) are more\nviral than those from controversial news sources ( CNIX ), while\nthe\u02c6\u03b8density is similar for the two sources. This appears to con-\ntradict common intuition, however the joint plot pictures a more\nnuanced story. For both RNIX andCNIX ,\u02c6\u03b8generally decreases as\n\u02c6n\u2217increases. However, for \u02c6n\u2217<0.25CNIX shows higher values of\n\u02c6\u03b8, while for \u02c6n\u2217>0.75CNIX has slower influence decay rates. In\nother words, low viral controversial articles are forgotten quickly,\nbut highly viral controversial articles are reshared in Twitter for\nlonger than the reputable articles.\n(a)RNCNIX-Fit\n(b)ActiveRT2017-Fit\nFigure 4: Quantify online items at the category level via\nthe aggregated model parameters, \u02c6n\u2217and \u02c6\u03b8of two datasets.\nFig.(a) RNIX and CNIX from RNCNIX-Fit : the median and\n25th/75thquantiles of \u02c6\u03b8(y axis) at varying \u02c6n\u2217values (x axis)\nare presented along with densities of \u02c6n\u2217and \u02c6\u03b8by sides. Fig.(b)\nFour popular YouTube video categories, Music ,Entertain-\nment ,Gaming and News & Politics from ActiveRT2017-Fit :\ndensity plots of \u02c6n\u2217and \u02c6\u03b8.\nFig. 4b shows the marginal densities of \u02c6n\u2217vand \u02c6\u03b8vfor four chosen\npopular YouTube video categories from ActiveRT2017-Fit . The joint\nplot is less readable than the one in Fig. 4a, and it can be found in the\nonline appendix [ 2]. We see that Gaming videos are substantially\nless viral than videos from other three categories, but these videos\nalso show slower influence decay, indicating that gamers consume\nsuch videos for longer after they were posted. We also observe that\nNews & Politics videos exhibit similar diffusion patterns as news\narticles, i.e., with high virality and fast decaying influence.\nExploring online item publishers. Here, we explore the usage\nof the diffusion embeddings to analyse the relation between content\nproducers. We construct mmmn\u2217\n\u03c1the embeddings for a publisher \u03c1by\naggregating the item embedding vectors ( mmmn\u2217\n\u03c1,mmmc\u03c1andmmm\u03b8\u03c1) for\nall online items associated with the \u03c1. Specifically, we compute\ntheir element-wise mean and we normalize the vectors to sum to 1,\ne.g.,m\u2032m\u2032m\u2032n\u2217\n\u03c1=[\u00cd\nv\u2208V\u03c1mmmn\u2217\nv,1/|V\u03c1|, . . .]Tandmmmn\u2217\n\u03c1,i=m\u2032m\u2032m\u2032n\u2217\n\u03c1,i/\u00cd\njm\u2032m\u2032m\u2032n\u2217\n\u03c1,j.\nWe compute the distance between two publishers \u03c11,\u03c12asD\u03c11,\u03c12\nfollowing Eq. (15). Finally, we use t-SNE [ 34] \u2014 a widely adopted\ntechnique for visualizing high dimensional data \u2014 to present the\nmost popular publishers in a latent two-dimensional space.\nIn Fig. 5, the top 30publishers with the most number of items\nof each category are shown for ActiveRT2017-Fit andRNCNIX-Fit .\nForActiveRT2017-Fit , as category is labeled at the item level, we\nconstruct publisher categories as the majority category for their\nitems. The bubble sizes of individual publishers are scaled by their\naverage \u02c6n\u2217over all published items. One conclusion emerges that,\nin general, publishers from the same category are also similar in\nterms of their diffusion patterns. In both figures, two major clusters\n(a)ActiveRT2017-Fit\n(b)RNCNIX-Fit\nFigure 5: Clustering of publishers with respect to the fitted\nmodel parameters. Top 30publishers with the most num-\nbers of produced online items in each category are cho-\nsen from ActiveRT2017-Fit (Entertainment ,Music ,Gaming ,\nNews & Politics ) and RNCNIX-Fit (RNIX ,CNIX ). Categories\nof YouTube publishers are determined by their mostly used\nvideo categories. The bubble size indicates the average \u02c6n\u2217of\na publisher. Names of 20publishers with high average \u02c6n\u2217val-\nues are presented.\nemerge. For ActiveRT2017-Fit (Fig. 5a) we observe Entertainment and\nGaming in one cluster, and Music andNews & Politics in the other.\nForRNCNIX-Fit (Fig. 5b), the RNIX and CNIX categories appear\nclearly separable. Fig. 5a also shows that Entertainment is a diverse\ncategory with its publishers sprinkled across the entire latent space.\nThis is due to Entertainement videos covering a broad range of\nsubjects, from people singing to online game recordings. Also, we\nidentify some viral YouTube publishers such as some K-pop music\nbands ( ARIRANG K-POP ,United CUBE ) and controversial news\nsources including breitbart.com from the plots. Another interesting\nobservation is that Fig. 5b groups similar controversial publishers\ntogether, e.g., those showing a strong level of spreading conspiracy\n(activistpost.com ,intellihub.com andyournewswire.com ) in the top-\nright corner and those having far-right bias in their political stands\n(breitbart.com ,rt.com andtwitchy.com ) in the bottom-right corner.5\nGiven the perceived separability of publisher category in Fig. 5,\nin the next section we setup a predictive exercise.\n7.3 Prediction of item categories\nIn this section, we build a predictor for item category based on\nitem resharing dynamics and textual content. We use three types of\nfeatures for online items: our proposed diffusion embeddings (see\n5Conspiracy levels and political stands can be found in https://mediabiasfactcheck.comTable 2: Results of categorical prediction of online items\nonActiveRT2017-Fit and RNCNIX-Fit .

Temporal features\nare shown by previous works to be useful in popularity prediction [ 5,\n14,37], but have not been experimented with in predicting content\ncategories. The text features are the natural choices for this task\nas they carry rich content information, particularly for the online\nnews articles.\nSpecifically, we build the three types of features as follows. Dif-\nfusion embeddings. We use our proposed diffusion embeddings,\ni.e., for a given online item vwe concatenate the vectors mmmn\u2217\nv,mmmcv\nandmmm\u03b8v.Temporal features. We compute the six-point summaries\n(min, mean, median, max, 25thand75thpercentile) of inter-arrival\ntimes, cascade sizes, cascade durations and number of followers of\nTwitter users involved in cascades. Text features. For each online\nitem, we first concatenate its metadata to a single string. This in-\ncludes video descriptions and video titles for ActiveRT2017-Fit , and\narticle titles, descriptions, keywords and body texts for RNCNIX-Fit .\nWe then use the state-of-the-art pre-trained multilingual text em-\nbedding model, BERT, to encode text features [ 18,47]. The model\nencodes at a token-level and generates a set of embeddings with\n768dimensions for each token. We then apply mean aggregations\nof these embeddings to create a single 768-dimension vector as the\nfinal text feature embedding for the item.\nThe experiments are conducted on items from the four categories\nofActiveRT2017-Fit and all items from RNCNIX-Fit . We perform a\n50%-50%train-test split and use the Gradient Boosting Machines\nas the predictor (via the GBMpackage in R [ 23]). The predictors\u2019\nhyper-parameters are selected via 5-fold cross validations. As both\ndatasets are imbalanced, we evaluate the prediction performance\nusing the Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient [45] and the macro-F1 score.\nWe test all the seven possible combinations of the three feature\nsets, and Table 2 reports the prediction scores. When individual\nfeature set is employed, the text features outperform both others due\nto the richer content information they contain. We also note that as\ngenerative models are often considered sub-optimal in prediction\n(a) Generalization performance\n (b) Item popularity prediction\nFigure 6: Forecasting for unseen content on ActiveRT2017-Test .

Times at x axis are the observation times since an online item was published.\nThe dots indicate the median values and error bars give the 25th/75thquantiles of the ARE values.\ntasks [ 37], the diffusion embeddings appear the least performing\nfeature types. However, when combined with other feature sets\nthey consistently provide a slight improvement of performance,\nindicating that they capture information not present in the textual\nor temporal features. The best predictor is the one trained using\nall feature sets and it achieves 0.831and 0.932of kappa values\nonActiveRT2017-Fit and RNCNIX-Fit , respectively. The result is\nparticularly interesting on RNCNIX-Fit , showing that the temporal\nfeatures (which are also designed to embed diffusion dynamics) are\ninformative features in predicting controversial news.\n7.4 Forecasting for unseen content\nHere, we examine the applications of dual mixture models for mod-\neling unseen diffusion cascades from ActiveRT2017-Test . The ob-\nservations are similar on RNCNIX-Test which are discussed in the\nonline appendix [2].\nGeneralization performance. Here, on individual cascades we\ncompare the holdout log-likelihood values of dual mixture models to\nsingle cascade fitting models [ 37] and to non-mixture joint models.\nThe dual mixture models and the non-mixture joint models are\nfitted using cascades from the same publisher. Given a cascade Hi\ndiscussing an online item v, we find the set of online items produced\nby thev\u2019s publisher, and we select all cascades relating to the 5\nmost recent items, denoted as C\u03c1. The dual mixture models are\nfitted on all cascades in C\u03c1. The holdout log-likelihood is computed\nvia Eq. (18). The single cascade models [ 37] use power-law Hawkes\nprocesses and fitted on Hi(T)\u2014 where Tis the maximum time the\ncascade is observed. Finally, the non-mixture joint model which is\nHawkes processes jointly fitted on all cascades in C\u03c1(as discussed\nin Section 4).\nFig. 6a shows the holdout negative log-likelihood values on\nActiveRT2017-Test as boxplots, trained on increasingly long obser-\nvation times T. For all observation times, the dual mixture models\nconsistently outperform single cascade trained models and non-\nmixture models. When comparing the single cascade trained models\nand the non-mixture joint models, despite the former has a better\nmean and median generalization values, we show in the online\nappendix [ 2] that it has more outliers than the latter. Finally, we\nobserve that the advantage of using jointly fitted models over single\ncascade models diminishes as the observations time increases, as\nthe latter observe more data to learn from.Prediction of final popularity. We compare the final popularity\npredictions on ActiveRT2017-Test with dual mixture models against\na predictor built using Seismic [54], an ensemble model in [ 29] and a\nregressor trained using temporal features. Seismic and the ensemble\nmodel predictions are produced by their provided R packages. Since\nboth models were designed to predict the final popularities of indi-\nvidual cascades, we build an item popularity predictor by following\nthe same steps as in Section 6 and using the predictions instead of\n\u02c6Nv,i(n\u2217,\u0398\u0434)in Eq. (20). We construct the regressor using the same\nsets of temporal features as Section 7.3 and the tuples (observa-\ntion times, online items) for the set of examples, and the item final\npopularity is the dependent variable to predict. We train a single\nregressor using the GBMpackage in R [ 23], and we obtain predic-\ntions for each tuple via 5-fold cross validation on ActiveRT2017-Fit .\nFinally, final popularity predictions of the dual mixture models are\ncomputed using Eq. (21) and at each observation time T. We note\nthat we re-fit the BMMs on cascades after the time Tin historical\ncascades to capture changes of content virality in time. We evaluate\nthe prediction results using the Absolute Relative Error (ARE) \u2014\nalso used in [ 54] and defined as|\u02c6Nv\u2212Nv|\nNvwhere \u02c6NvandNvare the\npredicted popularity and the actual final popularity.\nFig. 6b summarizes the prediction results, with the ARE values\nin log scale. As Seismic and the ensemble models do not provide\ncold-start predictions, only results for the dual mixture models\nand the regressor are presented at T=0observation time. We\nsee that both the dual mixture models and the temporal features\nregressor consistently outperform the other two baselines, Seismic\nand the ensemble model, up to the 18-hour observation time. Also,\nthe regressor slightly outperforms the dual-mixture model for short\nobservation times, after which the dual-mixture model delivers the\nbest predictive performances.\n8 CONCLUSION\nThis work is concerned with modeling and quantifying tempo-\nral dynamics of online items. We start from the observation that\nmaximum likelihood estimates for content virality and influence\ndecay are separable in a Hawkes process, which leads to a separated\nlearning procedure. Next, we propose a dual mixture self-exciting\nprocess, which leverages a Borel mixture model and a kernel mix-\nture model, to jointly model the unfolding of a heterogeneous set\nof cascades. When applied to cascades about the same online items,\nthe model directly characterizes the spread dynamics of online\nitems and supplies interpretable quantities as well as methods for\npredicting the final content popularities.\nLimitations and future work. Due to the restriction of the size\ndistribution of Hawkes processes, the current joint fitting is re-\nstricted to complete and unmarked processes. We plan to relax\nthese constraints to allow for joint modeling with more flexible\nforms of Hawkes processes.\nAcknowledgments.

Step (b) follows the assumption that T\u2192\u221e .\nA.2 The Borel Mixture Model\nAs the final cascade size distribution of Hawkes processes is only determined by the branching factor (Section 3), i.e. the Borel distribution, we are able\nto model sizes of a group of cascades as a Borel mixture model. Specifically, given a cluster number kv, we aim to find the parameter set as MBv=\n{(n\u2217\n1,pB\n1), . . . ,(n\u2217\nkv,pB\nkv)}. The parameters are estimated via the EM algorithm following [44]. The log likelihood function is\nLBMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvlogkv\u00d5\nk=1pB\nkB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk) (28)\nFor simplicity, let qB(k,Nv,i)=pB\nkB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk). We first introduce the probability of Nv,ibeing a member of kwhich is also the E-step in the algorithm:\npB(k|Nv,i)=qB(k,Nv,i)\n\u00cdkv\nj=1qB(j,Nv,i)(29)\nBy employing Jensen\u2019s inequality, we get\nLBMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvlogkv\u00d5\nk=1qB(k,Nv,i) (30)\n=\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvlogkv\u00d5\nk=1pB(k|Nv,i)qB(k,Nv,i)\npB(k|Nv,i)(31)\n\u2265\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvkv\u00d5\nk=1pB(k|Nv,i)logqB(k,Nv,i)\npB(k|Nv,i)(32)\nOptimizing Eq. (32) is equivalent to optimizing the following QBMM function\nQBMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvkv\u00d5\nk=1pB(k|Nv,i)logqB(k,Nv,i) (33)\nAt the Maximization step, the parameters are updated by maximizing QBMM .\n\u2022For updating n\u2217\nk, we take the derivative of QBMM w.r.t. n\u2217\nk\n\u2202QBMM\n\u2202n\u2217\nk=\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hv\u2202\u00cdkv\nk=1pB(k|Nv,i)logqB(k,Nv,i)\n\u2202n\u2217\nk(34)\n=\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208HvpB(k|Nv,i)\u2202logqB(k,Nv,i)\n\u2202n\u2217\nk(35)\n=\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208HvpB(k|Nv,i)\u2202\n\u2202n\u2217\nk\u0002\nlogpB\nkB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk)\u0003\n(36)\n=\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208HvpB(k|Nv,i)\u2202\n\u2202n\u2217\nklogB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk) (37)\n=\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208HvpB(k|Nv,i)\u2202\n\u2202n\u2217\nkB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk)\nB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk)(38)\nwe note that\u2202B(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk)\n\u2202n\u2217\nkhas a special solution\n\u2202B(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk)\n\u2202n\u2217\nk=\u2202\n\u2202n\u2217\nk\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0(Nv,in\u2217\nk)Nv,i\u22121e\u2212Nv,in\u2217\nk\nNv,i!\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb(39)\n=Nv,i(Nv,i\u22121)(Nv,in\u2217\nk)Nv,i\u22122e\u2212Nv,in\u2217\nk\u2212Nv,i(Nv,in\u2217\nk)Nv,i\u22121e\u2212Nv,in\u2217\nk\nNv,i!(40)\n=Nv,i\u22121\nn\u2217\nk(Nv,in\u2217\nk)Nv,i\u22121e\u2212Nv,in\u2217\nk\u2212Nv,i(Nv,in\u2217\nk)Nv,i\u22121e\u2212Nv,in\u2217\nk\nNv,i!(41)\n=Nv,i\u2212Nv,in\u2217\nk\u22121\nn\u2217\nkB(Nv,i|n\u2217\nk) (42)\nPlugging this result back to Eq.

The summation over Hvcan be\nthen replaced by this set for efficiency.\nA.3 The Kernel Mixture Model\nWe also define a mixture model for the kernel function \u0434(\u00b7)(KMM) based on its likelihood function of inter-arrival times of Hawkes processes. Similarly, for a\ncluster number kv, we denote the parameters as M\u0434\nv={(\u0398\u0434\n1,p\u0434\n1), . . . ,(\u0398\u0434\nkv,p\u0434\nkv)}. The log-likelihood function is\nLKMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvlogkv\u00d5\nk=1p\u0434\nkf\u0434(Hi|\u0398\u0434\nk) (47)\nwhere f\u0434(Hv,i|\u0398\u0434)=\u00ce\ntj\u2208Hv,i\u00cd\ntz<tj\u0434(tj\u2212tz|\u0398\u0434). The membership probability (E-step) is then\np\u0434(k|Hv,i)=p\u0434\nkf\u0434(Hv,i|\u0398\u0434\nk)\n\u00cdkv\nj=1p\u0434\njf\u0434(Hv,j|\u0398\u0434\nj)(48)\nThe function for learning parameters in EM algorithm is\nQKMM =\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvkv\u00d5\nk=1p\u0434(k|Hv,i)log(p\u0434\nkf\u0434(Hv,i|\u03b8\u0434\nk))=\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvkv\u00d5\nk=1p\u0434(k|Hv,i)logp\u0434\nk+\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvkv\u00d5\nk=1p\u0434(k|Hv,i)logf\u0434(Hv,i|\u0398\u0434\nk)(49)\nUpdating p\u0434\nkis the same as the procedure for BMM, i.e. (p\u0434\nk)news=\u00cd\nHv,i\u2208Hvp\u0434(k|Nv,i)\n|Hv|. Whereas, \u0398\u0434\nkis updated via\n(\u0398\u0434\nk)new=arg max\n\u0398\u0434\u00d5\nHv,i\u2208Hvp\u0434(k|Hv,i)logf\u0434(Hv,i|\u0398\u0434) (50)\nAs there is no analytical solution for the power-law kernel, we solve (\u0398\u0434\nk)newwith a non-linear solver, Ipopt [46].\nB ADDITIONAL RESULTS ON ACTIVERT2017 AND RNCNIX\nB.1 Inter-arrival times of cascades\nFig. 7 shows the complementary cumulative density function of the inter-arrival times of cascades from the two datasets. This shows that our assumption \u2014\ncascades that do not get new retweet for 30days are finished \u2014 accounts for more than 99%of cascades in our datasets.\nFigure 7: The complementary cumulative density function (CCDF) of the maximum inter-arrival time of cascades from Ac-\ntiveRT2017 andRNCNIX . The labeled points show the proportions of cascades with inter-arrival times larger than 30 days. The\nCCDF curves does not start at 1as maximum inter-arrival times for single-event cascades are considered 0thus being filtered\nduring the log transformation of x axis.\nB.2 Weighted density plots of n\u2217and\u03b8\nIn addition to Fig. 3, we show here weighted density plots of n\u2217and\u03b8of the fitted parameters on ActiveRT2017-Fit andRNCNIX-Fit , where the density weights\nrefer to the mixture components weights.\n(a)ActiveRT2017-Fit\n (b)RNCNIX-Fit\nFigure 8: Weighted density plots of content virality n\u2217of BMMs and content influence decay \u03b8of KMMs fitted on two datasets.\nB.3 Analysis of mixture models on explaining popular cascades and unpopular cascades\nIn this section, we first choose an online items with its fitted dual mixture model and then show the posterior mixture component assignments of individual\ncascades relating to this item. A YouTube video (ID: QvCj3wsXQDQ ) is chosen and the following figure shows cascades are assigned to 5different components.\nOverall, this figure shows that unpopular and popular cascades are modeled by different mixture components which reinforces the assumption that the\nproposed dual mixture model leverages the information from unpopular diffusion cascades.\nFigure 9: Posterior assignments to the fitted mixture components of cascades relating to a YouTube video (ID: QvCj3wsXQDQ ).\nEach dot is a diffusion cascade positioned by the final cascade size (x axis) and the total diffusion time (y axis). Each color\nrepresents a mixture component whose parameters are shown in the legends.\nB.4 Category-level measurement\nFig. 10 quantifies online items from ActiveRT2017-Fit at the category level in the same form as Fig. 4a.\nFigure 10: Quantify online items at the category level via the aggregated model parameters, \u02c6n\u2217and \u02c6\u03b8ofActiveRT2017-Fit .

In comparison, Fig. 5 depicts a better\nseparability as the diffusion embeddings are applied which encode more diverse item-level temporal information.\n(a)ActiveRT2017-Fit\n (b)RNCNIX-Fit\nFigure 11: Clustering of publishers with parameters fitted on all cascades related to all online items from a given publisher.\nB.6 Forecasting for unseen content\nWe present here the results on evaluating the generalization performance and the item popularity predictions on ActiveRT2017-Test andRNCNIX-Test . In\nFig. 13, we further split ActiveRT2017-Test into two parts based on cascade popularities to compare varying performances of different models. We observe from\nFig. 13a that on popular cascades, both mixture and non-mixture models outperform the benchmark [ 37] with similar percentages of failed cascades for all\nmodels. This indicates that joint fittings from historical cascades provide the most performance gain on popular cascades. However, in Fig. 13b, we note that\nthe proposed dual mixture model achieves the best negative holdout likelihood values among the three. Most notable, as much less events are available for\nlearning, much higher proportions of failed fits are shown for individual cascade fits [37].\n(a)ActiveRT2017-Test\n (b)RNCNIX-Test\nFigure 12: Negative holdout log-likelihood per event computed from the fitted non-mixture model, the dual mixture models\nand [37] on ActiveRT2017-Test andRNCNIX-Test given different observation times \u2014 lower is better.\n(a) On cascades with less than 50 events\n(b) On cascades with more than 50 events\nFigure 13: Negative holdout log-likelihood per event (left panels) and percentages of failed cascades (right panels) computed\nfrom the fitted non-mixture model, the dual mixture models and [37] on different subsets of ActiveRT2017-Test given different\nobservation times \u2014 lower is better.\n(a)ActiveRT2017-Test\n (b)RNCNIX-Test\nFigure 14: Newly published online item final popularity predictions of three models on ActiveRT2017-Test andRNCNIX-Test ,\nevaluated with Absolute Relative Error \u2014 lower is better.

Stemming from the emphasis on standards -based accountability are  the ideas of rapid school \nturnaround  and the state\u2019s role in this process (Peck & Reitzug, 2014; VanGronigen & Meyers, 2019). \nThe current study employed critical policy discourse analysis to examine the media\u2019s portrayal of the \n2019 determination to conti nue or terminate state control of the Little Rock School District. The \nanalysis highlights two argumentative frames \u2014one that emphasized neoliberal values in support of \ncontinued state control of the district and another that focused on systemic racism as  the basis for \nadvocating for local control of the district. These frames, along with their implications for future \nactions within the educational policy making process, guide the discussion. Our findings suggest \n\nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  2 \n \nsustained community and media participation  is needed to bring attention to education policy issues \nwhile underscoring the importance of taking a critical stance to assess media coverage.  \nKeywords : systemic racism; state takeover; critical policy discourse analysis  \n \nOfuscando racismo sist\u00e9mico: Un an\u00e1lisis cr\u00edtico del discurso pol\u00edtico de la \noperaci\u00f3n de ideas neoliberales en la representaci\u00f3n de los medios de \ncomunicaci\u00f3n sobre una adquisici\u00f3n estatal de un distrito escolar  \nResumen: Reforma educativa en los estados unidos  ha imprudentemente puesto  atenci\u00f3n \na los est\u00e1ndares y contabilidad al estado determinado por examines estandarizado s \n(Berliner & Biddle, 1995; Mehta, 2013).

According to the policy, \u201cany school or school \ndistrict on probationary status for failing to meet the standards for accreditation\u201d (Enforcement of \nStandards , 2012 , AR Code \u00a7 6 -15-207) was subject to  at least one action by the State Board of \nEducation. In LRSD\u2019s case, the state disbanded the locally elected school board and took control of \nthe city\u2019s largest district through its State Board of Education. By law, the mandate of state control is \nreexami ned at the five -year mark to make further determinations for the future of a school district.  \nAs this five -year deadline for LRSD approached near the end of 2019, Arkansas print media \nsources highlighted the policymakers involved, described their proposed  plans forward, and \npromoted discursive feedback that influenced the policy decision. A locally elected school board was \nreinstated in November 2020, and the district was released from the state -designated \u201cintensive \nsupport\u201d category in July 2021 (Millar,  2021). Notwithstanding, the state\u2019s fluctuation on the metrics \nfor release from intensive support, changes to the district during six years of state control, and \npassage of a new state law that bans public employees from collective bargaining (Millar, 202 1) \nprovide evidence that the policy decision was a compromise between those who wanted a return to \nlocal control and the state\u2019s hegemony.   \nIn this study, we critically examine media portrayal of education policy in Arkansas \nsurrounding a 2019 decision to continue or terminate state takeover using critical policy discourse \nanalysis (CPDA), a useful methodological framework that allowed us to consider policy in a \nrelational, constitutive, and context -specific way. Consequently, we have analyzed major print m edia \nsources that discuss and conceptualize the state takeover of LRSD for public stakeholders. In \nanalyzing these sources, we investigate our main research question: How did the media portray the issues, \nactors, and proposed solutions surrounding the 2019  decision to continue or terminate state control in the LRSD in \nArkansas? Our CPDA ultimately revealed two argumentative frames \u2014one entrenched in \nneoliberalism and the other rooted in the social reform movement \u2014both of which are broader \nsystemic ideologies , which reaffirm policy as a simultaneously constructive and reflective product of \nmultiple and sometimes contradicting discourses and beliefs (Blackmore, 2017). Given the results of \nthis study, we have determined that education policy decisions in Little Rock were part of a pattern \nof systemic racism, in this instance enacted through the neoliberal state takeover of the LRSD.  \nTo that end, we first situate the research in relation to broader education reforms and \nnarrow to the historical context of LRSD. W e then contextualize school turnaround efforts and the \nunderlying neoliberal agenda behind these efforts, connecting these broader turnaround movements \nto the LRSD takeover. We next establish CPDA as our methodological framework, discussing its \nsignificanc e to educational policy and media analyses. Employing CPDA, we explore how print \nmedia represented the deliberations and arguments surrounding the LRSD state takeover, pointing \nto two argumentative frames in the underlying subtext related to educational po licy. Finally, we \nconclude by pointing to the implications this study has for education policy, including the need for \ncritical literacy and continued advocacy for education reform.  \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  4 \n \nBackground  \nAfter the publication of A Nation at Risk  (1983), education po licy shifted toward capitalizing \non economic potential by instituting language that promoted standardization, including testing \nsystems that made schools and teachers narrowly accountable to deficit ideologies (Mehta, 2013). \nWithin this context of shifting  responsibilities, measurement, purpose, and goals of education, the \nscope of conflict within education policy expanded to include state legislators and business groups \n(Mason & Reckhow, 2017). No Child Left Behind and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) , \nwhich reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, codified state involvement in the \ncontext of these education reforms, specifying an endogenous problem representation (Bacchi, \n2009) which placed emphasis on the state\u2019s responsibilities in r apid school turnaround. Turnaround , \ndefined as the \u201crapid, significant improvement in the academic achievement of persistently low -\nachieving schools\u201d (Peck & Reitzug, 2014, p. 8), often incorporates paradoxical approaches (Peck & \nReitzug, 2014) , which include curricular and structural changes focused on standardized testing, test \nprep, and staff restructuring while ignoring \u201cthe pervasive effects of class, race, and funding \ndisparities on schools\u2019 potential to improve\u201d (Trujillo & Ren\u00e9e, 2012, p.  7).  \nCarpenter et al. (2014) expand on the ideas of education reform and turnaround in K -12 \neducation, describing a global movement toward specific neoliberal policy vocabularies that limit the \navailable policy solutions for problems in education. The inc lusion of these neoliberal policy \nvocabularies represents movement toward hegemonic control of the political process, where the \n\u201cpolitical apparatus and the shaping and instilling of supporting values\u201d (Gaventa, 1980, p. 58) and \nthe discourse surrounding p roblematization (Bacchi, 2012) become methods of ideological \nreinforcement. Following neoliberalism outcome -based measures (i.e., achievement tests) creates \nnarrow evaluations of efficacy within educational services and provides an assessment of school \nperformance and accountability to the community and government that dehumanizes students and \neducators and obscures systemic racial, socioeconomic, and social inequities that both students and \nschools face. Further, a neoliberal lens on student achievement ou tcomes creates a false narrative of \nfailure and deficit ideology that benefits private interests and promotes the commercialization of \nschool systems ( Endacott & Goering , 2015), facilitating colorblind racism that harms students of \ncolor by positioning the ir social, cultural, and linguistic identities as lying outside the realm of K -12 \nschools.  \nSystemic Racism in Neoliberalism  \nProcesses and institutions that have a disparate impact, or which \u201cadversely affect one group \nof people...more than another, even t hough the rules applied by employers, teachers, the \ngovernment, landlords etc. are prima facie neutral (i.e., neutral on their face)\u201d (Fandl, 2018, p. 484), \nare examples of systemic racism. As Feagin (2006) notes, \u201c systemic racism encompasses a broad \nrange  of racialized dimensions of [U.S.] society: the racist framing, racist ideology, stereotyped \nattitudes, racist emotions, discriminatory habits and actions, and extensive racist institutions \ndeveloped over centuries by whites\u201d (p. xii). Furthermore, resear ch that explores systemic racism \ninvestigates \u201cthe unjust, deeply institutionalized, ongoing intergenerational reproduction of whites\u2019 \nwealth, power, and privilege\u201d (Feagin, 2006, p. 4).  \nPrevious research on systemic racism in education has found that pol icy insiders use \ndifferent discursive strategies to explain educational inequity, with some viewing inequity as a result \nof structural inequity and others implementing a deficit discourse related to families and teachers \n(Bertrand et al., 2015). For exampl e, Berliner and Biddle (1995) and Gillborn (2018) call into \nquestion the practice of assessing schools on performance since achievement as measured by \nstandardized tests correlates with socioeconomic status and race. Critical race theorists (e.g., Wright \nObfuscating  systemic racism   5 \n \net al., 2018) have also studied \u201cracism as both a structural characteristic of educational systems and \nan individual element\u201d (Gillborn, 2018, p. 67), in which changes and advances are made and \ncountered cyclically. Wright and colleagues (2018), for example , analyzed the implementation of \ndiscipline following Public Act 4 and argued the law was applied in a racialized pattern to majority \nBlack urban school districts. Additional case studies (e.g., Bowman, 2013; Mason & Reckhow, 2017) \ncontextualize education reforms, pointing to the historical development of racially disparate systems. \nMason and Reckhow (2017) argued that connections to local political networks are necessary for \nsustainability of education reforms in their comparative case study school turnaro und efforts in \nDetroit and Memphis, connecting the two cases through historical and political similarities in racial \nsegregation and inequality. Bowman (2013) also used Michigan as a case in her argument that \nchanges to the role of education manager worked  to exclude local actors in education policy. These \nstudies point to education reform as a racial project, defined by Omi and Winant (2015) as \n\u201csimultaneously an interpretation, representation, or explanation of racial identities and meanings, and an effor t to \norganize and distribute resources (economic, political, cultural) along particular racial lines \u201d (emphasis in original, \np. 125). A racial project can be described as racist \u201cif it creates or reproduces structures of domination based on \nracial signific ations and identities\u201d (emphasis in original, Omi & Winant, 2015, p. 128). Education \nreforms that promote private sector involvement, school choice, accountability, and performativity \nalign with neoliberalism (Brathwaite, 2017; Carpenter et al, 2014; Lipma n, 2011). Neoliberalism, in \nturn, \u201chas set in motion new forms of state -assisted economic, social, and spatial inequality, \nmarginality, exclusion, and punishment\u201d (Lipman, 2011, p. 220). The enactment of neoliberal \neducation reforms operates covertly as a racist racial project (Omi & Winant, 2015) to perpetuate \nexisting racial, socioeconomic, and other socially constructed inequalities. For example, standardized \ntests do not \u2014at face value \u2014appear to have racist motivations behind them, but in reality and in \npractice, they are used by policymakers to further segregate schools through tools like school \ngrading policies ( Endacott & Goering , 2015). Within this study, we set out to analyze how the media \ndescribed, supported, and challenged these behind -the-scenes machinations in the case of Little \nRock.  \nHistory of Education in Little Rock  \nIn 1957, then -Governor of Arkansas Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard \nto block nine Black1 students from entering Central High School in Little Rock. These students, \nknown as the Little Rock Nine, eventually were allowed to attend the school after federal \nintervention. The Little Rock crisis was one focal event within the broader context of int egration. A \nrelationship existed between the actions of various local and state constituencies and the speeches \nand actions of the political elite in the Massive Resistance segregation movement (Baer, 2008). This \nsustained a sociocultural context within wh ich de facto segregation could continue. For example, Kirk \n(2005) chronicled the accumulation of segregationist actions of the Little Rock Housing Authority \nand the Little Rock School District throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s as one that marked \n\u201ccert ain parts of the city as \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018white\u2019 [and] paved the way for the de facto segregation of \nnumerous other facilities\u201d (p. 279). For example, a separate high school was created for Black \nstudents living in the city. Although the school was within the c ity limits, the state categorized it as \npart of a rural school district, so it was inadequately funded (Kirk, 2005).  \n                                                             \n1 Following Clement (2018) who echoed Tour\u00e9\u2019s suggestion, we have capitalized Black and not white \nthroughout this text because Black represents a distinct group of people who are unable to trace their lineage \nto a specific nation due to familial and nationa l disruptions of slavery. In quotations, we have kept the \ncapitalization of each word as it was originally published.  \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  6 \n \nLitigation challenging the implementation and results of desegregation measures and \ndisparate funding continued from the 1980s (Woods & De ere, 1991) into the 2010s. In addition to \npointing to disparate funding, cases such as 1984\u2019s Little Rock School District, et al. v. Pulaski County \nSpecial School District, et al.,  found evidence of segregation because the school district population was \n70% Black, while the population of Little Rock was around 65 % white (Jordan, 2017). The Little \nRock school board was majority white until 2006 (Clement, 2018). While some court cases and other \nsmall steps toward integration succeeded, decades of trouble surr ounding integration and adequate \nfunding have plagued Little Rock Schools. This reflects broader national trends that reinforce \nstructural barriers to integration and economic equality (Rotberg, 2020). These challenges persist \nthroughout larger, national m ovements of education reform.  \nMethods  \nCombined, we234 have over 40 years of experience across elementary, secondary, and higher -\ned settings, including firsthand experience as educators in Arkansas. We are white, middle -class \neducators who are interested in  making visible the invisible spaces created by the dynamics of state \nand local conflicts over control within certain school districts that highlight inequities within these \n\u201cunmarked spaces\u201d (Brekhus, 1998, p. 44).  \nTogether, we conceptualized this study o f LRSD to critically examine the impacts of \ndiscursive argumentation in the media as a harbinger for education policy decisions in Arkansas and \nbeyond specifically as a part of a broader patterning of systemic racism consistent with neoliberal \neducation re form in the United States. We employed CPDA to look further into the 2019 decision \nto continue or terminate state control of the LRSD and how that issue was portrayed in the media. \nUndoubtedly, our own negative experiences and observations within the neoli beral structures of our \nK-12 classrooms affected the decision to apply CPDA to consider the role of media in their explicit \nand implicit support of neoliberal policy implementation. We see the effect of neoliberal lenses on \neducation as a problematic trend  that adversely affects BIPOC5 students within public school \ndistricts, especially those districts that face state takeover initiatives. This study used CPDA to \n                                                             \n2 Trish A. Lopez taught kindergarten, second, third, and fifth grade from 2011 to 2018 and 2021 to present in \ntwo large districts in the s tate. During this timeframe, the state used three separate standardized assessments \nas the basis for determining school grades. Seeing the work families, teachers, and students put forth toward \nthe success of each student to then have a student or school l abeled as failing to meet standards through an \never-changing assessment system is frustrating.  \n3 Holly Sheppard Riesco taught English language arts at the secondary level in Arkansas for 15 years and \nrecently moved to a doctoral program in Curriculum and Instruction. During her career in secondary \neducation, she witnessed trends that focused on deficit thinking in literacy through standardized testing. \nTroubling to her was how these tests classified students, parents, teachers, schools, and communities as \nfailing, rather than as merely one instrument or tool for improving schools. She noted how the testing culture \ninfluenced curriculum and instruction that often had educators teach to the test to remove the label of failing \nfrom schools. Realizing decision makers often view schools through deficit lenses, she began a doctoral \nprogram in hopes of impacting literacy policy and teaching in future teachers of English language arts.  \n4 Christian Z. Goering taught in the K -12 system in a different state prior to t aking an Arkansas -based role \npreparing future middle and high school English teachers and mentoring doctoral students on their journeys \nin curriculum and instruction and through an interdisciplinary public policy program. Born out of frustration \nwith erodi ng conditions for innovative teaching and authentic learning in K -12 schools, they added a \nsecondary research agenda on K -12 education policy.  \n5 Black, Indigenous, and People of Color  \nObfuscating  systemic racism   7 \n \nexamine the research question, How did the media portray the issues, actors, and proposed solut ions surrounding \nthe 2019 decision to continue or terminate state control in the LRSD in Arkansas?  \nMethodological Framework  \nBecause neoliberal education reforms operate covertly (Carpenter et al., 2014), we employed \na critical stance that allowed for consideration of the historical, contextual, and institutional factors \nat play within the media. The context around LRSD led us to adopt a stance that allowed for the \nevaluation of how dominant media discourses influenced the decision -making process. Using  a \ncritical theoretical framework allowed us to take a stance centered on increasing consciousness about \ninjustices, identifying the \u201chistorical, social, cultural, political, ideological, and value -centered\u201d (New \nLondon Group, 1996, p. 86) sources of inequ alities and injustices, and tackling the issue of who has \npower and how that power is maintained (Patton, 2014). For these levels of analysis, CPDA \nprovided a methodological framework consistent with a critical stance that allowed us to study how \nthe compl exities of educational reform movements were promoted or negated by the media in \nbrokering policy reform (Yanovitzky & Weber, 2019).   \n CPDA bridges critical discourse analysis (CDA) with critical policy studies, engendering an \nenriched \u201canalysis of policy discourse\u201d (Farrelly et al., 2019, p. 264). Like discourse analysis, CPDA \noffers a method for analyzing the effects of discourse to text (Farrelly et al., 2019), which \u201cprovides \na general framework to problem -oriented social research\u201d (Wodak, 2008, p. 2). As Wodak (2008) \nexplains, the general framework of discourse analysis recognizes interdisciplinarity, employs \nintertextual and interdiscursive relationships, incorporates the history and archaeology of an \norganization, and considers the context of a situat ion (Wodak, 2008). CPDA uses theoretical and \nmethodological contributions from CDA as a guide for engaging in critical policy studies, allowing \nfor a focus on social power and power relations (Farrelly et al., 2019). While researchers who use \nCDA may exami ne policy texts, these more linguistically focused studies remain somewhat siloed \nfrom social and political approaches (Van Dijk, 2015). CPDA attempts to connect these silos by \nbringing epistemological, ontological, and normative perspectives from critical  policy studies to \nCDA to enrich the analysis (Mulderrig et al., 2019). CPDA supports a relational analysis of policy, \nwhich examines the role and context of discourse, and it \u201cencourages analysis of the connection \nbetween policy and power\u201d (Farrelly et al ., 2019, p. 264). Furthermore, CPDA provides a framework \nthat analyzes the discourses of the policy process within the context in which they occurred; in other \nwords, discursive practices form a part of the process which also shapes the structure of future  \ndiscourse (Mulderrig et al., 2019). As such, CPDA provides a framework for normative and \nexplanatory critique focused on the context of how a policy developed, a distinguishing feature of the \napproach from CDA. Through the use of policy discourse as a med ium for analysis, CPDA focuses \non the relational, constitutive, context -specific, and power -laden issues and properties of policy \n(Farrelly et al., 2019). The approach\u2019s focus on argumentation, in particular, meets a call for new \ndirections of policy analy sis such as a focus on knowledge development through argumentation \n(Fischer, 2007) while converging with concerns typically associated with policy studies such as the \nprocess of deliberation as an applied practice (Fischer & Gottweis, 2013), concentration on framing \nand the implementation of causal stories (Stone, 1997), and issues of agenda access and denial (Cobb \n& Ross, 1997; Gilens & Page, 2014) as evidenced through discourse patterns that include certain \nideologies and actors while excluding others.  \n In the context of control of LRSD, CPDA allowed for an examination of the actors, the \nissue, and the proposed solutions while considering the history of education in Little Rock and the \ncontemporaneous education reform movements to examine the discourse pro mulgated within and \nacross media sources. As media simultaneously describes and promotes ideological hegemony, this \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  8 \n \nstudy focused on deliberation present in media sources as the genre (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2012). \nSince media acts as a brokering agent t hat connects the multiple actors in policy ecosystems \n(Yanovitzky & Weber, 2019), CPDA provided a method for examining the relationship between \nsocial structures, practices, and events described in the media , as well as the argumentative frames \ndescribed a nd developed within them (Chouliaraki & Fairclough, 1999, as cited in Fairclough & \nFairclough, 2012; Poutanen, 2019).  Within the framework of CPDA, the media investigation turned \nspecific attention to both the historical and contemporaneous contexts of th e issues of race, class, \nand the interposition of levels of government. Following Poutanen (2019) and Fairclough and \nFairclough (2012), the focus on argumentative discourse analysis offers a framework for \nunderstanding the competing argumentative structure s.  \nIn the media, \u201cpowerful and persuasive frames resonate with powerful arguments\u201d \n(Poutanen, 2019, p. 126), but these persuasive frames should not be seen as factual in and of \nthemselves. Instead, they are representative of larger assumptions and underly ing connections to \nspecific arguments surrounding education. By analyzing the assumptions upon which the media \npresents its arguments about education, and in this specific case about the LRSD takeover, the \nresearch question creates an opportunity for a mor e complex look into the media portrayal of \neducation reform through district takeovers. Further, analysis of media portrayal of the LRSD \ntakeover supports additional understandings about how the media mirrors societal assumptions \nabout education. Focusing analysis on the argumentative discourse allows for an examination of how \nmedia, and the actors quoted within the media articles: (1) provided information to support the \narguments; (2) critically reflected on other potential framing options; and (3) gave op portunity for \nargumentation by representing different voices and perspectives (Poutanen, 2019). Furthermore, \ncritical analysis of media offers \u201ca principled way of criticizing powerful arguments that are not \neasily challenged, arguments that draw on domina nt discourses and ideologies,\u201d which paint the \nopposing argumentative frame \u201cas being grounded in unreasonable and rationally indefensible values \nand goals\u201d (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2012, p. 81). Guided by the historical and contemporaneous \nissues at play  in LRSD, argumentative frames that aligned with these dominant and dominant -\nopposed discourses emerged in the analysis.  \nData Collection  \nTo build the corpus of analyzed texts, we employed a \u201ctop -down approach\u201d of selecting \ntexts \u201cfrom the \u2018universe of poss ible texts\u2019\u201d (Mautner, 2008, p. 36). The goal of the search and \nselection of texts was to establish a body of text as a \u201cscientific object\u201d (Montesano Montessori, \n2019, p. 40) that could provide data suitable to answering the research question (Mautner, 20 08). In \ninitial searches in the database Nexis Uni for the dates January 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020, we \ncombined the terms and Boolean operators \u201cLittle Rock,\u201d \u201cLittle Rock School District,\u201d \u201cSchool*,\u201d \n\u201ctakeover,\u201d \u201cstate takeover,\u201d \u201cstate control,\u201d and \u201c school choice\u201d for various results that ranged \nfrom 91 to 1,329 news articles. These search terms were informed by other case studies of state -\ndriven reforms in education (i.e., Mason & Reckhow, 2017) and our understanding of neoliberal \npolicy vocabularies  (Carpenter et al., 2014). Comparing the results between the various searches, \n\u201cLittle Rock School District\u201d and \u201cState Board\u201d provided the most accurate news stories related to \nthe research question of how the media portrayed the events regarding control of the school district. \nWe analyzed the initial search result to eliminate duplicate results, leading to a total of 168 articles \nfor analysis from this search. To analyze additional sources, we conducted the same search of \u201cLittle \nRock School District\u201d and  \u201cState Board\u201d on the Arkansas Democrat -Gazette . This search resulted in \n104 news items. Both searches resulted in a corpus of 272 articles. We selected the time frame to \nallow for analysis of coverage of the issue before the five -year deadline approached.  In 2019, the \nObfuscating  systemic racism   9 \n \ndecision regarding control of the LRSD quickly approached a five -year time limit of state control \nthat originally began in 2015.  \nMost news articles came from Arkansas Times and Arkansas Democrat -Gazette  (Table 1). Both \nnews sources rank \u201chigh \u201d for factual reporting according to Media Bias/Fact Check (Van Zandt, \n2020). The Arkansas Democrat -Gazette is rated \u201cright -center biased\u201d (Van Zandt, 2020) because many \nof the editorials favor right -leaning positions. The Arkansas Times , on the other hand , is rated \u201cleft -\ncenter biased\u201d because editorial and news reporting favor left -leaning positions (Van Zandt, 2019). \nIn addition to these two main sources, several articles came from TalkBusiness.net , a website focused \non business, political, and cultural news in Arkansas. We aggregated and analyzed the 272 news \narticles from both the Nexis Uni and Arkansas Democrat -Gazette  search and conducted our analysis \nusing Dedoose computer -assisted qualitative data analysis software. These data provided the basis of \nthe material for CPDA.  \nTable 1  \nNews Articles by Source \nSource  Number of news articles  \nArkansas Democrat Gazette  104 \nArkansas Times  134 \nTalkBusiness.Net  12 \nThe Associated Press State & Local Wire  3 \nU.S. News & World Report  9 \nOther  10 \nTotal  272 \nData  Analysis  \nConsistent with CPDA, we employed a two -step, iterative research design (Farrelly et al., \n2019). In the first step, we analyzed texts using inductive open coding which provided the basis for \nthe development of axial codes (Creswell & Poth, 2018, p. 166). The unit of analysis for this code \nwas an excerpt from within an article that had enough information to stand alone or make meaning \nby itself. To provide consistency in coding among the researchers, we developed a codebook after \ninitial analysis o f 30 articles with the code, a definition of the code, and excerpts that served as \nexamples (Table 2). Through weekly debriefing meetings among the researchers, we conducted \nconstant comparison (Kenny & Fourie, 2015) among the codes and between the codes a nd new \nreading. In other words, while the initial codes were used as a guide, inductive processes were \nfollowed to further refine, defin e, and add  codes throughout the first coding process as more text \nwas read and analyzed. For example, the initial code race was further refined with the addition of the \nchild codes covert and overt to distinguish whether issues that disproportionately impacted different \nracial groups (covert) or race directly (overt) were mentioned in the media article (see Table 2). As an \nadditional measure of reliability, we selected 10 % of the articles using a random number generator \nfor a second code. The second coder read the article noting points of disagreement with the first \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  10 \n \ncoder, in which instance a third coder would review the article. In the 30 articles randomly selected, \nfirst coders identified 84 relevant excerpts. Second coders agreed with the coded excerpts of the first \ncoder and identified 15 additional excerpts to code.  \n \nTable 2  \n \nSelected Examples from the Codebook  \nCode  Definition  Excerpt  Media \nSource  \nLocal \ncontrol  Includes term \u201clocally \nelected school board,\u201d \nreference to return of local \ncontrol  \u201cIt would have relinquished control of \nthe best schools in Little Rock --those \nconcentrated in the north and west parts \nof the  city that have the highest \nenrollment of white students, allowing \nthem to be run by a locally elected school \nboard.\u201d (Camera, 2019a)  U.S. News \n& World \nReport  \n \n \n \u201cWith the locally elected school board, \nwill there be respect between what you \nguys decide and what you allow it to do?\u201d \n(Camera, 2019b)  U.S. News \n& World \nReport  \nRace Specific delineation of the \nrace of students, or how \nstudents of different races \nwere likely to be affected \ndifferently.

In debriefing, this conversation highlighted the \npresence of neoliberalism and systemic racism through a large portion of the data set, as well as \nexamples of a multifaceted understanding of those terms such as issues of state and local control. \nThe second round of analysis, therefore, used this deductive lens. While these overar ching frames \nguided analysis, the researchers kept an open mind to new findings in this second analysis.  \n In the second round, we read together all excerpts under a given code to provide an \nunderstanding of the \u201carguments that were most visible and persis tent\u201d throughout the entire body \nof text (Poutanen, 2019). In addition, we focused our attention on selecting excerpts for close \nanalysis. \u201cMoving from analysis of a large set of texts to close analysis of individual texts\u201d (Vaara, \n2014, p. 504) allows for  an investigation of characteristic patterns in media discourses. The \nmovement from large to small bodies of text is consistent with CPDA\u2019s focus on the interaction of \ndiscourse and power. While not predetermined, we then grounded the general frames genera ted by \nthe discourse analysis \u2014neoliberal ideologies and systemic racism \u2014in the literature.  \n We selected excerpts for this close analysis, defined as a quote from within an article that \nhad sufficient information to hold meaning on its own, based on the ex tent to which they: (1) \nrepresented the corpus of excerpts with that code; (2) provided argumentation toward one of the \ngeneral frames; (3) explained an underlying rationale within a frame; and (4) proffered sufficient \ndetail and contextualization for addi tional analysis. In analyzing these selected texts, we gave \nattention to the argumentative components within each frame. The argumentative components for \nthe two frames are provided in the appendix. The components within each frame included the claim \nor so lution that was proposed, the goal and values which expound the underlying aims and beliefs of \nthe argument , the means -goal or course of action proposed to achieve the solution, and circumstances  \nwhich include the external societal or institutional factors  that either provide or limit available \ncourses of action to a given actor (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2012; Poutanen, 2019). Considering \nthese argumentative components elucidates how the frames were implemented by various actors to \nproblematize the situatio n, which in turn has implications for the possible solutions each group \nproffered (Bacchi, 2009). In addition, we considered the alternative options  or counterclaims to a given \nframe as well as the extent to which the argument addressed alternative options  (Fairclough & \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  12 \n \nFairclough, 2012; Poutanen, 2019). Finally, we analyzed the given actors associated with each frame in \nthe media discourse (Farrelly, 2019).  \nFindings  \nAs the deadline for the five -year state control of the LRSD approached, news articles \nsurrounding LRSD and \u201cState Board\u201d increased (Figure 1). In the first seven months of 2019, the \nnumber of news articles published related to the two terms ranged from 1 to 12 per month. As the \n2019-2020 school year began, however, the number of articles pu blished increased, reaching as high \nas 65 published articles in October.  \nFigure 1  \nNumber of Articles Published by Month  \n \n \n This increase in published articles illustrated a reciprocal relationship between the media and \npolicy, where interest in an issue in one realm is supported and reinforced by the other \n(Baumgartner & Jones, 2009). The 2020  deadline from the 2015 implementation of the policy \nprovided a focal point for both political and media sources and guided discourse around the issue.  \nThe Emergence  of Two Argumentative Frames  \nAccording to the 2015 policy, the state\u2019s control of LRSD would end if the district met exit \ncriteria, based largely on the ratings schools received from a state framework that heavily relies on \nstudents\u2019 scores on an achieveme nt test. Mirroring this policy, media coverage in 2019 reported \nscores from this achievement test from the schools in LRSD, fulfilling their role as brokering agents \nto policy ecosystems through public discourse and information (Yanovitzky & Weber, 2019). In the \nmedia outlets that focused on the state\u2019s control of LRSD, the media mirrored \u201cframes already \npresent in public discourse\u201d (Poutanen, 2019, p. 126), which confirmed the analysis and reflected \nprevious discourses. These frames within the media, in fa ct, reflected the opposing values and goals \nin education that are centered in policy reform movements (Giroux, 2014).  010203040506070\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun JulAug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb\n2019 2020\nObfuscating  systemic racism   13 \n \nOne argumentation frame represented a hegemonic, neoliberal, continuation of state control. \nExcerpts within this frame echoed the concepts  of accountability, the state\u2019s responsibility in \neducation policy, and performativity. For example, in discussing schools\u2019 scores on achievement \ntests, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette  (Howell, 2019) reported:  \nWithin the district, the results at the schools varied widely. Better than 79% of \nthird -graders and 83% of fourth -graders at Forest Park Elementary achieved at the \nready and exceeds -ready levels on the reading tests. But at Baseline Elementary, no \npercentage of third -graders scored at ready levels in re ading, and 15.63% of fourth -\ngraders and 17.02% of fifth -graders attained ready scores. At McClellan High, one \nof the eight F -graded schools, fewer than 9% of ninth - and 10th -graders scored at \nthe desired levels in reading, compared with fewer than 7% at Ha ll High, another F -\ngraded school. At J.A. Fair, no more than 9.74% of ninth - and 10th -graders hit the \nready mark in reading. At Central High, about 44% of ninth -graders and about 35% \nof 10th -graders scored at ready or better levels. At Parkview Magnet High , 39% of \nninth -graders and 36% of 10th -graders did the same.  \nBy focusing on achievement test scores, the argument claimed  that schools failed to meet standards \nfor student achievement. It begins by framing \u201cthe results\u201d as the actor, taking a non -personal \nstance. It then emphasizes the scores of the students by naming \u201cthird -graders\u201d and \u201cfourth -\ngraders.\u201d This emphasis moves the responsibility of the so -called failure onto the students, \nalleviating the state of guilt in the process. At the same time, this a rgumentative frame suggests it \nwas the state\u2019s obligation to support \u201cfailing\u201d schools, and the designation of failing is largely \ndefined by the school\u2019s standardized test scores and attendance rates. The use of percentages of \nstudents scoring at proficien t level on achievement tests serves to represent the problem as student \nachievement, contributing to a problematization (Bacchi, 2009) in which specific policies related to \nschools, curriculum, and expected proficiency levels are used as a metric. Addition ally, the article \nlists the schools individually, presenting the information in a way that is difficult to understand and \nmakes it easy to lose sight of which schools are which, obfuscating correlations of achievement, race, \nand class. For example, Forest Park elementary, the only school with which the article uses the verb \n\u201cachieved,\u201d was 74.5% white for the 2019 -2020 school year and had 19% of students identified as \nlow income (Arkansas Department of Education, 2020). Finally, by reporting the schools in this \nseparate way, the reader is forced to compare the schools, echoing the concept of school choice and \nmarket competition which neoliberalism supports as a method for school improvement \n(Underwood & Mead, 2012).  \n In comparison, the opposing frame from Arkansas Times (Millar, 2019b) separates students \nfrom failure and groups the schools:  \nThree of Little Rock\u2019s five high schools remain on the list: J.A. Fair, Hall and \nMcClellan. So, too, does Washington Elementary. Newly in the group are Henderson \nMiddle Sc hool and three elementary schools \u2014 Baseline, Meadowcliff and Watson. \nAside from Hall and Henderson, all of those schools are located south of Interstate \n630 in neighborhoods, and all the schools have high concentrations of blacks and/or \nLatinos living in poverty.  \nWhat stands out in comparison to the first quote is that this one does not use the student -focused \naction words. For example, the use of the word \u201cremain\u201d to describe the schools separates the \nfailure from the students and positions it as an actio n of the state by emphasizing the state -created \nlist. This frame also makes the claim that systemic racism is observable, stating \u201call the schools [on \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  14 \n \nthe list of failing schools] have high concentrations of blacks and/or Latinos living in poverty\u201d \n(Millar , 2019b). This quote illustrates the argumentation present in the frame that served as a \ncounterargument to the neoliberal, state control frame. In general, this opposing frame claimed that \nsocial reform was necessary at the local level to combat systemic racism, and the history of Little \nRock is still relevant in current events. In addition, proponents of this frame highlight the capability \nand importance of local community members\u2019 inclusion in district decisions. For example, at a state \nBoard of Educatio n meeting district parents Ali Noland and Julia Taylor:  \n...pointed out that the Little Rock district community is highly engaged in the school \ndistrict operations and ready to take back the operation of the district. Noland said \nthe Education Board can't take credit for the positives in the district without also \naccepting responsibility for ongoing problems. (Howell, 2019)  \nThis frame emphasized the need for a return to local control and decision -making. The components \nof both argumentative frames are summ arized in the Appendix.  \nDiscourse Between the Frames  \nIn response to this opposing frame, the governor first attempted to address alternative options \nusing a strategy of agenda denial (Cobb & Ross, 1997). The excerpts we have included in this section \nillustrate how language and arguments were used within each respective frame. For example, in this \nexcerpt, the focus is first on the opposing frame\u2019s concept of local control, and how the state board \nframework supported it. Then, the quote from the govern or demonstrates his refutation of the \nproblem as proposed by the opposing frame:  \nHutchinson praised the board \u2019s framework because it would restore some local \ncontrol to a majority of the schools in the 23,000 -student district. He said the \nframework wasn't based on geography but on school performance. \u201cI absolutely \nreject the proposition that this is a resegregation of the Little Rock School District, \u201d \nhe said during a Monday morning meeting with reporters. \u201cThat is wrong. It is not \nbased in fact, and it is really trying to resurrect old history that has no application to \ntoday. \u201d (Field, 2019)  \nBy couching praise for the board\u2019s framework in vague language like \u201csome\u201d and \u201cmajority,\u201d \nHutchinson omits that following the framework would allow those schools with high populations of \nstudents belonging to low -income households to continue to receive state control. Class and race are \nomitted as he centers this argument on the framework of school performance, positioning the \nresults from school performance as objectiv e \u201cfact\u201d while ignoring the correlation between school \nperformance, class, and race. Using the term \u201cabsolutely reject\u201d further distances the argument from \nthe nuance of both the contemporaneous and historical context within which the media discussed \nthese  policy options. While new strategies have promoted de facto  segregation such as the \nproliferation of private schools in the 60s and 70s, the same sense of segregated schooling promoted \nbefore Brown v. Board remained. By suggesting that the opposing frame is \u201ctrying to resurrect old \nhistory,\u201d the argument implies that this decision -making moment is contextually ahistorical, and \nGovernor Hutchinson\u2019s position as a \u201ctruthmaker\u201d means some readers will follow this line of \nargumentation simply because it was pu t forth by the governor (Endacott et al., 2018). In addition, \nbecause this quote is presented toward the beginning of the news article followed by reporting of the \ndecisionmaking process, with quotes from the counterargument not presented until toward the end \nof the article, the structure of the media portrayal elevates the quote from the governor while \ndiminishing the counterargument.  \nObfuscating  systemic racism   15 \n \n Furthermore, in addressing the counterclaim  by suggesting the complete local control supported \nby the opposing frame was u ntenable, the governor promoted the neoliberal frame\u2019s solution . When \nlooking at the following quote, this argument promoted a frame in which the state was \u201crequired\u201d to \ncontinue controlling the district.  \nCiting the Arkansas Constitution and the Arkansas S upreme Court\u2019s ruling in the \nLake View case that found that the state is required to provide an equitable \neducation for all public school students, Hutchinson said if the state returned LRSD \nschools to local control that continue to receive an \u2018F\u2019 grade un der the state \naccountability framework, then \u2018we would surely have dedicated civil rights lawyers \nthat would immediately be filing a lawsuit saying we are not meeting our obligations \nunder the Lake View decision\u2019 (Millar, 2019a)  \nThe frame that the state wa s \u201crequired to provide an equitable education for all public school \nstudents\u201d suggested that by following the mandates of the Lake View  decisions, the state had no \nchoice but to take over the schools. The Lake View  cases were a series of six Arkansas Supre me \nCourt decisions which began with litigation in 1992 and continued into 2007, and they centered on \nthe distribution of state funds for education (Fritsche, 2014). Within the cases, \u201cthe most definitive \ndefinition\u201d (Fritsche, 2014, p. 752) of equality was  put forward in Lake View III and stated, \n\u201c[e]quality of educational opportunity must include as basic components substantially equal \ncurricula, substantially equal facilities, and substantially equal equipment for obtaining an adequate \neducation\u201d ( Lake Vi ew School District No. 25 v. Huckabee, 351 Ark. 31, 79, 91 S.W.3d 472, 2002, sec. \n21). The argumentation from the governor here, then, makes a jump from adequate funding to \nequality of outcomes. By using the word \u201crequired,\u201d the implication was that the st ate had no choice \nbut to take over the schools. Other options, however, did exist, as outlined under the policy that \nguided the options available to the state (Arkansas Educational Support and Accountability Act, \n2018). This act was engrossed after the sta te had controlled the LRSD for two years and similarly \nbased its justification on the opinions set forth in Lake View  and an older case in Arkansas, DuPree \n(Dupree v. Alma School Dist. No. 30 , 1983 , 279 Ark. 340, 651 S. W.2d 90). These options included \nannexation, consolidation, or reconstitution of the public school district; reassignment of staff \nwithin a school; requiring a new curriculum to be implemented in the district; reorganization, \nclosure, or dissolution of one or more schools within the district , among others. By later referencing \nthe \u201cstate accountability framework\u201d in which \u201cschools...continue to receive an \u2018F\u2019 grade,\u201d \nHutchinson indicates a failure of the schools rather than a failure of the framework or the \nassessment of student achievement w hich formed a large basis of the school grade. The \nproblematization as represented through the neoliberal frame  ignores factors of race or \nsocioeconomic status, using statistics from the accountability framework to represent the problem as \nschool failure and the state\u2019s role in alleviating it (Bacchi, 2009). This mention of state accountability \nstandards and the su bsequent letter grade also establishes a duplicitous dichotomy between the \nstate\u2019s responsibility to create the factors for achievement and the state\u2019s role in the failing schools, \nwhich were under the state\u2019s leadership at the time. Similarly, identifying  \u201cdedicated civil rights \nlawyers\u201d in this what -if situation implies that these lawyers would side with state control because \ninjustice would exist if the state had not controlled LRSD. This implication of civil rights\u2019 lawyers\u2019 \nsupport of state control lea ves out the state\u2019s role in setting the criteria and selecting as an option \nstate control and suggests that the state control of the district is more equitable than local control.  \n The opposing argumentative frame, which supported local control as part of  social reform to \ncombat systemic racism, also brought up the state accountability framework as part of its \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  16 \n \nargumentation scheme. State Senator Joyce Elliott commented on the framework, tying her response \nto another report from the government:  \nElliott said  this framework is \u201cblatantly racist in effect, \u201d saying that though Governor \nHutchinson and board members have said that this is not the case, \u201cyou cannot have a \nframework built on three separate categories of schools and not understand that this is \nsegreg ation. \u201d Elliott then referred to a report released in September by the nonpartisan \nBureau of Legislative Research on Arkansas\u2019s education accountability system. Elliott said \nthe report essentially revealed that the criteria used by the state to determine s chool \nperformance is \u201cjunk science. \u201d She also described the effects experienced by a school and its \nstudents when it receives an \u201cF\u201d grade. (Hall, 2019a)  \nMedia portrayal supported Elliott\u2019s argument by beginning with identifying the framework as racist \nin effect which illustrates how she was striving for a change in policy. By blaming the policy instead \nof a particular person or group of people, Elliott attempted to expand the conflict and make it more \npalatable to those who may support the politicians. Thi s acknowledgement of the policy as the \nfailure also ties in the concept of de facto  segregation, as Elliott noted the three separate categories did \nsegregate the schools even though the Governor and board members said that was not the intent. \nShe supports this claim with a report from the Bureau of Legislative Research (2019). This report, \ncommissioned for the committees on education in both the Arkansas House and Arkansas Senate, \nsimilarly notes \u201cthe demographic make -up of a school\u2019s student body often sti ll is statistically \nsignificantly correlated with the ESSA [Every Student Succeeds Act] Index Score\u201d (p. 13) and that \n\u201cschools with a lower than average percentage of black students are six times as likely to receive A\u2019s \nthan schools with larger than avera ge percentage of black students\u201d (p. 15). By calling into question \nthe accountability system with the term \u201cjunk science\u201d and later emphasizing the effects on students\u2019 \nself-perceptions as well as community real estate values that occur when schools are la beled as \nfailing, Elliott highlights the values  of the systemic racism frame. Focusing on the effects of a policy \nas implemented, like the Supreme Court justices did in the historic Brown v. Board decision (Souter, \n2010/2017), demonstrates how labeling the  schools has consequences beyond the political realm \nthat disproportionately affect low -income, Black and Brown students.  \nCompromise Aligned with Neoliberal Hegemony  \nFacing growing discontent that would eventually lead to a protest of thousands of \ncommunit y members at the foot of Central High School and later a teacher strike, Little Rock\u2019s \nMayor Frank Scott Jr. set forth a proposal in early October. Little Rock\u2019s first elected Black mayor, \nFrank Scott Jr. positioned himself as an actor within the local con trol frame, stating, \u201cI\u2019m on public \nrecord advocating for complete and full control of LRSD\u201d (Brantley, Oct. 31, 2019). His proposal, \nhowever, was \u201cfocused on solutions with the realistic understanding of what I can and cannot do\u201d \n(Brantley, Oct. 31, 2019) . In other words, his proposal nominally put forward a path to local control \ntempered by the state\u2019s neoliberal policy context. The media coverage of his proposal reflects the \nsupport for community outreach within a neoliberal framework:  \nMayor Frank Scott Jr. announced on Monday a proposal to return the Little Rock \nSchool District to local control, which includes putting an interim school board in \nplace in January 2020 and having the district operate its schools that received an F \ngrade under a partnership between the city and the state. (Herzog, 2019a)  \nBeginning with the frame of returning the district to local control and then dovetailing that \ninformation with the \u201cpartnership between the city and state\u201d attempts to show the proposed \nObfuscating  systemic racism   17 \n \nsolution met the goals  of the local control frame. The terminology of the neoliberal frame, however, \nwith the separation of \u201cschools that received an F grade,\u201d show that whatever the machinations are, \nthey are predicated on the false narrative perpetrated by the color -blind neo liberal policy of grading \nschools which serves as a proxy for class and race. The mention of an interim school board, rather \nthan a locally elected school board, also suggests that this is an unequal partnership between the city \nand state at best. This sup port for collaboration between district and state is continued with the \nphrase \u201chaving the district operate,\u201d which suggested that the district would regain full local control, \nbut then included \u201cunder a partnership\u201d indicating the state would have some ro le. While a local \nactor, the mayor\u2019s plan develops a relationship between the state and local actors with the state only \ninvolved in those schools with an F grade.  \n A large part of Mayor Frank Scott Jr.\u2019s proposal was the community school model. This \nmodel  was eventually adopted on a pilot basis for some of the schools in LRSD.  \nScott said the community school model is \u201csomething that\u2019s not foreign to the \nnation in regards to assisting challenging schools within local school districts and \nproviding wrap -around services.\u201d He said the schools are often in low -income, \ndistressed areas or have low school \u201cgrades\u201d because of \u201cthings that may be \nhappening in the community,\u201d including \u201cpoverty, food insecurity [and] health \ninsecurity.\u201d Scott said the \u201cwrap -around se rvices\u201d could include programs that \nensure children have three meals a day, and also services \u201cas complex\u201d as ensuring \nthat social and mental health workers are available in schools to help students \nexperiencing trauma or mental health issues. (Hall, 2019b ) \nComponents of the community school model did fit the demands of the systemic racism, local \ncontrol frame. In his statement, Scott tied low school grades with external factors of \u201cpoverty, food \ninsecurity, [and] health insecurity.\u201d The examples of wrap -around services illustrate the concern not \nonly for achievement on the standardized test, but also on the health and psychosocial well -being of \nthe students. Still, the entire concept of the community school model being predicated on \u201cassisting \nchallenging s chools\u201d reflects the notion of failing schools as developed through the idea of a \nmanufactured crisis. Bell\u2019s (1980) concept of interest convergence , defined as \u201cthe interest of blacks in \nachieving racial equality [being] accommodated only when it converge s with the interests of whites\u201d \n(p. 523), is reflected in the promotion of the neoliberal frame of argumentation as justification for \nthe community school model. \u201cChallenging\u201d is used as a synonym for low achievement scores. Scott \ndoes not explicitly menti on race or racial segregation, instead referring to \u201clow -income, distressed \nareas.\u201d The connection between low school grades and external factors highlights systemic issues, \nbut it also allows the state to evade culpability in their role with the schools. At this point, the state \nhad controlled the district for five years, but highlighting the external factors as Scott does here \nplaces the blame on the issues within the community instead of the state or policies. The community \nschool model as a solution was  palatable to both argumentative frames, but it was not problem free.  \nDiscussion  \nThe 2019 decision to return LRSD to local control with a memorandum of understanding \nbetween the state and school district, as well as creation of a pilot program of community  schools \nfor select schools in the district, demonstrates how the hegemonic frame continued to dominate the \npolicy process despite polarized media sources promoting both argumentative frames. The CPDA \nconducted in this study allowed for an examination of h ow two argumentative frames in the media \nportrayed the actors, issues, and possible solutions using components of the hegemonic, neoliberal \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  18 \n \nviewpoint, contributing to the adoption of incremental change in the policy that did not address \nissues of systemic racism in education policy.  \nOne argumentative frame aimed for a continuation of state control of the district based on \ncolor -blind, neoliberal policy. Portions of articles that aligned with this frame focused on \naccountability, using test scores to make th e claim that schools and students were failing (following \nBerliner & Biddle, 1995; Mehta, 2013). Most of the time, actors quoted and portrayed by the media \naffiliated with this frame were incumbent state officials like the Governor or members of the State \nBoard of Education. Justifying the state\u2019s involvement in the school district in their own rhetorical \ninterests (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2012), the actors and media that promoted this frame used terms \nreferring to the state\u2019s requirement, duty, and obliga tion. Furthermore, they portrayed their position \nas color-blind (Bonilla -Silva, 2014; Collins, 2009), suggesting the tumultuous history of LRSD and race \nhad no application to a proposed system which would have acted as a racist racial project (Omi & \nWinant , 2015) by categorizing and providing different levels of state and local control to the schools \nwithin the district.  \nThe media challenged the dominant discourse in this instance, unlike other previous media \ncoverage of groups that have been marginalized ( Collins, 2009; L\u00f3pez, 2020), through the inclusion \nof parents of students in the district, teachers, teacher union members, advocates from community \ngroups, some state officials, and local government representatives. These actors and the media \nquestioned t he framework used to identify failing schools, pointing to the correlations between \nschool grades, race, and class. Proponents of this argumentative frame proffered that the history of \nLittle Rock did apply in this decision -making process and advocated for  a return to full local control \nof the district, rather than a return to local control for only a portion of the school district. By \npointing out these proposed disparate outcomes were based on the institutionalized framework, this \nframe rallied against sy stemic racism (Fandl, 2018). The language used by the media and actors \nunder this counter -hegemonic frame, however, suggested that the dominant frame still influenced \ndiscourse in this policy decision (Carpenter et al., 2014). As Collins (2009) suggested, coded language \nis implemented within the societal context of color -blind racism, \u201ca system of power\u201d that is \u201cdeeply \nentrenched\u2026[in] America\u2019s struggle for democratic social equality\u201d (p. 53). In the state control of \nLRSD, implementing a community school p ilot aligned with the narrative of \u201cBlack youth in low -\nincome settings [framed] as \u2018broken\u2019 and in need of \u2018fixing\u2019\u201d (Baldridge, 2017, p. 781). The coded \naccountability framework influenced how the problem was represented as well as the proposed \nsolutions (Bacchi, 2012), and it provided the basis for determining which schools would become \npart of the community school pilot.  \nUtilizing CPDA allowed us to examine the argumentative frames developed through the \nmedia and to investigate the relationship between m edia reporting, political actors, and the policy \ndecision process. Increased media coverage of Little Rock schools during this policy process \ncorrelated with a policy change (Baumgartner & Jones, 2009), and the use of CPDA provides a \nmethod for studying th e responsiveness of this policy change to the goals of the two opposing \narguments. While the policy nominally responded to the aims of the counter -hegemonic frame, the \ncontinuation of state control though a memorandum of understanding and changes to the sc hool \nboard, along with the pilot community school initiative and discontinuation of the bargaining power \nof the teacher union, suggests the policy change reflected the goals of the hegemonic frame. This \nfinding is consistent with other studies of state tak eover and education reform (e.g., Bowman, 2013; \nBrathwaite, 2017; Carpenter et al., 2014; Mason & Reckhow, 2017; Peck & Reitzug, 2014; Wright et \nal., 2018), which suggest entrenched racist systems (Collins, 2009; Omi & Winant, 2015; Trujillo & \nWoulfin, 201 4) operate within and influence education policy in the United States (Ladson -Billings, \n2006).  \nObfuscating  systemic racism   19 \n \nConclusion  \nThe CPDA conducted on the media surrounding the decision to continue or terminate state \ncontrol of LRSD illuminated two argumentative frames. One fram e reflected a neoliberal \nperspective while the other aligned with social reform movements. Previous research has pointed to \na concern for the role of \u201cconsolidated media sources\u201d which may reflect only one argumentative \nframe (Poutanen, 2019). In this inst ance, polarized media sources provided outlets for both the \nhegemonic view of continued state control and the counter -hegemonic view of a return to full local \ncontrol to be portrayed. Despite representation of both sides, the policy decision to grant local  \ncontrol operating under a memorandum of understanding with the state serves to underscore how \nthe dominant, neoliberal frame continued to influence the policy process. While proponents of the \ncounter -hegemonic frame supported teachers striking for a chang e in conditions and sponsored a \nprotest, mounting a relatively large and visual form of opposition, systems which perpetuate racist \ncategorization and allocation of resources  continued , such as the state framework which assigns \ngrades to schools. The polic y decision in this case returned local control following the argumentative \nframe of social reform, but it continued to reflect components of the hegemonic view by allowing \nonly partial local control and banning collective bargaining.   \n This finding points  to several implications for the relationship between media coverage and \neducation policy. In order to have a significant policy change, sustained community and media \nattention to an issue is needed, especially if the actors promoting change are outside of  the \ngovernment or are challenging systemic issues. In the instance of Little Rock, community advocacy \ngroups played a large role in organizing events like the protest at Little Rock\u2019s Central High that \nwere large enough to garner media attention. Notwiths tanding, systemic issues such as achievement \non standardized testing used as coded justification for racist, differing systems of governance to \nschools within the district were not sufficiently challenged within media coverage to influence large, \nstate-level policy changes. Our findings point to the necessity for continued opposition with \naccompanying, careful media attention that challenges the coded language used within policy and by \npolicymakers.  \nRegarding movement toward integration, there are lasting effects of decades -long barriers \nand policies that have created segregated schools throughout the U.S. (Rotberg, 2020). Media \ncoverage in LRSD reflected the influence of the existing discourses (Blackmore, 2017) of \nneoliberalism's implicit support of segre gation policies when quoting various actors who supported \nor accepted the existing systems of accountability and performativity.  Media coverage of the LRSD \ntakeover was mostly reflective and constructive of the neoliberal status quo, and increasing coverag e \nfrom opinions that challenge the neoliberal lenses that lead to segregation could have increased \nsupport for new policies.  \n Another finding is the importance of taking a critical stance when reading news media. As \nthe media are seen as a form of educatio n (L\u00f3pez, 2020) and a source of information (Poutanen, \n2019), media consumers should approach media with a critical stance (Kohnen & Lacy, 2018). In the \ncase of Little Rock, audiences that do not take a critical stance will likely see the 2019 and 2020 \nevents surrounding the district control as a step toward local control and may therefore be less likely \nto favorably view continued calls for social reforms. Furthermore, neoliberal discourses in education \nsurrounding achievement and accountability warrant cr itical consideration of the extent to which \nthey promote systemic, racist ideologies. Considering argumentation and argumentative frames \npresent in media discourse surrounding a policy issue allows for an understanding of the relationship \nbetween discourse s present in media coverage and policy decisions and provides a method for \nanalyzing how the claims from differing argumentative frames are supported or refuted.  \nEduc ation Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 31  No. 34  20 \n \nAcknowledgements  \nThe authors would like to acknowledge and thank Melissa Taylor and Jake Warren for their \ncontributions to the research project in summer 2020  and Roseli Matos Franco for translating the \ntitle and abstract to Portuguese .  \n \nReferences  \nArkansas Department of Ed ucation.

The origin of this conflict dates from before the births of the two countries that have fought two wars over this territory, namely India and Pakistan. With both India and Pakistan having divergent positions pertaining to a path towards resolution, the decades-old Kashmir conflict has been difficult to resolve\n1. With \n1 There have been numerous attempts on the part of the United Nations (UN) to mediate between the \ntwo nuclear-armed neighbors, starting with the McNaughton Proposals of 1950. One of these is the \nestablishment of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to observe and report violations of the ceasefire following the Karachi Agreement signed by Pakistan and \nIndia in 1951. Following the Indo-Pak War of 1971 when the Simla Agreement was signed, however, Abstract\nThis paper examines the international coverage of the Kashmir dispute between \nPakistan and India. The study proceeds with a theoretical background to explore \nthe foreign policy dynamics surrounding the Kashmir issue since the beginning. \nThen, the research relies on the framing paradigm and discourse analysis as the key methodological tools to analyse four English language websites from American, \nTurkish, Pakistani and Indian news outlets about this conflict in 2018. These news \nmedia outlets are CNN, TRT World, GEO News, and NDTV, respectively. The findings will uncover the role of media in positioning and packaging the Kashmir \ndispute and will help understand the politics and the shaping of the coverage \nin this particular case. Ultimately, the paper will explain the framing approach adopted by news media based on momentary national interests as well as past en-\ngagement and expectations of cooperation in the future, providing an understand-\ning of how competing media cover the same conflict from a political economy of communication lens.\nKeywords\nKashmir Dispute, News Media, Alliance Politics, Media Diplomacy, Foreign Policy, Mediatized Conflict\n8Ravale Mohydin\nviolence escalating sharply in Indian Administered Kashmir in 2018 (Yadav, \n2018), and as security deteriorated further, the Indian government revoked the special constitutional status\n2 of Indian Administered Kashmir that guaranteed it \nspecial rights in August 2019. According to Pakistan, India\u2019s revocation of Kash-mir\u2019s special status violates United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and at the time of writing, was going to \u2018exercise all possible options to counter illegal steps\u2019 (Siddiqui, 2019).\nWith both India and Pakistan having divergent positions pertaining to a path \ntowards resolution, the decades-old Kashmir conflict has been difficult to resolve. \nObfuscation of information pertaining to human rights violations, the potential \nrole of the international community and the issue becoming a nuclear flashpoint, has been one of the reasons that have led to a delay and perhaps even a denial of its resolution. \nThis paper attempts to point towards reasons international media coverage of \nthe Kashmir dispute has been less than effective, and even required. Given the prolonged nature of the dispute, a limited number of previous studies on the topic showed international media coverage tended to reflect national priorities of the countries whose media provided coverage as well as the status of their relations with India and Pakistan. This paper will not only build on past findings with a larger evidence base, but will also provide a rationale for international media cov-erage by highlighting reasons associated with both airtime and content of media coverage of the Kashmir dispute.\nTo do this, the paper will introduce the concept of media framing and outline \nhow the Kashmir dispute has previously been covered by Pakistani, Indian and \ninternational media. After providing an overview of the bilateral relations be-\ntween Turkey and India, Turkey and Pakistan, the United States of America (US) and India as well as US and Pakistan, the study will analyse the media coverage of the Kashmir dispute by four international news media outlets, namely CNN, TRT World, GEO News, and NDTV \u2013 American, Turkish, Pakistani and Indi-an, respectively. By utilizing qualitative as well as quantitative techniques, framing analyses of digital news content related to the Kashmir dispute by CNN, TRT World, GEO News, and NDTV were conducted. \nBy comparing and contrasting the various media outlets\u2019 coverage, the study con-\nPakistan and India disagreed on the mandate of the UNMOGIP . India argues that it lapsed after the \nSimla Agreement as it was specifically established only for and after the Karachi Agreement. The \nceasefire remains in place until today. However, it is regularly violated ( Jaffrelot, 2018).\n2 The \u2018special status gave Indian Administered Kashmir its own constitution and decision-making \nrights for all matters except for defense, communications and foreign affairs\u2019 (Dawn, 2019). The law \n\u2018also forbade non-locals from permanently settling, buying land, holding local government jobs and \nsecuring education scholarships\u2019 (Dawn, 2019).\n9Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\ncludes that past engagements, current national priorities as well as expectations of \ncooperation between countries whose media cover the Kashmir dispute and both India as well as Pakistan could explain the symbiosis and dissonance in interna-tional media coverage of the Kashmir conflict.\nPakistani and Indian Media Coverage of the Kashmir Conflict\nResearchers have defined \u2018mediatized conflict\u2019 as \u2018how media do things with con-\nflicts\u2019 (Cottle, 2006, p.9), specifically actions that work to \u2018define, frame, narrate, evaluate, contest, promote and perform conflict\u2019 (Cottle, 2006 in Vukasovich, \n2012). Mediatize conflict is a paradigm that outlines the ways by which the me-\ndia engages with conflicts (Vukasovich, 2012). The engagement is \u2018performative, complex and active, and represents a constitutive role within conflicts\u2019 (Cottle, 2006; Cottle, 2004 in Vukasovich, 2012). This theory contends that that \u2018war is produced and immersed in a new ecology of media and diffused through a com-plex and interconnected web of everyday media\u2019 (Hoskins & O\u2019Loughlin, 2010; Cottle, 2006 in Vukasovich, 2012). \nThis is explained well by Herman & Chomsky (1988) who stated that mainstream \nnews media is influenced by factors including, among others, a reliance on official sources that allows the government to promote its own view, an aversion to flak or negative feedback that discourages controversial media coverage or institutional ideology such as fear of \u2018Islamic\u2019 terrorists. Hoskins & O\u2019Loughlin (2010) based the relationship between media and warfare on altering perceptions using both coercive and aggressive methods. One of the more aggressive methods, according \nto Knightley (2003), is limiting access based on willingness to be in unison with \nthe government and/or military or embedding correspondents within the military who would not report critically highlights the seemingly symbiotic relationship between mainstream media and the government-military apparatus. The success of the military-government apparatus\u2019 narrative in many conflicts, including most recently and clearly during the 2003 Iraq War, can be attributed to the complicity of the mainstream news media (DiMaggio 2010; Robinson & Taylor 2010; Ent-man et al. 2009 in Culloty, 2014).\nDavid Hoffman observed in 1991 that the \u2018global communications network has \nbecome more important for the conduct of diplomacy than traditional cables and emissaries\u2019 (Hoffman, 1991 in Gilboa, 2005). In light of media scholarship un-\nderlining the symbiotic relationship between mainstream media and the gov-\nernment-military apparatus, as well as the propensity for governments to utilize the global communications network to conduct both traditional and public di-plomacy, news coverage of even the Kashmir dispute is bound to reflect a par-ticular set of priorities and not necessarily realities on the ground. As Hoskins and O\u2019Loughlin (2010) argue, media enables constant connectivity that either \n10Ravale Mohydin\namplifies awareness of conflicts, modulating security and insecurity, or contains \nthem by packaging them a certain way. This connectivity is the mechanism by which media is weaponised (Vukasovich, 2012). Essentially, the media becomes the battleground.\nMedia framing is one of the more coercive manners perceptions can be altered. \nMedia framing involves both inclusion (emphasizing) and exclusion (de-empha-sizing) of critical aspects of an event, prioritizing one over another \u2013 intentionally or unconsciously \u2013 to promote a particular interpretation of that event (Abdullah & Elareshi, 2015). According to Entman (1993): \n\u2018Framing essentially involves selection and salience. To frame is to select some as-pects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpreta-tion, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described\u2019 (Entman, 1993, p. 52).\nSuccessful promotion of salient frames may highlight saliency of key issues in the foreign public agenda resulting in \u2018improved public opinion perceptions, and potential in\ufb02uence on foreign elites\u2019 (Sheafer & Shenhav, 2010)\u2019 (Golan, 2014, p. 420). \nAs expected, since the inception of India and Pakistan, and the resultant Kashmir \ndispute, Indian and Pakistani media coverage of the Kashmir dispute strong-ly reflects their respective stances on the conflict (Sreedharan, 2009). Pakistani coverage highlights Islamabad\u2019s official stance that the Kashmir dispute must be settled in light of UN resolutions, without which there can be no progress in India-Pakistan relations. On the other hand, Indian coverage echoes New Delhi\u2019s \nstandpoint, namely that Kashmir\u2019s accession to India is final, meaning there \u2018is \nno dispute to settle. The armed violence in Kashmir is a law and order prob-lem\u2019 (Sreedharan, 2009, p. 100), purely a conflict between the Indian state and Pakistan-sponsored terrorists ( Joseph, 2000 in Sreedharan, 2009). Another study by Ali and Perveen (2015) looked at Pakistani (Dawn) and Indian (The Tribune) media coverage of the Kashmir dispute and found that The Tribune and Dawn supported the Indian government\u2019s and the Pakistani government\u2019s position re-spectively (Ali & Perveen, 2015).\nHistorically, both India and Pakistan have relied on the assistance of foreign sup-\nport for their respective positions on Kashmir (Cohen, 1995). Applying Entman\u2019s (2007) cascading network activation model (see Figure 1) to international audi-\nences considering news consumption patterns via digital media (Deloitte, 2017), \nIndia and Pakistan could weaponize foreign media coverage in defence of their positions and gain foreign support. \n11Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nFigure 1: Cascading Network Activation (Source: Entman, 2007)\nStudies show that governmental attempts to in\ufb02uence foreign media coverage \ncan be best understood in the context of international relations, particularly frame-building during territorial disputes (Maoz, 2006; Rogers & Ben-David, 2010 in Golan, 2014). \nInternational Media Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nConversely, foreign media coverage of the Kashmir dispute could be perceived \nas an opportunity for foreign countries to influence India and Pakistan as well as propagate their own political objectives. According to Gans (1979), journalists \nselect stories based on availability as well as suitability. Particularly with respect \nto foreign policy, journalists tend to rely on government sources as that may be their only form of access to international news, and thus the way the media frame foreign policy coverage is influenced primarily by how the government frames an issue. As per Fuchs (2005), mass media is not a neutral subsystem of society, without any links to political or economic realities of the state.\nSheafer (2014) revealed that the more aligned the political objectives between \nIsrael and a foreign country, the higher the acceptance of Israel\u2019s views in that \nforeign country\u2019s media, and vice versa. The same findings, when applied in the \n\n12Ravale Mohydin\ncontext of the Kashmir dispute, could explain why certain frames were utilized \nby foreign countries\u2019 media coverage. Generated by past alignments (Wilkins, 2012) as well as shared political values and objectives, the media of states expect-ing cooperation in the future (Snyder, 1997) may be more aligned than opposed and vice versa. Other relevant influential factors for frame building include trade relations as well as the economic and political power of the country promoting a frame (Wu, 2000; Chang, 1998 in Sheafer, 2014).\nA limited number of studies have looked at the international media coverage of \nthe Kashmir dispute. According to Ray (2004) who studied The New York Times, \nThe Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, the US media echoes the Indian media \ncoverage of the Kashmir dispute, particularly after 1999. Dominant frames in the coverage of the Kashmir dispute by US news outlets included \u2018outside interfer-ence\u2019, \u2018violent neighbour\u2019, \u2018foreign fighters\u2019 and \u2018militant extremists\u2019 (Ray, 2004). Another study (Zia & Syedah, 2015) found that The New York Times provided minimum coverage to the Kashmir dispute in comparison with Pakistani Dawn or The Times of India. The study also asserted that limited coverage was generally \nmore negative, defined as \u2018triggering the dispute by giving partial coverage or only publishing the violent aspect of the conflict and distorting the situation\u2026 provid-ed unfair support to any party. If the coverage is supporting armed activities and appreciating aggressive acts or ferocity of all stakeholders\u2019 (Zia & Syedah, 2015, p. 169). Though the US had assumed the arbitrator\u2019s role in the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan, analysing US media coverage of the Kashmir dispute suggested it tended to favour India\u2019s viewpoint (Zia & Syedah, 2015, p. 169).\nBuilding on the above studies with a larger multi-country evidence, this study \nlooks at how that influences media coverage of those countries, given that for-eign countries have pre-existing values and political proximities with India and Pakistan, as well as expectations of alignment and opposition with both in the future. To explore these parameters potentially influencing media coverage of the Kashmir dispute, as well as the potential effects of cultural and religious proximity (or lack thereof ), digital news outlets from US and the Republic of Turkey were \nincluded in the study, as both US and Turkey have multi-layered and evolving \nrelations with India and Pakistan.\nInternational Alignments: United States, Turkey, Pakistan and India\nAs part of alliance politics during the Cold War (Leeds and Mattes, 2007), Paki-\nstan became the \u2018key point of an anti-Communist bulwark of regional countries\u2019 (Schaffer, 2009, p.44). In exchange, the US offered support on the issue of Kash-mir and provided military and economic assistance to Pakistan (Afzal, 2018) well into the 1980s. Once the Soviet Union was defeated, the US had more room to focus on economic development and investments in overseas markets (Brain-\n13Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nard & Brookings Institution, 2001). This led the US to downgrade its focus on \nPakistan, which also meant that Islamabad lost its support regarding the Kashmir conflict. Further deterioration in relations took place when the US banned the sale of military hardware and halted economic aid to Pakistan by 1990, creating a significant trust deficit between the two.\nNevertheless, following the September 11 attacks, the US once again sought Pak-\nistan\u2019s help in Afghanistan against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda and in its broader so-called \u2018War on Terror\u2019 (Afzal, 2018). Essentially, Pakistan had to choose be-tween joining the US-led war and not joining and facing \u2018America\u2019s wrath\u2019 (Tellis, \n2008, p. 13). As a spill-over effect from the war in Afghanistan, Pakistan struggled \nwith a Taliban insurgency on its soil from the mid-2000s onwards that has cost the country more than 75,000 civilian lives and suffered the loss of $123 billion (Iqbal, 2018). However, the US contended that Pakistan provides a safe haven to terrorists (Trump, 2018), leading to a considerable deterioration in relations (Afzal, 2018). \nDespite President Donald Trump announcing a new Afghan War strategy in \n2017, reiterating US accusations concerning Pakistan and urging India to help with economic development in Afghanistan, Pakistan is considered important for US strategy for Afghanistan due to its perceived influence over the Taliban (Felbab-Brown, 2018). Pakistan is also at the very centre of China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) (Econo-\nmist, 2017) that would help consolidate China\u2019s influence in the region, which \nis not ideal for the US. The US supported India in its stance that CPEC passes through the disputed territory of Kashmir (Iqbal, 2017).\nThe US considers India strategically important in the larger Indo-Pacific region \n(Pant, 2015). According to a report commissioned by the Pentagon, \u2018there is a broad consensus within Washington and Delhi that each depends on the other to sustain a favourable strategic equilibrium as Chinese power rises\u2019 (Quadren-nial Defence Review, 2010, p. 65). Additionally, India and the US have a bilateral trade relationship worth more than $115 billion (Meltzer & Singh, 2017). In a policy paper published by the Brookings Institute, Dhruva Jaishankar captured the mood when he stated that \u2018Washington now tilts in India\u2019s favour\u2019 ( Jaishan-\nkar, 2017). Experts suggest that the inclusion of India in the Afghanistan strategy \nmay be the US employing a carrot and stick approach with Pakistan, conditioning its support on critical issues such as Kashmir in exchange for help in Afghanistan (Felbab-Brown, 2018). \nTurkey has also offered to mediate between India and Pakistan to help resolve the \nKashmir dispute. Turkey and Pakistan enjoy historical ties, dating back to when the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent supported the Ottoman Empire (Pay, \n14Ravale Mohydin\n2015) leading up to present day support from Pakistan on multiple fronts includ-\ning against FETO, considered a terrorist organisation by the Turkish government following the attempted coup of July 15, 2016 (Akan, 2017). Much to India\u2019s irritation, in a 2017 visit to New Delhi, Turkish President Erdogan called for efforts to reduce the suffering of Kashmiris (Krishnan, 2017). International hu-manitarian and development assistance has become a central part of Turkish for-eign policy. Moreover, \u2018humanitarian diplomacy\u2019 has been highly visible given the fact that the country hosting almost 4 million Syrian refugees in 2018 (Hasimi, \n2014). President Erdogan calling for a multilateral dialogue to resolve the conflict \nthat has cost thousands of Kashmiris\u2019 lives dovetails with Turkey\u2019s foreign policy objectives (Kalin, 2012)\n3.\nTurkey has recently sought to widen its web of relations with international powers when it comes to trade and investment. An example of this is Turkey\u2019s engage-ment with China as part of both the Middle Corridor Initiative and China\u2019s One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative (Talbot, 2018), both of which Pakistan is a significant contributor to. With reference to trade and investment, the Turkish defence industry secured its most substantial arms deal with Pakistan in 2018 \n(Bekdil, 2018). However, Turkey and India also have growing trade relations. \nGiven Turkey\u2019s interest in joining BRICS (Korybko, 2018), Turkey and India \nmay seek greater cooperation in the future. With that, as previously noted, come \nexpectations of support on critical issues. In the past though, support was not \nforthcoming. For example, India maintains friendly relations with Cyprus (High Commission of India Nicosia Cyprus, 2018). New Delhi was not particularly supportive in the fight against the FETO organization (Asian News Interna-tional, 2017). Turkey for its part did not oppose India\u2019s entry to the elite Non-Suppliers Group (NSG) but also supported Pakistan\u2019s entry.\nThus, US-Pakistan, US-India, Turkey-Pakistan, and Turkey-India relations have \nbeen multi-layered and complex, attuned to the ever-shifting global dynamics that have led to the Kashmir dispute being both a barometer and instrument of influence by India and Pakistan. Additionally, considering the Kashmir dispute primarily affects Kashmiri Muslims, and has been viewed as a Muslim cause, the \ninclusion of US and Turkish media will allow for the study of relevant media \nfrom the lens of religious and cultural proximity to the Kashmir dispute (or lack thereof ) as well.\nResearch Methodology\nCable News Network (CNN), TRT World, GEO News, and NDTV were se-\nlected as respectively American, Turkish, Pakistani and Indian news sources for the study. CNN and TRT World are well-known sources of American and Turk-\n3 \u0130brahim Kalin is the Turkish Presidential Press Secretary.\n15Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nish English-language news outlets internationally. CNN was the first to revolu-\ntionize television news and expanded their broadcasting internationally in the early 1980s (Lule, 2016), and became a significant actor in international rela-tions during the 1991 Gulf War. CNN is also associated with the \u2018CNN effect\u2019, that assumes that the news media influences or determines what governments do (Hoskins & O\u2019Loughlin, 2010; Cottle, 2006; Robinson, 1999), making this the channel most likely to be utilized by the US administration in public diplomacy efforts. Also an international broadcaster, TRT World is a Turkish English-lan-\nguage 24-hour English language news channel. Launched in 2015, TRT World \nis part of the country\u2019s public broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Cor-poration (TRT). According to Turkish officials at TRT World\u2019s test launch, Tur-key would conduct public diplomacy by engaging all its institutions in order to protect its national interests (TRT Haber, 2015). TRT World is an international broadcaster with its own news agenda. However, there is a strong likelihood that the network\u2019s views will not be contradicting the Turkish government\u2019s foreign \npolicy. With that said, the channel reports with minimally loaded language and \nutilizes credible sources (Media Bias/Fact Check, 2018-a).\nFor Pakistani and Indian news sources, GEO News and New Delhi Television \nLimited (NDTV) were selected. GEO News was Pakistan\u2019s first 24-hour news channel, launched in 2002. It is the most watched network in the country (Al Jazeera, 2018). Importantly, PTV World, the 24 hour English news channel owned by the Pakistani state, at the time of writing, did not have an English-language online news outlet. NDTV was also India\u2019s first 24 hours private news channel, launched in 1988 and headquartered in New Delhi, India. Though the study could have included Doordarshan, the state network that had an online news outlet, it may not have led to reliable comparisons with the Pakistani private channel included in the study. In any case, NDTV republishes stories from the Press Trust of India for national news and presents world affairs from an Indian perspective (Media Bias/Fact Check, 2018-b).\nDigital news outlets of CNN, TRT World, GEO News, and NDTV were se-\nlected as incoming traffic to media organizations\u2019 own news websites is one of the \nmost important sources for online news consumption (Deloitte, 2017). Online content is reflective of the broadcast content that is produced by these channels (Graber & Dunaway, 2017). Considering that the study is a discourse analysis, relying on framing analysis and comparative keyword analysis, which is \u2018a method for the conjoint qualitative and quantitative analysis of large amounts of text, adapted for social research purposes\u2019 (Charteris-Block, 2012, p. 142), using online written content is preferable. \nFraming analysis, as a discourse analysis technique, allows us to \u2018select some as-\npects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, \n16Ravale Mohydin\nin such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, \nmoral evaluation and/or treatment recommendation\u2019 (Entman, 1993). According to Ray (2004):\n\u2018The salience of a frame in a media text is a product of the interaction of the frames embedded in the text and the mental schemas of the reader. Although the presence of frames in a text, as detected by researchers, does not guarantee that audience frames will be identical to the frames in the text (Entman, 1989), media frames, by emphasizing some aspects of a problem over others, activate certain kinds of knowledge within people, and this, in turn, affects their trains of thought and \nrecommended behaviour\u2019 (Ray, 2004, p.17).\nThe Lexis Nexis search engine located all news articles using terms including \n\u2018Kashmir dispute\u2019, \u2018Kashmir conflict\u2019 or \u2018Kashmir war\u2019 from January to August 2018. Even though Indian Administered Kashmir had experienced increased vio-lence since 2014 onwards with 2018 being the decade\u2019s deadliest year (Zia, 2019), this date range was selected to highlight media coverage that was not coloured by a particular \u2018media event\u2019 such as major terrorist attack such as the Pulwama attack in February 2019 and resulting military confrontations. Media events are \u2018interruptions of routine\u2019 (Dayan and Katz, 1992: 9-14), and the date range is re-flective of a period of routine media coverage provided to the Kashmir dispute on all the channels included in the study. This is important as it can be assumed that the effects of past alignments, shared political values and objectives, and expecta-\ntions of cooperation in the future may be less contaminated by a media event such \nas an overt war, when perhaps current priorities can take precedence.\nIn terms of operationalization of the framing analysis, the first phase of the study \nconcurrently applied both inductive and deductive reasoning to qualitatively ex-plore and select themes, or frames. Inductive reasoning \u2018is aimed at detecting generalizations, rules, or regularities\u2019 (Klauer & Phye, 2008, p. 86). It is based on \u2018grounded theory\u2019 (Glaser & Strauss, 1967 in Vukasowich, 2012), the aim of which is to discover theory that is implicit in qualitative data (Vukasowich, 2012). It \u2018involves the search for patterns from observation and the development of explanations \u2013 theories \u2013 for those patterns through [a] series of hypotheses\u2019 (Bernard, 2011). Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, bases the conclusion on \nmultiple premises that are believed to be true (Ratolo & Sator, 2018). Thus, some \nframes were pre-selected based on historical positions and political tensions be-tween India and Pakistan vis-\u00e0-vis the Kashmir dispute as well as their relations with the US and Turkey, while others were selected as they were detected in the media coverage. The CNN and TRT World frames were grouped together based on what were considered alignments with the Pakistani and Indian stances.\nFollowing a sequential multimethod approach (Dreissneck, Sousa & Mendes, \n17Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\n2007), the second phase used quantitative analysis to compare these selected \nframes and offer more rigor \u2018in terms of mapping results of a qualitative analysis\u2019 (Vukasowich, 2012). In order to be able to provide evidence for international media coverage reflecting not just current national priorities but also past engage-ments and expectations of cooperation between countries whose media cover the Kashmir dispute and both India as well as Pakistan as well, the following hypoth-eses were tested:\nH1: CNN is more likely to cover the Kashmir dispute in terms of security fram-\ning than TRT World.\nH2: TRT World is more likely to cover the Kashmir dispute using humanitarian \nframes than CNN.\nH3: There will be more differences than similarities between CNN and GEO \nNews frames as well as keywords in covering the Kashmir dispute than compared with TRT World and GEO News.\nH4: There will be more differences than similarities between TRT World and \nNDTV frames and keywords in covering the Kashmir dispute than compared with CNN and NDTV.\nHypotheses 1-2 reflect current national priorities of US and Turkey, while hy-\npotheses 3-4 capture the status of their relations with India and Pakistan respec-tively, reasonably assumed influenced by past engagements and expectations of future cooperation between them and India as well as Pakistan.  \nFindings\nCNN coverage of the Kashmir dispute consisted of 10 articles during the period \nof study, two of which were linked with non-conflict related sexual violence, and so were not included in the study sample. TRT World had 35 news articles on the Kashmir dispute during the same period, and all were linked directly to the Kashmir dispute. This led to the use of Fisher\u2019s exact test analysis for most tests concerning CNN in this study. A Fisher\u2019s exact test analysis affords a more robust \nanalysis when conditions for a chi-square test analysis cannot be met\n4.\nWith respect to the first hypothesis, though a Fisher\u2019s exact test analysis revealed \nthat there was no significant difference between the likelihood of CNN utiliz-ing the security framework compared with TRT World (p= 0.40, FET), CNN was almost twice as likely (38 percent versus 23 percent) than TRT World to include the security frame in their coverage of the Kashmir dispute. The following \n4 A Fisher\u2019s exact test analysis can be used when more than 20% of cells (in a chi-square analysis) have \nexpected frequencies of less than five, because applying approximation method is inadequate.\n18Ravale Mohydin\nsub-frames were included in the security frame: Indian violent behaviour in self-\ndefence, attacks on Indian soldiers or security personnel, descriptions of \u2018militant\u2019 organizations as well as India and Pakistan being nuclear powers\n5. In corrobora-\ntion, keyword analysis also revealed that CNN uses the label \u2018terrorists\u2019 while TRT World used the term \u2018rebels\u2019 and \u2018protestors\u2019. Additionally, CNN included references to India and Pakistan having nuclear arms in 20 percent of their cover-age while it was referred to in only 5 percent of TRT World coverage. Though the Fisher\u2019s test did not confirm whether CNN employs the security frame statisti-cally significantly more than TRT World, potentially due to the small number of CNN articles, triangulation of data shows that findings point in that direction.\nConfirming the second hypothesis, a Fisher\u2019s exact test analysis revealed that \nTRT World employed the humanitarian frame significantly more than CNN (p<0.01, FET). In fact, TRT World was almost three times as likely (54 percent versus 20 percent). This frame included the following sub-frames: use of pellet guns to blind protestors in Indian-administrated Kashmir, unfairness of legal sys-tems in Indian-administrated Kashmir, trauma experienced by civilians, civilians experiencing human rights abuses as well as journalists being in danger. \nConfirming the third hypothesis, a Fisher\u2019s exact test first revealed that GEO \nNews was statistically significantly more likely to use the \u2018Pakistan stance\u2019 than CNN (p<0.01, FET), while a chi-square analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between GEO News and TRT World in utilizing the \u2018Pakistan stance\u2019 frame (\n\u03c72=1.41, df=1, p=0.23). Additionally, keyword analysis \nrevealed that CNN uses the terms \u2018terrorists\u2019 or \u2018militants\u2019 which is less aligned with GEO News, whereas  TRT World uses the terms \u2018rebels\u2019, \u2018fighters\u2019 or \u2018youth\u2019 which is more aligned with the language employed by GEO News. This analysis includes sub-frames clearly reflecting Pakistan\u2019s stance including \u2018Kashmir does \nnot want to be a part of India\u2019, \u2018Kashmiris are resentful\u2019, \u2018Kashmiris are carrying \nout anti-India protests\u2019, \u2018Pakistan denies role in terrorism in Kashmir\u2019 and that there are \u2018renewed or indigenous protests in Kashmir\u2019. \nWith respect to the fourth hypothesis, though a Fisher\u2019s exact test analysis re-\nvealed that there was no significant difference between the likelihood of CNN employing the \u2018Indian stance\u2019 frame compared with TRT World (p= 0.42, FET), a chi-square analyses revealed that NDTV coverage was more similar to CNN (\n\u03c72=22.05, df=1, p<0.001) than TRT World ( \u03c72=31.33, df=1, p<0.001) coverage. \nThe \u2018Indian stance\u2019 frame included the following sub-frames clearly reflecting the Indian stance: \u2018Pakistan supports terrorism\u2019, \u2018Pakistani terrorist\u2019, \u2018globally recog-nized Kashmiri terrorist\u2019 and terrorists \u2018killing\u2019 or \u2018attacking\u2019. Additionally, CNN \n5 Terrorist as a term was not included as TRT World coverage does not utilize it in a single news \narticle in this study sample and that may have biased the outcome. However, such an omission did not \nappear to make the result significant in any case.\n19Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nuses the terms \u2018terrorists\u2019 or \u2018militants\u2019 which is aligned with NDTV news cover-\nage, along with referring to Kashmir as \u2018Jammu and Kashmir\u2019, while TRT World refers to Kashmir as \u2018Indian Administrated Kashmir\u2019. Though the Fisher\u2019s test did not confirm the fourth hypothesis, potentially due to a small number of CNN articles, the chi-square analysis showed greater alignment between NDTV and CNN compared to NDTV and TRT World. \nInter-rater reliability was calculated using two coders who coded and compared \nthe first 10 percent of CNN, TRT World, GEO News and NDTV content with each other in terms of frames utilized by each news outlet. Cohen\u2019s Kappa \nwas=0.762, which is, as proposed by different investigators, \u2018substantial\u2019 (Landis & \nKoch, 1977), \u2018good\u2019 (Altman, 1991) and \u2018excellent\u2019 (Fleiss, 1971). \nDiscussion\nAligned with findings from a study by Zia & Syedah (2015), who also found that \nUS media provided sparse coverage to the Kashmir dispute, this study also had significantly less CNN articles on the topic when compared with TRT World. Bahador (2011) showed that US media including CNN was less likely to cover an issue that did not directly involve Westerners or their military forces. Because the US, any other Western country or their militaries are not directly involved with the Kashmir dispute, this may be partially explanatory. According to Halton (2001), if a foreign story does not involve bombs, natural disasters or financial ca-lamity, it has little chance of entering the American consciousness. This is aligned with the news domestication theory (Cassara, 1993 in Taradai, 2014) which high-\nlighted the \u2018domestication\u2019 of international news. The term was first coined by \nGurevitch et al. (1991), \u2018as a process of presenting distant events as relevant to a domestic audience and constructing them as compatible with the culture and dominant ideology of the country of broadcast\u2019 (Gurevitch et al., 1991 in Taradai, 2014, p. 68). Ray (2004) found a significant jump in the coverage of the Kashmir dispute during the Kargil conflict between India and Pakistan in 1998-1999 in the US media confirms this. \nThough there was no statistically significant difference between TRT World and \nCNN when it comes to utilizing security oriented frames and keywords in their media coverage of the Kashmir dispute, trends detected by analysing CNN cover-age versus TRT World coverage utilising security oriented frames as well as key-\nword analysis point towards CNN being more security oriented. This result could \nsignal that the \u2018CNN effect\u2019, or \u2018the ability of real-time communications technol-ogy, via the news media, to provoke major responses from domestic audiences and political elites to both global and national events\u2019 (Robinson, 2002, p.2), is overshadowed by priorities related to national security. As per Livingston (1997):\n20Ravale Mohydin\n\u2018The CNN effect is a loss of policy control on the part of policy makers because of \nthe power of the media. It includes\u2026the media\u2019s power to force officials to take quicker decisions in response to foreign events involving (or not) U.S. interests\u2019 (Livingston, 1997 in Palloshi, 2015, p.49).\nThe CNN effect was a result of US foreign policy becoming \u2018media-specified crisis management\u2019 (Livingston, 1997, p.1). While many media researchers argue that the CNN effect does have an impact, nevertheless, according to Bahador (2011), the CNN effect never really existed as US media framing never fully op-erated independently of the ones in power.  Thus, CNN is inclined to convey the \n\u2018official\u2019 language of the US government and its security-oriented foreign policy. \nLance Bennett argued that \u2018mass media news is indexed\u2026to the dynamics of gov-ernmental debate\u2019 (Bennett, 1990, p. 108). This is particularly after the 9/11 terror attacks when US media largely reflected the US government\u2019s positions (Lahlali, 2011). Other authors (Malek, 1997; Herman & Chomsky, 1988) have questioned the US press\u2019 ability to exercise judgment that is independent of officialdom in Washington, and that appears to be especially evident when examining US media \ncoverage of the Kashmir dispute. \nFrom the perspective of the US, it appears that CNN coverage is more aligned \nwith NDTV coverage than GEO News is not just given US-India economic relations, but also due to strategic and political considerations. As noted above, the US considers India strategically important in the larger Indo-Pacific region \n(Pant, 2015), and according to a Pentagon report, \u2018there is a broad consensus \nwithin Washington and Delhi that each depends on the other to sustain a favour-able strategic equilibrium as Chinese power rises\u2019 (Quadrennial Defence Review, 2010, p. 65).  Secondly, many US officials have been unsupportive of Pakistan\u2019s role in the US war in Afghanistan, accusing the country of facilitating terror-ists (Mangaldas, 2018). The American government-military apparatus\u2019 frustration with Pakistan is detectable in the analysis. In fact, the same terms are being used to describe Pakistan\u2019s role in Kashmir as its role in Afghanistan, in an apparent attempt to develop a \u2018case\u2019 for American efforts being thwarted by Pakistan, even \nif they are two entirely different conflicts. Some authors went to the extent of \nstating that the US is scapegoating Pakistan for its failures in Afghanistan (Gul, 2018). Relatedly, when it comes to reporting on Muslims, and consequently Mus-lim causes or conflicts primarily affecting Muslims such as the Kashmir dispute, research studies have confirmed that Islam and Muslims receive negative report-ing from Western media outlets (Hassan & Omar, 2017; Alghamdi, 2015). This is aligned with Van Dijk\u2019s (1988) cognitive-structural model framework describing the relationship between the \u2018structures of news, the process of news production, \nand the processes of news comprehension on one hand, and the social practices \nwithin which these three elements are embedded\u2019 (Bell & Garrett, 1998 in Al-\n21Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nghamdi, 2015, p. 199).  Reflecting on the discourse on security and terrorism, \nresearchers found that \u2018the association of Islam with terrorism and violence has come to be accepted, to the extent that terms such as \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d have become almost synonymous\u2019 (Eid & Karim, 2014, p.105 in Alghamdi, 2015, p. 203). In corroboration, as previously noted, keyword analysis also revealed that CNN uses the label \u2018terrorists\u2019 to describe the same actors TRT World describes as \u2018protestors\u2019.\nHowever, CNN is not significantly different from TRT World when it comes to \nreflecting NDTV coverage, and while that could be attributed to Turkey\u2019s focus \non economic growth as part of foreign policy foci (Kalin, 2012), it could also be \ndue to the US foreign policy establishment being mindful of potential future co-operation with Pakistan vis-\u00e0-vis the War in Afghanistan\n6. This was evident when \nPresident Trump offered to mediate between India and Pakistan with respect to the Kashmir dispute during Pakistani Prime Minister\u2019s official visit to the US in July 2019, when the dialogue was expected to centre on the Afghan Peace Process and Pakistan\u2019s role in facilitating US-Taliban talks (Kocis, 2019). CNN coverage \nof the Kashmir dispute with its propensity to focus on security issues, lack of pro-\nmotion of either Pakistani or Indian stance over the other yet using the same key-words as NDTV reflects current national priorities as well as past engagements and expectations of cooperation between US and both India as well as Pakistan. \nTRT World was significantly more likely to employ humanitarian frames and \nkeywords than CNN. According to Kalin (2012), the Turkish leadership has em-\nphasized that \u2018the current global order has to be based on principles of justice and equality as a precondition to finding sustainable long-term solutions to cur-rent conflicts\u2019 (Kalin, 2012, p.14). Post 2015, Turkey\u2019s foreign policy has been characterized by \u2018moral realism\u2019 (Fuat, 2016), which combines hard power-based military assertiveness with humanitarian norms in order to achieve three goals simultaneously: to remain proactive in terms of foreign policy, to exhibit moral responsibility to protect human lives and to respond effectively via hard power if need be to address security challenges (Keyman, 2016). In the last decade, Turkey \nhas expanded its foreign policy tools and humanitarian organizations are central \nto them (Ozcan, 2017). Turkey has focused on \u2018humanitarian diplomacy\u2019 (Hasimi, 2014), expanding both development assistance and humanitarian aid with respect to geographic location as well as the scope of activity\n7. This humanitarian focus \ndoes not appear entirely aligned with religion alone. As per Tabak (2017):\n6 Indeed, Pakistan facilitated direct talks between the US and Taliban, which eventually culminated in \na US-Taliban agreement on February 29th 2020 that has the potential to end the decades-long war in \nAfghanistan (Hashim, 2020).\n7 By 2013, Turkey had \u2018implemented development projects in 110 countries from all continents \n(Hasimi, 2014, p.134). In regards to aid-related foreign policy, examples include an \u2018open door policy\u2019  for Syrian refugees (Hasimi, 2014).\n22Ravale Mohydin\nPreviously, Muslim communities were almost the sole beneficiaries of humani-\ntarian assistance, but, in the JDP era, deprived communities of all beliefs (Mus-lims and non-Muslims) in zones of conflict, war, and poverty have been extended a helping hand, yet with a confident Muslim identity (Tabak, 2017, p. 90)\nAlthough TRT World has its own news agenda and priorities, it is part of the country\u2019s public broadcaster, and is likely to use humanitarian lens when it comes to news reporting (TRT World, n.d.). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect TRT World to highlight human rights abuses in Kashmir more than CNN.\nConsidering Pakistan and Turkey\u2019s significant past alignments, it is not surprising \nthat TRT World coverage is significantly more likely to echo GEO News cover-age, and consequently Pakistan\u2019s stance, than CNN. However, even though analy-sis showed NDTV coverage to be more similar to CNN than TRT World, the fact that there was no statistically significant difference between CNN and TRT World aligning with NDTV coverage, that reflects pro-Indian stance frames and keywords, requires investigation. Though it could be explained by the small size of CNN articles, a review of Turkish foreign policy principles may help. According to Kalin (2012), Turkey has \u2018moved from modernization to globalization where there are multiple centres and new spaces for opportunities\u2019 (Kalin, 2012, p. 20). The Turkish foreign policy objective of economic development through trade and investment (Kalin, 2012) as well as expectations of more engagement with both India and Pakistan, in either political or economic terms, may be reflected in TRT \nWorld\u2019s balanced usage of terms such as \u2018Indian or Pakistani Administered Kash-\nmir\u2019. These are the terms used by the United Nations itself rather than \u2018Jammu and Kashmir\u2019 (used by CNN and NDTV) or \u2018Azad or Indian Occupied Kashmir\u2019 (used by GEO News).  Furthermore, Kalin (2012) states that \u2018Turkey has put eco-nomic considerations at the centre of its foreign policy and has advocated closer cooperation with other rising powers\u2019 (Kalin, 2012, p. 10). Turkish foreign policy emphasizes \u2018trade and economic development as a tool of strengthening bilateral relations\u2019 (Kalin, 2012, p. 14). Both Pakistan and India represent economic op-portunity. \nHowever, considering Turkey\u2019s population is predominantly Muslim, TRT World \nuses terms such as \u2018rebels\u2019 or \u2018fighters\u2019 rather than \u2018terrorists\u2019 or \u2018militants\u2019 as used \nby NDTV and CNN (as previously noted, Muslims receive negative reporting \nfrom Western media outlets) and \u2018youth\u2019 or \u2018martyrs\u2019, used by GEO News. Tur-key confidently and constitutively deploys religious causes and discourses in for-eign policy, and the Kashmir dispute is no different. This is aligned with Turkey\u2019s \u2018Turkish Islamic exceptionalism\u2019 (Mardin, 2005 in Tabak, 2017, p. 98), and that the \u2018role Ottomans and the preceding \u2018Turkish\u2019 states played in the building and \nsustaining of Islamic civilization endows Turkey with a responsibility towards \nfellow Muslims worldwide\u2019 (Tabak, 2017, p. 98). Thus, current national economic \n23Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nand foreign policy priorities as well as past engagements and expectations of co-\noperation between Turkey and both India as well as Pakistan, also a Muslim-majority country, are influencing TRT World\u2019s coverage of the Kashmir dispute with its focus on human rights abuses and promotion of the Pakistani stance on the matter, yet, using neutral keywords. \nConclusion\nFindings from this paper provide evidence for current national priorities as well \nas past engagements and expectations of cooperation between countries whose \nmedia cover the Kashmir dispute and both India as well as Pakistan could explain \nthe manner in which the Kashmir dispute is provided international media cover-age. Highlighting the dynamics associated with reporting on the Kashmir issue this study provides a nuanced view of how national and regional priorities affect foreign media coverage and offers explanations in light of factors including com-peting political objectives and alignments with Pakistan, India as well as other international powers. Given the apparent impasse between India and Pakistan, political motivations of foreign countries, seemingly irrelevant but ultimately connected, will continue to colour international media coverage. \nMedia coverage is never without political context, and coverage of the Kashmir \ndispute is no exception. In fact, comparing findings of this study with media cov-erage of the Kashmir dispute after the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in August 2019\n8 may prove that: TRT World had almost 50 percent \nmore coverage in terms of articles on the topic than CNN from August 2019 till March 2020. With that said, the role of the media in coverage of international conflicts, and in particular the longest international conflict to date namely the Kashmir dispute, is critical for it can outline and even activate the agency of the \ninternational community when bilateral dialogue has clearly failed. However, if \ninternational media coverage aligns itself with the agenda of any country, it can obfuscate the reality on the ground and potentially perpetuate conflict and conse-quently human suffering. Clearly, airtime of international media coverage by any media outlet, or lack thereof, of the revocation of Article 370 in August 2019 of the special constitutional status of Indian-Administered Kashmir, which was the covenant of its special rights, may prove to be an unfortunate testament to that.\nBio\nRavale Mohydin is an analyst at TRT World Research Centre. With graduate \ndegrees from Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, her research \n8 Article 370 allowed the only Muslim-majority Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir its own constitu-\ntion, a separate flag and freedom to make laws relating to permanent residency, ownership of property \nand fundamental rights. It also barred non-Kashmiri Indians who live outside the state from purchas-ing property or settling there to protect against demographic changes (BBC News, 2019).\n24Ravale Mohydin\ninterests include the political economy of media, strategic communications, pub-\nlic diplomacy, political effects of entertainment media and media literacy.\nReferences\nAfzal, M 2018, The future of U.S.-Pakistan relations, Brookings Institute, https://\nwww.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2018/01/12/the-future-of-u-s-paki-\nstani-relations/.\nAlghamdi, E A 2015, \u2018The representation of Islam in Western media: The cover-\nage of Norway terrorist attacks\u2019, International Journal of Applied Linguistics \nand English Literature, vol. 4, no. 3.\nAli, S & Parveen, F 2015, \u2018Representation of Kashmir Issue in the Mainstream \nNewspapers of Pakistan and India: A Test of Media Conformity Theory\u2019, Pakistan Journal of History and Culture, vol. 36.\nAltman, D 1991, Practical statistics for medical research, Chapman and Hall, \nLondon\nAkan, A 2017, Turkey praises Pakistan\u2019s support in fight against FETO, Anadolu \nAgency, viewed October 10 2017, https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/tur-key-praises-pakistans-support-in-fight-against-feto/931965.\nAsian News International 2017, Turkey may use FETO as bargaining chip for \nIndia\u2019s NSG big, Asian News International, viewed April 29 2017, https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/turkey-may-use-feto-as-bar-\ngaining-chip-for-india-s-nsg-bid-117042900259_1.html.\nBahador, B 2011, \u2018Did the Global War on Terror end the CNN effect?\u2019 Media, \nWar & Conflict, vol. 4, pp. 37-54.\nBBC News 2019, Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it mat-\nters, viewed 10 March 2020, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-in-dia-49234708.\nBekdil, B 2018, Turkey, Pakistan reach their largest-ever defense contract, De-\nfense News, viewed May 29 2018, https://www.defensenews.com/global/\nmideast-africa/2018/05/29/turkey-pakistan-reach-their-largest-ever-de-\nfense-contract/.\nBennett, L 1990, \u2018Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States\u2019, \nJournal of Communication, vol. 40, pp. 103-25.\nBrainard, L & Brookings Institution 2001, Globalization in the aftermath: Tar-\nget, casualty, callous bystander?, Brookings Institution, Washington, DC.\nCohen, S 1995, Kashmir: The Roads Ahead, Brookings Institute, viewed March 1 \n1995, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kashmir-the-roads-ahead.\nCottle, S 2006, Mediatized conflict: Developments in media and conflict studies, \nOpen University Press, Maidenhead, Berkshire, England.\n25Four Vantage Points: Foreign Policy and the News Coverage of the Kashmir Dispute\nCharteris-Black, J 2012, Comparative keyword analysis and leadership communi-\ncation: Tony Blair -

Introducci \u00f3 General  \n1.1. Justificaci \u00f3 \n \nEn la interconnectada societat que actualment estem vivint cada dia rebem tones i m \u00e9s \ntones d\u2019informaci\u00f3 de qualsevol tipus com per exemple publicitat, els famosos memes, \nmissatges o els avisos que et poses per recordar el que has de fer. El que ha afavorit tot \naix\u00f2 de la interconnexi\u00f3 \u00e9s la tecnologia i els seus aven\u00e7os, i ens permet viure m\u00e9s \nc\u00f2mode.  \n Aquesta nova manera de veure la societat tamb \u00e9 t\u00e9 un punt period\u00edstic: la inclusi\u00f3 de \nles xarxes socials a la nostra vida ha perm\u00e8s que els mitjans de comu nicaci \u00f3 puguin \nagafar una caracter\u00edstica molt important i necess\u00e0ria com \u00e9s la immediatesa. Ara podem rebre les noticies, la informaci\u00f3 que ens donen i els fets que ocorren d\u2019una manera m\u00e9s r\u00e0pida.  \n \nPer aquest motiu, es tem vivint ara mateix en la societat de la informaci \u00f3, un concepte \ncreat pel soci\u00f2leg japon\u00e8s Yoneji Masuda als anys setanta i que \u00e9s aquella en la qual les \ntecnologies faciliten la creaci\u00f3, distribuci\u00f3 i manipulaci\u00f3 de la informaci\u00f3 i juguen un \npaper esse ncial en les activitats socials, culturals i econ \u00f2miques\n1. Per \u00f2 la societat en la \nque vivim, que permet estar connectats entre nosaltres, tamb\u00e9 t\u00e9 una cara obscura.  \n \nDintre de les tones d\u2019informaci\u00f3 que podem rebre cada dia no sempre  alguna t \u00e9 el punt \nde veracitat que es necessita. En moltes ocasions, la informaci\u00f3 period\u00edstica que ens arriba no \u00e9s veritat, no \u00e9 s vera \u00e7. Les famoses Fake News que han comen\u00e7at a tenir m\u00e9s \nress\u00f2 medi\u00e0tic en els \u00faltims anys son presents en els ordinadors, els m\u00f2bils i les xarxes socials.  \n I aqu \u00ed ens trobem. Les Fake News  cada vegada tenen m \u00e9s protagoni sme en processos \nde la societat i, com moltes accions, afavoreixen a un o a un altre. Propagar una noticia \nfalsa es tan senzill com nom\u00e9 s pr\u00e9mer el bot\u00f3 de compartir a Facebook  o pr\u00e9mer el bot\u00f3 \nde retuit a Twitter , i tothom que et segueixi ho veur \u00e0. La ignor \u00e0ncia de les persones en \naquestes situacions permet que fer aquestes passes sigui molt f\u00e0cil   \n \nEl meu Treball de Fi de Grau consistir\u00e0  en analitzar tota aquesta sit uaci\u00f3 e intentar treure \ninterrogants sobre aquesta q\u00fcesti\u00f3  innovadora. La secci\u00f3 m\u00e9s afectada per aquest \nfenomen \u00e9s  la pol\u00ed tica, i aquest ser \u00e0 l\u2019enfocament que es doni en el treball per entendre \nmillor el que es vol tractar. Mitjan \u00e7ant l\u2019estudi de cas  sobr e les Fake News  a les eleccions \npresidencials dels Estats Units del 2016 es podr \u00e0 demostrar com aquest fenomen ens \nafecta a tots quan menys ho esperem.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Wikipedia (octubre del 2018).

Abstract \n \nMy Final Project will be to analyse this whole situation and try to ask questions about \nthis innovative issue. The section most affected by this phenomenon is politics, and this \nwill be the approach that is given in the work to better understand what is to be dealt with. Through the case study on the Fake News in the 2016 presidential electio ns, the \nUnited States will be able to demonstrate how this phenomenon affects everyone when we least expect it.  \n At present, the Fake News abound us, camouflaged in the form of real news and even from video and photography. There are many objectives to be able to handle this type of manipulation and there are many fields in which they are affected, such as the sport or the economy. Social networks have made it possible for this phenomenon to be very difficult to stop; his ability to reach the masses with ease and with massive diffusion makes it difficult for false news to spread.  \n However, the bombing of false news in our social networks is a more complex situation \nthan it seems. There is always an interest behind it and that is what we are going to \ninvestig ate. We will focus mostly on politics, source of many of the false news we see \ntoday. In p articular, to put a practical case, the US presidential election in 2016, year in \nwhich Donald Trump again popularized the term Fake News, which was presented and in which he was related to this false news to destabilize public opinion  \n         \n \n             \n \nLA INFLUENCIA DE LES FAKE NEWS EN LA POL\u00cdTICA  \n EL CAS DE LES ELECCI ONS PRESIDENCIALS DE LS EE.UU. (2016)  \n \n 4 1.3. Objectius del treball  \n \nEn el marc d \u2019aquest Treball de Fi de Grau, he decidit dividir els objectius del treball en \nun de general per despr\u00e9s dictar una s\u00e8rie d\u2019objectius espec\u00edfics. Per tant l \u2019objectiu \ngeneral marcat  per aquest Treball de Fi de Grau \u00e9 s el seg\u00fcent :  \n \n- Trobar un significat m\u00e9s acurat del que s \u00f3n les Fake News i analitzar com \u00e9s la \nseva influencia en la pol\u00edtica mitjan\u00e7ant un estudi de cas  \n \nDespr \u00e9s de revelar  quin \u00e9s l\u2019objectiu general passem als objectius m\u00e9s espec\u00edfics del \nmeu Treb all de Fi de Grau.  \n \n- Per qu \u00e8 existeixen  les Fake News ? \n- En qu \u00e8 xarxes socials s'utilitzen m\u00e9s?  \n- Que es busca amb les Fake News ? \n- Perqu \u00e8 la gent s\u2019ho creu?  \n- Perqu \u00e8 la gent ho comparteix ? \n- Com es pot parar aquest fenomen?  \n- Pot anar a m \u00e9s aquest fenomen?  \n- Qui ho fabrica?  \n- Qui les difon?  \n- Qui les viralitza?  \n- Quin a influencia pol \u00edtica t\u00e9 les Fake News ? \n- Perqu \u00e8 son perilloses?  \n- On \u00e9s el periodisme davant les Fake News?  \n- Qui surt guanyant?  \n El motiu p el qual aquests objectius establerts \u00e9s perqu\u00e8 aquest tema encara \u00e9s molt  \nactual e innovador. No s \u2019ha establert un significat concret, s \u2019han fet pocs estudis i poca \nrecerca sobre les Fake News. La tem \u00e0tica d\u2019aquest Treball de Fi de Grau no gaudeix de \nmolta informaci\u00f3 al respecte ja que va adquirir notorietat en aquests \u00faltims anys. Aquest treball servir\u00e0 per resoldre d ubtes sobre aquest tema.  \n \n1.4. Hip\u00f2tesi d\u2019Investigaci\u00f3  \n \n- Les Fake News  distorsionen la realitat amb la viralitat i la difusi\u00f3 immediata?   \n- La complicada detecci\u00f3 de les Fake News pot provocar inger \u00e8ncies en molts \nprocessos pol \u00edtics?  \n Aquestes s \u00f3n les meva preguntes  d\u2019investigaci\u00f3 que uneix tot el que es vol explicar en \nel meu TFG. Les Fakes News i la seva popularitat s \u00f3n un tema molt innovador  i del que \ns\u2019ha parlat poc. Malgrat la seva historia, que es remunta al segle XIX, s \u2019ha comen\u00e7at a \ntractar amb m\u00e9s c ura i amb m\u00e9s import\u00e0ncia degut a la seva utilitzaci\u00f3.  Un dels \u00e0mbits \nen el que \u00e9s m\u00e9s utilitzat \u00e9s a la pol\u00edtica. Per tal d \u2019afectar els processos pol \u00edtics amb \nl\u2019objectiu d\u2019afavorir algun inter\u00e8s ideol\u00f2gic o econ\u00f2mic, \u00e9s un arma que pot ser molt \u00fatil.  \n \nTREBALL DE FINAL DE GRAU 2018 -2019. UVIC -UCC  \n 5 1.5. Metodologia  \n \nPel meu Treball de Fi de Grau utilitzar\u00e9 diverses t\u00e8cniques  d\u2019investigaci\u00f3  per poder \nexplicar correctamen t el fenomen de les Fake News .  \n \n- Revisi \u00f3 Bibliogr \u00e0fica/Investigaci\u00f3 documental : La revisi\u00f3  de la literatura \nvinculada a les Fake News  \u00e9s una part important del treball.  \n- Entrevistes semi -estructurades:  Un altre m\u00e8tode per aconseguir informaci\u00f3  i \npode r completar el treball. L \u2019entrevista d\u2019experts en la mat\u00e8ria i tamb\u00e9 de \nperiodistes reconeguts per donar el seu punt de vista \u00e9s una manera d\u2019incloure \ninformaci\u00f3 valuosa el treball. Les entrevistes s \u2019han fet a:  \n- Jaime Andreu -Romeo:  funcionari jubilat de la Comissi\u00f3  Europea \nespecialitzat en fen \u00f2mens  de les xarxes socials, comunicaci\u00f3  i Fake \nNews. S\u2019entrevista per veure una visi \u00f3 de com Europa tracta aquesta \ndelicada situaci\u00f3  de la desinformaci \u00f3. \n- Marc Amor \u00f3s: expert en Fake News, comunicaci \u00f3 i escriptor del llibre \nFake News: la Verdad de las Noticias Falsas . Es pret\u00e9n aportar una visi \u00f3 \nclara del que \u00e9s i com afecta a les persones les noticies falses.  \n- Maria Blanco (Newtral): periodista d \u2019una de les webs de verificaci\u00f3  de \nnoticies falses m\u00e9 s famosos a Espanya i tamb \u00e9 de fact-checking. S \u2019intenta \nveure quin \u00e9s el treball i quin servei fan a les persones . \n- David Fern \u00e1ndez  (Maldita.es): periodista  d\u2019un dels referents en el fact-\nchecking i la verificaci\u00f3  de les noticies falses, Maldita.es. S\u2019 intenta veure \nquin \u00e9s el treball i quin servei fan a les persones.  Aquesta entrevista no \nha estat enregistrada perqu\u00e8  l\u2019entrevista ho ha demanat aix \u00ed. \n- Observaci \u00f3/An\u00e0lisi de contingut:  El m\u00e8tode d\u2019observaci\u00f3 estar\u00e0 a  la part \npr\u00e0ctica del treball.  Ser\u00e0 una de les parts emp\u00edriques del treball. S\u2019 observar\u00e0 una \nmostra representativa de  les noticies falses que s\u2019han fet de les eleccions \npresidencials dels Estats Units del 2016.  La mostra objecte d\u2019an\u00e0lisi ha estat \nseleccionada per la seva incid\u00e8ncia (difusi\u00f3) a la xarxa. Es crea una plantilla \nd\u2019an\u00e0lisi basada en diferents documents i experts citats al treball.   \n La plantilla explica de que tracta la noticia, el mitj \u00e0 que ho ha publica, quin grau \nde fiabilitat t\u00e9  el mitj \u00e0 que ho publica , la data de publicaci \u00f3. L\u2019an\u00e0lisi en si est \u00e0 \nbasat  en els estudis de la Dra. Claire  Wardle, que ha creat  una categoritzaci \u00f3 de \nles noticies falses i una llista per poder trobar com es desinforma i que s \u2019explicar\u00e0  \ndurant el treball.  Aquestes dues representacions  esmentades  s\u00f3n dos bons \nexemples per poder descobrir noticies falses.  \n \n1.6. Estructura i continguts del  treball  \n \nL\u2019estructura del treball est\u00e0 dividit en  tres parts:  \n \n- Introducci \u00f3 General : Una introducci\u00f3 de que es tractar\u00e0 al TFG i una pinzellada \nr\u00e0pida sobre el fenomen de les Fake News . La justificaci\u00f3, els objectius, les \nhip\u00f2tesis i la pregunta d\u2019investigaci\u00f3 estan en aquest apartat  \nLA INFLUENCIA DE LES FAKE NEWS EN LA POL\u00cdTICA  \n EL CAS DE LES ELECCI ONS PRESIDENCIALS DE LS EE.UU. (2016)  \n \n 6 - 1a part. Les Fake News  i la seva influ \u00e8ncia  actual:  Aquesta primera part del \ntreball serveix per posar els fonaments te \u00f2rics del meu TFG. S\u2019explica en que \nconsisteix aquest fenomen de les Fake News  amb definicions,  dades, exemples \ni estudis de com afecta a les persones. Es far \u00e0 un marc te\u00f2ric sobre el tema i es \nrespondran preguntes sobre aquest tema.  \n- 2a part. Estudi de cas: Les Fake News  a les Eleccions Presidencials dels EE.UU al \n2016. La segona part del treball cons isteix en aplicar tot el marc te \u00f2ric creat i \ntota l\u2019explicaci\u00f3 feta en un cas. Les Eleccions P residencials dels EE.UU al 2016 \nvan ser el comen \u00e7ament del ress\u00f2 d\u2019aquest fenomen que cada ve gada va a m\u00e9s. \nS\u2019analitzar\u00e0 una mostra noticies falses difoses, els c anals, les t\u00e8cniques, l\u2019 impacte \ni el seu descobriment. Mitjan \u00e7ant l\u2019an\u00e0lisi i t\u00e8cniques com el  Fact -Checking,  es \npodr \u00e0 explicar que vivim en un m\u00f3n ple de noticies falses .  \n \n        \n   \n \n             \n \n        \nTREBALL DE FINAL DE GRAU 2018 -2019. UVIC -UCC  \n 7 2. Les Fake News  i la seva influ \u00e8ncia en l \u2019actualitat  \n2.1. Marc Te \u00f2ric \n \nLes persones que tenen menys de 30 anys no llegeixen diaris, no posen la televisi \u00f3 \ndi\u00e0riament o no escolten la r \u00e0dio2. La tecnologia d \u2019Internet ha fet que els mitjans de \ncomunicaci \u00f3 tradicionals convinguin en un segon pla. Immediatesa i rapidesa s \u00f3n dues \nde les caracter\u00edstiques m\u00e9s importants que ens permet consumir noticies directament. \nI aix\u00f2, \u00e9s una font directe de Fake News.  \n \nEn el moment en el que es diu aquesta paraula, la gent ho associa directament, per\u00f2 cal \ndestacar  que el primer problema que ens trobem es neol\u00f2gic. Un problema que no \npermet entendre amb claredat el concepte que t\u00e9 i el que l\u2019envolta. Molts tamb\u00e9 \nanomenen les Fake News  com Desinformaci\u00f3.  \n \nPer sort, les persones adultes i d \u2019avan \u00e7ada edat segueixen fi dels. Tot i aix \u00f2, el futur del \npaper corre un perill molt recurrent i es veuen condemnats a canviar de rumb. La font \ndel jovent s \u00f3n les xarxes socials  com Facebook o Twitter, l\u2019epicentre de creaci\u00f3 i difusi\u00f3  \nde noticies falses, i de fet, son ells els que e s decanten per aquestes falsedats per qu\u00e8 \nconsideren que no estan informats, millor dit, no els interessa l\u2019actualitat3.  \n \nI aqu \u00ed trobem un altre problema. Hi ha poca diferenciaci\u00f3 i significaci\u00f3 sobre aquest \nconcepte, en joves i adults. \u00c9s una cosa que \u00e9s  necessari de saber degut al recent \ncreixement de la utilitzaci\u00f3 d\u2019aquesta t\u00e8cnica dissuasiva per manipular i desinformar a \nles persones. Un dels punts d \u2019aquest treball ser\u00e0 trobar soluci\u00f3 a aquest dubte.  \n El fenomen de les Fake News  va a m\u00e9s, gr\u00e0cies en part a la campanya del president dels \nEstats Units, Donald Trump. Per\u00f2 la detecci\u00f3 d\u2019aquestes, tot i tenir bones eines com el Fact -Checking, encara \u00e9s bastant complicada. Un usuari no pot veure a vista d\u2019ull si \u00e9s \nuna noticia certa o falsa. Hi ha punts que  ens fa caure una noticia com les imatges. \u201c Un \n80% del que veiem el recordem i nom \u00e9s el 20% del que llegim\u201d (Amor\u00f3s. 2018).  \n Les Fake News  busquen fastiguejar a alg \u00fa altre, sigui de l\u2019\u00e0mbit que sigui, malgrat que \nel que m \u00e9s ress\u00f2 medi\u00e0tic ha tingut \u00e9s l\u2019\u00e0mbit pol\u00edtic. i busquen interessos: interessos \necon \u00f2mics per lucrar -se e ideol\u00f2gics per manipular l\u2019opini\u00f3 p\u00fablica\n4. Els creadors de de \nnoticies falses no ho fan perqu\u00e8 volen, sin\u00f3 perqu\u00e8 s\u00f3n persones int eressades. No \nnom \u00e9s aix\u00f2, i \u00e9s que ara utilitzen xarx es socials o portals digitals per inf ormar- se, llocs \nf\u00e0cils per colar falsedats .  \n \n                                                 \n2 Marchi, Regina (2012).

(2016)  \n \n 8 Investigacions recents apunten a la creixent popularitat d\u2019info rmatius sat \u00edrics com The \nColbert Report (TCR), The Daily Show (TDS) o The Tonight Show (HBO ) i altres \nproducci ons sat \u00edriques i la depend\u00e8ncia creixent del p\u00fablic com a font de not\u00edcies  i \ninformaci\u00f35. Aix \u00f2 dona a pensar que, pels joves , les Fake News  es refereixen als \nprogrames de televisi\u00f3 d'entreteniment que parodien not\u00edcies utilitzant s\u00e0tires per \ndebatre els as sumptes p\u00fablics.  \n Tot aquest tema ja ha arribat, fins  i tot, als governs pol\u00edtics de molts pa\u00efsos . La Uni \u00f3 \nEuropea ja s\u2019ha p osat en marxa per veure e intentar controlar aquest fenomen, amb \nestudis i bar \u00f2metres\n6. Molts europeus consideren que poden detectar el que \u00e9s una \nnoticia falsa o una no, un debat que s\u2019ha comen\u00e7at a tractar al carrer.   \n Els mitjans de comunicaci\u00f3 tradicio nals tamb \u00e9 han posat l\u2019alerta en aquest tema. Estudis \ndemostren que aquest tipus de mitjans son els menys exposats a les noticies falses, per\u00f2 creuen que aix\u00f2 podria canviar amb el temps\n7. Clarament, els que son m \u00e9s vulnerable \nson els mitjans digitals, clarament demostrat com a difusors sense donar- se compte. \nPer\u00f2  encara hi ha un lloc m\u00e9s vulnerable com s\u00f3n les xarxes socials.  \n Un simple bot \u00f3 pot difondre qualsevol noticia falsa . Amb aquesta premissa molts \ncreadors de Fake News  comencen a fer la seva feina: distorsionar la societat i l\u2019opini\u00f3 \np\u00fablica. No nom\u00e9s les grans xarxes socials com Twitter  (com a creador de la agenda \ninformat iva) son difusors de contingut engany \u00f3s, sin\u00f3 que ara tamb\u00e9 arriba a la \nmissatgeria instant\u00e0nia, com Whatsapp\n8. \n \nPer\u00f2, perqu\u00e8 s\u2019ha tornat a fer fam\u00f3s aquest terme i s\u2019ha popularitzat aquest m\u00e8tode? \nEleccions per la presid\u00e8ncia dels Estats Units al 2016. Do nald Trump i Hillary Clinton \nlluitaven per un joc \u00f3s lloc a la Casa Blanca quan van comen\u00e7ar a proliferar Fake News  \ncontra Clin ton, una manera tan f\u00e0cil com compartir davant molt gent virtualment. \nEstudiar el cas, el gran cas que va destapar aquestes teorie s i t\u00e8cniques \u00e9s la segona part \nd\u2019aquest TFG.  \n \nEns trobem en un m \u00f3n en el que la digitalitzaci\u00f3 i la societat de la informaci\u00f3 ja formen \npart de les nostres vides. Ja no \u00e9s una utopia, sin\u00f3 una realitat. Apareixen noves t\u00e8cniques de manipulaci\u00f3 i la millo r trobada fins ara \u00e9s el de les Fake News .

UVIC -UCC  \n 9 Abans de donar un significat a les Fake News, s \u2019ha d\u2019explicar com arriba a les persones i \nels motius d\u2019aquesta. La Dra. Claire Wardle i Hossein Derakhshan van estudiar d \u2019una \nmanera cient\u00edfica aquest fenomen i van donar una s\u00e8rie  d\u2019explicacions sobre el \nfenomen, comen\u00e7ant pel trastorn de la informaci\u00f3 .  \n \n2.2.1. El trastorn de la informaci \u00f3 \n \nEl marc conceptual de les Fake News  t\u00e9 un nom: e l Trastorn de la Informaci\u00f39, que es \ndesglossa en tres parts.  \n \n1) Els tres tipus de trastorns de la informaci\u00f3: dis -informaci\u00f3, informaci\u00f3 err\u00f2nia i  mala \ninformaci\u00f3  \n2) Les Tres Fases del Trastorn de la Informaci\u00f3: Creaci\u00f3, Producci\u00f3 i Distribuci\u00f3  \n3) Els Tres Elements del Trastorn de la Informaci \u00f3: Agent, Missatge i Int\u00e8rpret  \n \n2.2.1.1. Els tres tipus de trastorns de la informaci \u00f3 \n \nGran part del discurs sobre \"not \u00edcies falses\" combina tres nocions: informaci\u00f3 err\u00f2nia, \ndesinformaci\u00f3 i mala informaci\u00f3. Per\u00f2 \u00e9s im portant distingir missatges que s \u00f3n \nveritables d'aquells que s\u00f3n falsos i missatges creats, produ\u00efts o distribu\u00efts per \"agents\" \nque pretenen fer mal per aquells que no s\u00f3n: \n \n- Dis-infor maci\u00f3 : Informaci\u00f3 f alsa i creada deliberadament per fer mal a una \nperson a, grup social, organitzaci\u00f3 o p a\u00eds. \n- Informaci \u00f3 incorrecta : Informaci\u00f3 falsa, per\u00f2 no creada amb la intenci\u00f3 de \ncausar danys.  \n- Mala informaci\u00f3 : Informaci\u00f3 basada en la realitat, utilitzada per infligir danys a \nuna persona, organitzaci\u00f3 o pa\u00eds.  \n \nA l\u2019estudi, es posen exemples de les \u00faltimes eleccions franceses , en les  que Emmanuel \nMacron va guanyar. Aqu \u00ed els exemples:  \n- Dis-informaci \u00f3: la creaci\u00f3  d'una sofisticada versi\u00f3 duplic ada del peri\u00f2dic Le Soir, \namb un fals article que afirmava que Macron estava sent finan \u00e7at per Ar\u00e0bia \nSaudita.  \n- Informaci \u00f3 Incorrecta : L\u2019atac als Camps Elisis del 20 d\u2019abril de 2017 va ser \ndesencadenant de moltes noticies falses . Les persones que compartien aquest \ntipus de contingut rares vegades ho fan per causar danys. M \u00e9s aviat, per ajudar \ni ser \u00fatil.  \n- Mala Informaci \u00f3: quan els correus electr\u00f2nics d'Emmanuel Macron eren  es va \nfiltrar el divendres abans de la votaci\u00f3 del 7 d'agost. La informaci\u00f3 continguda als correus electr \u00f2nics era real, tot i que la campanya de Macron suposadament \ninclo \u00efa informaci\u00f3 falsa per disminuir l\u2019 impacte  \n                                                 \n9 Wardle, Claire i  Derakhshan, Hossein ( 27 de setembre de 2017).

Quin format va prendre? Quins eren \nels caracter\u00edstiques?  \n- Int\u00e8pret: Quan alg \u00fa va rebre el  missatge, com ho van interpretar  missatge? \nQuines accions, si n'hi ha, van prendre?  \n \n   \n \n            \nLa intersecci \u00f3 entre informaci\u00f3 falsa, falsa i incorrecta s'adre\u00e7a a l voltant dels conceptes de falsedat i dany.  \nFont: Information Disorder Toward an interdisciplinary framework for research and policymaking  \nEls actors del trastorn de la informaci \u00f3 \nFont: Information Disorder Toward an interdisciplinary framework for \nresearch and policymaking  \n \nTREBALL DE FINAL DE GRAU 2018 -2019.

Significat de les Fake News  \n \nQuan parlem d \u2019aquest concepte  i d\u2019aquesta uni\u00f3 de paraules, podem trobar \nconnotacions que canvien d\u2019una manera o un altra el significat.  Molts prestigiosos \ndiccionaris tenen tamb \u00e9 la seva i, de fet, consideren que \u00e9s una  paraula molt buscada \nen l\u2019actualitat.  \n \nEl diccionari de la Universitat de Cambrigde considera que les Fake News s \u00f3n \u201chist\u00f2ries \nfalses que semblen not\u00edcies, difoses a Internet o utilitzant altres mitjans, generalment creades per influir en opinions pol\u00edtiques o com una broma\u201d . Amb aquest concepte \nexpliquen que \u00e9s una falsedat.  \n D\u2019altra banda, trobem la definici\u00f3 del Diccionari Collins. \u201cI nformaci\u00f3 falsa, sovint \nsensacional, difosa sota  l\u2019aparen\u00e7a d\u2019una cobertura de premsa\u201d. Curta per\u00f2 directe. \nAquesta va ser la paraula de l\u2019any 2017 segons el propi diccionari. Perqu\u00e8? Doncs perqu \u00e8 \nla popularitat que li va donar Donald Trump va fer augment\u00e9 s en un 365% la seva cerca.  \n Per\u00f2 aquesta paraula  s\u2019ha convertit en un arma de doble fil. Una de les persones m\u00e9s \nestudioses sobre aquest fenomen, la doctora Claire Wardle, creu que el terme s'ha convertit en una arma que pol \u00edtics i col\u00b7lectius utilitzen per atacar- se uns a altres volent \nfer veure que te nen la veritat  absoluta. A m \u00e9s, no explica la complexitat de la situaci\u00f3 i \ngenera confusi\u00f3 en els debats medi\u00e0tics i pol\u00edtics.  \n Tampoc defineix b \u00e9 el fenomen: si pensem en \u201c not\u00edcies falses \u201d ens ve al cap un format \ndeterminat: un article, amb el seu titular, la seva foto i el seu desenvolupament i el \nLes fases del trastorn de la informaci \u00f3.

De moment ho podr \u00edem dir d\u2019una manera  \nmolt clara: les Fake News  s\u00f3n m\u00e9s que informacions tendencioses o manipulades, s\u00f3n \nmentides. Per fer una definici \u00f3 m\u00e9s acurada, podr\u00edem fer -ho de la seg \u00fcent manera.  \n Les Fake News s\u00f3n informacions falses dissenyades per fer -se passar per noticies amb \nl\u2019objectiu de difondre un engany o una desinformaci\u00f3 deliberada per obtenir una fi determinada, habitualment de tipus pol \u00edtic o financer.  \n Per\u00f2 el problema arriba quan hi ha alguns te\u00f2r ics no volen parlar d\u2019aquest terme. \nTrobem un problema neol\u00f2gic.  \n \n2.2.3. El problema neol \u00f2gic  \n \nClaire Wardle, una de les persones que m \u00e9s est\u00e0 estudiant el fenomen, considera que \ntot el m\u00f3n considera que ens referim com a Fake News  a la desinformaci\u00f3. Als experts \nen aquesta mat\u00e8ria no els hi agrada dir noticia falsa perqu \u00e8 no hi ha un consens clar \nsobre aquesta definici \u00f3.  \n \nEl terme Fake News  s\u2019ha convertit en un arma de doble fil que pol \u00edtics i col\u00b7lectius \nutilitzen per la seva pr\u00f2 pia fi amb l\u2019objectiu de demostrar tenir la veritat absoluta. La \nparaula crea confusi\u00f3  en la societat i pol\u00edtica, a m\u00e9s de no explicar la complexitat que t \u00e9 \naquesta situaci \u00f3 en la actualitat.  \n Aquest problema amb la paraula provoca tamb \u00e9 una confusi\u00f3 en l es persones: si \npensem en Fake News,  molts pensen en el format determinat de l\u2019article. Tot i que \naquest problema \u00e9s enc ara m\u00e9 s gran com memes, captures, v \u00eddeos... aquesta \u00e9s la \ndesinformaci\u00f3 a la que m\u00e9s estem exposats.  I la desinformaci\u00f3 seria la paraula m\u00e9s clara \nper parlar d\u2019 aquest fenomen.  \n \n2.2.4. La Desinformaci \u00f3, el significat vertader  \n \nSegons la RAE, desinformar t \u00e9 dos significats:  \n \n- Donar informaci\u00f3 intencionadament manipulada al servei de certs fins  \n- Donar informaci\u00f3 insuficient o ometre -la \n \nEls experts parlen de desinformaci\u00f3 perqu\u00e8 no nom \u00e9s es tracta d \u2019una cosa que \u00e9s \npurament fals, s in\u00f3 tant a all\u00f2 mancat de context,  com per exemple un article sat \u00edric. Si \nuna persona no sap del context quan llegeix una noticia aix\u00ed, se l\u2019ha pot creure com una noticia real.  \n Quan parlem de Fake News , les persones tamb \u00e9 limitem a un format definit, com una \nnoticia. Com he mencionat abans, aquest problema es molt m \u00e9s gran del que ens \nTREBALL DE FINAL DE GRAU 2018 -2019. UVIC -UCC  \n 13 pensem, ja que no nom\u00e9s les noticies poden manipular, sin\u00f3 que tamb\u00e9 altres formats \ncom les fotografies o v\u00eddeos son objectes de desinformaci\u00f3.  \n Per tant, \u00bfhem de canviar e l terme de Fake News  per Desinformaci\u00f3? La resposta \u00e9s que \nno \u00e9s necessari. Es pot dir com es vulgui, per\u00f2 hem de remarcar que si volem parlar que \nsi tractem el gran problema que comportar aquest tipus de manipulaci\u00f3 hem de parlar de desinformaci\u00f3. Fake Ne ws el podr \u00edem dir com una paraula associada a desinformar, \nper\u00f2 que no dona tota la  realitat de la situaci\u00f3.  \n El portal FirstDraft News\n10, un portal creada per l \u2019experta Claire Wardle en el que es \nparla del m\u00e8todes de manipulaci\u00f3, Fake News  i desinformaci\u00f3, considera que aquesta \n\u00faltima paraula \u00e9s la que m\u00e9s defineix aquest m\u00f3n. Pel porta l, la definici\u00f3 de \ndesinformaci\u00f3  m\u00e9s acurada es la seg\u00fcent.  \n \u201cLa fabricaci\u00f3 o manipulaci\u00f3 deliberada de contingut audiovisual incloent la creaci\u00f3 intencionada de rumors i teories de la conspiraci \u00f3\u201d. \n \nEls motius els va donar la pr\u00f2pia doctora Wardle amb Hossein Derakhshan en l \u2019informe \n(esmentat anteriorment) pel Consell Europeu Information Disorder Toward an \ninterdisciplinary framework for research and policymaking11 \n \u201cEns abstenim d'utilitzar el terme \u201c Fake News \u201d, per dues raons. En primer lloc, \nlamentablement \u00e9s inadequat per descriure el complex fenomen de la contaminaci\u00f3 de \nla informaci\u00f3. El terme tamb\u00e9 ha comen\u00e7at a ser apropiat pels pol\u00edtics de tot el m\u00f3n per descriure a les organitzacions de not \u00edcies la cobertura troben desagradable.

Les Motivacions per crear falsedats  \n \nEl periodista i creador de Bellingcat, un portal d \u2019investigaci\u00f3 online  per a periodistes, \nEliot Higgins, va intentar estudiar i investigar quines s \u00f3n les motivacions principals per \nles persones per desinformar a les persones i crear Fake News . En una conferencia TED \na Amsterdam13, Higgins va donar quatre raons per la creaci\u00f3 i difusi\u00f3  de Fake News , \nanomenant -les \u201cThe Four P\u201d .  \n \n- Passi \u00f3 \n- Propaganda  \n- Partidisme  \n- Pagament  \n                                                 \n13 Eliot Higgins (2017).

UVIC -UCC  \n 15 Els motius de Higgins van quedar molt clars. Les quatres P tenen diverses explicacions:  \n \n- Passi \u00f3: es demostra en aquelles not \u00edcies referides a temes molt medi\u00e0tics, on els \nusuaris s'identif iquen i es posicionen f\u00e0cilment. Per aquest motiu, tenen \npotencial per adquirir un to groc i sensacionalista.  \n- Partidisme:  busquen influir o modificar la conducta o el pensament dels usuaris. \nUn gran exemple s \u00f3n les eleccions presidencials dels EE.UU dels 2016, que \nveurem en la segona part del treball.  \n- Propaganda i Pagament : ambd \u00f3s motivacions van juntes , segons Higgins. S \u2019ha \ndemostrat que les Fake News  tenen una fi propagand\u00edstica perqu\u00e8 permet \narribar a moltes persones en poc temps. El fenomen dels clics tamb\u00e9 est\u00e0 \nassociat als diners i \u00e9s que cada clic on es punxa una noticia falsa \u00e9s una quantitat guanyada gr\u00e0cies als anunciants. A m\u00e9s a m\u00e9s, tamb\u00e9 s\u2019ha descobert que moltes \nempreses posen en valor la compravenda de les dades dels usuaris.  \n \nLa Dra. Claire Wardle va anar m\u00e9s en ll\u00e0. Basant -se en la llista que va fer el seu company \nHiggins, ella va trobar quatre motivacions m\u00e9s perqu\u00e8 les persones cre\u00efn i difonen Fake News  en la societat de la informaci\u00f3.

De fet, segons el Papa Francesc en una conferencia 52 Jornada Mundial \ntitulada \"La veritat us far \u00e0 lliures (Jn 8, 32). Fake news  i periodisme de pau\", va ser la \nserp \u201cl'art\u00edfex de la primera fake news \", a l'enganyar Eva, barrejant veritat i mentida, \namb un objectiu clar.  \n Per comen \u00e7ar parlant d \u2019aquest tema, citem a Jacob Soll en un article en el que parlava \nde la \u201c brutal\u201d  historia de les Fake News . \u201cEl sensacionalisme sempre es ven b\u00e9. A \nprincipis del segle XIX, es van comen\u00e7ar a produir els diaris moderns, per\u00f2 tamb\u00e9 les hist\u00f2ries falses per augmentar la circulaci\u00f3 d\u2019aquestes. Una noticia falsa que va ser el detonant d\u2019aquesta pr\u00e0ctica va ser la \"Gran lluna de  la Lluna\". Al 1835, el New York Sun  \nva afirmar que hi havia una civilitzaci\u00f3 alien\u00edgena a la lluna i amb aix\u00f2 es va establir com a diari l\u00edder i rendible\u201d\n14 \n                                                 \n14 Jacob Soll ( 18 de desembre de 2016) .

Ha estat part de \nla hist\u00f2 ria medi\u00e0tica molt abans que els mitjans socials, des de la invenci\u00f3 de la \nimpremta. La primera noticia falsa que es reconeix data de 1475 a Trento, It\u00e0lia: Un nen \nde 2 anys anomenat Simonino havia desaparegut, i un predicador francisc\u00e0, Bernardino da Felt re, va donar una s\u00e8rie de sermons al\u00b7legant que la comunitat jueva havia \nassassinat al nen. Els rumors es van estendre r\u00e0pidament. Abans de temps, Feltre afirmava que el cos del nen havia estat trobat al soterrani d'una casa jueva. En resposta, el bisbe de  Trento, Johannes IV Hinderbach, va ordenar la detenci\u00f3 i tortura de tota la \ncomunitat jueva de la ciutat. Quinze d'ells van ser considerats culpables i cremats a la foguera. La hist\u00f2ria va inspirar comunitats circumdants per cometre atrocitats similars.  \n A la d\u00e8cada de 1890, els periodistes i peri\u00f2dics rivals de Joseph Pulitzer i William Hearst van competir amb el p\u00fablic a trav\u00e9s del sensacionalisme i els rumors com si fossin fets reals, una pr\u00e0ctica coneguda en aquella \u00e8poca com a \"periodisme groc\", aques ta \u00e9s la \nprimera vegada es que veu la paraula Fake News\n15. Les seves incertes not\u00edcies van jugar \nun paper important, per exemple, en liderar el EE.UU a la Guerra de Cuba de 1898.  \n \nUna de les motivacions per als peri\u00f2dics de 1890 que participen en el period isme groc \n\u00e9s el mateix que avui dia per als creadors de not\u00edcies falses: les not\u00edcies exagerades amb t\u00edtols amb impactes que reben atenci\u00f3 i donen clics promovent la venda de publicitat. \nEn la forma de mitjans de comunicaci\u00f3 tradicionals, la majoria de la gent ha apr\u00e8s millor \nque fer resums de not\u00edcies tan seriosament com ho va fer en l'\u00e8poca de periodisme groc.  \n Les Fake News  van ser la ordre del dia durant els per\u00edodes b\u00e8l\u00b7lics. Va ser utilitzat per \nm\u00e0quines de propaganda nazi per construir fervor anti semita. Va jugar un paper en  la \nIl\u00b7lustraci\u00f3, quan la falsa explicaci\u00f3 de l'Esgl\u00e9sia cat\u00f2lica del terratr\u00e8mol de Lisboa de \n1755 va provocar que Voltaire es pronunci\u00e9s contra el domini religi\u00f3s. A la d\u00e8cada de \n1940 als Estats Units, el sentiment racista va portar a la publicaci\u00f3 d'hist\u00f2ries falses \nsobre les suposades defici\u00e8ncies i delictes dels afroamericans.  \n \nLa difusi \u00f3 de falsedats per distorsionar la visi\u00f3 de la realitat del receptor i modificar la \nseva conducta ha existit des de sempre, molt abans de la cr eaci\u00f3 de les xarxes  socials. \nEn molts cap \u00edtols de la historia mundial, mitjan \u00e7ant informaci\u00f3 falsa es manipulava a les \nmasses per afavorir una causa o una altra.  \n \nL\u2019\u00fani ca diferencia que podem trobar amb l \u2019actualitat \u00e9s la seva manera de difusi\u00f3 .

Se'l va acusar entre altres coses de donar suport a l'aristocr\u00e0cia o de voler instaurar la monarquia, casant al seu fill John Quincy Adams amb una filla del rei d'Anglaterra. Tot era mentida.  \n El rebombori de les Fake News  s\u2019ha donat en molts casos, per\u00f2  quan van arribar Donald \nTrump i les eleccions generals de EE.UU al 2016, la popularitat de la paraula que es va esmentar despr\u00e9 s de molt temps, va tornar a generar el creixent fenomen que ara vivim \nen l\u2019actualitat.  \n \nEncara m\u00e9 s rebombori va agafar quan una petita localitat de Maced \u00f2nia van comen \u00e7ar \na guanyar diners difonent noticies falses per grups de Facebook .

Per\u00f2 ara, amb el m\u00f3n \ninterconnectat gracies a Internet i la immediatesa de les xarxes socials, els clics i la rapidesa s\u2019han convertit en un factor important. Les formes han canviat molt.  \n \n2.4.2. La guerra de la Informaci \u00f3  \n \nGenerar contingut r \u00e0pid  per aconseguir el m \u00e0xim benefici amb una capacitat de difusi \u00f3 \nelevada ha fet que els mitjans tradicionals i d \u2019internet competeixen per veure qui \u00e9s el \nque arriba primer. La investigadora Danah Boyd ho fa palpable amb un concepte que \ns\u2019ha utilitzat mol ts cops en l \u2019antiguitat: la Guerra de la Informaci\u00f3.\n17 \n El concepte de la Guerra de la Informaci\u00f3 consisteix en l'\u00fas de la informaci\u00f3 amb l'objectiu d'aconseguir una avantatge competitiva, com volen fer les Fake News  de \nmoltes maneres. El concepte s\u2019utilitz ava m\u00e9s en el per\u00edodes b\u00e8l\u00b7lics, ja que pot consistir \nen recollir informaci\u00f3 t\u00e0ctica, confirmar la veracitat de la informaci\u00f3 pr\u00f2pia, en la \ndistribuci\u00f3 de propaganda o desinformaci\u00f3 per a desmoralitzar l'enemic i el p\u00fablic, en \nminar la qualitat de la informaci\u00f3 de l'enemiga de la for\u00e7a i en negar oportunitats de \nrecollir informaci\u00f3 a les forces enemigues.  \n Tornant a l \u2019explicaci \u00f3 de Boyd, el concepte s \u2019ha utilitzat per comen \u00e7ar una creuada \ncontra el anomenen \u201c generadors de falsedats \u201d. Parafrasejant el mentor del nou \nmoviment de l\u2019extrema dreta als Estats Units, Steve Bannon, hi ha una guerra \nd\u2019informaci\u00f3  entre mitjans, persones amb influencia i tamb \u00e9 els lectors, que molts cops \ntenen esperit cr \u00edtic o no. Les paraules que exactament Bannon va remarcar les va f er a \nun periodista durant una entrevista amb el New York Times\n18. \u201cVost \u00e8 \u00e9s del partit de \nl'oposici\u00f3.

El partit de l'oposici\u00f3 \u00e9s la \npremsa\u201d.  \n \nLa creuada de Donald Trump contra els mitjans de comunicaci\u00f3  tamb\u00e9 ha afavorit que \nhi hagi una guerra d\u2019informaci\u00f3, perqu\u00e8 els periodistes han vist com el seu treball s\u2019ha \nlimitat per les treves que posen moltes organitzacions. Aquest motiu ha fet perdre, \nsegons Boyd, la objectivitat de molts periodistes, un greu problema.  \n \nAquest greu problema no nom\u00e9s s\u2019ha expandit pels mitjans, sin\u00f3 tamb\u00e9 per les agencies \nde noticies. Per a Danah  Boyd , les agencies han estat entrenades per centrar -se en \ninformar i mantenir un model conceptual de normes malgrat que no estan ben equipades per comprendre que poden tenir un paper en aquesta guerra, que les seves \naccions i decisions estan perfilant la forma en qu\u00e8 es produeix la guerra.  \n                                                 \n17 Boyd, Danah (27 de gener de 2017).

Explicaci \u00f3 del cas:  \n \nLes eleccions presidencials celebrats als Estats Units l\u2019any 2016 van ser un punt d\u2019inflexi \u00f3 \nen el que es refereix a la popularitat de les Fake News . Amb l\u2019arribada de Donald Trump \ncom a candidat i els seus vincles i les seves pol\u00e9miques que podrien provocar conflictes d\u2019interessos, \u00e9s un bon moment per aquells que volen  manipular la opini\u00f3 p\u00fablica i \ncontrolar a les masses.  \n La popularitzaci\u00f3 d\u2019aquest terme s\u2019ha fet present en els mitjans de comunicaci\u00f3 de masses en l\u2019actualitat. Per\u00f2 s\u00f3n les xarxes socials les que m\u00e9s perilloses en quan a les noticies falses es refereix en, i es que la seva funci\u00f3 de propagaci\u00f3 m\u00e0xima en un m\u00f3n \ninterconnectat ha perm\u00e8s que corrin pel m\u00f3n amb un sol clic.   \nPer a aquells que volen fer fake news  pels seus propis interessos o per interessos d\u2019uns \ntercers \u00e9s perfecte: propaguen a gran nivell una falsedat i, a sobre, poden guanyar diners \namb facilitat. Un pla perfecte que va comen\u00e7ar a tenir rebombori a les eleccions \npresidencials dels EE.UU al 2016, de nou.   \nEs diu  de nou perqu\u00e8 aix\u00f2 ja va existir en \u00e8poques passades, quan la propaganda pol\u00edt ica \nera present a la l\u2019Alemanya nazi o en molts punts del m\u00f3n. Ara, ha evolucionat i s\u2019ha \nconvertit en un m\u00e8tode m\u00e9s f\u00e0cil d\u2019enviar i m\u00e9s dif\u00edcil de detectar i controlar.  \n Als Estats Units, les Fake News  tenen un significat m\u00e9s potent. Els c onceptualitzem com \na senyals distorsionades sense correlaci\u00f3 amb la veritat. Les falses not\u00edcies sorgeixen en equilibri, ja que \u00e9s m\u00e9s econ\u00f2mic que proporcionar senyals precises, ja que els consumidors no poden inferir la precisi\u00f3 sense cost i perqu\u00e8 els consumidors poden gaudir de not\u00edcies partidistes. Les not\u00edcies falses poden generar utilitat per a alguns consumidors, per\u00f2 tamb\u00e9 imposen costos privats i socials, fent que els consumidors puguin inferir el veritable estat del m\u00f3n, per exemple, fent que els votants sigui n m\u00e9s \ndif\u00edcils de deduir quin candidat electoral prefereix.  \n El focus de preocupaci \u00f3 ha canviat amb les xarxes socials. Les plataformes de \nmitjans socials com  Facebook  tenen una estructura dram \u00e0ticament diferent a les \ntecnologies medi \u00e0tiques anteriors, sense filtres y amb una connexi\u00f3 directa amb \nqualsevol persona.  \n Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton van ser els dos candidats (republic\u00e0 i dem\u00f2crata) per aquestes noves eleccions.

Tot el que \nrealment es pot comprovar \u00e9s que el director del FBI, James Co mey, ha treballat per a \norganitzacions del passat que han donat diners o s'han associat amb la Fundaci\u00f3 Clinton.  \n \nFont: New York Times  \nTREBALL DE FINAL DE GRAU 2018 -2019. UVIC -UCC  \n 39 Fins ara, Brietbart no ha pogut demostrar cap prova en la qual Comey va participar \ndirectament o es va beneficiar de qualsevol de les transaccions. Quant a la reivindicaci\u00f3 \ndels impostos,  Peter Comey \u00e9s contractat per DLA Piper, un despatx d'advocats \nmultinacional. Segons Breitbart, DLA Piper va d ur a terme una auditoria independent de \nla Fundaci\u00f3 Clinton el 201 5, encara que no hi ha evid\u00e8ncies  que recolzin  aquesta \nafirmaci\u00f3.  \n \nL\u2019\u00fanic vincle clar entre DLA Piper i la Fundaci\u00f3 Clinton \u00e9s un dels socis de la firma, Kathy Keneally. Abans d'incorporar- se a l'oficina de DLA Piper a Nova York el 2014, Keneally va \ntreballar com a fiscal general adjunt de la divisi\u00f3 fiscal del departament de just\u00edcia. Durant el seu temps a la DOJ, Keneally va dur a terme una revisi\u00f3 de quatre anys de la declaraci\u00f3 de la Fund aci\u00f3 Clinton entre el 2010 i el 2013.  \n An\u00e0lisi:  podem veure que en aquest cas podem trobar que aix\u00f2 \u00e9s un contingut \nmanipulat en favor dels conservadors. El contingut \u00e9s fabricat perqu\u00e8, tot i que hagi una relaci\u00f3 entre la fundaci\u00f3 i els implicats, no s\u2019ha trobat cap prova o evidencia que \ndemostri que Comey va rebre milions de d\u00f2lars de manera fraudulenta i nom\u00e9s \u00e9s per \ndesprestigiar al director del FBI i a la candidata  dem\u00f2crata.  \n \nD\u2019altre banda, el contingut \u00e9s manipulat perqu\u00e8 hi ha coneixen\u00e7a de la relaci\u00f3 entre ambdues parts, per\u00f2 no s\u2019 aporten les proves i no es demostra que el que informa sigui \ncert. Per tant, no hi ha veracitat en la informaci\u00f3 , el que ens dona a p ensar que el \ncontingut, a part de ser fabricat, ha estat manipulat  pels interessos republicans.  \n \nPer \u00faltim, el contingut \u00e9s impostor per suplantar fonts genu\u00efnes.

Tot i aix\u00f2, poques vegades podem \nveure algun mitj\u00e0 conegut  entre els defensors de la ideologia (The Political Insider o \nBreitbart News).  \n No obstant aix\u00f2, es pot veure clarament que la seva exposici\u00f3 nom\u00e9s \u00e9s gran quan fan \nalguna noticia que no sigui vera\u00e7 i \u00e9s falsa.

Tot i ser un tema \nque cada vegada encara t \u00e9 m\u00e9s ress\u00f2 medi\u00e0tic, encara podem trobar molts dubtes sobre \naquest fenomen.   \n \nLes Fake News  son un fenomen que sempre ha estat present en la nostra societat. Els \nfamosos \u201cbulos\u201d o les noticies, imatges o informacions falses que s\u2019han publicat en molts \nmitjans amb les seves respec tives rectificacions. A la hist\u00f2 ria hi ha molts casos de \nnoticies falses, sigui a l\u2019Edat Mitjana o en l\u2019actualitat, i en molts temes destacats. (tornar a redactar)  \n Per\u00f2, per  qu\u00e8 ha agafat embranzida aquest fen omen latent en la no stra societat? La \nresposta es pe r la tecnologia imperant i, cada vegada, m\u00e9s modern a a m\u00e9s de la \nmecanitzaci\u00f3 en el proc\u00e9s de creaci\u00f3 de les noticies falses. La tecnologia cada vegada est\u00e0 millor i hi ha maneres molt senzilles de poder falsejar la informaci\u00f3 i enganyar a les persones.  \n D\u2019altra banda, podem dir que hi ha una mecanitzaci\u00f3 en el proc\u00e9s de les noticies falses. Hem pogut observar que hi ha una tend\u00e8ncia clara a la creaci\u00f3 de les noticies i un objectiu concret, aspecte  de la que parlarem despr\u00e9s. Un titular amb molt de \u201cmorbo\u201d i \nun cos de la noticia amb molta c\u00e0rrega ideol\u00f2gica \u00e9s la plantilla clara per una noticia falsa. Moltes, de fet, tamb\u00e9 poden estar acompanyades per una imatge manipulada.  \n \nEl que podem dir \u00e9s que hi ha moltes maneres de manipular i desinformar a les persones mitjan\u00e7ant les noticies falses. Directament, assegurar que una fotografia \u00e9s d\u2019un lloc concret i es demostra que no \u00e9s aix\u00ed, ja est\u00e0 desinformant. (Repensar).  \n Abans, la millor manera de difondre era el fam\u00f3s boca a boca. Alg\u00fa feia c\u00f3rrer el rumor cap a altres persones i sense contrastar, es difonia cap a altres fins arribar a tothom. Les Fake News  es poden aprofitar per aix\u00f2, per\u00f2 han trobat un altre manera m\u00e9s r\u00e0pida i \nque pot arribar a m\u00e9s gent , i aquestes s\u00f3n les xarxes socials.  \n Amb un simple bot\u00f3 es pot difondre un a falsedat:  aquesta es la premissa a seguir quan \nparlem de les xarxes socials i la seva amplia difusi\u00f3. Amb un m\u00f2bil i disposar un \npensament per poder canviar l\u2019 opini\u00f3 p\u00fablica de les persones ... . Aix\u00ed \u00e9s com funciona \naquest fenomen, i el principal problema \u00e9s que no hi ha una soluci\u00f3.  \n La tecnologia emprada en l\u2019actualitat fa que hi hagi la possibilitat de falsejar i desinformar a les persones, per\u00f2 no ha trobat cap manera per poder eradicar i parar la desinformaci\u00f3 que es crea i la mentida que impera en moltes xarxes socials com \nFacebook . Hi ha plans, intents, opinions, per\u00f2 de moment no hi ha accions per poder \nparar- ho. Tecnol\u00f2gicament parlant, no hi ha cap enginy per subsanaro.  la pol\u00edtica sembla \nque tampoc  hi ajuda. Actualment, \u00e9s dif\u00edcil trobar una t\u00e8cnica per parar aquest fenomen, \nTREBALL DE FINAL DE GRAU 2018 -2019.

El fenomen de les Fake News  nom\u00e9s ha come n\u00e7at i promet anar a m\u00e9s.

Tot i que la seva \npopularitat al m\u00f3n ha anat baixant en picat, als Estats Units continua tenint \u00e8xit... \ni \u00e9s el que menys controlat est\u00e0. Prova d\u2019aix\u00f2 s\u00f3n els casos que han sortit sobre \nvenda de dades,  a m\u00e9s que la gran majoria de noticies falses s \u00f3n compartides per \naquesta xarxa social.

Perqu\u00e8 va tornar a popularitzar la parau la Fake News  i tamb\u00e9 va comen\u00e7ar una campanya contra els mitjans que pensaven \ndiferent  a la l\u00f2gica Trump.  \n \nAquesta campanya, tot i ser contra grans corporacions com la CNN, va ser la t\u00f2nica de \nla seva carrera cap a la Casa Blanca. Aquesta estrat\u00e8gia va se r creada pel guru de la nova \nextrema dreta, Steve Bannon, que ha seguit VOX a Espanya i que als Estats Units va aconseguir for\u00e7a adhesions . Malgrat que va ser una campanya negativa cap als mitjans \ntradicionals, molts tamb\u00e9 van posar l\u2019ull sobre la veracitat de  les informacions de molts \nportals web .  \n S\u00f3n els propis pol\u00edtics els que donen m\u00e9s visibilitat a les noticies falses per poder \ndesprestigiar una ideologia, pol\u00edtic o partit.

Per ser m\u00e9 s clars, tots els experts consultats coincideixen que els partits \npol\u00edtics tenen un a rma ideol\u00f2gica  i poderosa, a m \u00e9s de que en processos electorals, les \nnoticies falses tenen una incid\u00e8ncia  gran, sense especificar si a la intenci\u00f3  de vot o a la \nmobilitzaci\u00f3 .  \n \nLa paraula dels experts consultats per aquest treball tamb \u00e9 ens demostra que el \nfenomen canvia amb el temps, muten aix \u00ed a t\u00e8cniques  m\u00e9s sofisticades i amb l\u2019 objectiu \nde ser dif \u00edcils de detectar i ser un arma encara m \u00e9s poderosa del que \u00e9s en l \u2019actualitat. \nEls experts recalquen que amb una educaci \u00f3 sobre com veure la informaci\u00f3  seria m\u00e9 s \nsenzill  poder detectar noticies falses.  \n \nPer acabar aquest Treball de Fi de Grau, m\u2019agradaria fer dos pensaments: el primer, una reflexi\u00f3 sobre nosaltres, els periodistes, i la nostra feina davant aquest fenomen que cada vegada \u00e9s m\u00e9s extens i dif\u00edcil de detectar. La nostra feina \u00e9s explicar qu\u00e8  passa \nd\u2019una manera clara, rigorosa i vera\u00e7 , i les Fake News  atempten contra  la normalitat \nperiod\u00edstica.  \n Malauradament, hi ha molts mitjans i molts periodistes, sigui per interessos econ \u00f2mics, \npol\u00edt ics o ideol \u00f2gics, que no fan una reflexi\u00f3 profunda sobre  aquest fenomen i \ncontinuen sense contrastar les noticies, vital pel periodisme en l\u2019actualitat i una manera de poder recuperar la confian \u00e7a perduda en el temps en l \u2019activitat \nperiod\u00edstica. La prova es que el 2018, 26 pa \u00efsos tenen \u201c ex\u00e8rcits de periodistes \u201d per \ndonar informaci \u00f3 a favor del govern de torn.\n38 \n                                                 \n38 Freedom House (2018).

As a group we set out to study \nthe \u201cmisinformation problem\u201d in the areas where social media platforms \nwere seemingly working with great ardor to address it: elections and the \npandemic. How are they contending with misinformation in the areas that \nhave their special focus, some years on from the seminal \u201cfake news\u201d crisis? \nIn preliminary work we had found that platforms such as Facebook appeared \nactive in retarding the spread of extreme viewpoints and sources that directly \nrelated to elections and the pandemic but less successful in immediately \nadjacent areas such as election-related social issues and vaccines.\nWhat have platform efforts to curb the misinformation problem yielded? \nThe findings we report here are both generalizable as well as platform-\nspecific, which are the two sides of our cross-platform analysis. Generally, \nsocial media platforms are mainstreaming the fringe and marginalizing the \nmainstream. As others have found, extreme viewpoints and sources, particu -\nlarly from one side of the political spectrum, are receiving disproportionate \nengagement compared to other sources. But we made the additional, broad \nobservation that even in issue areas deemed serious\u2014elections and the pan -\ndemic\u2014mainstream media are less referenced or otherwise marginalized.\nMore specifically, the manner in which the platforms decenter the \nmainstream differs. Twitter, for example, has high percentages of \u201chyper -\npartisan\u201d sources present in tweets concerning politics, and while not in \nthe majority, many of Facebook\u2019s most engaged-with sources would be \nclassified as \u201cfake news,\u201d if one deploys the original definition by Craig \nSilverman in the seminal 2016 Buzzfeed News  article ushering in the term. \nWhere other platforms are concerned, Instagram users prefer influencers \nover experts, and rely on their social responsibility in debunking falsehoods. \nTikTok users parody mainstream media, and Reddit and 4chan (at least \ntheir leading forums and boards) dismiss it and send users to alternative \ninfluence networks and YouTube videos with extreme cultural commentary. \nGoogle Web Search, whose results for political queries we also studied, \nreturns more quality than alternative media but the presence of these \nsources decline as the election nears, owing to the preponderance of what \nthe researchers call special interest sites. Incidentally, we also found that \nin election-related Google returns the sources are politically imbalanced.\n8 T he Pro Pa gaTion  of Mi Si nfor MaTion  in\u00a0Social Media\nAs I note in the opening chapter, the social media platforms have \nintroduced \u201ceditorial epistemologies\u201d for elections and the pandemic, \nauthoring lists of authoritative sources that appear when one queries core \nelection-related or pandemic-related keywords or making other manual \ninterventions beyond commercial content moderation, the outsourced, \nlow-wage work of removing offensive content. They also have had to assume \nthe role of \u201caccidental authorities,\u201d developing rapidly evolving source and \ninformation adjudication policy that at the same time invites backlash for \nheavy-handedness as well as competition from \u201calt-tech\u201d platforms that \nmoderate with a lighter touch. The extent of the platforms\u2019 editing, and \nparticularly where it ends, is on display in each of the studies.\nEach of the chapters benefits from techniques developed to capture the \ndata necessary to exhibit the current state of the misinformation problem. \nSome rely on platform-supplied data (Twitter, Instagram), another on a \nrepurposed marketing data dashboard (Facebook) and others on scraping \n(Google Web Search, Reddit, 4chan, TikTok). There is also a study that uses \none platform (4chan) to analyze another (YouTube), given the copious \nreferencing of YouTube videos by \u201calternative influencers\u201d and later to \nvernacular newcomers. Many of the studies also classify sources as main -\nstream or alternative (to varying degrees) as well as evincing a political bent, \nrelying on (and triangulating) external classification schemes developed \nby journalists and other media analysts.\nThe platform studies were undertaken twice (and on occasion three \ntimes), first in the early run-up to the U.S. presidential elections and the \npandemic (March, 2020) and again after the elections and deeper into the \npandemic (January, 2021 and/or March, 2021). One of the Twitter studies \ntakes advantage of the data spanning the Capitol riots of January\u00a06, 2021 in \nWashington, DC, allowing for the analysis of how the platform\u2019s subsequent \npurge of accounts had an impact on the quality of the sources encountered.\nThe studies have been written up in the format of the Harvard Kennedy \nSchool Misinformation Review , where earlier versions of the Facebook and \n4chan/Reddit chapters were published. It is a format that leads with the \nresearch questions and is followed by an essay summary, the implications \nand the findings. The methods section comes last. To us the format highlights \nthe relevance of the work to journalists and thus also serves well the col -\nlaboration with First Draft.\nRichard Rogers\nNovember, 2022\n1 \u201c Serious queries\u201d and \u201ceditorial \nepistemologies\u201d\nHow social media are contending with misinformation\nRichard Rogers\nAbstract\nThe following concerns the \u201cmisinformation problem\u201d on social media \nduring the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Employing data \njournalism techniques, it develops a form of cross-platform analysis that \nis attuned to both commensurability as well as platform specificity. It \nanalyses the top-ranked political content on seven platforms and finds that \neach marginalizes mainstream media and mainstreams the fringe. TikTok \nparodies mainstream media, while 4chan and Reddit dismiss it and direct \nusers to alternative influence networks and extreme YouTube content. \nTwitter prefers the hyperpartisan over it. Facebook\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d problem \nconcerns declining amounts of mainstream media referenced. Instagram \nhas influencers dominating user engagement. By comparison, Google Web \nSearch buoys special interest sites. It concludes with a discussion of how \nplatforms filter the content through increasing editorial intervention.\nKeywords: Problematic information, content moderation, cross-platform \nanalysis, platform criticism, fringe media\nIntroduction: The politics of problematic information and its \ncross-platform study\nWhile scholars of hearsay, rumor and conspiracism would point to the history \nof its staying power (Olmsted, 2009), the spread of misinformation and other \nproblematic information is said to be \u201csupercharged\u201d by contemporary \nsocial media (Bounegru et al., 2018; Daniels, 2018). The following examines \nRogers. R. (ed.), The Propagation of Misinformation in Social Media: A Cross-platform Analysis . \nAmsterdam: Amsterdam University Press 2023\ndoi: 10.5117/9789463720762_ch01\n10 T he Pro Pa gaTion  of Mi Si nfor MaTion  in\u00a0Social Media\nthat thesis through an analysis of the current state of what globally could \nbe called the \u201cmisinformation problem\u201d (Allcott et al., 2019) across seven \nonline platforms: TikTok, 4chan, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram \nand Google Web Search. The part played by YouTube is viewed by way \nof the videos referenced on 4chan. The case in question is the political \ninformation environment in the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections, \nor what may be dubbed U.S.-based, \u201cpolitical Facebook,\u201d \u201cpolitical Twitter,\u201d \n\u201cpolitical Instagram,\u201d etc. Borrowing a technique from data journalism, \nand examining the most interacted-with content around the candidates, \npolitical parties and election-related issues, the work reported here found \nthat stricter definitions of misinformation (imposter sites, pseudo-science, \nconspiracy, extremism only) lessen the scale of the problem, while roomier \nones (adding \u201chyperpartisan\u201d and \u201cjunk\u201d sites serving clickbait) increase it, \nalbeit rarely to the point where it outperforms mainstream media.\nThe misinformation problem differs per platform. On such youthful \nplatforms as TikTok and to a lesser extent Instagram, misinformation may \nbe delivered sarcastically or insincerely, making it difficult to characterize \nintent (Phillips and Milner, 2017). On the masked or anonymized political \nboards and communities of 4chan and Reddit, problematic sources are \nnot as copiously referenced as mainstream ones, but that finding does not \nmean to suggest the absence of a problem, as the most referenced collection \nof sources (on 4chan) are extreme YouTube videos, many of which end up \nbeing deleted from the platform. The users of mainstream social media as Twitter and Facebook continue to point in great proportions to hyperpar -\ntisan sources, originally defined as \u201copenly ideological web operations\u201d \n(Herrman, 2016). Political spaces on Instagram, however, were found to \nbe the \u201ccleanest,\u201d where most election-related content is non-divisive and \nearnestly posted, and influencers, with some exceptions, were found to be \nresponsible information providers, debunking rather than spreading 5G \ncoronavirus conspiracy theories.\nThe research provides a technique for \u201ccross-platform analysis,\u201d or the \nexamination of a single phenomenon (through engagement analysis) across a \nvariety of social media. It thereby addresses critiques of \u201csingle platform studies,\u201d \nwhere societal trends or phenomena are seen through one social media lens \nwithout the benefit of a comparative perspective that would furnish a baseline \n(Rogers, 2019). Engagement analysis of a single subject matter (election-related \ninformation, in this case) is considered one robust cross-platform approach \nsince it captures each platform\u2019s top content, which refers to the posts or web \nURLs that receive the most interactions (directly or indirectly). It has the \nbenefit of being more global in its outlook compared to other cross-platform \n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 11\napproaches that rely on seeking one or more digital objects shared across \nplatforms (e.g., a hyperlink) and comparing resonance (Rogers, 2017).\nBut the cross-platform approach put forward here is not blind to platform \nspecificities. It seeks to account for differing platform metrics, vernaculars \nof use and user subcultures. Accounting for this \u201cmedium specificity\u201d is \nperformed in at least three ways. The first is that engagement is measured \ndistinctively per platform, as discussed in some detail below. Second, social \nmedia manipulation (such as artificially amplifying misinformation so \nthat it appears to be engaged-with content) also differs per platform. One is \ninterested in fake followers on Instagram and bots on Twitter, for example. \nBeing attuned to platform vernaculars, finally, rests on the study of cultures \nof use. For example, certain sound effects or facial gestures on TikTok suggest \ndisbelief or mistrust. In all, commensurability thereby relies on both the \ncross-platform study of engagement as well as individual platform analyses \nimbued with a medium-specific approach.\nIn the following I first introduce the current misinformation problem \nonline as bearing some resemblance to the quality of information debates \nfrom early web history. The contemporary concerns, however, flow from the \n\u201cfake news\u201d crisis of 2016, together with the continual study of the extent \nto which the platforms have addressed the issue (and how they have done \nso). Moreover, these debates have not escaped the politicization of \u201cbig \ntech\u201d and its supposed \u201cliberal bias\u201d (Vaidhyanathan, 2019), a claim that is \nalso a source of empirical study in the Google Web Search analysis below.\nIndeed, designating certain information as problematic may be political \n(and increasingly politicized), because, as others before us also have found \n(Benkler et al., 2018; Rogers and Hagen, 2020), it is more prevalent on the \nright side of the political spectrum, as are problematic or \u201cinauthentic\u201d \nusers, though they are not alone there. Making a case for balancing the \npartisanship of sources outputted by social media and search engines \n(rather than serving filter bubbles through personalization, for example) is \namong the emerging source adjudication methods under consideration, as \nI will discuss. The piece concludes with a discussion of source criticism on \nsocial media, including the recent rise of \u201ceditorial epistemologies\u201d alongside \ncrowdsourced ones associated with the (early) web.\nUncertainty online renewed\nThe web historically has been thought of as a space for the unsubstanti -\nated, authored by rumormongers, conspiracy theorists and all manner of \n12 r ichard rog erS \nself-publishers and fringe contributors. Indeed, one could argue, as it was put \nin 1994, that on the web \u201cthe eminent and the crackpot\u201d stand side-by-side, \na feature once celebrated as a productive collision (Rheingold, 1994; Rogers, \n2004). Indeed, in early internet studies, next to the blurring of the real and \nthe virtual, conspiracy theory in particular but also the production and \ncirculation of rumor were subjects of study, before notions as the \u201cwisdom \nof the crowd\u201d and projects as Wikipedia appeared to place the web on a less \nshaky epistemological footing (Dean, 1998; Shirky, 2008). Arguably, social \nmedia have put paid to that brief period of relative stability. Conspiracists or \nat least those who discuss such phenomena as the link between 5G and the \ncoronavirus are among some of the high-profile influencers or microcelebrities \nfound there (Bruns et al., 2020).1 In turn, scholars now write, as they did two \ndecades earlier, that the internet is \u201cmainstreaming the fringe\u201d (Barkun, 2016).\nThe recent uptick in attention to the study of problematic content online \ncould be attributed as well to the \u201cfake news crisis\u201d of 2016, where it was \nfound that so-called fake news outperformed mainstream news on Face -\nbook in the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections that year (Silverman, 2016). That finding also set in motion the subsequent struggle around the \noccupation of the term from a type of news originating from imposter \nmedia organizations or other dubious sources to a \u201cpopulist\u201d charge against \nmainstream and \u201celite\u201d media that seeks to delegitimate sources found \npublishing inconvenient or displeasing stories (van der Linden et al., 2020).\nIn its recent study we have had calls to cease using the term, fake news \n(Pepp et al., 2019). There also has been a series of classification moves. \nBoth the expansion as well as contraction of the notion may be seen in its \nreconceptualization by scholars as well as by the platforms themselves \n(Venturini, 2019). The definitional evolution is embodied in such phrasings \nas \u201cjunk news\u201d and \u201cproblematic information,\u201d which are broader in their \nclassification, while the platforms appear to prefer terms such as \u201cfalse\u201d \n(Facebook), which is narrower (Rogers, 2020a).\nOn the back end the platform companies also develop responses to these \nactivities. They would like to automate as well as outsource its detection \nand policing, be it through low-wage, outsourced content moderators, \n(volunteer) fact-checking outfits or user-centered collaborative filtering \nsuch as Twitter\u2019s \u201cbirdwatchers,\u201d an initiative they say born of societal \ndistaste for a central decision-making authority, as found through qualitative \ninterviews (Gillespie, 2018; Roberts, 2019; Coleman, 2021). They also take \nmajor decisions to label content by world leaders (and indeed have world \n1 5 G is the \u201cfifth generation\u201d technology standard for mobile phone networks.\n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 13\nleader content policies), which subsequently land platform governance and \ndecision-making in the spotlight (Twitter, 2019).\nMore broadly there has been a rise in the study of \u201ccomputational \npropaganda\u201d and \u201cartificial amplification\u201d which the platforms refer to \nas \u201cinauthentic behavior\u201d (Woolley and Howard, 2016; Colombo and De \nGaetano, 2020). These may take the form of bots or trolls; they may be \n\u201ccoordinated\u201d by \u201ctroll armies,\u201d which has been outlined in Facebook\u2019s \nregular \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior reports\u201d (Facebook, 2021a). As its \nhead of security policy puts it, Facebook defines it (in a plain speak manner) \nas \u201cpeople or pages working together to mislead others about who they are \nor what they are doing\u201d (Facebook, 2018). Occasionally datasets become \navailable (by Twitter or other researchers) that purport to be collections of \ntweets by these inauthentic, coordinated campaigners, whereupon scholars \n(among other efforts) seek to make sense of which signals can be employed \nto detect them (Roeder, 2018).\nOther types of individuals online have caught the attention of the plat -\nforms as \u201cdangerous\u201d (Facebook), and have been deplatformed, a somewhat \ndrastic step that follows (repeated) violations of platform rules and presum -\nably temporary suspensions (Rogers, 2020b). \u201cDemonetization\u201d also is among \nthe platforms\u2019 repertoire of actions, should these individuals, such as extreme \ninternet celebrities, be turning vitriol into revenue, though there is also \nthe question of which advertisers attach themselves (knowingly or not) to \nsuch content (Wilkinson and Berry, 2020). Moreover, there are questions \nabout why certain channels have been demonetized for being \u201cextremist.\u201d \nOthers ask, is \u201ccounter-speech\u201d an alternative to counter-action (Bartlett \nand Krasodomski-Jones, 2015; Gagliardone, 2019)?\nOn the interface, where the metrics are concerned, there may be fol -\nlower factories behind high follower and like counts (Lindquist, 2019). The \nmarketing industry dedicated to social listening as well as computational \nresearchers have arrived at a series of rules of thumb as well as signal \nprocessing that aid in the flagging or detection of the inauthentic. Just as \nsudden rises in follower counts might indicate bought followers, a sudden \ndecline suggests a platform \u201cpurge\u201d of them (Confessore et al., 2018). Perhaps \nmore expensive followers gradually populate an account, making it appear \nnatural. Indeed, there is the question of which kinds of (purchased) followers \nare \u201cgood enough\u201d to count and be counted. What is the minimum amount \nof grooming? Can it be automated, or is there always some human touch? \nFinally, there is a hierarchy in the industry, where Instagram followers \nare the most sought after, but \u201cinfluencers\u201d (who market wares there) are \noften contractually bound to promise that they have not \u201cparticipated in \n14 r ichard rog erS \ncomment pods (group \u2018liking\u2019 pacts), botting (automated interactions), or \npurchasing fake followers\u201d (Ellis, 2019).\nHaving touched upon the current state of uncertainty online, I would \nlike to turn to how problematic information manifests itself in social media \nplatforms around specific social issues as well as election-related keywords. \nThe following recounts a cross-platform analysis into the \u201cmisinformation \nproblem\u201d in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. As noted above, \nthe overall approach is to study most engaged-with content with a sensitivity \nto platform metrics, vernaculars of use and user subcultures. It relates a \nset of empirical studies that enquire into the extent to which platforms are \nagain mainstreaming the fringe, examining more specifically those spaces \nconjured through \u201cserious queries\u201d that contain election-related as well \nas COVID-19 information. When querying political hashtags, candidate \nand party names as well as issues, and sifting through the content most \ninteracted with on the platforms, how do more mainstream sources fare \nin comparison to those characterized as problematic? More to the point, \nis social media marginalizing the mainstream?\nHere I take the most salient findings per platform in turn, before conclud -\ning with a discussion of the emergence of editorial epistemologies put into \nuse by social media platforms as well as search engines. Editorial source \nadjudication is a remarkable transformation in how these platforms sift \nand filter sources, indicating an exceptional information state, a point \nupon which I conclude.\nTikTok: Instilling doubt in mainstream accounts\nTikTok is not usually considered a site for political encounter, but recently \nthe short video sharing platform, used predominantly by youth, has posted \nrules about political content, indicating its growing presence there. It also \nwarns against \u201cmisleading information\u201d and urges users to \u201cverify facts \nusing trusted sources,\u201d suggesting that misinformation could be worthy \nof investigation on the platform (TikTok, 2020). Apart from how to think \nabout TikTok\u2019s place in political discourse, we asked, how do TikTok users \nexpress themselves politically? How may forms of creative expression on \nTikTok manifest themselves as misinformation?\nOn TikTok the most engaged-with videos (returned through platform \nqueries of hashtags) are fresh and topical, which implies that the platform can \nbe regarded as an event-commentary medium, where users may encounter \npolitical \u201cnews\u201d first through its parody. Political parody in media has a long \n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 15\nhistory, though here the argument is that rather than specialized magazines \nsuch as Punch , the British weekly satirical magazine (1841\u20132002), or The \nOnion , an American one (1988\u2013 ), it is a regular or \u201cmainstream mode\u201d of \nelection engagement for users of the platform.\nHow are they expressing themselves? The singing and dancing users \ndemonstrate a form of civic engagement by making, tagging and uploading \nvideos that are characterized as forms of \u201cplayful political performances\u201d \nas well as \u201cremixing as ambivalent critique.\u201d The playful performances \ninclude \u201cgiving a speech\u201d as well as \u201cstaging an opinion\u201d such as when a \nman speculates that he hears \u201cthank God for Donald Trump\u201d in the song, \nDa Da Da. The remixing of news clips and other video that is typical on \nTikTok satirize candidates, their supporters as well as their viewpoints by \nintroducing sounds that sew mistrust or ridicule, though it is not always clear \nwhether the critique is sincere or ironic, thereby meriting the description \n\u201cambivalent critique\u201d (Philips and Milner, 2017).\nThese sounds are networked objects in the sense that one can select and \nfollow the sound to other videos that have embedded it. The sounds are \noften deployed in analogous manners, meaning that the audio pathway \nwill lead to more remixed videos that satirize the candidates and their \nsupporters, or videos that have stitched into the another with the sound \nin order to comment on it (e.g., by commenting on it or mocking it). For \ninstance, \u201cRide It\u201d by Regard is a viral sound that is often paired with finger \ndancing to relate stories of cultural misunderstanding. TikTokers have used \nit when dealing with accusations of being a Trump supporter, such as \u201cget called racist 24/7\u201d (sound), \u201cget yelled at for presenting facts\u201d (sound), and \n\u201caccused of not respecting women\u201d (sound). The viral sound denotes being \nmisunderstood, eliciting sympathy but also a knowing smile.\nTikTokers employ a range of creative expression such as singing, dancing, \nduet, lip-syncing, mimicking, finger dancing, viral sounds and facial expres -\nsions. Some have specific connotations for TikTok insiders and make for \ntrends. Having queried election related hashtags, such as #trump2020 and \n#biden2020, it was found first that TikTokers make copious use of political \nhashtags, attaching both Trump and Biden-related hashtags to the same \nvideo, thereby striving to maximize the audience and view counts, rather \nthan identify with one candidate or another. In the analysis, the researchers \nundertook a format and content analysis of the top 30 videos per hashtag \nquery, examining which forms of creative expression are used in political videos and where misinformation may be imparted.\nApart from viral sounds, two other forms of creative expression stand out: \nlip-synching and facial expressions. TikTokers match the lip movements of \n16 r ichard rog erS \nthe candidates, often sarcastically, for example when the comedian, Sarah \nCooper, lip-synched Trump\u2019s remarks during a White House briefing on using \nultraviolet light and detergent to thwart the coronavirus (2020). Finally, the \nfacial expression that approximates the doubtful emoji is another creative \nexpression often encountered. In these videos news footage may be cut \ninto the shots, such as multiple clips of Joseph Biden hugging women, with \nthe intention to sew doubt about his fitness for presidential office. Here \nwe found many of the political videos instilling mistrust in news clips \nthrough sarcastic and doubtful facial expressions. Such a finding prompted \nconsideration of adding \u201cinstilling mistrust\u201d as a category of misinformation \ntypes developed by Wardle (2017), which ranges from parody (least intent \nto deceive) through misleading content and false context to fabricated \n(most intent). Alternatively, one could argue that on TikTok all categories \nof misinformation could be hybridized, for TikTokers are employing parody \nwhen simultaneously introducing misleading content, false context or other \nmisinformation types.\n4chan and Reddit: Referencing extreme YouTube content\nUnlike public-facing platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, where users \ncultivate an online self, 4chan and Reddit are so-called masked spaces of \nanonymous users (De Zeeuw and Tuters, 2020). Particularly the board, \n4chan/pol, and the subreddit, r/TheDonald, have been associated with \nelection politics, and especially the 2016 Trump campaign, where support \nfor his candidacy took the form of \u201cthe great meme war,\u201d which comprised \nthe deployment of vernacular language, image macros and other tactical \nmedia to support the candidate\u2019s cause (Donovan, 2019). Previous research \ninto misinformation in 4chan/pol and across Reddit found little reference \nto outwardly problematic sources, such as imposter news sites or (Russian) \ndisinformation, but rather numerous links to extreme videos on YouTube \nthat were later removed (Hagen and Jokubauskait\u0117, 2020). Thus, while not \nnecessarily a space that links to disinformation sources, it is problematic \nfor other reasons.\nHere, in the context of the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections of \n2020, the research enquired into the extent to which U.S.-based political \nboards and forums on 4chan and Reddit share misinformation and \u201cjunk\u201d \ncontent, and more specifically imposter news and other types of \u201cpink slime\u201d \nwebsites, termed as such for the use of low-cost, newspaper-like sites often \npublishing repurposed content (Tarkov, 2012; Bengani, 2019). We also were \n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 17\nquestioning the interest these boards and communities might have in what \nhas been termed an \u201calternative influence network,\u201d a group of extreme \nsocial media influencers that \u201cfacilitates radicalization\u201d (Lewis, 2018). The \nresearch employed the so-called \u201cneedle-to-haystack\u201d technique, querying \n4chan/pol and all of Reddit for the URLs of the pink slime websites, and the \u201chaystack-to-needle\u201d technique which queries an expert list of problematic \nsources (hosts) in the same platform datasets (Hagen and Jokubauskait\u0117, 2020).\nThere are two separate sub-studies, one covering the period from \nJanuary\u00a011, 2019 to March\u00a025, 2020 and the second picks up where the first \nended and runs to December\u00a031, 2021. Throughout no pink slime sites were \nencountered, suggesting either their lack of significance (despite returning \nhigh in Google queries) or the media literacy of the users on the boards and \ncommunities (or both). Modest amounts of problematic sources were found \nbut like in previous research copious YouTube links were identified, which \nled to the inquiry into whether YouTubers from the alternative influence \nnetwork are significantly present in those online cultures. The alternative \ninfluence network (AIN) is described here as a set of YouTube channels \nfluctuating between \u201cnews and personality-centric vlogging, spreading \nmisinformation-laden commentary\u201d (Burton and Koehorst, 2020). Indeed, \nin the first period, many of these channels were found between the boards \nand subreddits under study, though their presence was unequally distributed. \n4chan/pol and Reddit are rather different in their media consumption, with \npolitical Reddit preferring to reference videos using the \u201calternative debate \nstyle\u201d and /pol electing more for the \u201ctoxic vox populist\u201d style of single person, \ndirect-to-audience (Tuters and Burton, 2020). Indicating their extreme \nspeech, a significant percentage of the YouTube videos referenced on 4chan \nhas been removed by the platform. In the second period in the run-up to the \nelections, however, the alternative influence network\u2019s presence declined \nsignificantly. It should be noted that in June\u00a02020 Reddit closed r/TheDonald \nas well as other extreme subreddits for breaking platform rules. The decline \nin links to the AIN coincided with the deplatforming as well as the decline \nin \u201cjunk news\u201d referenced in political Reddit. But given the AIN\u2019s decline on \n4chan (where no analogous deplatforming took place) one could speculate \nthat they were no longer considered \u201calternative\u201d for the fringe space.\nTwitter: Hyperpartisan sources in ascendancy\nLike Facebook and to a lesser extent Instagram, Twitter also has been the focus of public attention concerning misinformation around the 2016 U.S. \n18 r ichard rog erS \npresidential elections and beyond. Twitter, rather unlike the other two \nplatforms, has aided researchers in its study through providing curated \ndatasets of Russian and alleged Iranian trolls and influence campaigners, \nor what are referred to as inauthentic users (Gadde and Roth, 2018). Thus, in \nthe study of misinformation on Twitter, there are generally two strands of \nanalysis to consider\u2014problematic content as well as users. During the 2016 \nelection campaigning and running through to at least late 2019, much of that \ncontent and those users, described as \u201csprawling inauthentic operation[s]\u201d \nwere promoting \u201cpro-Trump messages\u201d (Romm and Stanley-Becker, 2019).\nHere we revisit these claims through a study of the content and users on \n\u201cpolitical Twitter\u201d in the early run up to the 2020 U.S. presidential elections \nand its aftermath, where we examine result sets of queries for election-\nrelated hashtags and keywords, together with the users most active in \ndeploying them (Groen and Geboers, this volume). How much problematic \ninformation is present in the most interacted-with content on political \nTwitter? Are problematic users among the most active? Are they generally \nof a particular political persuasion?\nThe content under study are the URLs (hosts) that are referenced in the \ntweets, and the most active users defined as those who tweet the most. In a \nthree-week timeframe prior to and just after Super Tuesday (March, 2020), \nwhen a cluster of election primaries and caucuses were held, in the aftermath \n(December, 2020 / January, 2021) and after the dust had settled on the Capitol \nbuilding riots (March\u00a02021), we compared the hosts found in the tweets to a \nlist of problematic sources curated by combining pre-existing labeling sites, \nincluding Allsides.com, Media Bias/Fact Check, \u201cthe Chart,\u201d and NewsGuard. \nWe also consulted Wikipedia and other news sources mentioning the sources \nin question. With one exception (related to the query DACA, the immigration \nissue), we found little reference to disinformation, imposter news sources, \npseudo-science, conspiracy theory sources or extreme sites. When expanding \nthe definition of problematic information to include hyperpartisan sites, \nhowever, in the first period nearly half would fall into that category, with the \nimplication that social media (or at least a goodly share of users of political \nTwitter) appear to marginalize mainstream sources. Put differently, if we \nwere to employ Craig Silverman\u2019s original definition of \u201cfake news,\u201d it could \nbe said to challenge mainstream sources anew, as it had in the immediate run-up to the 2016 U.S. elections (on Facebook) (2016). In December\u00a02020 / \nJanuary\u00a02021 the proportion of hyperpartisan hosts in the examined tweets \ndecreased slightly, but by March, 2021, after Twitter removed users breaking \nplatform rules (e.g., of glorification of violence) that figure was significantly \nlower, suggesting a \u201cdeplatforming effect.\u201d\n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 19\nFor the study of the most active users, we analyzed \u201cauthenticity\u201d with \nthe aid of SparkToro, which employs indicators (abnormal tweeting activity, \nunusual combinations of followers/following, etc.) to make a determination. \nWe also studied user partisanship or side-taking through qualitative profile \nanalysis. Our findings are not dissimilar to others in that there is far more \ninauthenticity in the pro-Trump user base, but we also found that there are \na few flagged users on the other side of the political spectrum, too.\nFacebook: The seminal \u201cfake news\u201d problem persists\nJournalists began calling Facebook the seminal \u201cfake news machine\u201d (Gal -\nlucci, 2016) just after the finding made by Buzzfeed News  that so-called \nfake news was liked and shared more than mainstream news on the social \nmedia platform in the three months prior to 2016 U.S. presidential elections \n(Silverman, 2016). Since then, there has been a steady stream of stories from \nFacebook\u2019s corporate blog concerning both its crackdowns on \u201cinauthentic \ncoordinated behavior,\u201d or influence campaigning, as well as its initiatives to \ncurb misinformation and \u201cfalse news,\u201d which is a narrow definition includ -\ning pseudo-science and conspiracy sites though excluding hyperpartisan \nones (Mosseri, 2017). The measures began in at least April\u00a02017 with among \nother plans to economically disincentivize such sources as the infamous \nMacedonian fake news factory that chose divisive pro-Trump messaging \n(over pro-Sanders\u2019) because it brought in far more revenue (Silverman and \nAlexander, 2016; Tynan, 2016). Has much changed in how well \u201cfake news\u201d is consumed on the platform since 2016?\nA team of researchers and I revisited the original Buzzfeed News  story and \nits data journalism method in order to investigate the state of the \u201cfake news\u201d \nproblem in January\u2013March, 2020 (Rogers, 2020a), which is roughly the first \nof the three timeframes under consideration in the original Buzzfeed News  \npiece entitled, \u201cviral fake election news stories outperformed real news on \nFacebook\u201d (Silverman, 2016). We investigated again in January\u00a02021, looking \ninto the run-up to the election as well as its aftermath, from March\u00a02020 \nuntil the end of December, 2020.\nSilverman defined \u201cfake news\u201d as sources ranging from \u201choax sites [to] \nhyperpartisan blogs\u201d (Silverman, 2016). Akin to his method, we ran election-\nrelated queries in BuzzSumo, the social media research and monitoring \ntool. From the results we compiled a list of sources and characterized them \nwith the aid of a series pre-existing \u201cbias\u201d labeling sites, as in both Twitter \nand Google studies in this volume, so that we had a rough indication of \n20 r ichard rog erS \ntheir quality and partisanship. Sources are categorized as problematic or \nnon-problematic (which more colloquially could be called \u201cmainstream\u201d), \nand those falling into the latter category were subcategorized as (hyper)\npartisan-conservative, (hyper)partisan-progressive or neither of the two, \nagain with the aid of the existing labeling sites. Problematic sources included \nimposter news (and so-called \u201cpink slime\u201d sites), pseudo-science, conspiracy \ntheory and extreme sites, as was done in the Twitter study above (Bengani, \n2019).\nWhen using Silverman\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d definition (that includes hyperparti -\nsan sites) Facebook\u2019s fake news problem has worsened slightly. In the seven \ntimeframes under study (from March\u00a02019 to December\u00a02020) the proportion \nof engagement of \u201cfake news\u201d to mainstream was on average 1:1.8 compared \nto 1:2.6 in 2016. If, however, we tighten the definition, as Facebook has done, \nto \u201cfalse news\u201d and include in that category only the sources or stories flagged \nas \u201cproblematic\u201d the scale of the problem drops substantially to 1 in 12 on \naverage per quarter. It should be noted that we encountered one imposter \nnews site, which may suggest that they are well targeted by Facebook or \nthat they are not significantly resonating among users.\nNonetheless, in the last period under study in 2016, when Silverman \nfound that \u201cfake news\u201d performed well, imposter sites (as the Denver Guard -\nian) comprised a majority of those most interacted-with. One implication \nof the finding is that efforts to identify imposter sites (and other \u201cpink \nslime\u201d) continue to have value, despite the fact that they are not yet well \nconsumed. Another implication is that if the problem remains of a smaller \nscale, scaled-up fact-checking may continue to find its place amongst \nthe counter-initiatives, rather than only mass content moderation and \nautomation.\nInstagram: Influencers as responsible information sources?\nInstagram had been one of the more understudied and under-appreciated \nsocial media platforms when it came to misinformation. That changed with \nthe release of two major reports on the Russian disinformation campaigning \nsurrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential elections (Howard et al., 2018; DiResta \net al., 2018). In fact, in one study, it was noted that unlike the other social \nmedia platforms Instagram actually saw a rise in disinformation activity in \nthe period just after the elections (Howard et al., 2018). Many of the posts, \nincluding memes, were openly divisive, but others were sarcastic and more \ndifficult to decode with respect to stance or side-taking. As scholars have \n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 21\nfound, over the past few years more and more content online could be \ndescribed as equivocal or ambivalent, where the sincerity of the post and \nthe sender is unclear (Phillips and Milner, 2017; Hedrick et al., 2018).\nIn the study of election-related Instagram posts in the early run-up to the \n2020 U.S. presidential elections (January\u2013April, 2020) and in the run-up to \nthe election and its aftermath (September, 2020\u2013January, 2021), we enquired \ninto the amount of divisive and ambivalent posts, compared to non-divisive \nand earnest ones (Colombo and Niederer, this volume). How sarcastic and \n\u201cedgy\u201d are the top election-related posts on Instagram? Does it form the \ndominant mode of political discourse on the platform? We also are interested \nin whether misinformation is spread in this divisive, ambivalent style. To \nbegin to answer these questions, we queried CrowdTangle, Facebook\u2019s \ncontent monitoring tool, for the names of the candidates and select social \nissues (healthcare, gun control, COVID-19 and 5G), and coded the top 50 \nposts for divisiveness (or non-divisiveness) and ambivalence (or earnestness), \nwhereby each post is ultimately given a hybrid label, e.g., divisive-ambivalent. \nWe scrutinized the candidate- or issue-related posts by influencers that had \nparticularly high engagement scores, often at the top of the rankings. We \nalso sought misinformation.\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, we found Instagram to be a rather healthy \nplatform. The vast majority of the top posts concerning the candidates as \nwell as the social issues are earnest and non-divisive. Virtually no posts \nwere found to be divisive and ambivalent. Indeed, most posts were sincere \nexpressions of support. Of the few divisive posts which the coders addition -\nally found to be earnest, half were by Donald Trump or Donald Trump, Jr., \nand most of the rest concern Trump or gun control. Apart from a few posts \npushing a conspiracy theory surrounding 5G and COVID-19 (including \none post that ranked second in engagement), no other misinformation \nwas encountered. The top 5G related post, by an influencer, debunked the \nconspiracy. Indeed, with a few exceptions we also found that the influencers \nwere posting responsibly and earnestly.\nIn a separate exercise we studied the authenticity of the followers as well \nas the political parties, employing the HypeAuditor tool. While, in both \ntimeframes, the Republican Party\u2019s account had over 25% of suspect follow -\ners, and Trump\u2019s had 25%, Biden was not far behind at about 20%. His party \nalso had 25% of suspect followers. It should be noted that when separating \nthe two categories that make up inauthentic followers\u2014\u201cmass follower\u201d \naccounts and \u201csuspect\u201d accounts\u2014in the first period the Republican Party \nand Trump tally higher on suspicious followers, defined as \u201cInstagram bots \nand people who use specific services for likes, comments and followers \n22 r ichard rog erS \npurchase\u201d (Komok, 2020), while in the second period the candidates and \nparties grow closer together in their suspect counts.\nGoogle Web Search: Liberal sources outnumber conservative \nones\nWhile Google Web Search could be considered the dominant information \nmachine online, among the major platforms and online services it has been \none of the least studied for misinformation. Recognizing the potential for \nits spread during the pandemic, or what the head of the WHO called the \n\u201cinfodemic\u201d (UN DGC, 2020), Google has been curating the results for queries \nconcerning the COVID-19 pandemic, with side bars ordering the official \ninformation served, and results geo-tailored to provide local and national \nresources. Such information curation is rather unprecedented, unless one \ncounts Google\u2019s disclaimer notice on top of the results page for the query \n\u201cJew\u201d (Sullivan, 2004), or the cleaning up of autosuggested queries to remove \nethnic, homosexual and other slurs (Gibbs, 2016). Another contemporary \ncontext behind the study of election-related Google results concerns the \ndebate surrounding \u201cliberal tech bias\u201d (Schwartz, 2018). Could Google results \nbe thought to exhibit a bias towards or against particular types of sites? \nHow to characterize the sites returned for political queries?\nIn order to start to answer these questions, we queried candidate names, \npolitical parties and a host of election-related issues in Google, with results \nfrom the \u201cU.S. region\u201d from January\u00a012, 2019 to March\u00a023, 2020 and again from \nMarch\u00a024, 2020 to January\u00a05, 2021 (Torres, this volume). In an examination \nof the top 20 results per query, we ask, how to characterize the sources \nreturned? Are problematic sources present and even highly ranked? How \ncould the results be characterized politically? To do the analysis, we curated \na source list of problematic and non-problematic sources, largely news \nand cultural commentary, combining a set of media labeling sources, as \nin the Twitter and Facebook projects discussed above. We also consulted \nWikipedia and online news mentions of potentially problematic sources. \nThe categorization is considered rough and is meant to give an indication \nrather than a determination. With the aid of the labeling sites, we also \nassigned political leanings. There are two distinctive political categorization \nschemes, one \u201cample\u201d and one \u201cnarrow,\u201d with the former merging center-left \nand left and center-right and right, and the latter only including left (liberal) \nor right (conservative) labels, according to the sites that sort sources in such \na fashion. (When there was disagreement among the labeling sites, we went \n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 23\nwith the majority.) We also labeled the sites returned that fell outside the \ncategories, such as \u201cspecial interest,\u201d \u201clocal news\u201d and \u201cofficial.\u201d\nIn all we found that the Google results for our nearly 120 queries resulted in \nscant problematic information returned. Hardly present as well were official \nsources that we defined as federal or local government, intergovernmental \nagencies, politicians, or campaign websites. Special interest sites, a broad \ncategory ranging from think tanks to advocacy groups, have an outsized pres -\nence in the results, however, especially in the run-up to the elections. These \nsites tend to specialize in an issue or industry, which is also an indication of \nhow Google values information sources. Most significantly, when considering \nthe political leanings of sources, it is striking that Google could be said not \nto seek \u201cbalance.\u201d That is, liberal sources outnumber conservative ones in the results for all queries made. Employing the \u201cample\u201d categorization, for \nthe first period, the results were 6:1 in favor of liberal sources, and 3:1 when \nemploying the narrower scheme, and for the second period they jumped \nto 12:1 and 14:1.\nMarginalizing the mainstream\nAt the outset the question to be addressed concerned the extent to which \nsocial media is \u201cmainstreaming the fringe,\u201d not so unlike the early web, \nprior to the development of epistemologies that placed it on firmer ground. \nAmong those mentioned were the wisdom of the crowd such as Wikipedia\u2019s \ncollaborative editing, but there were others. For instance, Yahoo! and DMOZ \nemployed librarianship in their directory-making, Google used hyperlink \nanalysis scientometrically, and the early U.S. blogosphere constituted a kind \nof fact-checking, epistemic community, most famously uncovering faked \ndocuments held up as authentic by an authoritative TV news program (60 \nMinutes), in what has become known as the \u201cKillian documents controversy\u201d \n(Callery and Proulx, 1997; Langville and Meyer, 2006; Wikipedia contributors, \n2020). Here we now ask the same of social media. How to characterize the current epistemological foundations of online platforms?\nIn order to grapple with that question, I briefly sum up the findings \nwith respect to the relationship between the mainstream and the fringe \nper platform and draw conclusions from our cross-platform approach. \nGenerally speaking, social media and its users appear to be marginalizing \nthe mainstream. Subsequently, I discuss the prospects of source adjudication \nin terms of results curation or otherwise managing which content is allowed \nto remain on social media platforms. It is a form of \u201cplatform criticism\u201d \n24 r ichard rog erS \nthat speaks to the various emerging epistemologies on offer to stabilize \nsocial media.\nThe social media platforms under study have varied relationships with main -\nstream media, at least with respect to those sources or posts most interacted \nwith in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential elections and its aftermath. \nBroadly speaking, TikTok parodies it, 4chan and Reddit dismiss it and direct \nusers to alternative influence networks and extreme as well as conspiratorial \nYouTube content. Twitter nearly prefers the hyperpartisan over it. Facebook\u2019s \n\u201cfake news\u201d problem also concerns declining amounts of mainstream media \nreferenced. Instagram has influencers (rather than, say, experts) dominating \nuser engagement, though is a rather healthy space. By comparison, Google \nWeb Search buoys the liberal mainstream (and sinks conservative sites), but \ngenerally gives special interest sources, as they were termed in the study, the \nprivilege to provide information rather than official sources.\nThese findings were made on the basis of cross-platform approach that \nseeks to attain commensurability of the findings through employing engage -\nment analysis on each platform. At the same time, it remains sensitive to \nthe platforms\u2019 specificities by remaining attuned to each of their differing \nmetrics, vernaculars of use and user subcultures, as related above.\nOverall, we found that social media marginalize the mainstream, albeit in \nmanners specific to each platform. Given the decline of what one could call \n\u201cmainstream authority\u201d online, how to characterize the contemporary ap -\nproaches to source adjudication, when considering problematic information? \nThat platforms are manually editing results (for certain queries) indicates what I would call an \u201cexceptional information state.\u201d\nRecently, social media platforms and Google web search have begun to \ncurate the results of such \u201cserious queries\u201d as coronavirus, COVID-19 and \nsimilar terms related to the global pandemic. Such filtering may explain \nthe scant amount of outwardly problematic information such as conspiracy \nwebsites encountered in the top results for coronavirus queries across the platforms. It does, however, raise the question of the epistemology behind the authority that is being applied, and whether it puts paid (for example) \nto the signals approach of algorithms, and instead puts forward \u201cediting in\u201d \nofficial sources as the top content recommended.\nEditorial epistemologies and serious queries\nSource list or results curation is laborious work and fell into decline with \nthe overall demise of the human editing of the web and the rise of the \n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 25\nback end, and algorithmic signals, taking over from the editors (Rogers, \n2013). COVID-19 and the coronavirus are thus exceptional for they have \nmarked the return of the editors and raise the question of whether their \nwork should extend beyond pandemic sources to election-related informa -\ntion, as discussed above. Maintaining COVID-19 and the coronavirus as \nan exceptional information state would draw the line there, though cases \ncould be made to extend the adjudicative practice to the democratic process, \nwhere policymakers especially in Europe have directed their efforts. France\u2019s \nfalse news legislation comes to mind, as does Germany\u2019s extension of its \nhate speech act. There are also Facebook\u2019s efforts to maintain a political \nad archive tool. Each is (partially) a response to concerns of a repeat, in \nEurope and beyond, of the \u201cfake news\u201d crisis of 2016.\nSo far, the pandemic and (for some) election-related matters are \u201cserious \nqueries\u201d in the sense that the information returned should not be fully in \nthe hands of current trends in algorithmic culture but returned to editors. \nWith content reviewers and moderators, there is currently a blurring (and \nin a sense cheapening) of editors, however. Their low-wage, outsourced \nwork to date has had to do with violent and pornographic content rather \nthan the \u201cquality of information\u201d (Roberts, 2019). There is the question of \nthe journalistic training and qualifications for the editing work (Parks, \n2019). The professional fact-checking editors, as mentioned above, would \nstruggle with volume.\nThere are advocates of an editorial recovery online. Source adjudica -\ntion techniques on offer these days for results curation are, among others, \njournalistic balance, the absence of biased sources, fact-checked stories, and \n\u201clongue dur\u00e9e\u201d expertise, be it official and/or established. Crowd-sourcing \nusers to flag inappropriate content or only checking trending content are \nalso available approaches. All mark the return of qualitatively determin -\ning the worthiness of source appearance and could be dubbed editorial \nepistemologies. Each requires judgements in advance of the moment of \ngaveling the A/B or ignore/delete decision, as platforms are wont to decide \nto allow a post or not. (For world leaders, as mentioned, the posts may be \nlabeled.) There is also the question of handling the volume of posts to be \nscrutinized\nWhen curating results or otherwise managing outputs, to undertake \n\u201cbalanced list\u201d work implies making political or partisan source distinctions, \nand continually returning to the outputs to check the weight of each side \nper substantive query. An approach seeking an \u201cabsence of biased sources\u201d \npresupposes classification and monitoring and likely relying on official, \ninstitutionalized information. Fact-checking, rather than on a source level, \n26 r ichard rog erS \nswitches the efforts to the individual story, and subsequently researches, \narchives and labels them. At least as it has been performed on Facebook \nposts by DPA and AFP, the German and French news agencies respectively, \nit is such meticulous work that it outputs a total of about four fact-checks \nper day, if their production prior to the 2021 Dutch elections is exemplary \n(AFP, 2021; DPA, 2021). Relying on \u201clongue dur\u00e9e\u201d expertise could be another \nmeans of offering high-quality sources, as organizations working in the same \nterrain for many years would have accrued credibility, but to official sources \nit would add non-governmental and other specialized organizations with an established track record (and perhaps a noticeable political leaning).\nAnother starting point is to take an active audience approach, and assume \nthat another, perhaps more significant instance of filtering lies with the \nuser or what was once known as the \u201cwisdom of the crowd.\u201d Users can \n\u201cflag\u201d or report content on various platforms and label it as inappropriate, \nmisleading, etc. Taking such user reporting practices a step further, as \nmentioned above, Twitter\u2019s \u201cBirdwatch\u201d program seeks dedicated users (not \nso unlike Wikipedians, albeit without the non-profit spirit) to sift content and enforce platform rules.\nAs demonstrated in the empirical research reported above, engagement \nmeasures that consider rating (liking), circulating (sharing) and comment -\ning (reading) are another means to determine the activity of audiences. \nOn Facebook, but also on Twitter (retweeting), one may inquire into the \nstories about the coronavirus and other issues making audiences active. \nAdjudicating only those posts with the highest engagement would allow \nliking and sharing to trigger editorial interest.\nFinally, one also could argue for an \u201canything goes\u201d approach to mis -\ninformation, returning to a pre-pandemic algorithmic signals method \noperated in tandem with standard content moderation, editing out violence, \npornography, terrorism and hate. Such a return would appear unlikely \nas it would imply a regress in content review standards on mainstream \nplatforms. For example, since 2019, Twitter policies cover not just  violence \nbut its \u201cglorification\u201d (Twitter, 2019a), as publicized in a case of the labeling \na Donald Trump tweet as such. Indeed, more content types are scrutinized \nthese days. Specifically, since the coronavirus pandemic, the types have \nbeen expanded to include \u201cmisleading\u201d information.\nWith respect to identifying such information, Twitter writes, \u201cmoving \nforward, we may use these labels \u2026 in situations where the risks of harm \n\u2026 are less severe but where people may still be confused or misled by the content\u201d (Roth and Pickles, 2020). Setting aside for a moment the question \nof taking social media company utterances at face value (John, 2019), the \n\u201cSeriou S q uerie S\u201d  and \u201cedi To rial e PiS TeMo logie S\u201d 27\nstatement raises the prospect that the new editorial epistemologies, together \nwith the contestation that accompanies their fundaments, may abide beyond \nthe current exceptional information state.\nNote\nAn earlier version of the article appeared in the journal, Frontiers in Big \nData  (Rogers, 2021) .\nReferences\nAFP (2021).

Overall, we found that the presence of \nproblematic information in the returns is scant. In additionally studying \nthe diversity of sources, we found an asymmetry between liberal and \nconservative websites in the top results. This imbalance is notable when \napproaching it through the lens of an opposition or even competition for \nhigh rankings between liberal and conservative media, broadly defined. A \nmore nuanced classification does not eliminate the imbalance given the \nnear absence (from March\u00a02020 to January\u00a02021) of explicitly conservative \noutlets.\nKeywords: Google, problematic information, digital methods, elections \nresearch\nResearch questions\nHow are problematic sources positioned within the first 20 Google.com \nresults, when querying U.S. candidates and their most significant issues? \nFor issue-related queries, what are the predominant source types returned, \nand how may their leanings be characterized politically?\n1 Pa rts of this research were carried out in collaboration with Varvara Boboc and Robert \nBaciu.\nRogers. R. (ed.), The Propagation of Misinformation in Social Media: A Cross-platform Analysis . \nAmsterdam: Amsterdam University Press 2023\ndoi: 10.5117/9789463720762_ch02\n34 g uillen Torre S \nEssay summary\nThe main finding is that within the top 20 Google results for election-related \nqueries from February\u00a02019 to January\u00a02021 the presence of problematic \ninformation is low. We also find that when using either \u201cample\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d \ndefinitions of liberal and conservative sources to query Google Web Search \nin different moments in time, liberal outnumber conservative. Moreover, \nwe find the predominance of mainstream news, a considerable presence \nof \u201cspecial interest\u201d websites and a fluctuating presence of official sources. \n\u201cSpecial interest\u201d is used as a broad category including professional as -\nsociations, think tanks, and industry or community news sites, producing \ninformation mostly around one specific topic (e.g., farming or taxes), while \n\u201cofficial sources\u201d are largely governmental or the candidates\u2019 own campaign \nwebsites.\nThis study undertakes a source-distance analysis of Google.com results \nfor the periods of February\u00a012, 2019 to March\u00a023, 2020 and March\u00a024, 2020 \nto January\u00a05, 2021, where one measures how far from the top of the returns \nare particular types of sources. To assign a rough political bias category \nto the search results, two classifications were devised, based on existing \nschemes. An \u201cample\u201d classification combines center-left and left political \norientations into left, and center-right and right into right. A \u201cnarrow\u201d \nclassification makes a stricter division and only considers explicitly left or \nright sources as liberal or conservative, while center-left and center-right \noutlets are considered mainstream.\nImplications\nThe low presence of official institutional sources in the returns to our queries \nis not necessarily problematic, but the strategies Google implemented to \nfight problematic information related to SARS-CoV-2 beg the question about \nwhether something similar may be justified for queries related specifically \nto elections, or more generally to public policies or governmental programs \nthat have proven controversial or divisive in the past (e.g., DACA or foreign \nrelations with China). Google already employs \u201cfeatured snippets\u201d that \nhighlight certain sources for general searches (e.g., [Trump policies] bring \nup a Wikipedia page), but this is not the case for queries about specific \npolicies. Whether it is desirable that Google privileges information produced \nby politically accountable institutions is a discussion that lies beyond the \nProble MaTi c infor MaTi on in go ogle Web Search?  35\nscope, but the fact that the company has decided to take a stance regarding \nSARS-CoV-2 suggests that there might be benefits to such a strategy.\nSecondly, the near absence of such problematic sources as imposter, \nconspiracy, pseudo-science or extreme sites in the top twenty results suggests \nthat Google\u2019s efforts to prevent such misinformation from rising to the top \nare succeeding (Google 2019a). This is the case at least for queries related \nto political issues and candidates. As other platforms are arguably losing \nthe battle against problematic information, particularly in the context of \nthe global pandemic and political unrest in the U.S. (Alba, 2020), Google\u2019s \nstrategies could be considered by other actors.\nThird, we found a preponderance of liberal sources over conservative \nones using both an \u201cample\u201d and a \u201cnarrow\u201d classification of information \nsources. Although this result could be related to the wording of our \nqueries (i.e., occasionally using more liberal keywords), we found that \nthe imbalance still stands for those queries that could be considered \nmore neutral (i.e., immigration). Considering that a perceived liberal \nmedia bias lingers in the U.S. political imaginary (Hassel et al., 2020), \nGoogle may find that clarifying anew why its algorithm privileges certain \noutlets over others could contribute to the debate about a \u201cliberal tech \nbias\u201d (Boxell et al., 2020). Although Google previously has openly stated \nthat there is no bias affecting its results (Wakabayashi, 2018) and the \nplatform\u2019s role in polarizing its users is still a heavily contested matter \n(Boxell et al., 2017; Sunstein, 2018; Bail et al., 2018), Google\u2019s reflection \nabout the possibilities of implicit bias could be beneficial. The company \noften frames the production of its results as a process guided by objective \nmeasures of content quality and value (Google, 2019a, 2019b); however, \nreflections around these concepts (Kelemen, 2005; Heuts and Mol, 2013) \nas well as about the politics of search engine rankings (Introna and \nNissenbaum, 2000; Noble 2018) could be matters for Google to discuss \nmore explicitly.\nFinally, the considerable presence of websites of special interest in our \nqueries implies that these sources have the privilege of supplying election-\nrelated information. Considering how those voices are boosted over official \nsources, this finding calls for a more specific analysis into the politics of the \ninformation they produce. Although previous studies have also noted the \npresence of this type of source (Courtois et al., 2018; Unkel and Haim, 2019), \nthey have not yet been the exclusive object of research. Such an analysis \nwould pertain to the study of less obvious partisanship in search engine \nrankings (Robertson et al., 2018).\n36 g uillen Torre S \nFindings\nFinding 1: Official sources are hardly in evidence in Google Web Search results \nfor queries related to the 2020 U.S. presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald \nTrump. Overall, the presence of official sources, such as \u201c.gov\u201d sites or official \ncampaign sites is quite low. For the first period under research (February\u00a012, 2019 \nto March\u00a023, 2020), official sources make up only 1% of the total. For the second \n(March\u00a024, 2020 to January\u00a05, 2021), which includes the official campaign season, \nthe elections and the days prior to inauguration day, the presence of these \nsources increases considerably, making up 5% of the dataset. Queries related \nto Donald Trump produce the highest number of official sources, accounting \nfor nearly 10% of that subset of the results. In fact, the whitehouse.gov website \nwas the third most common top result for Trump-related queries. Given the \nscope of this chapter, it is not possible to identify whether this change is related \nto contextual factors such as current events or a change in the evaluation of \nsource relevance by the Google Web Search service.\nFinding 2: Problematic information is hardly present in Google Web \nSearch results for queries related to the 2020 U.S. presidential candidates \nbefore the start of the pre-campaigning, and it is entirely absent afterwards. \nProblematic sources are only present in our dataset if this category is made \nto include hyperpartisan websites. No imposter, fake news or fly-by-night \nsources were identified. Only five sources classified as problematic were \nidentified: The World Tribune, National File, RedState, TheBL, and  Breitbart, \nall labeled as hyperpartisan. These sources were present exclusively during \nthe period between the unofficial start of Trump\u2019s campaign and the suspen -\nsion of in-person rallies due to the COVID pandemic. Table\u00a02.1 displays the \ndistribution of problematic sources among the results. There is no particular \nquery that seems to be more likely to return problematic sources than others, \nalthough queries where hyperpartisan sources are present also seem to \nhave more conservative sources than liberal, which is remarkable given the \noverall low presence of right-of-center sources. It is noteworthy that while \nthe presence of this type of source is minimal, The World Tribune , National \nFile and RedState  show up as the first result for some queries. Queries related \nto Joe Biden produced the highest number of problematic sources.\nTable\u00a02.1  P roblematic sources in Google Web Search results.\nSource Query Candidate Result ranking\nWorld Tribune K-12 \nedu\ncation do\nnald Trump 1\nThe bl re\nparations Joe \nbid\nen 14\nProble MaTi c infor MaTi on in go ogle Web Search?  37\nSource Query Candidate Result ranking\nn\national \nfi\nle ch\narter Schools Joe \nbid\nen 1\nbre\nitbart da\nca J\noe \nbid\nen 19, 20\nre\nd State The \nco\nnstitution Joe \nbid\nen 1\nTimeframe: fe bruary\u00a012, 2019 to March\u00a023, 2020. da ta from go ogle.com.\nFinding 3: Mainstream news websites dominate the top 20 Google Web \nSearch Results. For both periods under review, the majority of the websites \npresent in the first 20 results of our political queries are mainstream news \nand special interest sites. Table\u00a02.2 summarizes the types of sources present \nin our queries for the first period under review. The ten most present sources \nare the following: Politico , The New York Times, The Hill , Forbes , Common \nDreams (which we classified as a liberal source, rather than mainstream), \nThe Guardian , Reuters , USA Today , The Wall Street Journal and Wikipedia . \nTogether, they make up 28% of the total results.\nTable\u00a02.2   Oc currences of different types of sources in the results of Google Web \nSearch to political queries. \nCandidate News \n(national)Special interestNews (local)Official Platform Academic Problematic/hyperpartisanOther\nTrump 73% 19.2% 6.2% 1% 0.9% 0.09% 0.04% 1.3%\nbid\nen 71% 15.8% 9.34% 1.5% 1.2% 0.08% 0.2% 1.3%\nTimeframe: \nfe\nbruary\u00a012, 2019 to March\u00a023, 2020.

The top positions this time are held \nby The Washington Post , followed by CNBC, The New York Times, Reuters, \nForbes, NPR, Politico, The White House, The Guardian and  NBC News . Together, \nthese sources represent 34% of the total results, which implies an increase \nin the overall prominence of these ten mainstream sources (together with \nthe one official source) in comparison to the period before. This result is \nnoteworthy considering that the overall presence of mainstream sources \nis lower in this second dataset, since special interest websites increased \ntheir incidence. The stable presence of The New York Times, Politico, Forbes, \nReuters and  The Guardian  suggests that Google Web Search assigns them \na high relevance.\n38 g uillen Torre S \nTable\u00a02.3   Oc currences of different types of sources in the results of Google Web \nSearch to political queries.\nCandidate News \n(national)Special interestNews (local)Official Platform Academic Other\nTrump 58% 20% 8% 9.3% 3% 0.7% 1%\nbid\nen 53.4% 28.5% 11.4% 3% 2.3% 0.5% 0.7%\nTimeframe: March\u00a024, 2020 to January\u00a05, 2021. The categories of \u201cproblematic\u201d and \u201chyperparti-\nsan\u201d are not included given that no source was classified as such. \nda\nta from \ngo\nogle.com.\nFinding 4: Overall, the presence of liberal sources is greater than that \nof conservative websites. Using news bias labeling sites as a rough in-\ndicator, we found a greater presence of liberal sources in comparison to \nconservative ones in all queries and for both periods under review, with \na slight decrease in the presence of right-of-center sources in the second. \nThis was the case both with \u201cample\u201d and \u201cnarrow\u201d definitions of what \nconstitutes a liberal or conservative source. Imbalances within search \nresults have been noted before by researchers, journalists and civil society \norganizations, and results have varied depending on geography and subject \nmatter. For example, Haim et al. (2017) found an overrepresentation of \nconservative sources in Germany, while in the U.S. audits tend to find more \nliberal websites than conservative ones (Trielly and Diakopoulos, 2018). \nIn our case, using the \u201cample\u201d classification makes the imbalance grow \nto a proportion of 6:1 in favor of liberal sources for the first period under \nanalysis and 12:1 for the second. Using the \u201cnarrow\u201d scheme changes the \nimbalance to around 3:1 and 14:1, respectively. The increase in the ratio of \nliberal to conservative sources in the second period of analysis is credited \nto a considerable decrease in the number of conservative websites in the \nreturns, rather than an increase of liberal ones. In fact, the data show \nan overall decrease of both types of sources, although the presence of \nconservative sources declined more. Tables\u00a02.4 and 2.5 show the propor -\ntions using both classifications. The imbalance stands even for queries \nthat deal with topics that would, intuitively, be connected to a higher \npresence of conservative sources (i.e., [Donald Trump] [Gun control] or \n[Donald Trump] [immigration]).\nProble MaTi c infor MaTi on in go ogle Web Search?  39\nTable\u00a02.4   P roportion of liberal and conservative news sources per candidate. \nEarly campaigning period\nCandidate Liberal\n(ample)Unbiased(ample)Conservative(ample)Liberal(narrow)Unbiased(narrow)Conservative(narrow)\ndo nald Trump 44.4% 24.2% 8% 11% 63% 3%\nJoe \nbid\nen 39% 25% 14% 12% 59% 6%\n\u201cSpecial interest\u201d websites are not considered, as their political orientation has not been defined. \nTimeframe: \nfe\nbruary\u00a012, 2019 to March\u00a023, 2020. \nda\nta from \ngo\nogle.com.\nTable\u00a02.5   P roportion of liberal and conservative news sources per candidate. \nRun-up to election and aftermath\nCandidate Liberal\n(ample)Unbiased(ample) Conservative\n(ample)Liberal(narrow)Unbiased(narrow)Conservative(narrow)\ndo nald Trump 41% 22% 2% 4% 61% 0.3\u00a0%\nJoe \nbid\nen 39% 22% 3% 5% 59% 1%\n\u201cSpecial interest\u201d websites are not considered, as their political orientation has not been defined. \nTimeframe: March\u00a024, 2020 to January\u00a05, 2021. \nda\nta from \ngo\nogle.com.\nThe imbalance is also present when analyzing the diversity of unique URLs \nfrom which Google Web Search draws its results. Our dataset consists of 1,300 \nunique URLs. The proportion liberal/conservative of these sources using \nthe ample scheme is around 3:1, whereas using the more restrictive criteria \nit is around 4:1. This difference suggests that, overall, Google seems to be \ndrawing results from a more diverse pool of liberal sites than conservative. \nWhen only explicitly progressive/conservative websites are classified as \nsuch, the imbalance increases. Rather than implying a liberal bias, this \nresult could be related to the existence of a higher number of liberal outlets \n(Trielli and Diakopoulos, 2019).\nThere is also a slight difference in the political composition of the unique \nsources in the two moments of data capture. For example, the five hyper -\npartisan conservative sources found in the first dataset did not appear in \nsubsequent queries, despite the use of the same keywords. This could be \nrelated to current events during the dates of the queries rather than a bias \nin Google\u2019s service.

Although national mainstream news outlets make up for the \nlargest proportion of results to our queries, they are not in the majority \nwhen analyzing the diversity of unique sources. For the first period of \nanalysis, special interest websites represent 40% of the pool of sources from \nwhich Google Web Search draws its results, whereas local news websites \nrepresent 20% and mainstream news websites represent only 19%. The \npresence of this type of source is higher when querying candidate names \nProble MaTi c infor MaTi on in go ogle Web Search?  41\ntogether with sensitive topics such as drugs, migration or gun control, but \nalso for some less obviously contentious topics such as K-12 education and \ntransportation.\nTable\u00a02.8 presents the distribution of unique sources in the results to \nour queries for both periods under review. Sites we have defined as special \ninterest are the largest number in both cases, and the data shows an increase \nof 40% of this type of source in the latter queries. The considerable presence \nof special interest websites suggests that Google\u2019s understanding of relevance \nvalues specialization and expertise less than the journalistic qualities of \nestablished news outlets. Thus, although search results are drawn from a \nmore diverse pool of special interest websites, they are featured less often. \nThe top five special interest websites for the first period were Marijuana \nMoment (cannabis enthusiasts), The Motley Fool (investment), EdWeek  \n(education), American for Tax Reform (policy), and The Tax Foundation \n(policy). For the second period, the top five sources were Marijuana Moment, \nThe Tax Foundation, The Balance (real estate), KHN (public health), and \nThe Tax Policy Center (policy). These sources tend to feature prominently \nand exclusively within their niche topics, rather than being spread over \nmultiple issue-queries.\nThe presence of local news websites within our dataset can be character -\nized in similar terms to special interest websites with the difference that \nthe numbers of the former did not increase from the first period of analysis \nto the second. In this case, we could argue that Google\u2019s understanding \nof relevance values the geographic proximity of content producers to the \nissues in question, but that this quality is less valued than the expertise of \nmainstream news outlets. Local news sources are usually confined to the \nsecond page of results, and although high in number in terms of source \ndiversity, they have a low occurrence. The most prominent local news sites \nin both datasets are connected to large metropolitan areas, such as Los \nAngeles, Philadelphia, Miami or Chicago.\nTable\u00a02.8  C lassification of unique sources in search results.\nNational \nNewsLocal NewsSpecial InterestAcademic Platform Official Problematic Other\nFirst period 179 213 267 7 8 20 5 36\nSecond period 136 188 372 18 7 34 0 24\nda ta from go ogle.com.\n42 g uillen Torre S \nMethods\nWe implemented a simple source-distance methodology (Rogers, 2019) whose \nobjective is to locate the position of different types of sources within Google \nWeb Search results, in order to find which ones are privileged by the search \nengine by assigning them positions close to the top. This method is employed \nto answer the following research questions: How are problematic sources \npositioned within the first 20 Google.com results for queries concerning \nU.S. candidates and their most significant issues? And for election-related \nqueries, what are the predominant source types returned, and how may they \nbe characterized politically? We followed Caroline Jack\u2019s conceptualization \nof problematic information as \u201cinaccurate, misleading, inappropriately \nattributed, or altogether fabricated\u201d (2017: 1).\nThe queries were designed on the basis of a list of political issues, trian-\ngulated from the two political parties\u2019 platforms, individual candidate\u2019s \nplatforms, and three voter support services: Politico,2 VoteSmart3 and On \nthe Issues.4 The queries consisted of the following keywords: [candidate] \nAND [issue]. Donald Trump and Joe Biden were the candidates queried. The \nqueries do not strive to replicate the search behavior by Google users, but \nrather to test the type of information returned generically in the United \nStates by the search engine when querying political issues deemed relevant \nby voter support services.\nAlthough research has shown that personalization is low in Google\u2019s \nWeb Search (Haim et al.\u00a02017, Robertson et al., 2018b), we still sought to \nreduce the prospects of individual (but not geographical) personalization \nin our results by performing queries on a clean Firefox Extended Support \nRelease browser (with a fresh installation and with no prior use of any \nother Firefox version); Virtual Private Network (VPN) software was used \nto acquire a U.S. IP address. The queries were performed with the Search \nEngine Scraper (Search Engine Scraper, n.d.). Adjusting the parameters of the \ntool, we scraped the first 20 results provided by Google, in the U.S. region, for two different periods: February\u00a012, 2019\u2013March\u00a023, 2020 and March\u00a024, \n2020\u2013January\u00a05, 2021. While the first period captures the unofficial start of \nthe Trump campaign and up to the suspension of in-person rallies due to the \nCOVID pandemic, the second period captures the official pre-campaigns, the elections, and up to a few days before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. We set \n2 ht tps://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/\n3 \nhttps://justfacts.votesmart.org/\n4 ht\ntps://www.ontheissues.org/Issues.htm\nProble MaTi c infor MaTi on in go ogle Web Search?  43\nthe number of results to 20 under the assumption that users tend not to look \nmuch further than that (Jansen and Spink, 2003; Dan and Davison, 2016). \nOur dataset consists of the results for searches of about 114 issues, each of \nwhich was queried two times (one for each candidate) on two different dates \n(March\u00a023, 2020 and January\u00a05, 2021). This \u201cone shot\u201d strategy introduces \nsome limitations to the study given the known variability in the composition \nof Google results through time. This variability can be connected with \nbreaking news (Curtois et al.\u00a02018), or updates to the algorithm. Although \nresults variability affects the position that each source holds in the results \npage (which would have been relevant for our second finding, had we found \nmore problematic information), it seems to affect less the composition of the \nresults in terms of source diversity. For example, in two studies conducted \nby Trielly and Diakopoulos (2019, 2020) source diversity seems to remain \nstable throughout the queries performed. Thus, our findings 1, 3 and 4 \ncould be considered indicative despite ours not being a longitudinal study conducted through daily queries.\nThe resulting list of 9,120 links was compared against an expert list of \nknown problematic sources, which was curated by fellow researchers, \nusing a combination of labeling sites, AllSides.com, Media Bias/Fact Check, \n\u201cthe Chart,\u201d and NewsGuard. Wikipedia and news mentions of potentially \nproblematic sources also were consulted. In the relatively few cases where \nsources had not been previously classified, two researchers independently \nclassified them, following the guidelines of the labeling sites. When unla -\nbeled sources reproduced the content created by larger outlets (as is the \ncase with most local news), the resulting label was the same as assigned \nto the parent outlet (e.g., CBS, ABC, NPR). In cases where no affiliate was \nexplicitly acknowledged (mostly local news editorial pieces), the coding \nattempted to locate politically laden opinions. If no bias was detected, the source was labeled as \u201cleast biased.\u201d\nTwo categorization schemes were devised, still following the existing \nlabeling sites\u2019 overall viewpoints. The first, \u201cample\u201d one, combines center-\nleft and left political orientations, on the one hand, and center-right and \nright, on the other. As a result, mainstream sites such as The Guardian  and \nThe New York Times were labeled \u201cliberal,\u201d while The Wall Street Journal  \nwas labeled \u201cconservative.\u201d The second, \u201cnarrow\u201d scheme makes a stricter division and only considers more explicitly liberal or conservative sources \nas either left or right, while most mainstream news outlets remain in the \ncenter. As a result, sites as The New York Times, The Guardian  and The Wall \nStreet Journal  switched categories to \u201ccenter\u201d and sites as The National Review  \nand The Washington Times were labeled as conservative. Furthermore, we \n44 g uillen Torre S \nalso labeled certain websites as \u201cspecial interest,\u201d \u201clocal news,\u201d \u201cofficial,\u201d \n\u201cacademic,\u201d \u201cplatform\u201d and \u201cother.\u201d Special interest, the broad category of \nsources whose content is mostly oriented towards one particular topic, \ninclude such professional associations and think tanks whose ultimate goal is \nto advocate for public policy (e.g., Americans for Tax Reform or the Center for \nImmigration Studies), as well as industry or community news sites focusing \non a particular audience (e.g., Transport News, Agripulse  or the National Low \nIncome Housing Coalition). We differentiated between local and national \nnews outlets, since even if the first sometimes reproduce the content of the \nlatter, we found considerable original local reporting and opinion columns \nin the results of our queries, prompting a further opportunity to classify \npartisanship. We considered as \u201cofficial sources\u201d those belonging to the U.S. \nfederal or local government, inter-governmental agencies, politicians in \noffice, or the official campaign websites of current and former candidates. \nAcademic sources are those connected to a university (e.g., the University \nof Pennsylvania\u2019s Budget Model), while the platforms encountered are \nWikipedia, Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. Finally, the category \u201cother\u201d \nincludes all sources that bore no direct relation to the other types.\nReferences\nAlba, D. (2020, June\u00a01).

Here the report\u2019s \nmethods are revisited for 2020. Examining Facebook user engagement \nof election-related stories, and applying Silverman\u2019s classification of fake \nnews, it was found that the problem has worsened. If, however, one were \nto classify \u201cfake news\u201d in a stricter fashion, as Facebook and others do \nwith the notion of \u201cfalse news,\u201d the scale of the problem shrinks. A smaller \nscale problem could imply a greater role for fact-checkers, while a larger \none could lead to the further politicization of source adjudication, where \nlabeling certain sources as \u201cfake\u201d results in backlash.\nKeywords: Fake news, false news, junk news, hyperpartisan, media \nlabeling\nResearch questions\nTo what extent is \u201cfake news\u201d (as defined in the 2016 seminal news article) \npresent in the most engaged-with, election-related content on Facebook in \nthe run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential elections?

Is there more user \nengagement with hyperpartisan conservative or progressive sources in politi -\ncal spaces on Facebook? How does such engagement imply a politicization \nof the \u201cfake news\u201d problem?\nEssay summary\nIn all, it was found that the \u201cfake news\u201d problem around the U.S. elections \nas observed in 2016 has worsened overall on Facebook in 2020. While \u201cfake \nnews\u201d did not outperform mainstream news in any period under study (as \nit did in August to November of 2016) the proportion of user engagement \nwith \u201cfake news\u201d to mainstream news stories was higher compared to 2016. \nIn the seven full quarters under study in the run up to and aftermath of \nthe 2020 elections (from March\u00a02019 to December\u00a02020) the proportion of \nengagement of \u201cfake news\u201d to mainstream was on average 1:1.8 compared \nto 1:2.6 in 2016. It is both an observation concerning the persistence of the \nproblem and an admonition that the measures undertaken to date have \nnot lessened the phenomenon.\nIf one applies a stricter definition of \u201cfake news\u201d such as only imposter \nnews and conspiracy sites (thereby removing hyperpartisan sites as in \nSilverman\u2019s original definition), mainstream sources outperform \u201cfake\u201d \nones by a much greater proportion.\nThe findings imply that how one defines such information has an impact \non the perceived scale of the problem, including the types of approaches to \naddress it. With a smaller-scale problem, fact-checking and labeling become \nmore viable alongside the \u201cbig data\u201d custodial approaches employed by \nsocial media firms.\nGiven there are more hyperpartisan conservative sources engaged with \nthan hyperpartisan progressive ones, the research points to how considera -\ntions of what constitutes \u201cfake news\u201d may be politicized. Targeting \u201cfake \nnews\u201d presumably would affect hyperpartisan conservative sources to a \ngreater degree than progressive ones. It thereby could invite criticism of \u201cbig \ntech,\u201d including claims of censorship on one side of the political spectrum. \nIt also could prompt social media firms to become less open to critical \nscrutiny by scholars and journalists alike interested in which sources and \nstories are being degraded or deplatformed.\nThe findings are made on the basis of Facebook user engagement of the \ntop 200 stories returned for queries for candidates and social issues. Based on \nThe Sc ale of fa ceboo K\u2019S  Pr oble M  de Pe ndS  uPo n ho W  \u201cfa Ke n eW S\u201d  iS  cla S Si fied  49\nexisting labeling sites, the stories and by extension the sources are classified \nalong a spectrum from more to less problematic as well as partisan.\nImplications\nThe initial \u201cfake news\u201d crisis (Silverman, 2016; 2017) had to do with fly-by-\nnight, imposter, conspiracy as well as so-called \u201chyperpartisan\u201d news sources \noutperforming mainstream news on Facebook in the three months prior \nto the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. In a sense it was both a critique of \nFacebook as \u201chyperpartisan political-media machine\u201d (Herrman, 2016) but \nalso that of the quality of a social media landscape witnessing a precipitous \nrise in the consumption and sharing of \u201calternative right\u201d news and cultural \ncommentary (Benkler et al., 2017; Holt et al., 2019).\nThe events of the first crisis have been overtaken by a second one where \npoliticians as former President Trump in the U.S. and elsewhere employ \nthe same term for certain media organizations in order to undermine their \ncredibility. Against the backdrop of that politicization as well as rhetorical \ntactic, scholars and platforms alike have demurred on using the term \u201cfake \nnews\u201d and instead offered \u201cjunk news,\u201d \u201cproblematic information,\u201d \u201cfalse \nnews\u201d and others (Vosoughi et al., 2018). Some definitions (as junk news and \nproblematic information) are roomier, while others are stricter in their source \nclassification schemes. Subsumed under the original \u201cfake news\u201d definition \nare imposter news, conspiracy sources and hyperpartisan, defined as \u201coverly \nideological web operations\u201d (Herrman, 2016) or sources that \u201cexpressly \npromotes views\u201d (Otero, 2017). The newer term, \u201cjunk news,\u201d covers the same \ntypes of sources but adds the connotation of attractively packaged junk \nfood that when consumed could be considered unhealthy (Howard, 2020; \nVenturini, 2019). It also includes two web-native source types. \u201cClickbait\u201d \ncaptures how the manner in which it is packaged or formatted lures one \ninto consumption, and \u201ccomputational propaganda\u201d refers to dubious news \ncirculation by bot and troll-like means, artificially amplifying its symbolic \npower. Problematic information is even roomier, as it expands its field of \nvision beyond news to cultural commentary and satire (Jack, 2017). Stricter \ndefinitions such as \u201cfalse news\u201d would encompass imposter and conspiracy \nbut are less apt to include hyperpartisan news and cultural commentary, \ndiscussing those sources as \u201cmisleading\u201d rather than as \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d or \nas not being \u201cnews\u201d in the first instance (Kist and Zantingh, 2017).\nRather than an either/or proposition, \u201cfake news\u201d could be understood as \na spectrum with problematic information (the roomiest notion) on one end \n50 r ichard rog erS \nand \u201cfalse news,\u201d the strictest, on the other, with junk news and fake news \nin the middle (Wardle, 2016; 2017). While beyond the scope, the purview \ncould be widened even further to include more media than stories and \nsources, such as video and images.\nDepending on the definition, the scale of the problem changes as does \nthe range of means to address it (Gillespie, 2020). With \u201cfalse news,\u201d it grows \nsmaller, and fact-checking again could be a profession to which to turn \nfor background research into the story and the source. Fact-checking\u2019s \neffectiveness is occasionally regarded as limited, given the enormity of the \ntask, the large reach of some fake news stories (well before fact-checks have \nappeared) and the number of fact-checks an organization can complete per \nday (Annany, 2018). Moreover, the audiences of \u201cfake news\u201d and fact-checked \n\u201cfake news\u201d also may differ significantly, meaning that corrections rarely \nreach the original consumers of the offending content (Bounegru et al., 2018). \nMore attention may be paid to the stories that have merited a fact-check or \na label, expanding their reach and engagement.\nFacebook\u2019s content moderation is multi-facetted, relying on human review, \nuser reporting and automated approaches (Roberts, 2016; Gillespie, 2018; \nFacebook, 2021b). Where their approach to misinformation is concerned, \nFacebook has striven to work with fact-checking bodies, though some of the \nfledgling partnerships ended after a year or two (Madrigal, 2019). For the \nremaining partner organizations, there is a Facebook dashboard, populated \nwith content flagged through crowd-sourcing and automated techniques, \nwhere the fact-checkers can choose articles and write their reports, from \ntwo to five per day per fact-checker (Annany, 2018). These reports result in \ncontent removal or downgrading. When the problem is scaled down, these \napproaches become more viable as do other qualitative approaches such as \nlabeling, with adjudicators sifting through posts one by one.\nRoomier definitions make the problem larger and result in findings such \nas the most well-known \u201cfake news\u201d story of 2016. \u201cPope Francis Shocks \nWorld, Endorses Donald Trump for President\u201d began as satire and was \nlater circulated on a hyperpartisan, fly-by-night site (Ending the Fed). It \ngarnered higher engagement rates on Facebook than more serious articles \nin the mainstream news. When such stories are counted as \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cjunk\u201d \nor \u201cproblematic,\u201d and the scale increases, industrial-style \u201cscalable\u201d solu -\ntions may be preferred such as automated review and commercial content \nmoderation (rather than journalist fact-checking).\nAs more content is taken down as a result of roomy source classification \nschemes, debates about freedom of choice may become more vociferous \nrather than less. It recalls the junk food debate, and in this regard, Zygmunt \nThe Sc ale of fa ceboo K\u2019S  Pr oble M  de Pe ndS  uPo n ho W  \u201cfa Ke n eW S\u201d  iS  cla S Si fied  51\nBauman stressed how we as homo eligens or \u201cchoosing animals\u201d are wont \nto resist such restrictions, be it in opting for \u201chyperprocessed\u201d food or \nhyperpartisan news and cultural commentary (2013).\nLabeling hyperpartisan news as \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cjunk,\u201d moreover, may lead to \ngreater political backlash. Indeed, as our findings imply, the \u201cfake news\u201d or \n\u201cjunk news\u201d problem is largely a hyperpartisan conservative source problem, \nwhereas the \u201cfalse news\u201d one is not. As recently witnessed in the Netherlands, \nthe designation of hyperpartisan conservative sources as \u201cjunk news\u201d drew \nthe ire of sources so labeled as well as the leader of a conservative political \nparty, who subsequently labeled mainstream news as \u201cjunk fake news\u201d \n(Rogers and Niederer, 2020; Van Den Berg, 2019). Opting for the narrower \n\u201cfalse news\u201d classification would imply a depoliticization of the problem.\nFinally, it should be remarked that the sources outputting questionable \ncontent in 2020 do not appear to be the fly-by-night, imposter news sites in \noperation in 2016, but rather more \u201cestablished\u201d conspiracy and hyperparti -\nsan sites. If Facebook, as its policy states (2021), were to degrade the posts in \nthe News Feed from at least the conspiracy sites, thereby affecting their reach \nand engagement, then the scale of \u201cfalse news\u201d problem may be reduced. \nThe circulation of hyperpartisan sources would remain, however, making \nthe platform still the site where the competition between mainstream and \n\u201cproblematic information,\u201d \u201cjunk news\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d will remain.\nSource and story classification tensions remain. Certain sources may \nhave hyperpartisan commentary but run mainstream stories from wire \nservices. Hyperpartisan sources may gradually mainstream. Distinctions \nbetween the hyperpartisan and conspiracy may be difficult to disentangle. \nConspiracy theories may become more legitimate with time such as the lab \norigins of the coronavirus.\nFindings\nThis study revisits the initial \u201cfake news\u201d findings made by Craig Silverman \nof Buzzfeed News  in 2016, where it was found that in the three months prior \nto the 2016 U.S. presidential elections \u201cfake news\u201d stories received more \ninteractions on Facebook than mainstream stories (see Figure\u00a03.1). It ushered \nin the \u201cfake news\u201d crisis with Facebook at its center.\nFinding 1: If we employ the same definition of \u201cfake news\u201d as Silverman \ndid during 2016, to date the problem has worsened somewhat. Whereas 1 in \n2.6 \u201cfake news\u201d sources (on average per quarter) were most engaged-with in \nFebruary\u2013November\u00a02016, from March, 2019 to December, 2020 it is now 1 \n52 r ichard rog erS \nfi gure\u00a03.1 \u201c fa ke news\u201d outperforms mainstream news in the months prior to the 2016 u.

The main finding, in other words, is that the \n\u201cfake news problem\u201d of 2016 has not been remedied four years later.\nFinding 2: If, however, one tightens the definition of \u201cfake news\u201d sites \nto imposter and conspiracy sites (as the definition of \u201cfalse news\u201d would \nhave it), thereby removing hyperpartisan sources from the categorization \nscheme, the proportion of most engaged-with \u201cfake news\u201d to mainstream \nnews in March\u00a02019 to December\u00a02020 lessens to 1 in 12 (see Figure\u00a03.3). After \na spike in the run up to the elections, there is a general downward trend in \nthe engagement with such sites.\nNote that the 2016 problem also could be thought to diminish if one were \nto disaggregate Silverman\u2019s original source list and remove hyperpartisan \nstories and sites. An examination of his list per period in question indicates \nin the first two quarters (February through July\u00a02016) most sources are \nhyperpartisan and satirical (Silverman, 2016). Only in the period between \nSeptember and the election do we find imposter sites. A case in point is the \nDenver Guardian (which is no longer online); as the Denver Post  wrote, \u201c[t]\nhere is no such thing as the Denver Guardian, despite that Facebook post \nyou saw\u201d (Lubbers, 2016). Imposter sites, however, are in the minority and \nmost engagement is driven by the hyperpartisan and the satirical such \nas Ending the Fed, Breitbart News and the World News Daily Report. In \nother words, their removal from the \u201cfake news\u201d classification would put \nmainstream news back on top.ProblematicNon Problematic\nIncludes (hyper)partisanconservative and

but, with the strict defini -\ntion, in no case did they (consistently) outperform mainstream sources (see \nFigure\u00a03.5). If we return to the original \u201cfake news\u201d definition (that includes \nhyperpartisan sites), alternative sources outperform mainstream ones (either \noverall or in certain weeks) for certain divisive issues such as abortion, death \npenalty, gun control, social security as well as the issue of fake news itself \n(see Figure\u00a03.4). There is also one issue (social security) where there is more \nengagement with \u201cfake news\u201d in the narrow sense than with mainstream \nnews (see Figure\u00a03.5), but overall the mainstream outperforms fake news \nin a narrow sense across most all issues and periods. With respect to the \ncandidates, Biden has proportionately more \u201cfake news\u201d (and \u201cfalse news\u201d) \nassociated with it than Trump, though Trump has a higher quantity overall. \nThe most engaged-with \u201cfake news\u201d story (PJ Media) relates to Trump and \nreads \u201cmilitary ballots found in the trash in Pennsylvania all were Trump votes.\u201d\nFinding 4: There is more engagement with hyperpartisan conservative \nsources than hyperpartisan progressive ones both overall as well as for \nthe majority of the candidates and issues (see Figures 3.6 and 3.7). The \nfinding suggests that any \u201cfake news\u201d definition that includes hyperpartisan \nsources will associate the problem more with conservative sources. When \nadjusting the definition to exclude such sources, \u201cfake news\u201d itself becomes \nless politicized.(hyper)partisan progressive(hyper)partisan conservativeFacebook engagement \nover

Silverman \nand published in Buzzfeed News  in 2016. It employs a similar methodology, \nalbeit introducing a \u201cslider\u201d or gradient to indicate the extent of the problem \ndepending on how one classifies sources. The research enquires into the \ncurrent scale of the problem and compares it to the same timeframe in \n2016. It also demonstrates how roomier definitions of \u201cfake news\u201d make the \nproblem appear larger, compared to stricter definitions.\nFirst, a list of candidates and social issues is curated. The candidates \nchosen are the ones from the major parties, still in the race and campaigning \nat the time of the study. For social issues, the issue lists at four voting aid \nsources are first merged, and then filtered for those that appear on multiple \nlists: Politico, VoteSmart, On the Issues and Gallup (see Table\u00a03.1).\nTable\u00a03.1   T he list of candidates and issues queried in BuzzSumo.com in \nMarch\u00a02020 and January\u00a02021.\nTrump ca rbon emissions gun  control Private prisons\nbid\nen ch\narter schools healt\nh insurance Securing 5 g\nS\nanders cli\nmate change i\nmmigration Social security\nab\nortion co\nronavirus inf\nrastructure Student debt\naff\nordable housing da\nca M\nedicare Teacher pay\nas\nsault weapons dea\nth penalty Minimum wage Veterans\nba\nckground checks el\nection security oi\nl and gas drilling Wealth taxes\ncamp\naign financing fa\nke news Paid leave\nNext, we queried Buzzsumo, the marketing research and analysis tool, for \neach candidate and issue keyword, using the date ranges of March\u00a023, 2019 to \nMarch\u00a023, 2020 and March\u00a024, 2020 to January\u00a04, 2021, and the filter \u201cEnglish.\u201d \n(We limited our analysis to the end date, December\u00a023, 2020, thereby covering \nseven three-month periods.) We also retained non-American sources, in order \nto ensure that we did not miss highly engaging, problematic sources that are \nfrom outside the U.S. Buzzsumo returns a list of web URLs, ranked by interac -\ntions, which is the sum of reactions (including likes), shares and comments. \nThe study of engagement (or interactions) concerns a combination of rating \n(like), reading (comment) and circulating (share). In that sense, it is a rather \ncomprehensive measure. For every candidate and issue, we examined only \nthe top 200 stories returned, which is a limitation. Analyzing Facebook user \nengagement of \u201ctop\u201d content follows Silverman\u2019s original method. Silverman\u2019s \nincluded top 20 sources, whereas \u201ctop\u201d content is greater by a factor of 10.\n62 r ichard rog erS \nEach of the source names, headlines and any description text are read, \nand the sources are roughly labeled by concatenating pre-existing source \nclassification schemes (or when in disagreement choosing the majority label). \nTo gain an indication of their genre (non-problematic or problematic news \nincluding imposter news, conspiracy site, or clickbait) and (hyper)partisan-\nship, the sources are checked against media bias labeling sites including \nAllSides (2020), Media Bias/Fact Check (2020), \u201cThe Chart\u201d (Otero, 2017) and \nNewsGuard (2020); news sources\u2019 Wikipedia entries are also consulted. We \nalso searched for them online and consulted news and analysis that mention \nthe sources. Additionally, we checked the source lists returned by Buzzsumo \nagainst a study of imposter sources called \u201cpink slime sites,\u201d or sites that \nimitate local or national news sites (Bengani, 2019). Throughout the entire \nperiod and across all issues in the top 200 most engaged-with stories just \none pink slime site was found.\nSubsequently, we characterized the stories as problematic or non-\nproblematic, where the former adheres to the strict \u201cfalse news\u201d definition \n(imposter or conspiracy sites). These are then graphed overtime using RAW \ngraphs. We also applied the roomier definitions of \u201cfake news,\u201d which adds \nto imposter and conspiracy sites \u201chyperpartisan\u201d sources. We graphed these \nvalues anew. These graphs display the proportion of \u201cfake news\u201d versus \nnon-problematic sources in Facebook for the results of each candidate \nand social issue query over the election campaigning timeframe and its \naftermath, March\u00a02019 to December\u00a02020.\nWe then compared the 2020 findings with the 2016 results, in two ways. \nFirst, we compared the 2020 results with the roomier definition (imposter \n+ conspiracy + hyperpartisan) to the \u201cfake news\u201d findings of 2016 as propor -\ntions, finding that in 2019\u20132020, on average per quarter, there are 1 in 1.8 \nsources that are \u201cfake\u201d compared to 1 in 2.6 in 2016. Thus, the \u201coriginal\u201d \u201cfake \nnews problem\u201d has worsened. Second, we examined the source list from \nFebruary to November\u00a02016 in order to ascertain whether the findings were \nbased on a strict or roomy definition for that timeframe. Early in the 2016 \ncampaign, those sources were largely hyperpartisan or satirical, but the \nbest-performing story by far was from a reputable source that mistakenly \npublished a \u201cfake story,\u201d originating from a tweet by Sean Hannity of Fox \nNews  that the then candidate Trump had used his own private plane to \ntransport \u201c200 stranded marines\u201d (American Military News, 2016). Right \nbefore the 2016 election (August to November), the best-performing sources \nwere again hyperpartisan or satirical ones (as Ending the Fed, Breitbart and \nWorld News Daily Report), though imposter sites also make an appearance \n(Denver Guardian). For a sense of how definitions of fake news politicize, \nThe Sc ale of fa ceboo K\u2019S  Pr oble M  de Pe ndS  uPo n ho W  \u201cfa Ke n eW S\u201d  iS  cla S Si fied  63\nwe also examined which candidates were associated with hyperpartisan \nnews, noting how Biden is targeted far more often in such sources.\nTo study the politicization of the \u201cfake news\u201d problem further, we com -\npared the overall engagement on Facebook of hyperpartisan sources, both \nconservative and progressive, as well as the candidates and issues that \nhad each type most associated with it, finding that conservative, so-called \nhyperpartisan sources outperformed hyperpartisan progressive ones.\nReferences\nAllSides (2020).

How might we characterize the shift \nin the information ecologies of these spaces around the time of the 2020 \nU.S. election?\nEssay summary\nThis chapter takes up these questions through a quantitative analysis of the \nnews links shared on the spaces of the subcultural political web. It details \nthe results of two separate studies. The first dataset covers the beginning \nof the 2020 presidential primaries, while the second period the lead-up and \nfollow-through of the November\u00a03, 2020 election. We employed a variety \nof methods to tackle these questions, of which the \u201chaystack-to-needle\u201d \ndeductive method pioneered by Hagen and Jokubauskaite (2019) produced \nthe best results in investigating the texture of informational websites \nshared.\nConstructing a coding schema based on Benkler et al.\u2019s work studying the \n2016 U.S. election, we first investigated the presence of \u201cjunk\u201d news on each \nplatform, which Howard et al. define as content \u201cextremist, sensationalist, \nconspiratorial, masked commentary, [or] fake\u201d that presents itself as news \n(Howard et al.\u00a02017; see also Gray et al., 2019). The presence of junk news \non each platform remained relatively stable, comprising approximately a \nthird of sources on 4chan and a fifth on Reddit.\nWe then investigated those sources coded as news proper and as well as \nfor partisanship using a variety of expert sources. We find that while the \nfirst collection period was characterized by a plurality of websites coded \nas neutral news, the period leading up to and through the election marks \na shift towards partisanship in the news ecologies of both spaces.\nFinding YouTube as an outsized source in both spaces\u2014in both time -\nframes making up a higher share of links on 4chan than all other sites \ncombined, and a stark presence on Reddit\u2014we focus further on the types of \nvideos that characterize each platform\u2019s YouTube shares. While the network \nof right-wing pundits that make up what Lewis (2018) dubs the \u201calternative \ninfluence network\u201d constituted a strong presence in the first dataset, their \npopularity in the lead-up to the election dramatically wanes\u2014replaced by \nvideo clips that purport to illustrate the very theories that the AIN traffics \nin, and illustrating a potential abandonment of the mediated, parasocial \nrelationships that make up the AIN\u2019s appeal (Lewis, 2020). Methodologically \nspeaking, this chapter\u2019s cross-platform methods\u2014using hyperlinks as \nWhen MiSi nfor MaTi on M igra Te S 69\nmetaphors for interest as opposed to tracking infrastructural syntaxes \nspecific to particular platforms\u2014offers a further potential avenue for study \nin the face of deplatforming and the migration of user audiences across \nplatforms (Rogers, 2020b).\nImplications\nThe accelerated informational exchange and ease of publication afforded \nby social media took on a dystopic turn during the 2016 U.S. election, \nwhere coordinated campaigns to manipulate information ecologies on \nmainstream social media platforms like Twitter sounded an epistemic \nalarm and added \u201cmisinformation\u201d to the cultural lexicon (Shao et al., 2018). \nBut as platforms strengthen their harmful content policies in response \nto criticism for harboring misinformation and hate speech, especially \nafter the election (Einwiller and Kim, 2020; Donovan and boyd, 2018), \nwe began to see alternative spaces such as the relatively unmoderated \nand historically uncensored subcultural political web found on spaces \nlike Reddit and 4chan as primary hubs for the spread of misinformation \n(Coppins, 2020). The lack of oversight in these spaces marks a continuation \nof what Starbird et al. refer to as the \u201cecho-systems\u201d that characterized \nthe spread of misinformation in 2016, wherein particular news sources \nare amplified within a discursive space and iteratively gain volume and \nattention (2018). And while Reddit banned a number of subreddits in \nJune\u00a02020 for violating their hate speech policy\u2014including the notori-\nous alt-right subreddit \u201cr/The_Donald\u201d (included in our dataset)\u2014the \npseudonymous nature, sheer scale, and ideological underpinnings of these \nplatforms set up a \u201cpropaganda pipeline\u201d where misinformation and its \ncorrelates gain vivacity (Benkler et al., 2019). These subcultural political \nplatforms make up what Tuters calls the \u201cdeep vernacular web\u201d (2019), \ncharacterized by pseudonymous participation and its antecedent trolling, \nplayfulness, and dreams of unfettered freedom of speech (Massanari, \n2017; Coleman, 2012; Buyukozturk et al., 2018), and are thus important \nplayers in contemporary news ecologies. But to characterize every user of \nthese spaces as a part of this propaganda pipeline would be too general. \nWhat does news circulation on these spaces look like? How are common \nnarratives and shared realities drawn in these spaces? And what might \nbe different about their conceptions of information, political punditry, \nand mediated verification?\n70 anTh ony gl yn bu rTon  \nFindings: News ecologies, compared\nIncreasing junk news as the election drew near\nWe observed that \u201cjunk news\u201d aesthetically or through the adoption of tech -\nniques masquerading as news websites either pushed conspiracy theories \nor presented content with the aims of sensationalizing or propagandizing. \nOn 4chan, the presence of junk news remained relatively stable across our \ndatasets, with 32% of links posted falling under the category in the first \ntime period and 31% of websites in the second time period. On the other \nhand, the stark shift in the presence of junk news on Reddit between our \nfirst and second datasets points to the fact that Reddit\u2019s banning of starkly \npolitical subreddits may have played a role in the information ecologies of \nthe site: while 17% of links shared fell under the category of junk news in \nour first dataset, it fell to about 4% in the second dataset, with propaganda \nmaking up little over 1% of links, sensationalist media counting 3%, and \nconspiracy a paltry 0.5%.\nThe types of junk news that appear on each website provide us with fur -\nther insight on changes that occurred as the election approached, especially \non 4chan. While propaganda was in relative abundance in the initial data \ncollection period\u2014with 20.2% of total links falling under the category, \ncompared to 10.7% as sensationalist and 1.2% as conspiratorial\u2014the lead-up \nto the election saw propaganda junk news fall by almost half, to 10.4% of \ntotal news links posted. Sensationalist news decreased slightly to 6.9%. \nMost notably, 14.4% of links in our second dataset were categorized as \nconspiratorial. This is an increase by a factor of 14. And while it is still \noutranked by the first dataset\u2019s number of propagandistic links, the increase \nin conspiracy as the election approached signals a dramatic shift.\nIncreasing partisanship as the election drew near\nCompared to junk news, websites which appeared to follow journalistic \nstandards made up the majority of links in both datasets. The changes over \ntime, however, are notable: while both Reddit and 4chan hovered around \n60% of all links being to news websites in the first data collection period, \nnews links on 4chan slightly lowered to 58% on the second run while Reddit\u2019s \nnumber increased by almost a third to 83%. But what appears on the surface \nas a relatively stable and socially endorsed informational ecology belies the \npartisan shift that occurred as the election approached.\nWhen MiSi nfor MaTi on M igra Te S 71\nIn the first dataset, Reddit\u2019s news sources contained a plurality of neutral \nsources\u201448% of all websites, and 57.8% of all websites coded as \u201cnews.\u201d \nLeft-leaning sources made up 24.8% of all links, while right-leaning sources \nmade up 9.9% of news links. The second dataset saw a marked shift in the \npolitical valence of hostnames, however. In this period, left-leaning websites \nmade up a plurality of the links, with 42.0% of links posted being categorized \nas such. Much of this gain was at the loss of neutral links, which numbered \n21.1% of all total news links; meanwhile, the number of right-leaning links \ndecreased to 3.9% of all news links.\nThe shift towards partisanship (according to our coding) was starker on \n4chan. In the first dataset, news websites categorized as neutral made up \n46.4% of the total information websites posted, while right-leaning websites \nmade up 12.3% of links and left-leaning websites just 4.1%. In the run-up \nto the election, however, the amount of neutral websites that appeared \ndecreased by more than half, comprising just 17.5% of total news-coded \nlinks. This decrease was counterbalanced by a tripling of both left- and \nright-leaning links. Left-leaning links appeared 15.9% of the time in the \nsecond dataset, while right-leaning links made up over a third of all news links, appearing 35.0% of the time.\nVideo ecologies: Categories versus our own coding\nOn both 4chan\u2019s /pol/ and in the political subreddits, video plays an \nimportant part in collective information habits. In both datasets, links \nto YouTube on 4chan were higher than all other links combined; on Red -\ndit, YouTube was the top-linked website. In the first run-through of the \ndataset, we focused on studying the videos posted by using YouTube\u2019s \nown categories to characterize videos. \u201cNews & Politics\u201d made up the \nmajority of links shared on both websites, with \u201cPeople & Blogs\u201d being the \nsecond highest. \u201cNews & Politics\u201d contains political content, news clips, \nbroadcasts, and other related content, while the purview of \u201cPeople & \nBlogs\u201d is slightly larger, containing talk shows, interviews, video casts of \npodcast recordings, and vlogs. Despite these core similarities, \u201cEducation\u201d \nand \u201cNonprofits and Activism\u201d made up the third- and fourth-highest \ncategories in the Reddit data, while \u201cEntertainment\u201d and \u201cMusic\u201d made \nup the third- and fourth-largest categories on 4chan. Given the lack of \ngranularity of these categories we performed our own coding for the \nsecond dataset, applied to YouTube links on both 4chan and Reddit, \ndetailed in Table\u00a04.1.\n72 anTh ony gl yn bu rTon  \nTable\u00a04.1  C oding scheme of Y ouTube videos.\nVideo type Definition\ncl\nip Short, standalone clip without context\nShitposting de\nliberately low-quality content that provokes attention and disrupts \ndiscursive exchange \nco\nlley and Moore 2020, 22)\ndi\nscussion co\nnversation or debate surrounding a particular issue\nPress \nco\nnference Videos of partial or full press conferences held by officials\ninte\nrview i\nnterviews between individuals\nre\nportage re\nporting of an event by press or individuals\nl\nivestream The live filming and transmission of an event\ncom\npilation an e\ndited collection of videos, clips, reporting, etc.\ncamp\naign Video Videos created by political consultants or staff with a direct promo-\ntional purpose\nMeme Videos of a typically humorous nature with viral qualities\naud\niobook a\n video containing a narrativized recording of a book\noth\ner an\ny content that does not fit in the above categories\nOn 4chan a significant number of videos shared were categorized as \nshitposting, followed by discussion and clip (see Table\u00a04.2). On Reddit, \nthe top categories differed, with audiobooks, discussions, and inter -\nviews making up the top three. There was likewise a much higher level \nof homogeneity among videos shared on Reddit: only five of the twelve \ncategories appeared on Reddit, while 4chan\u2019s shared videos ran across \nthe different types.\nTable\u00a04.2  Y ouTube video types per platform (Reddit and 4chan).\nVideo type Reddit appearances 4chan appearances\ncl\nip 17.0 4% 30.81%\nShitposting 0% 18.23%\ndi\nscussion 22.69% 12.88%\nPress \nco\nnference 0% 5.93%\ninte\nrview 26.2% 2.77%\nre\nportage 24% 8.36%\nl\nivestream 0% 2.21%\ncom\npilation 0% 10.02%\ncamp\naign Video 0% 5.37%\nMeme 0% 2.12%\naud\niobook 10.07% 0%\noth\ner 0% 1.31%\nWhen MiSi nfor MaTi on M igra Te S 73\nThe decline of the alternative influence network\nWhile these categories were not used in the first round of data collection, \nqualitative observation of the data indicates that the type of videos shared \nshifted strongly over two datasets: the direct viewer address of alt-right \npolitical punditry gave way to a documentarian form of video clip, usually \ntaken out of its overall context, designed to act as \u201cunmediated\u201d footage \nof depicted events. At the beginning of the election period, videos from a \ngroup of alt-right pundits that Rebecca Lewis calls the \u201calternative influence \nnetwork\u201d constituted these spaces\u2019 video culture. The AIN is a group of \nloosely associated pundits that form a sort of \u201cnetwork,\u201d in Lewis\u2019s terminol -\nogy, by appearing on each other\u2019s YouTube channels and repeating talking \npoints brought up by websites such as Breitbart and the Daily Caller. The \ncast of characters on this network differentiate themselves by peddling \ntheir own particular brands of misinformative and conspiratorial content \nthat ideologically speaking ranges from the Trumpian Republican party \nline to neo-Nazism. AIN member Richard Spencer regularly propagandizes \nfor a white ethnostate (Kaplan, 2017); Paul Joseph Watson of Prison Planet \npushes the conspiracy that 9/11 was a covert government operation (Hines, \n2018); Jordan Peterson shot to fame by claiming a Canadian government bill \nintroducing gender identity as grounds for discrimination was an example \nof creeping \u201cpost-modern radical leftism\u201d (Peterson, 2016). The AIN could be \ndescribed as reactionary politics pivoting to video: by explicitly positioning \nthemselves as alternatives to legacy and mainstream news outlets, members \ncan adopt the techniques of social media influencers to \u201cbuild audiences \nand \u2018sell\u2019 them on far-right ideology\u201d (Lewis, 2018, p.\u00a04).\nIn the earlier dataset, these links made up 596 of the total YouTube links \nshared on 4chan, and 3989 of the links shared on Reddit. The second dataset \npaints a different picture of the video cultures of the deep vernacular web: \nthe AIN made an appearance on 4chan just 337 times, for a 42.5% reduction, \nwhile Reddit users shared videos from the AIN just 458 times, a reduction \nof 88.6%. The Reddit numbers are likewise boosted by 378 shares of a video \nby Mike Cernovich titled \u201cUn/Convention: Exposing Fake News at the RNC \nand DNC\u201d (2016). The second-most popular AIN members\u2014Ben Shapiro\u2019s \n\u201cDaily Wire,\u201d Rick Rubin\u2019s \u201cRubin Report,\u201d and Tim Pool\u2014were only shared \n15 times apiece.\nOne possible explanation is that a combination of deplatforming and \nsubreddit banning could explain their decline, but it does not bear out. The \nmost popular AIN figures on 4chan and Reddit in the earlier dataset, Joe Ro -\ngan and Ben Shapiro (\u201cPowerfulJRE\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Wire,\u201d in channel-name \n74 anTh ony gl yn bu rTon  \nterms), remain on YouTube, as do 4chan\u2019s two favorites, Sargon of Akkad and \nTarl Warwick (\u201cThe Thinkery\u201d and \u201cStyxhexenhammer666,\u201d respectively). \nAnd while Reddit banned a significant number of subreddits between the \nfirst and second data collection periods, as detailed above, this would have \nno bearing on 4chan\u2019s sharing numbers, which show a decline in viewing \nby nearly half.\nAlternative or mainstream influence network?\nFrom the purview of the subcultural spaces under study, the AIN\u2019s desig -\nnation as alternative could be revisited. Put differently, they could have \nmainstreamed or normified, in the sense that all the figures above as well \nas many others in the AIN still enjoy robust followings and high YouTube \nsubscriber counts outside of the subcultural spaces discussed here. Yet \nthe video consumption tastes of their original fans seem to have shifted. \nInstead of pointing to AIN pundit commentaries on political clips, they point \nincreasingly to clips discussed by lesser-known YouTube accounts. Three of \nthe top five shared YouTube videos on 4chan in the second dataset fall under \nthis category, and all are documentary-style recordings recontextualized \nto articulate a particular political or empirical theory by non-AINs. One \n\u201cAmy Adams\u201d has two of the top shared videos. The first is a 35-second \nundated clip of Joe Biden, posted in 2016, titled \u201cSHOCKING: Joe Biden \ndiscusses the left\u2019s globalist agenda\u201d (Adams 2016). The other is \u201cKRAKEN \nUNLEASHED: The press conference they don\u2019t want you to see\u2026\u201d (2020). \nAnother is a 70-second clip from 2017 titled \u201cSenator Schumer says God \nmade him a guardian of Israel,\u201d posted by the user \u201cIf Americans Knew,\u201d who \ndescribe themselves on their biography page as \u201can independent research \nand information dissemination institute, with particular focus on the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, U.S. foreign policy regarding the Middle East, \nand media coverage of this issue. Specifically, the organization\u2019s objective is to provide information that is to a large degree missing from American press coverage of this critical region\u201d (2017).\nMigrating misinformation\nTwo observations may be made from a comparison of these two periods. \nWhen it comes to \u201ccleaning up\u201d the junk news strewn about on a platform, \neliminating spaces\u2014not necessarily users, which would be considered \ndeplatforming and is another discussion (see, e.g., Rogers, 2020; de Keule -\nnaar and Burton, 2021; Urman and Katz, 2020)\u2014may lead to precipitous \nWhen MiSi nfor MaTi on M igra Te S 75\nreductions. Reddit\u2019s banning of politically charged subreddits, especially the \nnotorious r/the_Donald, coincided with a steep decline in dubious content \non Reddit. The amounts also dwarf those in comparison with 4chan. If we \nthink of the changes in 4chan data as a rough way to normalize the Reddit \nchanges, the fact that only 4% of links were categorized as junk news at all \n(let alone a particular type of junk news) while the amount of junk news on \n4chan remained relatively stable lends credence to arguments concerning \nthe effectiveness of such actions.\nAs was found in a previous study of subreddit closures, users of r/the_Don -\nald are not known to have migrated en masse to any other particular subred -\ndit but rather moving to the group of independent \u201c.win\u201d platforms (Goforth, \n2021). While the \u201c.win\u201d platforms were outside the scope of this study, it\u2019s \nalso possible that some of the purged users from Reddit made their way to \n4chan/pol/ after June\u00a02020. It could explain the rise of conspiratorial content \non 4chan in the run-up to the election: not necessarily a shift in existing \nuser sentiment, but a migration of users themselves. It is worthy of further \ninvestigation given how that subreddit and /pol/ have been credited with \nan outsize influence on the spread of political misinformation (Blackburn, \n2018; Zanettou et al., 2017).\nThe second notable observation in the dataset is the decline in popularity \nof the alternative influence network in these spaces, paralleled on 4chan \nby the rise in conspiratorial \u201cfound footage,\u201d documentary-style clips. Out \nof the videos shared over 100 times on 4chan in the run-up to the election, \nthese clips made up 30.81% of all total videos\u2014almost double the runner-up, \n\u201cshitposting,\u201d at 18.23%. While these clips do not carry the explicitly political \nexplanations or expressions that characterize the AIN, they instead act to \nsupport pre-existing conspiratorial narratives on the far right. Adopting the \ngeneric affordances of documentary footage, they play into narratives of \nelection irregularities, COVID-19 hoax theories, and Hunter Biden\u2019s alleged \nties to Ukraine. Thus, the stark rise in conspiratorial links on 4chan is \nparalleled by the rise in popularity of these fodder-style videos, which is \nlikewise paralleled by Reddit\u2019s closing of r/the_Donald and other politically \nunsavory subreddits. Investigating this further would require a closer lens \non the months surrounding the subreddit\u2019s banning as well as innovations \nin method to determine an appropriate proxy for user migration, considering \nReddit\u2019s pseudonymity and 4chan\u2019s anonymity.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the instability of contemporary platform ecologies \nrequires a robust framework for studying them across particular spaces and \nthat the open nature of hyperlinks, despite being one of the web\u2019s oldest \ninfrastructural elements, provides a way to track these spatial conflations. \n76 anTh ony gl yn bu rTon  \nIt\u2019s also clear that in order for the misinformation epidemic to stay under the \ngrasp of those tracking it, further research is needed on both the ecologies \nthat spring up on migratory platforms as well as the role these shifts play \nin the evolution of verification, epistemologies, and political narratives.\nMethod: Finding links in a web stack\nThis project consisted of two periods of data collection: from the beginning \nof the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign to its middle, and then the end of \nthe campaign and two months of its aftermath. We took Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s \ncampaign announcement for the Democratic Party nomination on January\u00a011, 2019 as marking the beginning of the campaign period. This research window \nran until March\u00a025, 2020, the day we began our data collection. The second \nround of research, conducted from January\u00a07\u201310, 2021, picked up where the \nfirst research window left off, up to December\u00a031, 2020.\nMethodologically, we oriented our data collection around the political \nspaces of the respective platforms. On 4chan, we drew our data from the /\npol/ board. Titled \u201cpolitically incorrect,\u201d /pol/ is the forum\u2019s largest board and \ncontains a few unique infrastructural syntaxes that allowed us to narrow \nour research. User posts are tagged with a small flag, which is automatically \nchosen based on the geographic location of the user\u2019s IP address. We thus \nqueried for user posts tagged with a U.S. flag in our given time periods. The \nflag is not a perfect proxy for location, because users can manually select \ncustom flags such as \u201cCommunist\u201d and \u201cEuropean\u201d alongside explicitly \noffensive and anachronistic flags like the Rhodesian flag (for context, during \nour first data collection period there were 4,173,476 posts with custom flags \non the entirety of the board, and 25,872,606 posts with U.S. flags). Users \ncannot change their flag to another geographic location, however, so while \nour collection did not incorporate users with custom flags, those U.S. flags \nwe did capture can reliably be said to originate in the U.S.\nFor Reddit, we relied on the Reddit bot named \u201cuserleansbot,\u201d in order to \ncollect political subreddits. Userleansbot is designed to provide \u201cinformation \nand transparency to the users engaged in political communities across \nreddit\u201d (userleansbot, 2020). Userleansbot\u2019s primary purpose is to provide \nthe political leaning of Reddit users on request. By replying to a user\u2019s \npost and tagging the bot, userleansbot analyzes the posting history of the initial poster and quantify the frequency of their participation on various \nsubreddits in order to provide an estimation of their political leanings. The \nlist from which userleansbot sources its information is crowd-sourced from \nWhen MiSi nfor MaTi on M igra Te S 77\nvarious Reddit users through personal threads as well as direct suggestions \nvia Reddit\u2019s direct messaging feature. The bot is popular on Reddit: users \nhave awarded it 50,254 karma points, a (high) score that refers to Reddit\u2019s \ninfrastructural points system that allows users to endorse the activity of \nother users (userleansbot, 2020). In order to build our list for analysis, we \ntook the list of subreddits that userleansbot relies on to code partisanship \nand then selected those subreddits that dealt with U.S. national politics.\nIn the first round of data collection, we began our research by employing \nthe \u201cneedle-to-haystack\u201d method (Hagen and Jokubauskaite, 2018). This \nmethod entails inductive investigation, looking for a \u201cneedle\u201d of particularly \ndefined URLs within the \u201chaystack\u201d of collected data. We employed the \n4chan Capture and Analysis Toolkit, or 4CAT (Peeters and Hagen, 2018), to \ncollect all posts in our time range from 4chan/pol/ with U.S. flags, and from \nour collected political subreddits. Given that our initial research questions \nrevolved around the presence of \u201cpink slime\u201d websites outlined in Bengani \n(2019), we used a list of these websites as our needle and our collected data as \nthe haystack. There were no pink slime websites found in either dataset. We \nthen turned to the \u201chaystack-to-needle\u201d method, taking a deductive approach \nto investigate the news ecologies of each space. In our first collection period, \nwe wrote a python script to filter for a regular expression that matched \nURLs to construct this dataset. In the second collection period, we used \n4CAT\u2019s functionality to extract hostnames from our datasets (which uses a similar regular expression strategy on its backend).\nHostnames were then manually coded according to the coding schema \nadapted from Benkler et al.\u2019s study of the media ecologies of the 2016 U.S. \nelection (Table\u00a04.1), using a combination of the qualitative study of each \nwebsite\u2019s front page alongside information from Media Bias/Fact Check \n(2020) (when the political valence was still unclear after consulting Media \nBias/Fact Check, both NewsGuard and AllSides.com were used). Media Bias/\nFact Check codes websites according to their political partisanship into 9 \ncategories, using a qualitative methodology to rank sources on 4 metrics: \nBiased Wording/Headlines, Factual/Sourcing, Story Choices, and Political \nAffiliation. While we drew basic readings from Media Bias/Fact Check, we \nused it as a guide for our first reading of the websites as opposed to adapting \nits coding schema directly because of its breadth. We coded news websites \nas those that adhered to journalistic standards, while websites that made \nno attempt or posture towards the appearance of presenting news were \ncoded as \u201cnon-news.\u201d The remainder, which we classified as \u201cjunk news,\u201d \nwas further split into conspiracy (circulating conspiratorial narratives), \npropaganda (misrepresenting facts for political aims), and sensational \n78 anTh ony gl yn bu rTon  \n(websites aiming to emphasize salacious perspectives or \u201cclickbait\u201d-style \ncontent).

From this, our coding dataset contained 204 websites \nWhen MiSi nfor MaTi on M igra Te S 79\nfrom Reddit and 182 from 4chan. We used Bernhard Reider\u2019s YouTube Data \nTools (2015) to collect video metadata, including category, view count, date \npublished, and title. Since the YouTube Data Tools use the YouTube API, \nwhich occasionally returns malformed data, we scripted a separate call in \nPython to the YouTube API that individually verified each video returned and whether it was deleted since its appearance in the links dataset.\nBoth our tooling and sampling criteria were changed for the second \nobservational period. Between our observational periods, Reddit banned four \nsubreddits that together constituted a large portion of data in our first study: \nr/ChapoTrapHouse, r/The_Donald, r/RightwingLGBT, and r/TheNewRight (Ingram and Collins, 2020). Our second observational period spanned the \nperiod of 9\u00a0months, in contrast to the 15\u00a0months observed between Janu -\nary\u00a02019 and March\u00a02020. Because of this smaller window, we reduced the \ncut-off we used for coding hostname links on Reddit from 2,000 to 100, which \nresulted in 220 hostnames from Reddit being coded. On 4chan, likewise, \nwe reduced the cutoff for coding websites from 400 mentions to 200, which \nyielded 219 results. Regressions and limitations introduced into YouTube\u2019s \nAPI between the first observational period and the second led us to writing \na custom script using youtube-dl (ytdl-org, 2021), in order to capture video \nmetadata. Instead of using YouTube\u2019s API, youtube-dl programmatically \nscrapes the information from the video by simulating the loading of what \na casual user would see on a video page. While this took longer to run than \nusing the YouTube Data Tools, our requests were not malformed or subject \nto the unknowns of YouTube\u2019s API interface.\nReferences\nAdams, A.

Significantly, (hyper)\npartisan sources are close to half of all sources shared, implying a robust \npresence. By March\u00a02021, though, both the share of problematic and of \n(hyper)partisan sources decreased significantly, suggesting the impact \nof Twitter\u2019s deplatforming actions. Additionally, active, problematic users \n(fake profiles, etc.) were found across the political spectrum, albeit more \nabundantly on the conservative side.\nKeywords: hyperpartisanship, misinformation, U.S. elections, deplatform -\ning, Capitol riots, digital methods\nResearch questions\nTo what extent are problematic sources present in the most engaged-with \ncontent in political and social issue spaces on Twitter in the run-up to and aftermath of the 2020 U.S. elections? Has Twitter\u2019s deplatforming affected \nthe quality of sources shared? Are there problematic users among the most \nactive, and are they typically of a particular political leaning?\nRogers. R. (ed.), The Propagation of Misinformation in Social Media: A Cross-platform Analysis . \nAmsterdam: Amsterdam University Press 2023\ndoi: 10.5117/9789463720762_ch05\n84 M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nEssay summary\nTo probe the extent to which problematic sources are present on political \nTwitter, the study queries political keywords and investigates the most \nshared news sources and their credibility as well as the most active users, \ntheir authenticity and partisanship. Problematic sources refer to Jack\u2019s \ncharacterization as containing information that is \u201cinaccurate, mislead -\ning, inappropriately attributed, or altogether fabricated\u201d (2017, p.\u00a01). Most \nengaged-with  content on Twitter refers to the most retweeted tweets and/\nor most frequently shared sources within the given time periods. Most \nactive users or accounts are those with the highest tweeting activity, and \nproblematic ones are fake accounts, bots or locked/suspended users. Political \nand issue spaces on Twitter (or \u201cpolitical Twitter\u201d) refer to the result sets \nfrom keyword and hashtags queries for presidential candidates, political \nparties and social issues.\nIn March\u00a02020 the amount of problematic news sources shared on Twit -\nter was 16% of all shared news sources. By December\u00a02020 the share of \nproblematic news sources almost had doubled to 30%. In March\u00a02021 we \nfound a sharp decline in those shared, at just over 10%. While it may have \nto do with the decline in source sharing during that time frame, it also \ncould reflect the significant purge of user accounts by Twitter in the days \nafter the Capitol riots of January\u00a06. The purge likely affected users who were \ninvolved in sharing problematic sources.\nIn the first two time spans under study (March\u00a02020 and December\u00a02020/\nJanuary\u00a02021), close to half of the non-problematic sources circulating the \nnews were classified as (hyper)partisan,1 suggesting that Twitter, like Fa -\ncebook before it, is a platform where such sources perform well (Silverman, \n2016). In March\u00a02021, the third timeframe, we saw a drop to 34% in that \ncategory. The first two periods set themselves apart from the third in that \nthey witnessed the dominance of conservative (hyper)partisan sources \nwhich were no longer as strongly in evidence in the third period of time \n(after the deplatforming).\nIn terms of the users, in 2016 it was mostly pro-Republican fake and bot \naccounts that shared problematic information on Twitter (Bovet and Makse, \n2019). We noticed, however, that there are also pro-Democrat fake and bot \n1 (H yper)partisan is used with the parentheses not only to indicate an amalgamation of \nthe hyperpartisan and partisan source types, but also to signal the difficulty in consistently \ndisentangling them. Below we use (hyper)partisan when discussing sources that were labeled \nas such in the study.\nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 85\naccounts actively circulating such information. In addition, instead of using \ntheir own hashtags, both Democrat and Republican supporters tend to use \neach other\u2019s hashtags to draw attention from their opposition.\nImplications\nEver since its tagline changed from What are you doing? to What\u2019s happening? \n(2009) Twitter has become regarded less as an ambient friend-following \nmedium than as a \u201creporting machine\u201d at least in the Western social media \nrealm (Rogers, 2014; Tate, 2009). In the past decade, Twitter also has been \nregarded as a space for doing politics, exemplified by Donald Trump\u2019s usage \nof the platform as a political tool in his campaigning for the presidency \nin 2015\u20132016 and later by its integration into his administration. Trump\u2019s \ntweeting changed the nature of the presidency and allowed him to leverage a \nrelatively novel form of media power (Enli, 2017), at least up until the banning \nof his account on January\u00a08, 2021, as a response to the Capitol building riots \nand violence two days before, given the role that Trump played in fueling \nand \u201cglorifying\u201d them.\nGiven the dominant presence of Trump on Twitter, but also of other \ncandidates and their supporters and observers, it arguably became the \nkey social media platform where the politics of the 2020 U.S. presidential \nelections played out. Trump\u2019s \u201cpopulist anger\u201d (Wahl-Jorgensen, 2019, p.\u00a0117) \nwas not only on display on Twitter but connected to a hybrid media system \nin which mainstream media co-mingle with \u201cfringe\u201d players (Chadwick, \n2017; Wahl-Jorgensen, 2019). It is the extent of this co-mingling that one is able to study on Twitter.\nIn this regard, it is important to note how social media posting not \nonly \u201cfolds into\u201d (Niederer, 2019, pp.\u00a0119\u2013120) the content of mainstream \nmedia (within which we distinguish more or less partisan sources) but \nalso impacts their \u201caffective styles\u201d (Wahl-Jorgensen, 2019, p.\u00a0116). A broad \nset of transformations have accompanied these new media, enabling a \nmedia regime to emerge in which there is a \u201cnormalization of a new set of \n\u2018emotion rules\u2019 that allow a president to consistently make statements that \nare verifiably false, be called out on these falsehoods and pay no political price for them\u201d (Delli Carpini, 2018, pp.\u00a018\u201320).\nTwitter is a space that is vulnerable to problematic information and \nthe presence of potentially problematic users such as fake accounts and \nbots (Boyd et al., 2018). We identified such problematic activity during \nthe periods under study, each of which with distinctive user activity. The \n86 M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \ninitial time span is the period around \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d on March\u00a03, 2020, \nwhen the greatest number of states hold their primaries or caucuses. We \nthen repeated our analyses in the final days of 2020 from late December \nup until January\u00a04, 2021, which covers the post-election time span and the \nsignificant U.S. Senate run-off elections in Georgia on January\u00a05 which \nwould result in a Senate majority for the Democrats. In retrospect, these \ndays were also close to the Capitol riots of January\u00a06 that were spurred by \nongoing speculations about election fraud. This time frame represents a \nTwitter discourse centering on speculations concerning the balance of \npower after the Senate run-offs as well as allegations of election fraud and \nsubsequent calls for protesting the \u201cvote steal.\u201d The final time span under \nstudy covers March\u00a010 to 22, 2021 and can be characterized as not only \npost-election but also post-purge after Twitter deplatformed over 70,000 \naccounts (many linked to QAnon conspiracies) between January\u00a09 and 12, in response to the aforementioned riots (Conger, 2021).\nOverall, our findings show that mainstream sources outperform (or are \nshared more often than) problematic sources on political Twitter. Though \nthe circulation of problematic sources was higher just after the election, \nthey never outperformed mainstream sources as was the case on Facebook \nin the run-up to the 2016 elections (Silverman, 2016). We do see a significant \ndrop in March\u00a02021 in the circulation of problematic sources after the \nTwitter purge.\nIn both March\u00a02020 and December\u00a02020/January\u00a02021 nearly half of the \nsources shared were coming from sources that we sub-categorized as (hyper)\npartisan progressive or (hyper)partisan conservative. We also witnessed a \nnoticeable uptick in problematic sources shared in the aftermath of the elec -\ntions which spans the weeks in which the Twitter discourse was dominated \nby allegations of electoral fraud. While (hyper)partisan sources do not share \nconspiracy or pseudo-science and are not problematic in that sense, the \nfindings point to a particular kind of hybrid media landscape. It provides \nplenty of space for (hyper)partisanship and problematic information to \nco-mingle with mainstream sources. Put differently, mainstream news is \nincreasingly confronted with more partisan players in the field, at least on \nTwitter in the run-up to and aftermath of the U.S. elections.\nThough beyond the scope of this study, our findings imply that more \nproblematic information is engaged with on social media than in other online \nmedia spaces such as the web, where the top-ranked media properties (by \ntraffic) are rather mainstream and include NBC, CBS, Disney and Turner \n(ComScore, 2019), though a separate measure should be taken of the \u201cpolitical \nweb.\u201d This disparity between Twitter and the web aligns with what Barnidge \nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 87\nand Peacock (2019) point out concerning the reliance on social media for \nthe dissemination of hyperpartisan (and problematic) sources.\nIn the run-up to the presidential elections in 2016, multiple studies \nindicated that suspect accounts were mostly spreading problematic, pro-\nRepublican information on Twitter (Bovet and Makse, 2019). During the cam -\npaigning and in the (immediate) aftermath of the 2020 elections, however, \nwe also identified problematic, pro-Democrat accounts actively spreading \nproblematic information across Twitter, though they do not outnumber \nthose on the other side of the political spectrum. That is, compared to the \nfindings of previous studies concerning the type of problematic accounts, \nto date there are indications of a shift from mainly conservative to a mix \nof conservative as well as progressive problematic accounts. Additionally, \namong the datasets of most active users we found more problematic accounts \nthan authentic ones, implying that highly active accounts during election campaigning deserve scrutiny.\nWith respect to the most engaged-with tweets, the vast majority is posted \nby influential users, and they do not circulate many problematic sources. \nThe finding indicates that most retweeted content (rather than most tweeted \ncontent only) is a quality indicator, at least in this brief study. The role of \nfollower counts is thus important as there is a direct relationship between follower and retweet counts. If problematic users would attain influential masses of followers, such analyses might look different.\nIn light of the societal consequences of disseminating problematic or \nhyperpartisan sources, it is important to stipulate that the link between \nsharing and the actual visibility of such sources is not clear cut, given how \nvisibility is algorithmically determined. We can assume a higher probability \nof exposure, however, when tweets are retweeted (Kwak et al., 2010). Meier \net al. (2014) found that retweeting and liking could be regarded as audience \nengagement in a conversation and attention to the messages, which facilitates \ninformation transmission.\nSituating the findings: Diversification and polarization on \nTwitter\nWe situate our findings around the sharing of problematic and non-\nproblematic sources in the affordances of a platform that, to a certain \nextent, democratized news sharing in the sense of opening the gates for \nnon-mainstream sources to circulate and be amplified. In order for sources \nto be successful on Twitter, we need to understand both how people are \n88 M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nexposed to news sources and what makes (news) content prone to ampli -\nfication in that realm. The rise of social platforms has posed challenges \nto theorizing selective exposure to news. Barnidge and Peacock (2019) \ndistinguish two ways in which social media have restructured selective \nexposure to news. Both ways provide a means to assess the implications \nof our findings that social media diversify social connections and facilitate \nthe rise of hyperpartisan news.\nThe diversification aligns with Bruns\u2019s reflections (2019) on the existence \nof filter bubbles and echo chambers (Pariser, 2011; Sunstein, 2001). Such \nstructures of isolated communities are based on a belief that social media \ninevitably promote echo chambers and filter bubbles as they personalize \ncontent to the extent that individuals consume news in isolated ways. \nEmpirical research into the existence of such structures have not found \nevidence to support this belief (O\u2019Hara and Stevens, 2015; Barnidge, 2017). \nBruns (2019) modified these concepts through introducing degrees of \n\u201cbubbleness\u201d or \u201cchamberness\u201d: scholars can quantify the extent to which \npeople connect or communicate within and beyond ideological groups. This \nmodification does justice to the fact that by far most people use multiple \nsources for their news consumption (Dubois and Blank, 2018) and that \npeople befriend others not just on the basis of their political leanings. Bruns \n(2019) backs the latter argument by stating how people are not primarily \non social media (or at least on Facebook) to talk politics. We would like to \nnote that Twitter\u2019s use culture is more geared toward talking politics than is Facebook\u2019s, for example, which might lead to different ways of curating one\u2019s social network.\nThough Twitter users may have diverse social networks and the infor -\nmation that people are exposed to is varied, the findings from our study \nunderscore how sharing sources seems to largely follow one\u2019s own political \nleaning: in the datasets where Republican leaning users were most active, \nthe (hyper)partisan sources were mainly conservative in kind and vice versa. \nNote, too, how the Republicans are overrepresented in the data demarcated \nby keywords pertaining to the Democrats, which is related to how Twitter users are calling out or attacking their opponents in their tweets.\nWithin all datasets we found a pattern whereby users employ the op -\nposition\u2019s keywords and hashtags, in order to target each other. It occurs \nin political spaces organized around both political parties and candidates. \nWithin these supporter spaces, there appear to be more sources shared that \nattack the opponent rather than support the candidate. (See also Starbird \n(2017) as well as Groshek and Koc-Michalska (2017) for investigations into \nstrategies of attack and trolling of mainstream media, especially apparent \nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 89\non Twitter.) Our findings thus reiterate how the relentless targeting of people \nthrough hyperpartisan viewpoints continues and is a phenomenon practiced \non both sides of the political spectrum. One methodological implication is \nthat one cannot neatly demarcate a supporter space through hashtag and/\nor keyword queries only.\nBarnidge and Peacock (2019) point out that alongside the diversification of \ninformation described above, social media also allow hyperpartisan voices \nto reach a wider audience that is now able to share messages independently \nof mainstream media. Hyperpartisan news could be described as having \na slanted political agenda and making scant effort to balance opposing \nviews. It could be said to push anti-system messages that are critical of \nmainstream media and established politicians, relying on dubious informa-\ntion or misinformation to do so. It also depends heavily on social media for \nits dissemination (Barnidge and Peacock, 2019).\nThrough challenging mainstream narratives, hyperpartisan media also \noverlap with notions of alternative media. Strengthening Bruns\u2019s argument \nabout the absence of isolated bubbles, Peacock et al.\u2019s empirical investiga -\ntion (2019) found that strong partisans on social media are exposed to \nboth left- as well as right-leaning news. In order to proffer an \u201calternative \nperspective\u201d to mainstream news, hyperpartisan media and users have to \nmonitor mainstream sources to know how these outlets talk about issues. \nThey attach commentary to the narratives of mainstream media. As O\u2019Hara \nand Stevens point out: \u201cengaging with the enemy does not necessarily make \na group less partisan\u201d (2015, p.\u00a0418). Bruns (2019) expands on this point and \nsituates exposure to diversified information as intensifying polarization \nthrough in-group identification and providing an outside \u201cother\u201d that serves \nas an embodiment of the political enemy. We might not live in isolated \nbubbles; rather, it is the diversification of information on platforms that \nseems to spur polarization because of an increased exposure to opposing views. This observation would involve a much-needed research focus into \nhow people perceive and recontextualize news on social media to fit it into \ntheir existing beliefs.\nExpanding on Bruns\u2019 argument about \u201cporous\u201d filter bubbles and \necho chambers, we found that many tweets were formatted to call out or \nattack opponents, e.g., from the dataset that queried GOP: \u201cIf we \u2018move \non\u2019, the GOP will refuse to concede future elections, then judge-shop \nuntil they steal one. There must be a price paid for sedition or we will \nlose our democracy. This is critically important work in the next couple \nof years\u201d (Alter, 2021). This strategy of attacking opponents was apparent \nin the fact that the tweet data collected through (for example) words \n90 M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nthat relate to Democrats contained largely Republican-leaning users \nwho were calling out or attacking Democrats and vice versa. Note for \nexample that in the March\u00a02020 Republican-oriented dataset, a tweet \nfrom a Democrat reads: \u201cReal quick: How are Republicans like Donald \nok with 2% of people dying from coronavirus as if 2% is not a very high \nnumber. But when you discuss a 2-cent wealth tax on people making over \n50 million they freak out like it\u2019s the worst thing that could ever happen \nto them\u201d (Salenger, 2020).\nMainstream media attempts to contextualize and balance the narra -\ntives injected by hyperpartisan sources. When terms like \u201cjunk news\u201d and \n\u201cconspiracy theory\u201d are invoked, they seem to trigger political backlash \n(Rogers, 2020a) and increase distrust in mainstream media. This dynamic \ncan only be further understood if affective and intuitive tactics of people \nwho are consuming and sharing news on social media are taken into account. \nAs Swart and Broersma (2021) found in their analyses of young people\u2019s \nassessments of the trustworthiness of news, it is prior knowledge, lived \nexperiences, and endorsements of sources by people within their own social \nnetworks that guide how people assess sources, which in turn plays a vital role in the choice to share particular sources over others.\nWhen it comes to sharing news, the existing literature also steers attention \ntoward the emotive underpinnings of hyperpartisan news and its effects \nwhen disseminated in the realm of social media. Twitter\u2019s business model \nis based on an attention economy, which places emotion at the forefront \nof journalistic practices. While emotion and information are not mutually \nexclusive, hyperpartisan media tend to exploit anger and a culture of outrage \n(Barnidge and Peacock, 2019; Berry and Sobieraj, 2014). Berry and Sobieraj \n(2014) move away from conventional wisdom that the rise of outrage media \nis the result of increased political polarization and argue for considering \nthe economic underpinnings of what they dub an \u201coutrage industry.\u201d They \nsituate this industry in the context of structural changes to the media \nlandscape that have fostered its exponential growth.\nTwitter as part of this new media landscape is market-driven and \ndependent on the stickiness of content circulating on its platform. What \nmakes users stick around (and share)? In the context of problematic and \nhyperpartisan news media, Berger and Milkman\u2019s study into viral news \ncontent (2012) is instructive for it examines what animates users to share \ncontent by assessing the emotive components of more and less shared \ncontent. They found that the virality of the content depends on evoking \nhigh-arousal positive (awe) or high-arousal negative (anger or anxiety) \nemotions. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., \nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 91\nsadness) is less viral.2 Thus outrage is seen as viral, which sheds light on \nthe rise of hyperpartisan news on Twitter, as this kind of news is \u201cmeant \nto cause outrage, cue partisan emotions, and get clicks (i.e., make money). \nHyperpartisan news \u2026 provides low-quality news with the goal of making \nmoney from people\u2019s\u2014in many cases misguided\u2014anger and outrage\u201d \n(Barnidge and Peacock, 2019, p.\u00a06). Note, however, that a binary opposition \nbetween quality journalism that is \u201cinforming\u201d and less emotive and a \nsensationalized form that is merely emotive is false, as Wahl-Jorgensen \n(2019) also stipulates, in reference to Boltanski (1999). The creation of \nempathy is a prerequisite for political action. We want to stipulate that our \ndistinction between problematic and non-problematic sources is not based \non considerations regarding a distinction between factual and emotive \nnews sources; rather, we point to the role of exploiting outrage through \na socio-technical synergy between (hyper)partisan news outlets and a \nmarket-driven platform.\nNotwithstanding the fact that all journalistic items hold some emo -\ntion, the affordances of Twitter facilitate a discursive climate which is \nmore extreme, divisive and polarized than most mainstream news spaces \n(Shepherd et al., 2015). Trump but also hyperpartisan (and problematic) \nnews outlets have benefitted from this affective shift by crafting messages \nin such a way that they spill over to mainstream media (Karpf, 2017) that in \nturn, and perhaps unwantedly, amplify fringe players on the platform. So, \nalthough the majority of shared sources is still comprised of mainstream \nnews organizations, problematic and hyperpartisan sources are pushing \nfor more space and might have spillover effects in the form of steering \nmainstream content and affective styles of communication on the platform.\nThough investigating such spillover effects into content and style of legacy \nmedia is beyond the scope of our analyses, we did find that in political issue \nspaces such as that of DACA, mainstream media either followed uptakes \nin problematic source-sharing (see third time span, Figure\u00a05.4) or seemed \nto veer upwards after such flares in problematic source-sharing (second \ntime span, Figure\u00a05.4), suggesting that problematic sources can be at the \nforefront of constructing a particular narrative about an issue at hand that is \nthen taken up by mainstream sources. The latter dynamic can be the result \nof an algorithmically maintained power disparity between mainstream \nand fringe sources due to the intensification of majority (already popular) \n2 T hese results hold even when the authors controlled for how surprising, interesting, or \npractically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external \ndrivers of attention, e.g., how prominently content was featured.\n92 M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nvoices, a dynamic also hypothesized by among others Bruns (2019) as well as \nBozdag and Van den Hoven (2015). This observation opens a relevant future \ndirection for misinformation research which is more sensitive to detecting \nthe adoption, or the \u201cfolding in,\u201d of fringe and at times problematic sources \nin the coverage and affective styles of mainstream media.\nFindings\nFinding 1: On Twitter the number of mainstream sources attached to political \ntweets or retweets is greater than problematic sources, however much the \nhigh share of (hyper)partisan sources within mainstream sources points to \na rather polarized platform. After the Twitter purge of problematic accounts \nin January\u00a02021, the share of (hyper)partisan sources within mainstream \nsources decreased significantly.\nIn the data collected during all three time frames (March\u00a02\u201322, 2020, \nDecember\u00a024, 2020\u2013January\u00a04, 2021 and March\u00a010\u201321, 2021) around a million \nlinks to media articles were shared. Of these, overall, mainstream news \nsources outperformed problematic sources on Twitter. In March\u00a02020, the \nshare of problematic news sources shared on Twitter was 16% of all shared \nnews sources. In December, the share of problematic news sources almost \ndoubled to 30%. In March\u00a02021, the share of problematic sources dropped \nsignificantly to 11%. The source classifications are based on source labeling \nplatforms and contain two main categories indicating whether a source is \nmainstream or problematic and sub-labels for mainstream sources indicating \n(hyper)partisanship conservative or (hyper)partisanship progressive. The \npercentage of mainstream sources shared from sources subcategorized \nas (hyper)partisan decreased slightly from 48% in March\u00a02020 to 43% in \nDecember and further dropped to 33% in March\u00a02021. This drop mostly \nowes to conservative (hyper)partisan sources being less circulated. Overall, \nmainstream sources are shared more often than problematic news websites, \nthough closely after the election, there was a significant rise in the share of \nproblematic sources which decreased again in March\u00a02021.\nFinding 2: Conservative sources are shared more often when discussing \nDemocrat keywords, and in most cases progressive sources are shared more \noften when discussing Republican ones. In Twitter we queried for specific \nkeywords and hashtags (see Table\u00a05.1) that represent each party and political \ncandidate and found that in both March periods of 2020 and 2021 conservative \nsources were shared more than progressive ones when discussing Democrat \nkeywords, and vice versa (Figures 5.2 and 5.3). Only in the December/January \nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 93\nperiod the share of progressive sources in the Republican dataset was lower \nthan that of conservative sources. We also found that in both March periods \nthere were fewer problematic sources shared when discussing Republican \nkeywords than Democrat ones. In December the proportion of problematic \nsources was much higher which is a trend we see across all datasets. The \n(hyper)partisan conservative sources in December are shared more often \nacross both Republican and Democrat political spaces.\nThis finding is in contrast with the results in the other two periods that \nindicate a crossover of information where (hyper)partisan conservative \nsources were shared in the Democrat issue space and (hyper)partisan \nprogressive sources were shared in the Republican. The change in December \nindicates that in the aftermath of the elections, Democrats continue to \nattack Donald Trump and the Republican party while some problematic \nand conservative (hyper)partisan sources seem to make a shift and even \nattack Republicans in the December/January time period when the alleged \nelection fraud was a major topic. One example of this shift is an article3 \n3 https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/12/raffensperger-gets-caught-georgia-ballots-\nprinted-differently-gop-counties-vs-dem-counties-election-rigged/\nfi gure\u00a05.1 cu mulative total of mainstream and problematic hosts shared on political Twitter over \nthree time spans: March\u00a02\u201322, 2020, \nde\ncember\u00a024, 2020\u2013January\u00a04, 2021 and March\u00a010\u201321, 2021. \nli\nne graphs by \nca\nrlo \nde \nga\netano and \nfe\nderica \nba\nrdelli.\n94 M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nfi gures 5.2 and 5.3 cum ulative total of mainstream and problematic hosts shared on political \nTwitter when querying \nre\npublican or \nde\nmocrat terms for three time spans: March\u00a02\u201322, 2020, \nde\ncember\u00a024, 2020\u2013January\u00a04, 2021 and March\u00a010\u201321, 2021. \nli\nne graphs by \nca\nrlo \nde \nga\netano and \nfe\nderica \nba\nrdelli.\nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 95\nby the Gateway Pundit which made up 25% (23,000 shares) of the total of \nproblematic content shared in that 4-day period, attacking a Republican \nin Georgia (who had not followed Trump\u2019s wishes). In terms of hashtag \nuse, users who support the Democrats would use Republican keywords or \nhashtags such as #gop and #republicans to tweet against or at them. The \nsame holds for the Republican supporters using the Democrat terms.\nFinding 3: Mainstream sources are shared more often than problematic \nsources concerning social issues related to health care and climate change \nbut not DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) where problematic \nsources outperformed mainstream sources in certain periods during March \nand December\u00a02020 as well as in March\u00a02021. In the third time span DACA \nhas fewer partisan sources than in the first two time spans. That is, of those \nunder study, the one issue where problematic sources are shared more \noften than mainstream sources (only during the first week of March and \nDecember\u00a02020) is DACA (Figure\u00a05.4), though the high engagement is largely \nattributed to a few articles. In the second and third weeks of March\u00a02020, \nthe number of problematic sources in the DACA issue space significantly \ndecreased. Indeed, across the three social issues, with the exception of \nDACA, few problematic sources were shared.\nWe note a similar pattern of shared problematic sources across the issues \nwhen comparing all time frames. In general, all issue spaces show less \nengagement in the time periods after the election. For example, there was \nalmost no activity in the Medicare issue space in March\u00a02021, indicating \nits election relevance rather than a broader societal concern. Note that \nthe sample sizes in these issue spaces are small, so one article can quickly \nspike engagement.\nFinding 4: There were more problematic accounts (fake accounts, bots or \nlocked/suspended) than real accounts on Twitter among selected keyword \nand hashtag datasets (Democrat, Republican, Trump) except for Biden\u2019s \ndataset in the first time frame. The latter data did contain problematic \naccounts in the second time span, covering the immediate aftermath of \nthe elections.\nWe now move to the top 20 users with the highest number of tweets and \nretweets during two, three-day time frames in March (one during and one \nafter \u201cSuper Tuesday,\u201d March\u00a03, 2020) and a third time frame (January\u00a01\u20134, \n2021). In the Republican and Democrat keyword and hashtag datasets we \nnoticed that, in total, there were more problematic accounts than real \naccounts (Figure\u00a05.7) for these time frames. For the Democrat dataset we \nfound only four real accounts in March and one account that clearly labeled \nitself as a bot that retweets all tweets by Trump.

In the Democrat keyword and hashtag dataset, most accounts, \nwhether real or fake, were mostly pro-Republican, indicating again how \nusers are employing the opposing political party\u2019s terms. The same applies \nto the Republican keyword and hashtag dataset, where most users are \npro-Democrat as opposed to Republican, though a smaller proportion is \nfake. Interestingly, in January\u00a02021, the share of fake and bot accounts \nshifts between these two issue spaces. The number of fake accounts in the \nRepublican hashtag space is now larger than the Democratic space. In our \ndatasets in total, problematic accounts in January make up about 60% of \nall accounts which is roughly the same as in March.\nIn 2016 it was found that suspect accounts were mostly Pro-Republican, \nand these were responsible for spreading most of the problematic in -\nformation (Bovet and Maske, 2019). In March we found that there was \nalready a rise in problematic accounts associated with pro-Democrats. \nIn January, we found that there are more problematic pro-Democrat \naccounts compared to March. Thus, it can be argued that Democrats are \nemploying problematic accounts within Republican political spaces to \nattack the Republican party.\nfi gure\u00a05.6 cu mulative total of mainstream and problematic hosts shared on political Twitter \nconcerning \ngr\neen \nne\nw \nde\nal, during the time spans: March\u00a02\u201322, 2020, \nde\ncember\u00a024, 2020\u2013Janu-\nary\u00a04, 2021 and March\u00a010\u201321, 2021. \nli\nne graphs by \nca\nrlo \nde \nga\netano and \nfe\nderica \nba\nrdelli.\n98 M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nfi gure\u00a05.7 The top 20 users with the highest activity measure on Twitter within the de mocrat, \nre\npublican, \nbi\nden and Trump hashtag/keyword datasets, collected March\u00a02\u20134, 2020 and \nJanuary\u00a01\u20134, 2021. \nbu\nbble diagrams by \nca\nrlo \nde \nga\netano and \nfe\nderica \nba\nrdelli.\nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 99\nfi gure\u00a05.8 The top 20 users with the highest activity measure on Twitter within the de mocrat and \nre\npublican hashtags/keywords datasets, collected during the time spans: March\u00a02\u20134, 2020 and \nJanuary\u00a01\u20134, 2021. \ndi\nagrams by \nca\nrlo \nde \nga\netano and \nfe\nderica \nba\nrdelli.\n100  M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nfi gure\u00a05.9 The top 20 users with the highest activity measure on Twitter within the hashtag/\nkeyword datasets for the three political issues, collected during the time spans: March\u00a02\u20134, 2020 and January\u00a01\u20134, 2021. \ndi\nagrams by \nca\nrlo \nde \nga\netano and \nfe\nderica \nba\nrdelli.\nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 101\nFor the candidates\u2019 datasets (Biden and Trump) the same process was fol-\nlowed, but we filtered the top 20 users (by tweeting activity) that @mention \neach candidate (Figure\u00a05.7). Interestingly, a similar shift can be seen in the \nDemocrat and Republican datasets when comparing the two time frames. \nIn March, the Biden dataset had the highest number of real accounts, with \na few fake and locked/suspended accounts. The majority of users that @\nmention Biden is not problematic, and they are supporters of his political \ncampaign. The opposite holds for users mentioning Trump where results \nare equally distributed between bots, fake, and real accounts. In terms \nof partisanship, the majority is pro-Republican, which indicates that in \ncontrast to the political party spaces, the most active users are supportive. \nIn January, however, the most active users are those who are attacking either \ncandidate. There are more pro-Democrat bots attacking Trump and more \nreal pro-Republican accounts attacking Biden. Overall, the debate seems \n(even) more polarized in January compared to March.\nFinding 5: The most retweeted tweets among all datasets in both \nMarch\u00a02020 and December\u2013January\u00a02021 were made mostly by influential \naccounts like the presidential candidates, members of Congress, organiza -\ntions, and journalists and largely do not contain any problematic sources. \nFew problematic sources were found among the top 20 most retweeted tweets \nin the Democrat and Republican keyword and hashtag datasets in the two \ntime frames (Figure\u00a05.8). For example, the two tweets flagged as problematic \nin the Republican space in March are linked to the website run by Dan \nBongino, a conservative talk show host. A large majority of the retweets are \nby less controversial, influential people, including presidential candidates, \nmembers of Congress and journalists. The results are largely similar for \nthe January\u00a02021 dataset, where one highly resonating retweet opposing \nDemocrats was labeled as questionable. It relates to a news item around \nelectoral fraud from the OAN (One America News), which is a problematic \nsource as per our classification based on Media Bias/Fact Check (see also \nmethods section). Another resonating retweet referred to Breitbart News \ncovering calls for investigating electoral fraud.\nMethods\nBefore initiating our Twitter data collection, we curated a list of queries \nfor political candidates, political parties and social issues, incorporating \npolitician-specific, party-specific and issue-specific keywords and hashtags \n(Table\u00a05.1).

Each \nsource was labeled into two main categories, mainstream or problematic. \nMainstream sources could be sub-categorized as (hyper)partisan conserva -\ntive, (hyper)partisan progressive or neither. The expert list was created \nusing existing labeling sites such as Allsides.com, Media Bias/Fact Check, \u201cthe Chart,\u201d and NewsGuard. We consider the categorization as rough. By \ncalculating the total number of times problematic sources were shared \n4 h ttps://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat\nfr inge Pl ayer S on  Pol i Ti cal T Wi TTe r 103\nduring our duration of study and comparing it with the mainstream sources \nwe were able to show the magnitude of the matter at hand. Are problematic \nsources present and shared by the users on Twitter who make use of specific \npolitical hashtags and keywords? We limited the scope of the top users and \nhashtags under study to three days in the first two time frames, starting \nfrom the 2nd of March\u00a02020 and from the 1st of January\u00a02021. The reason for \nchoosing the specific March period was that it encompassed \u201cSuper Tuesday,\u201d \na day when the largest number of U.S. states hold primary elections, and it \nwould be a reasonable assumption that the Twitter engagement on this day, \nthe day prior, and the day after would be higher than the other days in our \ndate range. The January time frame was just before the deciding Georgia \nrun-off elections for the U.S. Senate on January\u00a05, which would give the \nDemocrats a slim majority and in hindsight, with that time frame, we also \ncaptured the days before the Capitol riots of January\u00a06, 2021.\nWith the dataset of most active users, we investigated the extent to which \nproblematic users/accounts (fake profiles, bots, or locked/suspended users) \nwere present. We examined the top 20 users with the greatest number of \ntweets on political Twitter. These users were then coded or categorized on \ntwo scales: \u201cauthenticity\u201d and \u201cpartisanship.\u201d For the authenticity label, \nthe top 20 users were classified into four types based on their Twitter \nprofiles, where the idea is to gain a sense of the genuineness and legitimacy \nof the top users: real, fake, bot, and locked/suspended. The categories are \nadopted from the audience intelligence website, SparkToro, which ranks \nTwitter users based on their attributes (Fishkin, 2018). For bots, the website \ncategorizes accounts by determining whether they have Twitter\u2019s default \nprofile image, if an account has an unusual ratio of followers/following, \nor posts an abnormal number of tweets per day, among other signals. \nFake/real profiles, too, are judged according to (usual/unusual) tweeting \nhabits and behavior. The second categorization is \u201cpartisanship,\u201d where \nall the top users\u2019 political leanings were labeled independently by two \nauthors by looking at their Twitter profiles and classifying them into one \nof three categories: Democrat-leaning, Republican-leaning, or unknown. \nAny disagreements between the authors resulted in labeling the one in \nquestion as unknown.\nWith regards to the most retweeted tweets, the top 20 tweets were ex -\ntracted from the political spaces, and from the three issue-specific hashtags, \nDACA, Green New Deal, and Medicare. The most retweeted or the most \npopular tweets were further categorized into two categories of partisanship \nand the categories problematic or non-problematic information provider.  \nSimilar to the problematic users\u2019 segment, the partisanship of the tweets was \n104  M aar Te n gr oen and Marloe S  ge boer S \nmanually labeled by looking at the language of the tweet and further details \nabout the person who tweeted. To decide if a tweet contains problematic \ninformation, we checked whether any news sources linked in the tweets \nwere classified as such in the labeled source list.\nReferences\nAlter, J.

How \ndid Twitter\u2019s content moderation guidelines and techniques for COVID-19 \nmisinformation interfere in these divergences? How did COVID-19 affect \nTwitter\u2019s overall policies on misinformation?\nEssay summary\nAs new information on the epidemiological nature of COVID-19 infections \nand its impact on public safety evolves, so do claims on which objective \nfacts constitute it (Yong, 2020). Twitter has been tasked with ensuring \nthat their users maintain a basic level of consensus around public safety \nguidelines and other information relative to personal and public health by, \nfor example, centralizing access to local health organizations and representa -\ntives, flagging and at times deleting \u201cmisleading\u201d tweets that contradict \nsuch sources (Skopeliti and John, 2020). But with diverging guidelines and \nfacts occasionally opposing even authorities\u2014notably ex-U.S. President \nTrump, the American Center for Disease Control, the National Institutes \nof Health and the World Health Organization\u2014the platform has struggled \nto determine whom to attribute ultimate authority for reliable information \nabout COVID-19 transmission, treatment and protection.\nIn this context, we find that English-speaking publics who interact with \nany of these authorities have at times been polarized around either Donald \nTrump or the World Health Organization. As these authorities contradict \neach other, we find that Twitter begins to moderate\u2014and ultimately \nsuspend\u2014authorities that disrupt the general consensus over COVID-19, \nparticularly Donald Trump. We conclude that Twitter\u2019s moderation of \nproblematic information on the virus demonstrates how the platform relies \nless on specific guidelines over what constitute true and false information \nthan on the general consensus between public health authorities.\nThese findings suggest two main implications. First, Twitter\u2019s moderation \nof authoritative sources renders the platform an authority in its own right, as \nit ultimately decides which of these authorities can and cannot govern on its \nplatform. Second, COVID-19 has pushed platform moderation of misinforma-\ntion from detecting and suppressing technically inauthentic contents to \ninformation that affects the overall consensus over what constitutes correct \ninformation, leading the platform to sanction outliers or \u201cextremes,\u201d and \nshrink its size down to a more homogeneous (and thereby cohesive) public \nsphere. Both of these implications constitute a few emerging characteristics \nof a kind of \u201cpost-Trump\u201d internet.\nTWiT T e r a S  acciden Ta l au Th ori Ty  111\nImplications\nHeads of state, health organizations and the public have been frequently \ndivided on claims around COVID-19, such as whether asymptomatic people \nand children can contaminate others, whether one should use a mask, or if \nchildren can be contagious (Iati et al., 2020; O\u2019Leary, 2020). In this context, \ngovernments and public health authorities have struggled to maintain a \nconsensus with their local publics and each other (Starbird, 2020), hurting \npublic trust in their capacities as main references about the pandemic \n(Bordia and Difonzo, 2004; Bostrom et al., 2015; Starbird et al., 2016).\nIn response, social media, search engines and encyclopedic wikis have \nbeen tasked with ensuring that their users maintain consensus around \npublic safety guidelines and other information relative to public health \n(Skopeliti and John, 2020). Since the early months of 2020, Google Web \nSearch, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit have set up centralized \naccess points to information provided by local and global \u201cauthoritative \nsources\u201d (Skopeliti and John, 2020). Though some stakeholders continue \nto demand more radical platform redesign (Dwoskin, 2020), more mod -\nest measures include prompting local guidelines on the virus whenever \none searches or consults information about COVID-19 (Lee and Oppong, \n2020), temporarily disabling the personalization of Newsfeeds (Lyons, \n2020); flagging contents (tweets, posts, videos) that disseminate contested \nclaims (Lyons, 2020), demoting \u201cborderline\u201d or suspicious contents like \nconspiracy theories and raising \u201cauthoritative content\u201d to the top of search \nand recommendation results (De Keulenaar et al., 2021; YouTube, 2019), \nand altogether deleting materials that pose a danger to public health, such \nas anti-vaccination or alternative medication (De Keulenaar et al., 2021; \nYouTube, 2020).\nBut with information about the virus being uncertain in the early months \nof the pandemic, one wonders how a platform like Twitter has adapted \nits COVID misinformation policy to tolerate the relative contingency of \nknowledge and facts about the virus. Not only have authoritative guid -\nance on treatments and protection frequently changed, but they have also \ncontradicted each other. Guidance by the World Health Organization, favored \nby nearly all social media platforms, at times differed from what the Centers \nfor Disease and Control Prevention, the NIH and then-U.S. President Donald \nTrump advised. While such discordances are to be expected, we assume \nthat it has at times created a crisis of authority in the platform\u2014a \u201cstate of \nexception\u201d (Schmitt, 2005)\u2014that has pushed Twitter to take exceptional \nmeasures to maintain a baseline of consensus in its platform.\n112  de Ke ulenaar ,  Ki SJeS , SM iTh,  albrech T  and  ca PPu ccio  \nDrawing partly from studies on collective sensemaking and rumors \n(Caplow, 1946; Dailey and Starbird, 2015; Krafft et al., 2017; Shibutani, \n1966), we use close reading and natural language processing techniques \nto measure the relative divergence of authoritative and \u201caudience\u201d claims \nabout COVID transmission, prevention and treatments. Authoritative \nsources include international and U.S. representatives and public health \norganizations, with claims released on Twitter and their respective websites, \nand their \u201caudiences,\u201d defined here as the users who have at some point \nengaged with or referred to the former on Twitter. Our dataset contained \n250 million tweets that mention #covid or #coronavirus between March \nand October of 2020. Authoritative sources include then-U.S. President \nDonald Trump, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National \nInstitutes of Health, and the World Health Organization\u2019s International and \nRegional Office for the Americas. Using the Wayback Machine (Internet \nArchive, 2021), we then examine how Twitter adapted its content modera -\ntion techniques to moderate COVID-19 misinformation. We capture Twitter \nmoderation data for each of the tweets in our dataset using Selenium, a \nweb interface scraper, obtaining labels, suspensions and other removal \ndisclaimers.\nWe find that the pandemic has pushed Twitter and its platform counter -\nparts to delimit what \u201cmisinformation\u201d or other problematic information \nis, be it in a technical, authoritative or even rhetorical sense. Determining \nthe objective value of statements on COVID-19 treatments, prevention \nand transmission vehicles, however, is not a responsibility the platform \ninitially embraces. Its preference is to relay that decision to \u201cauthoritative \nsources,\u201d a solution already set by other platforms to prioritize authoritative \ncontents as \u201creputed\u201d or \u201ctrustworthy\u201d sources, despite mixed reactions \nfrom users suspicious of \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of left-wing American \npolitical culture (Economist, 2019). This study also shows mixed results. \nThe absence of consensus among authoritative sources makes the 2020 \nU.S. (and international) crisis of authority on COVID-19 even more evident, \nwith the WHO, CDC, NIV and the White House contradicting one another. \nThe difference, we find, is that in the absence of authority, Twitter steps in \nas an authority itself.\nConsensus and misinformation in the process of COVID-19 \nsensemaking: Conceptual implications\nA number of misinformation policies and studies have focused on detecting \nand correcting misinformation by (for example) investing in media literacy \nTWiT T e r a S  acciden Ta l au Th ori Ty  113\nand pinpointing factors that can \u201cincrease the chances of citizens to be \nexposed to correct(ive) information\u201d (Scheufele and Krause, 2019, p.\u00a07664). \nStrategies include removing false content and demoting false or \u201cborderline\u201d \ninformation in favor of authoritative sources (Scheufele and Krause, 2019, \np.\u00a07664).\nA possible drawback of these strategies is the decontextualization of \nmisinformed claims from the premises and info spheres that substantiate \nthem. These spheres are frequently outside of misinformation-policed \nsocial media platforms (De Zeeuw et al., 2020), and their users may be \nunaware of the information needed to understand claims and directives from \nauthoritative sources (Kou et al., 2017). In other instances, misinformative \nclaims can come from more innocuous misunderstandings (De Zeeuw et \nal., 2020), or attempts at making sense of situations still unexplained by \nauthorities (Krafft et al., 2017, p.\u00a02976; Starbird et al., 2016). The inconsistency \nof official information is characteristic of the formation of rumors and other \n\u201cimprovised\u201d sensemaking (Shibutani, 1966), which in themselves constitute \nan attempt to create consensus or a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d where there \nis none (Bordia and Difonzo, 2004).\nIn this sense, we join a field of study that approaches misinformation as \na dynamic by-product of poor consensus between information providers \nand recipients\u2014authoritative sources and their audiences\u2014who must in \ncrises \u201cconverge\u201d around a common understanding of facts and the epistemic \nframeworks used to validate them (Scheufele and Krause, 2019, p.\u00a07663; \nStarbird, 2012, p.\u00a01). By pinpointing information that authoritative sources \nand their audiences mutually ignore and comparing diverging claims related \nto these terms,2 we find that authoritative sources and their audiences do \nnot always focus on the same aspects of COVID-19, nor do audiences always \nrely on the same authoritative sources.\nFrom misinformative to misleading tweets: How COVID affected \nTwitter\u2019s moderation of \u201cproblematic information\u201d\nOver the course of 2020, Twitter adapted its anti-misinformation content \nmoderation policies significantly. Twitter\u2019s initial approach to manag -\ning COVID-19 misinformation on its platform piggy-backed on existing \npolicies that targeted inauthentic user behavior. In early February\u00a02020, \nthe platform targeted COVID misinformation as deceitful contents, or \n2 F or example, audiences mention \u201c5G\u201d and \u201cfood\u201d as transmission vectors, while authoritative \nsources focus on \u201ccough\u201d and \u201ctouch.\u201d\n114  de Ke ulenaar ,  Ki SJeS , SM iTh,  albrech T  and  ca PPu ccio  \ndisinformation: doctored footage or photography, or contents forged with \nthe intention to mislead other users (Twitter, 2020). It uses the World \nHealth Organization as a reference from which to determine whether a \ntweet is false or not. This requires heavy-handed, top-down measures to \nremove tweets that contradict such authorities before they can spread \non the platform.\nAs the pandemic began to spread globally, however, it became clear \nthat existing conceptions of disinformation do not capture the fact that \nCOVID-19 is also the subject of widely diverging and contingent information. \nIt becomes difficult, arguably impossible, for the \u201cauthoritative sources\u201d \nTwitter recommends delivering stable facts and guidelines on the virus. On \nthe one hand, this leads Twitter to fine-tune its definition of misinformation \ndown to the level of the rhetoric of a tweet. This includes both what a tweet \nclaims and how  it claims it. On the other, Twitter also broadens its definition \nof misinformation as a problem of consensus. It recognizes that information \nabout the virus, even when provided by authoritative sources, is subject to \ndisagreements and change.\nRather than resorting merely to deletion, it seeks to reinforce a consensus \non guidelines and facts about the virus by centralizing users\u2019 access to COVID \ninformation. It wants to ensure that users comment on the virus within \ndelimited epistemic boundaries of what can and cannot be entrusted to \nbe true. The delimitation of those perimeters is an arbitration outsourced \nto local, legislative and medical authorities: those tasked with deciding \nthe truth about the virus. This means pointing users to local authorita -\ntive sources\u2019 websites on tweets that mention the virus or adding links \nto national or state-level guidelines on newsfeeds and homepages. These \nmeasures\u2014exemplified by the early #KnowTheFacts prompt\u2014would help \nfill in possible \u201cdata voids\u201d (Golebiewski and boyd, 2019) between authorita -\ntive sources and their audiences.\nTwitter as an accidental authority\nStill, trouble comes when authoritative sources begin to contradict one \nanother around mask usage, hydroxychloroquine treatments or airborne \nviral transmission. In such cases, Twitter does not favor one or another public \nhealth authority but does at times moderate authorities that disrupt their \noverall consensus. Ex-U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s analogies of COVID \nand seasonal flu, or the merits of hydroxychloroquine-based treatments, \ncontradict and confuse statements by the CDC and NIH. His tweets are \nflagged, counter-balanced by resources Twitter recommends users consult \nTWiT T e r a S  acciden Ta l au Th ori Ty  115\ninstead. Though the first tweet it suspended was sanctioned for violating \nits \u201cglorification of violence\u201d policy, Trump\u2019s tweets on COVID are nearly \nalways labeled by default.\nThe decision to moderate authorities appears to mark a shift between \nredirecting users towards trust-worthy sources of information to curating \nsuch sources relative to their capacity to maintain a greater consensus \namongst other relevant authorities. In this sense, Twitter is no longer mod -\nerating tweets individually, but as a larger ensemble of statements whose \noverall consensus constitutes the objective quality of COVID information. \nTechnically, moderating consensus rather than single falsehoods grants \nTwitter significant institutional responsibilities. As it optimizes the relative \nproportion of public safety and consensus, Twitter accidentally becomes an \n\u201cauthoritative source\u201d\u2014or authority, for short\u2014in its own right.\nTwitter\u2019s moderation of existing authorities speaks to a number of foun -\ndational concepts of political theory, among which is Carl Schmitt\u2019s famed \nphrase that the \u201csovereign\u201d is \u201cthat which decides the state of exception\u201d \n(Schmitt, 1932). As consensus wanes among existing authorities in a given \nbody politic and crisis sets in, the one who will hold ultimate authority is \nthat who intervenes and decides for those in this sphere regardless of the \nlegality of their actions. It is not so much Twitter\u2019s content moderation \npolicies that legitimize its moderation of authoritative sources, but its very \nability to do so regardless of existing conventions.\nFindings\nFinding 1: Authoritative sources and their audiences contradict each \nother most on undetermined facts, such as COVID-19 treatments. As may \nbe expected, audiences and authoritative sources diverge most around \nunconfirmed information. There were no single, confirmed treatments \nfor COVID-19 until the announcement of the Pfizer vaccine in August of \n2020. Despite declaring that \u201cno treatment\u201d and \u201cvaccines\u201d were available by January, authoritative sources like the World Health Organization and \nthe CDC fail to prevent their audiences from contemplating a plethora of \ntreatments ranging from house-grown remedies and specialized medicines \n(see Figure\u00a06.1), be it vitamin C, ethanol, zinc or remdesivir.\nIn this context, authoritative sources act primarily as debunkers of \nunconfirmed or false information. The World Health Organization opens \na page dedicated to debunking false ingredients reported on social media.

This can be said about chloroquine, \nhydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, dexamethasone, prednisolone and Tamiflu, \nabout which authoritative sources mention ongoing research and testing. This \ndoes not prevent audiences from continuing to engage with these ingredients.\nFinding 2: Audiences are divided around contradicting claims by au-\nthoritative sources.

Audiences do focus on modes \nof transmission mentioned by authoritative sources: (respiratory) droplets, \nclose contact, community spread, coughing, sneezing and touch. Here, too, \nauthoritative sources act as debunkers: 5G is dismissed at least twice after \ngaining considerable traction among audiences in March.\nThe caveat, here, is that audiences continue to focus on modes of trans -\nmission disputed among authoritative sources (see Figure\u00a06.4). With little \nscientific consensus on the minutiae of droplet transmissions, there is notable \npublic confusion on the airborne nature of the virus (Achenbach and Johnson, \n2020; Lewis, 2020; Mandavilli, 2020). The World Health Organization expresses \nuncertainty about airborne transmission throughout February, then later \njoins the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March to affirm \nthat it spreads mainly via droplets. Only in April\u00a02020 does the CDC offer a \nverdict: \u201caccording to experts,\u201d it says, \u201cthe virus can be transmitted by both \ndroplets and smaller, \u2018aerosol\u2019 types of particles\u201d (Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, 2020). While the World Health Organization rejects this claim, \na slight majority of users echoes the CDC\u2019s statement well until October.\nIn this context, audiences express a relatively constant amount of un -\ncertainty throughout, as well as conspiratorial suspicions in early March. \nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nMAY\nJUNE\nJULY\nAUGUST\nSEPTEMBER\nOCTOBER\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nMAY\nJUNE\nJULY\nAUGUST\nSEPTEMBER\nOCTOBERamount of claims\namount of moderated claimsUsers\nAuthoritative sources\n@RealDonaldTrump\nwho.int\ncdc.gov nih.gov\nyes\nno\nyes, in combination with azithromycinIs hydroxychloroquine \neffective against COVID-19?\nuncertain\nfi gure\u00a06.3 be e swarm of authoritative and audience claims on whether hydroxychloroquine is or is \nnot effective against \ncoVi\nd-\n19 infections.

Audiences express an equally \ndistributed amount of agreement with each claim, seemingly partitioned \ninto groups that either rely on the word of the World Health Organization or that of the White House.\nThe debate on whether the virus is droplet or aerosol airborne shows how \npopular understandings of viral transmission appear to have evolved through \ndiscussions between authoritative sources and audiences. Early public \ndoubts about whether the virus was airborne have prompted authorities to \ndefine and measure airborne transmission in increasingly concrete terms \n(see Figure\u00a06.6). While the World Health Organization had stated earlier \nthat airborne transmission is an exchange of infected droplets, recent \nfindings on aerosol transmission substantiate earlier public conceptions \nof airborne transmission as a somewhat ubiquitous form of \u201cair infection\u201d (Mandavilli, 2020).\nFinding 3: Twitter has adapted its content moderation policies to capture \nthe disputed nature of COVID-19 information. In the face of such disputes, \nTwitter\u2019s \u201cCOVID-19 misleading information\u201d policy underwent frequent changes throughout 2020 (see Figure\u00a06.7). On February\u00a04, 2020, Twitter\u2019s \ninitial definition of COVID-19 misinformation is based on a conception \nfi gure\u00a06.6 li ne graph of claims on droplet or aerosol transmission by authoritative sources \n(web domains) and their Twitter audiences (tweet replies and mentions of website domains by \nauthoritative sources, e.g., whitehouse.gov).

This \ndefinition follows existing conceptions of misinformation as disinforma -\ntion, or as semantically or technically inauthentic. Examples of the former \ninclude \u201ca deliberate intent to deceive people about the nature or origin \nof the content,\u201d and for the latter, \u201ccontent that has been substantially \nedited in a manner that fundamentally alters its composition, sequence, \ntiming, or framing,\u201d \u201cany visual or auditory information that has been \nadded or removed,\u201d and \u201cfabricated or simulated media depicting a real \nperson\u201d (Twitter, 2020a). Both of these types of information are subjected \nto an incremental type of moderation, where they are first labeled, de -\nmoted and altogether removed after infringing misinformation policies \nmore than once (Roth and Pickels, 2020). Twitter\u2019s policy against COVID \nmisinformation as \u201cmanipulated media\u201d is sealed with a general \u201czero \ntolerance approach to platform manipulation,\u201d announced in March\u00a04, \n2020 (Twitter, 2020b).\nAs the virus disseminates outside of China in early March, Twitter broad -\nens its conception of COVID-19 misinformation as contradicting local and \ninternational \u201cauthoritative sources\u201d (Twitter, 2020b). The idea, then, is to establish a baseline of facts about the virus with which to moderate user-\ngenerated contents. Content moderation targets content that may contradict \nwhat is known and stated by authoritative sources. This includes \u201cdenial of \nglobal or local health authority recommendations to decrease someone\u2019s \nlikelihood of exposure to COVID-19\u201d; \u201cdenial of established scientific facts \nabout transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance \nfrom global and local health authorities\u201d; and \u201calleged cures for COVID-19 that are not immediately harmful but are known to be ineffective\u201d (Twit -\nter, 2020b). To reinforce this policy, Twitter prioritizes posts by the World \nHealth Organization and local health organizations in users\u2019 homepages and \npersonal timelines. From January\u00a029, 2020, Twitter also launches a series of \nlabeling techniques to redirect users towards claims by authoritative sources \non the transmission, protection and treatment of the virus. Contradictions \nto these claims are first labeled and then removed (see Figure\u00a06.6) (Twitter, \n2020b).\nThe fact that authoritative sources occasionally disagree with each other \nposes a new challenge to existing COVID policies. For this reason, content \nmoderation guidelines adopt a two-fold strategy: they simultaneously \nrestrict the kind of claims users can make about COVID-19 transmission, \nprevention and treatments, and highlight the disputed nature of such \nTWiT T e r a S  acciden Ta l au Th ori Ty  123\nclaims. The idea is to adapt moderation to the contingent and disputed \nnature of various information about the disease, be they international \ndiscrepancies in public health policies or diverging claims made by au-\nthoritative sources about the virus. As did other platforms (e.g., Google \nand Facebook), it also creates a flag prompt (\u201c#KnowTheFacts\u201d) whenever \nusers search or encounter information about the virus on the platform (Chu \nand McDonald, 2020). By May\u00a011, it introduces new labeling and warning \ntechniques intended to \u201cprovide additional context and information on \nsome tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to \nCOVID-19\u201d (Twitter, 2020c).\nLater, on December\u00a016, 2020, Twitter goes as far as to specify the type \nof rhetoric that infringes upon its COVID-19 misinformation policy. \nIt targets tweets that \u201cadvance a claim of fact, expressed in definite \nterms\u201d and later \u201ctweets that are an assertion of fact (not an opinion), \nexpressed definitely, and intended to influence others\u2019 behavior\u201d (Twit -\nter, 2020d). Misleading statements on \u201cvaccines\u201d consist in spreading \n\u201cpreventative measures that are not approved by health authorities, \nor that are approved by health authorities but not safe to administer \nfrom home\u201d; \u201cthe sale or facilitation of medicines or drugs that require \na prescription or physician consultation\u201d; or information on \u201cadverse \nimpacts or effects of receiving vaccinations, where these claims have been \nwidely debunked\u201d (Twitter, 2020d). It targets conspiratorial language, \nlabeling tweets \u201cwhich suggest that COVID-19 vaccinations are part of a \ndeliberate or intentional attempt to cause harm or control populations\u201d \n(Twitter, 2020d). It reinforces consent to local authoritative guidelines by \ntargeting tweets that dispute \u201clocal or national advisories or mandates \npertaining to curfews, lockdowns, travel restrictions, quarantine proto -\ncols, inoculations \u2026,\u201d and even targets tweets about \u201cresearch findings \n(such as misrepresentations of or unsubstantiated conclusions about \nstatistical data) used to advance a specific narrative that diminishes the \nsignificance of the disease.\u201d Once again, all of the above is first labeled, \nand then removed (Twitter, 2020d).\nFinding 4: Twitter acts as a debunking system. In practice, this means \nlabeling almost every tweet that mentions a COVID-19 treatment ingredient \ndisputed by authoritative sources (see Figure\u00a06.8). Though some are deleted, \nmost are simply flagged and redirected to a centralized reference page on \nlocal COVID-19 guidelines and information. This also applies to claims dis -\nputed amongst authoritative sources, such as whether hydroxychloroquine \nis or is not a safe drug.\n124  de Ke ulenaar ,  Ki SJeS , SM iTh,  albrech T  and  ca PPu ccio  \nCovid-19 misleading information policy\nJanuary 29, 2020\nF\nebruary 4, 2020\nMarch 4, 2020\nZero tolerance approach to platform manipulation\nApril 11, 2020\nMay 11, 2020\nType of rhetoric\nMedia shared in a deceptive manner\nMarch 16, 2020\nJuly 14, 2020\nInformation that may increase the likelihood \nof exposure to the virus\nInformation that may have adverse effects \non the public health system\u2019s capacity to \ncope with the crisis\nDec 16, 2020\nFalse of misleading affiliation\nCounterspeech\nPersonal anectodes or first-person accounts\nPublic debate about the advancement of \nCOVID-19 science and research\nCOVID-19 #KnowTheFacts search prompt launched\n#KNOWTHEFACTS LABEL\nSynthetic or manipulated media\nREMOVAL\nLABEL\nWARNING\nDEMOTION\nREMOVAL\nLABEL\nWARNING\nDEMOTION\nBroadened definition of \n\u201c\nharm\n\u201d\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nUnverified claims that have the potential to incite\npeople to action, could lead to the destruction or\ndamage of critical infrastructures, or cause \nwidespread panic or social unrest\nSUSPENSION\nNew labels and warning images\nLABEL\nTweets that are an assertion of fact (not an option),\nexpressed definitely, and intended to influence\nothers\u2019 behavior\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nFalse or misleading information about the nature \nof the virus\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nFalse or misleading information about the efficacy\nand/or safety of preventative measures, \ntreatments, or other precautions to mitigate or \ntreat the disease\nLABEL\nREMOVAL\nStrong commentary, opinions, and/or satire\nALLOWED\nALLOWED\nALLOWED\nALLOWED\nfi gure\u00a06.7 Timeline of Twitter\u2019s \u201c c oVi d- 19 \nmisleading information policy.\u201d Source \nin image.

Authoritative sources\u2014the World Health \nOrganization, in particular\u2014repeatedly deny claims made on social media.\nFinding 5: In the absence of consensus between authoritative sources, \nTwitter intervenes as an authority in its own right. At issue is that disagree -\nments amongst authoritative sources create a crisis of authority on the \nplatform. Twitter can no longer redirect users to one specific source. In \nthe absence of consensus among authorities, Twitter begins to highlight \nthe disputed nature of even authoritative claims (see Figure\u00a06.10). This \napplies particularly to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s private account. While \naudience tweets are more severely moderated (suspended, deleted), Trump\u2019s \ntweets initially obtain the \u201c#KnowTheFacts\u201d prompt the platform introduced \nin January\u00a029th (see Figure\u00a06.7). Reuniting several other authoritative sources, \nthis prompt is intended to display current consensus among a majority of \nauthoritative sources, including \u201ctrusted news sources\u201d (Twitter, 2020c). \nAs Trump alleges that \u201csometimes over 100,000\u201d people \u201cdie from the Flu\u201d \nin October, Twitter flags it for violating \u201cthe Twitter Rules about spreading \nmisleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.\u201d The \nsame happens to a later tweet claiming immunity from COVID-19.\nBoth of them do stay up, in accordance with Twitter\u2019s \u201cWorld leaders\u201d and \n\u201cPublic-interest exceptions\u201d policies (Twitter, 2019), until Trump\u2019s account is \npermanently suspended for violating a separate policy designed to prevent \n\u201cglorification of violence\u201d (Twitter, 2021) .\nMethods\nThe methodology of this study is two-fold. Based on a collection of millions \nof tweets, we first parse, analyze and visualize diverging claims on COVID-19 \ntransmission, prevention and treatments between U.S. authoritative sources \nand their respective audiences. We then look at how Twitter moderated \ndisputed claims by first consulting content moderation policies designed \nfor COVID-19 misinformation, and then obtaining moderation metadata \nfrom tweets containing disputed contents.\nDefinitions\nThe U.S. has at least two channels responsible for communicating authorita -\ntive information on COVID-19: its head of state and its health departments \nor disease prevention agencies (See Table\u00a06.1 in Annex). Because Twitter \nTWiT T e r a S  acciden Ta l au Th ori Ty  129\nprioritizes the World Health Organization as an authoritative source, we also \ncaptured data from that organization\u2019s international and American offices. \nWe refer to heads of state and public health organizations as \u201cauthoritative \nsources,\u201d and the WHO, health ministries, departments and disease preven -\ntion agencies as \u201cpublic health organizations.\u201d By \u201caudiences,\u201d we refer to \nusers who have at some point interacted with any one of the authoritative \nsources on our list, be it by replying, mentioning them or their website \ndomains (e.g., whitehouse.org).\nBy \u201cclaims\u201d about the coronavirus, we mean information that can be \nconfirmed as true or refuted as false by governments and health organiza -\ntions. We focused on how the virus is transmitted, available treatments, \nand preventive methods.\nData collectionFor data collection on Twitter, we used Borra and Rieder\u2019s Twitter Capture \nand Analysis Toolkit, which collects tweets based on a chosen set of queries \n(Borra and Rieder, 2014). These queries were \u201ccovid,\u201d \u201ccoronavirus\u201d and \n\u201cWuhanVirus\u201d and captured a total of 61,498,037 tweets from January\u00a026 to \nOctober\u00a02020. Of those, we extracted 910 tweets from government and public \nhealth organizations and 496,166 replies and mentions of official domains. \nIn addition to tweets, we also collected claims on COVID-19 transmission, \nprevention and treatment by the CDC, NIV and Donald Trump\u2019s administra -\ntion on their official websites (cdc.gov, nih.org, whitehouse.gov). Information \non Twitter\u2019s COVID-19 misinformation moderation policies came primarily \nfrom two sources: Twitter\u2019s blog on COVID-19 and its \u201cCOVID-19 Misleading \nInformation Policy.\u201d From these, we were able to note what information they \ntarget and how they moderate it (suspension, labeling, deletion, etc.). We \nthen obtained moderation metadata from tweets that mentioned disputed \nclaims by using Selenium, the web scraping application.Parsing claims inductively and deductivelyTo map divergences in government, public health organization and \u201caudi -\nence\u201d statements about COVID-19, we sought to capture and compare the \nwidest possible range of claims about the transmission, prevention and \ntreatment of the virus. We captured both true and false statements with \nboth deductive and inductive approaches. The deductive approach consisted \nin consulting secondary sources on COVID-19 misinformation, such as \nWikipedia (Table\u00a06.1 in Annex). The inductive approach consisted in manual \n130  de Ke ulenaar ,  Ki SJeS , SM iTh,  albrech T  and  ca PPu ccio  \nand semi-automatic capture of claims. This involved reading tweets and \n(authoritative or official) websites that contained the words \u201ctransmission,\u201d \n\u201cprevention\u201d or \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201ccure.\u201d We also generated \nword embeddings and bigrams for the queries \u201ctransmission,\u201d \u201cprevention\u201d \nor \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201ctreatments\u201d or \u201ccure\u201d to find other relevant terms. We \nobtained a total of 48 words for transmission, 83 for treatments (2,739 with \nmedications extracted from drugbank.ca) and 79 for prevention (Table\u00a06.2 \nin Annex).\nCoding and filtering claims in tweets and official websitesWe split and detected sentences per topic as follows:\n1. Transmission: sentences mentioning \u201cinfect,\u201d \u201ctransmi,\u201d \u201ctransfer,\u201d \u201ccontag,\u201d \n\u201ccontamin,\u201d \u201ccatch,\u201d or \u201cspread\u201d;\n2. Prevention: sentences mentioning \u201cprevent,\u201d \u201cprotect\u201d; and3. Treatment: sentences mentioning \u201ctreatment,\u201d \u201ccure\u201d and \u201cvaccine.\u201d\nFor more complex queries such as whether the virus is airborne or whether \none should wear masks, we manually coded every sentence that mentioned \nboth \u201cwear\u201d and \u201cmask\u201d for the masks query and \u201cairborne\u201d and either \n\u201caerosol\u201d or \u201cdroplet\u201d for the \u201cairborne\u201d query. For sentences mentioning \nCOVID-19 transmission, coding meant annotating claims that (1) the virus \nis or is not airborne, and more specifically that (2) it spread through droplets \nor aerosols. For those mentioning protection, it implied annotating claims \nthat (1) the general public should and should not wear masks (\u201cshould wear,\u201d \n\u201cshould not wear,\u201d respectively) and (2) who should be wearing masks \n(caregivers, essential workers, travelers\u2026). In many cases, claims were far beyond simple binaries, and if frequent, required a category of their own.\nWe then manually coded the information retrieved from government \nand health authorities\u2019 official webpages on whether they provided any \ninstructions or claims about transmission, treatments and use of masks \nthat were inconsistent among them. We used the Internet Archive to track \nchanges in the information in these webpages from January\u00a02020 to July\u00a02020. \nFor each page with any information about transmission, treatments or use \nof masks, we coded them by date of change accordingly. For transmission, we coded if they agree if the transmission is possible through airborne or \naerosol, contact, droplet, fluid or animals. For treatments, we coded if they \nrecommend chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or ibuprofen. For masks, we \ncoded if they recommend wearing a mask or face-covering in public, wear a mask if one has symptoms, or wear a mask if around sick people.\nTWiT T e r a S  acciden Ta l au Th ori Ty  131\nCoding and filtering claims in social media textual data: Limitations\nTwitter audience responses contain a large number of retweets of claims \nmade by authoritative sources. Because of this, we also included tweets that \ndo not necessarily reply or mention authoritative sources but are geolocated \nin the U.S. Geolocation is included in TCAT\u2019s tweet metadata.\nModeration data\nModeration status and labels for the 4.2 million relevant tweets (i.e., by \nauthoritative sources or audiences, and containing any of our keywords) \nwere gathered using web scraping (Selenium).\nReferences\nAchenbach, J. and Johnson, C.

site for misinformation, inau -\nthentic activities, and polarization, particularly in recent studies about \nelections, the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines. In this study, we have \nfound a different platform. By looking at the content that receives the \nmost interactions over two time periods (in 2020) related to three U.S. \npresidential candidates and the issues of COVID-19, healthcare, 5G and \ngun control, we characterize Instagram as a site of earnest (as opposed \nto ambivalent) political campaigning and moral support, with a rela -\ntive absence of polarizing content (particularly from influencers) and \nlittle to no misinformation and artificial amplification practices. Most \nimportantly, while misinformation and polarization might be spreading \non the platform, they do not receive much user interaction.\nKeywords: social media, Instagram, U.S. elections, COVID-19, disinforma -\ntion, digital methods\nResearch questions\nTo what extent is ambivalent and divisive (or earnest and non-divisive) \ncontent present in the most interacted-with posts concerning political \ncandidates and social issues on Instagram in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. \npresidential elections? Do the candidates control their own \u201cname space,\u201d \ni.e., the (top) posts about them? Are there signs of artificial amplification (so-\ncalled fake or suspicious followers) among the candidates and their parties? \nRogers. R.

In 2020, concerns about such misinformation \nand divisiveness heightened in the lead-up to the U.S. elections. These \nconcerns hit the global stage in full force with the rise of the COVID-19 \npandemic, in which misinformation about the disease, the necessity of \nthe precautions taken to curb its spread, and the safety of its vaccinations \ncould pose immediate public health threats.\nRecent studies and reporting have demonstrated that Instagram is suscep -\ntible to problematic information related to elections. Prior to the 2016 U.S. \nelections, Instagram was a fertile ground for disseminating misinformation \nand divisive content (Jack, 2017; DiResta et al., 2018). Furthermore, an analysis \nof Netherlands-based news media accounts on Instagram surfaced a special \naffinity (in terms of shared followers) between mainstream news sources and \nso-called junk news providers (Colombo and De Gaetano, 2020). Additionally, \nrecent studies have found that conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine content \nspread under the guise of lifestyle content (Bond, 2021; Tiffany, 2021; Maragkou, \n2020; McNeal and Broderick, 2020). Such \u201cpastel QAnon\u201d accounts\u2014con -\nspiracy theories spread in sugar-coated messages by \u201cmummy bloggers, \nwellness coaches and lifestyle influencers\u201d (Gillespie, 2020)\u2014are yet another \naddition to the \u201ccacophony of voices and narratives\u201d which \u201chave coalesced to create an environment of extreme uncertainty\u201d (Smith et al., 2020, p.\u00a02).\nA report by the Center for Countering Hate describes how users who follow \nanti-vax accounts are presented with other problematic information by the \nplatform\u2019s recommendation systems. These include \u201crecommendations for \nantisemitic content, QAnon conspiracy theories, and COVID misinforma -\ntion\u201d (Center for Countering Hate, 2021, p.\u00a08). The study points out how the \nU.S. elections and the pandemic have fueled the disinformation problem \n(Bond, 2021). Not only has there been an increase in disinformation because \nof the divisive U.S. elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, the platform\u2019s \nrecommendation systems further grow the problem by connecting health information to a diverse range of conspiracy theories.\nThe earne S T Pl aT for M 141\nInstagram has been studied for its role in spreading divisive and polarizing \ncontent and the amplification of hate speech or harmful content (Bradshaw \nand Howard, 2018). When other mainstream platforms successfully \u201cde -\nplatformed\u201d accounts accused of sharing hateful messages and polarizing \ncontent, for a while, Instagram functioned as a refuge, dubbed as \u201cinternet\u2019s \nnew home for hate\u201d (Lorenz, 2019) or \u201calt-right\u2019s new favorite haven\u201d (Sommer, \n2018). With deplatforming recently on the rise, and extreme user accounts \nforced to move to \u201can alternative social media ecosystem\u201d (Rogers, 2020b), \nthis opens up the question of whether the characterization of Instagram as \na safe place still holds and whether the platform has succeeded in cleaning \nup divisive and polarizing content, at least in high-engagement spaces.\nInstagram is also the platform most known (and studied) for inauthentic \nbehaviors, such as purchased followers or artificially inflated like and \ncomments counts, obtained through \u201cclick farms and follower factories\u201d \n(Lindquist, 2019), or by participating in \u201ccomment pods,\u201d where users convene to like and comment each other\u2019s posts to inflate their own \nengagement metrics (Ellis, 2019). Detecting and limiting such inauthentic \nactivities is an increasing need of the marketing industry, as one can \nnote from the deluge of audit tools to \u201cexamine the health\u201d (Hypeauditor, \n2021) of one account\u2019s follower base through scrutinizing various features \nsuch as following-follower ratios or number of posts. The platform itself \nperiodically deploys new measures with the aim of \u201ckeeping Instagram \nauthentic\u201d (Systrom, 2014), deactivating \u201cspammy accounts\u201d (Systrom, \n2014), deleting those using \u201cthird-party apps to boost their popularity\u201d \n(Instagram, 2018), or, more recently, asking suspicious profiles to verify \ntheir identity (Instagram, 2020).\nIn this study, we focus on multiple topics, exploring the quality of in -\nformation and the users active in those spaces as well as the authenticity \nof their follower bases. U.S. election-related posts are studied through the prism of the presidential candidates, Trump, Biden, and Sanders. We then identified much-discussed topics in these candidates\u2019 spaces and selected \ngun control, healthcare, COVID-19 and 5G as particularly salient. Where \nsome studies choose to filter out verified Instagram accounts to capture \n\u201corganic social media conversations as opposed to media reports\u201d (Smith \net al., 2020, p.\u00a08), or look at the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d (Shane, 2020) beyond highly engaged-with posts, for this study we focus on the most engaging content \n(in terms of user interactions) regardless of the source. Therefore, we do \nnot filter out any user accounts, which allows us to include in the analysis \ncelebrities and influencers, whose role in spreading misinformation and \ndivisive content has been an object of scrutiny in multiple cases due to \n142  S abine ni ederer and ga briele co loMb o \ntheir high level of interactions and follower bases \u201cpredisposed to believe \nthem and trust their messages\u201d (Ahmadi and Chan, 2020).\nThis study considers the quality of information on Instagram about \nthe U.S. presidential candidates of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, and a \nselection of social issues (healthcare, 5G, gun control). These topics are \nexplored in the spring and fall of 2020, where the study zooms in on posts \nper period that receive the most user interactions. For the top 50 posts, the \nstudy combines content analysis with user activity analysis and includes \na follower analysis to test for artificial amplification, as discussed in the \nmethods section.\nWe developed a coding scheme for the content analysis that builds on \nBenkler et al. (2018) and distinguishes between divisive content (that might \nfuel polarization, conspiracy, or conflict) and non-divisive content. Following \nPhillips and Milner (2017), we term as ambivalent content (contrasted here \nwith earnest content) posts that are not inflammatory but may still generate \na lighter form of division by possibly excluding those who do not have the \ncultural references to decode it, laugh about it, and involuntary become \n\u201claughed at\u201d (Phillips and Millner, 2017).\nIn applying these notions to the most interacted-with content concerning \npolitical candidates and social issues in 2020, we found, counter-intuitively, \nthat most is earnest as well as non-divisive. In fact, throughout 2020, the \npolitical and issue spaces become even more earnest. There is also little to \nno misinformation encountered. In spring of 2020, influencers, including \ncelebrities, mostly share responsible posts about the pandemic, while later in \nthe year, they mainly encourage people to vote. Regarding COVID-19, there is \nan evolution from health warnings and supportive messages to posts about \nmental health during a pandemic and posts demonstrating that personal \nand professional life goes on despite COVID-19.  Overall, our study finds a \nhealthier platform than one might expect from one often associated with \nmisinformation. While misinformation might be spreading on the platform, \nit does not receive much user interaction.\nImplications\nIncreasingly, Instagram is discussed as a site for misinformation, inauthentic \nactivities, and polarization, particularly in recent studies about elections, \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines. Conspiracy and anti-vax content \neven have appeared as gradient pastel images under the guise of wellness \nand lifestyle posts. In this study, we have found a different platform. By \nThe earne S T Pl aT for M 143\nlooking at the content that receives the most interaction, we characterize \nInstagram as a site of earnest political campaigning and moral support, with \na relative absence of polarizing content and little to no misinformation.\nFirst, we analyze posts that receive the most user interactions over two \ntime periods (the spring and fall of 2020) related to three U.S. presidential \ncandidates and the issues of COVID-19, healthcare, 5G and gun control. To \ncharacterize these spaces, we adopt a two-fold coding scheme: Following \nBenkler et al. (2018), we distinguish between \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cnon-divisive\u201d \nposts, and from Phillips and Milner (2017), we identify \u201cambivalent content\u201d \n(contrasted here with \u201cearnest content\u201d). These are posts that often through \nmultiple layers of meanings and irony might subtly fuel division, excluding \nthose who do not have the cultural references to decode them.\nSecond, in the same candidate and issues spaces, we perform a user \nactivity analysis, examining the most active users and the number of \ninteractions they generate with their posts. Third, in order to assess the \nauthenticity of U.S. presidential candidates and parties\u2019 audiences, we \nanalyze their follower bases, looking at suspicious behaviors (such as dubi -\nous geographical provenance) that might signal automation or artificial \namplification practices. Fourth, we zoom in on the role of celebrities and \ninfluencers, characterizing through close reading the nature and content \nof their posts with an eye towards their role in spreading misinformation and divisive content.\nOverall, our study finds a healthier space than one might expect from \na platform often associated with polarization and misinformation. In fact, \nthroughout 2020, the political and issue spaces become even more earnest. \nWhile misinformation and polarization might be spreading on the platform, \nthey do not receive much user interaction.\nIndeed, the findings show that while posts about political candidates may \nentail fierce campaigning, the overwhelming majority of the most engaged \nwith content is earnest and non-divisive. The finding is significant given \nthat research has shown how well divisive and false news and commentary \noften spread compared to more sincere content (Vosoughi et al., 2018; Klein \nand Robison, 2019).\nFor the posts concerning the three presidential candidates under study, \neach has an equal amount of divisive content (about 15%) in the top 50 \nposts. For that content, however, it was found that over half of it was posted \nby Trump or Trump, Jr. One implication is that the Trumps are a leading \nsource of divisiveness and that they are rather alone in that role, at least in \nthe top posts under study. It should be noted that Trump is also the main target of that content type. Of the remaining divisive content, most posts \n144  S abine ni ederer and ga briele co loMb o \nare about Trump or his administration. Engagement is an impact metric \nrather than a measure of sentiment. In other words, non-divisive, earnest \nposts may trigger positive but also negative comments, as we know from \nresearch into trolling and antagonistic behavior online (Phillips, 2015). \nNegativity in the comment space still leads to a high interaction score, so \nthe findings do not imply the absence of toxicity.\nThe namespace analysis shows an uneven distribution of attention to \nthe three candidates. Trump proved to be successful in dominating his own \nnamespace, while Biden\u2019s space is occupied by a variety of users (mainly \nendorsing him). Sanders is the most successful of the three candidates in \npopulating the others\u2019 namespaces. After losing the race to the presidential \nnomination in the fall, he is left alone in his space, and his language becomes \nmore divisive.\nIn a further examination of the followers of the political candidates and \nparties, we find signs of light artificial amplification only for the accounts \nof the Republican Party and Donald Trump. The finding implies that the \nmajority of the user interaction is not achieved through the purchasing of \nfollowers or likes, as was found in previous research, suggesting an apparent \nslowing of that practice (DiResta et al., 2018; Feldman, 2017).\nLastly, it is worthwhile to zoom in on the outsized role of particular users, \napart from the Trumps and the National Rifle Association. On a platform \nknown for its influencers, we can distinguish between at least two types of \n\u201cissue celebrities\u201d here. The one assumes a more traditional role of celebrity \nfundraising and awareness-raising, which we find mainly in healthcare posts \nby those who support front-line workers and hospitals during the pandemic \n(sometimes with financial donations). For the topic of COVID-19, we also \nsee other, more commercially entangled celebrity engagement, where they \nsell their products and promise to donate a percentage of the profits to a \nCOVID-related cause.\nThe study contributes to scholarly work that examines how visual \npractices on Instagram \u201care not just social media artifacts, isolated and \nindividual, but are surrounded by debates and discussions that take on \npolitical, legal, economic, technological, and sociocultural dimensions\u201d \n(Highfield and Leaver, 2016, p.\u00a049). By selecting the political content with \nmost interactions, we approach engagement on the platform in a more \ncomprehensive way than content posted by influencers only. Indeed, the \npoints of departure are the political debates and discussions. They take \ncenter stage rather than emerge as a byproduct of celebrity and influencer \nculture. In further assessing the content of top posts as earnest or ambiva -\nlent and divisive or non-divisive (Hedrick et al., 2018), it contributes to the \nThe earne S T Pl aT for M 145\ndiscussions on online (mis)information, offering an analytical framework \nthat is sensitive to critiques of thin ontologies as true or false content (Lazer \net al., 2018; Marres, 2018). The work thereby has methodological implications \nfor those categorizing contemporary social media content.\nFindings\nFinding 1: The top posts concerning political candidates and social issues on \nInstagram contain largely earnest and non-divisive content. Social media \nplatforms such as Instagram have been described as sites of misinformation \nand divisiveness, particularly around elections. In this study, however, the \npolitical and issue coverage that has received the most user interactions \non Instagram from January to mid-April\u00a02020 and from September\u00a02020 to \nJanuary\u00a02021 is primarily earnest and non-divisive, with scant ambivalent \ncontent.\nConcerning the political candidates, in spring approximately 85% of \nthe posts are non-divisive, and the vast majority is earnest. The amount \nof divisiveness in each of the different candidate\u2019s namespaces is more or \nless the same, but nearly half of such content is posted by Donald Trump \nor Donald Trump, Jr., and most of the remaining divisive posts are about \nTrump. In the fall, despite the U.S candidates\u2019 spaces remaining generally \nearnest and non-divisive, there are variations compared to the situation \nin spring, depending on the candidate. Biden\u2019s namespace has become \nmuch less divisive; both compared to that in spring and to the others. The \nnamespaces of Trump and Sanders have instead become more divisive than \nin spring. Sanders\u2019 space is the one with more divisive posts in the top 50 \namong the three candidates. Examining the tone and wordings of his posts, \nwe observe an increasingly more divisive language, with direct attacks to \nvarious opponents, including Joe Biden (see Figure\u00a07.2), President Trump and \nWall Street (e.g., \u201cpathetic \u2026 president\u201d and \u201cWall Street crooks\u201d). Posts about \nTrump also become slightly more divisive in spring. Trump\u2019s namespace \nhas the most memes and jokes, some making fun of him and others of his \nopponents (sometimes both in one meme). Furthermore, many of the posts \nin the Trump space are labeled and fact-checked by Instagram (Figure\u00a07.3), \nwith banners, blurring covers and various notices.\nThe fact that Instagram overlays content moderation notices and disclaim -\ners\u2014not only on Trump\u2019s statements and videos but also on memes and fake \nscreenshots posted by satirical accounts\u2014generates an additional layer of \nmessiness that contributes to the ambivalence of this space.\n146  S abine ni ederer and ga briele co loMb o \nfi gure\u00a07.1 ex ample of be rnie Sanders\u2019 posts becoming more divisive in wording.

Moving from spring to fall, issue spaces remain largely earnest \nand non-divisive (except for gun control), but the content of the posts dif -\nfers over time. Contrary to reports about online misinformation on social \nmedia, we find Instagram to be an earnest space of non-divisive content \nabout the COVID-19 pandemic and healthcare, mostly posting in support \nof healthcare workers and encouraging users to stay safe. In the fall posts \nabout the pandemic and health, in general, become even more earnest and \nnon-divisive (with only one divisive post in the healthcare space), and the \ncontent of the posts changes. COVID-19 no longer dominates healthcare \nposts; instead, they address mental health and include well-wishing.\nFrom the spring to the fall the COVID-19 space moves from posts support -\ning healthcare workers and encouraging users to stay safe to posts about \nactivities that are taking place despite the pandemic.

We find one 5G \nconspiracy-related post well down in the results (#306). A post by Robert F. \nKennedy, Jr., now removed from Instagram (Jett, 2021), references \u201cdeadly \n5G radiation\u201d together with \u201cBig Pharma,\u201d \u201cBig Data,\u201d \u201cBill Gates\u201d and the \n\u201cCOVID vaccine project.\u201d Gun control is the most divisive of the issues we analyzed, and its top 50 posts are dominated by a single user, the National \nRifle Association (with 30 out of the 50 posts), becoming even more divisive \nover time.\nfi gure\u00a07.4 cl assification of the top in stagram 50 posts (receiving most interactions) in the issues \nspaces. \nda\nte ranges: January\u00a01, 2020\u2013 ap\nril\u00a020, 2020 and September\u00a022, 2020\u2013January\u00a05, 2021. \nda\nta \nsource: \ncr\nowdTangle.\nThe earne S T Pl aT for M 149\nFinding 3: Trump performs well in his own namespace in the spring, \nwhile Biden is crowded out of his. In the fall, Sanders is left alone in his own \nnamespace. For each candidate, we looked at their respective namespace, \nthat is, the body of posts that @-mention the candidate. The rationale to \ndo so is that when a presidential candidate holds control over his own \nnamespace, this space is likely to be less divisive or ambivalent than when \nothers mostly post about the candidate. For a candidate, controlling one\u2019s \nown namespace might mean being able to actively steer the discourse in \ntheir favor and reducing the level of divisiveness. In this next analytical step, \nwe assess if and how the namespace is affected\u2014in terms of its divisiveness \nand ambivalence\u2014when the candidate occupies it.\nLooking at the most active users in each candidate\u2019s namespace, Trump \nperforms well in his namespace in both time frames analyzed. Trump\u2019s own \nInstagram content, likely run by his campaign, is not as negative as the \ninsulting messages he is known for on Twitter (Quealy, 2017; Lee and Quealy, \n2019). Many of his most engaging Instagram posts in the initial period are \nabout his Super Tuesday wins in several states. However, of the earnestly \ndivisive posts across all namespaces, many are by Trump or Trump, Jr. \nCompared to the spring, Trump still dominates his own namespace in the \nfall. His top posts in total receive fewer interactions than before, however, \nand there is a broader variety of users receiving interaction, including Snoop \nDogg (with memes) as well as Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, and Hillary \nClinton (with critical posts).\nIn the spring Biden\u2019s account does not have a strong presence in the top \nposts about him. His namespace shows the most user diversity. Popular \ncontent posted about him by others varies from endorsements, the most \npopular of which was that by Barack Obama, to criticism and campaigning, \nfor instance by Sanders in 1/5 of the top posts. Donald Trump, Jr. is also active \nin Biden\u2019s namespace, calling him out for his son\u2019s business in China and \nhis views on gun control. In the next period, Biden\u2019s namespace remains \ncrowded with diverse users, many of whom are non-political celebrities \nencouraging users to vote for him or congratulating him.\nIn the spring, Sanders is the most successful of the three candidates \nin populating the others\u2019 namespaces, posting much-interacted-with, \ncampaign-style content about Trump and Biden.

It is also worthwhile to zoom in \non the role of celebrities and influencers on a platform known for their \nsignificance in influencing public opinion. Generally speaking, their posts \nfall into the category of earnest and non-divisive. They raise awareness, \ndonate to causes, show support for a candidate, serve as role models, \nand debunk conspiracy theories. Indeed, some contributions fit into a \nlongstanding tradition of \u201cissue celebrity\u201d fundraising and awareness-\nraising, particularly concerning healthcare, with posts by celebrities who \nsupport (sometimes with financial donations) healthcare workers and \nhospitals during the pandemic in spring. In the posts concerning COVID-19, \nwe also witness celebrities promoting their products and promising to \ndonate a percentage of the profits to COVID-19 related funds, as Kim \nKardashian does in her four posts that make it into the top 50 on that issue. \nOn healthcare, on top is Tom Hanks\u2019 message from Australia, reporting \nthat he and his wife were infected and in self-isolation in Australia. In \nthe 5G space, it is a repost of hip-hop artist 55Bagz making fun of the \ncoronavirus-5G conspiracy that receives the most user interactions. On \nthe issue of gun control, however, rapper Kevin Gates\u2019s post of his daughter \nposing with a gun receives a great deal of attention in a space otherwise \ndominated by the National Rifle Association (with 30 posts in the top \n50). Concerning posts about political candidates, we see how candidate \nsupport messages by model and actress Emily Ratajkowski attract high \namounts of user interactions.\nIn the fall we still observe the prominent role of celebrities both in the \nissue and candidate spaces, although the pool of most active ones in the \ntop 50 posts changes slightly: new celebrities appear (such as athletes \nCristiano Ronaldo and Virat Kohli), while others who reached the top \nin spring have disappeared (e.g., Tom Hanks). Kim Kardashian (present \nin the top 50 with multiple posts in Spring) remains at the top. For some \nissues, the tone and the content celebrities discuss change considerably \ncompared to the previous period. Concerning COVID-19, messages of \nsupport and advice about the pandemic are replaced by posts that show \nhow life goes on despite the pandemic (at least for celebrities who can afford \nit): film sets are moved to comply with travel restrictions, or \u201cCOVID-free\u201d \nbirthday parties are held on private islands. In the health space, support \nfor healthcare workers is partly replaced with messages of awareness \n154  S abine ni ederer and ga briele co loMb o \nabout mental health issues, specifically around World Mental Health Day \non October\u00a010th.\nIn the political spaces, more celebrities are active, calling on users to \ngo and vote, both in dedicated posts (e.g., Jennifer Aniston) or by adding \n#voteforBiden to otherwise non-political posts. Indeed, among the candi-\ndates, Biden is the one receiving the most celebrity support. Together with \ncelebrities, some famous politicians (e.g., Barack Obama) voice support \nfor Biden, while others express criticism for Trump (e.g., Kamala Harris, \nMichelle Obama, and Hillary Clinton). In the Trump space, Snoop Dogg \nreceives quite a lot of attention by posting memes about the president.\nfi gure\u00a07.8 ex amples of celebrities\u2019 posts in fall: ce lebrities urging to vote in dedicated posts \n(Jennifer \nan\niston), or by inviting to vote (for \nbi\nden) in the caption of otherwise non-political posts \n(ar\niana \ngr\nande); \nce\nlebrity personal life (Kim Kardashian) and professional life (The \nro\nck) going on \ndespite \ncoVi\nd-\n19.

To create our dataset, we first compiled a list of keywords \nfor each candidate, including candidate names, campaign slogans, and \nmost-used hashtags. Then, we selected four of the most-mentioned topics \nin the candidate spaces: healthcare, COVID-19, 5G and gun control. For \neach of these topics, we compiled a list of relevant keywords intending \nto include official terms, vernacular words, and, if applicable, pro- and \ncounter-terminology, e.g., including in the query both \u201cgun control\u201d and \u201cgun \nownership.\u201d (See Appendix for the full list of queries.) We used each query \nto collect Instagram posts shared in two timeframes: between January\u00a01 and \nApril\u00a020, 2020 (we refer to this period as spring throughout this chapter) \nand between September\u00a022, 2020, and January\u00a05, 2021 (which we refer to as \nfall). For each query and each period, we selected the top 50 posts based on \nthe total sum of interactions, which is the number of likes and comments \nby Instagram users that a post has received.\nIn this study, we focus on most engaged with posts, as well as most active \nusers in high-engagement spaces, asking specifically whether the posts from \nhighly visible accounts receiving the most user interactions are earnest or \nambivalent and whether they are divisive or not. After having manually \nremoved unrelated posts from the dataset, we conduct a close reading of the \ntop 50 posts per space, taking into consideration both the visual elements \n(image or video) and the post captions, applying a four-category analytical \nscheme (see Figure\u00a07.10).\nWe flag as divisive content posts that fuel conflict, polarization, or even \nradicalization (following Benkler et al., 2018), in contrast to more positive messages (e.g., supporting a candidate or sharing quarantine tips), which we label as non-divisive. We make a distinction between earnest content \nthat is posted with clear intent and may be understood by many users and \ncontent that often through humor or (sub)cultural references lends itself \nto different interpretations, depending on those who receive it and what \nthey read into it. Here, we keep in mind the possibility of encountering \nconvincing yet \u201cmaliciously \u2018fake\u2019 content\u201d (Highfield and Leaver, 2016, \np.\u00a052).\nIn opposition to \u201cearnest and non-divisive\u201d content, we categorized \nas \u201cearnest and divisive\u201d inflammatory posts that might fuel polariza -\ntion, conspiracy, or conflict. We used \u201cambivalent and non-divisive\u201d to \ncategorize content that is not inflammatory but may still generate a \nlighter form of division by possibly excluding those who do not have the cultural references to decode it, laugh about it, and involuntary become \n\u201claughed at\u201d as Phillips and Millner put it (2018). We subsequently tagged \nas \u201cambivalent and divisive\u201d content that, while ambivalent (as above), \nThe earne S T Pl aT for M 157\nfi gure\u00a07.10 an alytical scheme. ex amples of coded posts in earnest non-divisive, ambivalent \nnon-divisive, earnest divisive, and ambivalent divisive.

Here, we only coded such content as divisive \nwhen it was explicitly dismissive of a political opponent or another person \nor accusatory in incendiary terms. Not all critical posts were labeled as \ndivisive, just as not all jokes were coded as ambivalent.\nUser activity analysis of candidates and issues spacesFor each of the presidential candidates and issue spaces, we analyzed the \nmost active users. Here, we count how many times a user has posted and \ncalculate the total number of interactions (likes and comments) received \nby each user for the total of his or her posts. User activity analysis tells us \nwhether one or more very active users dominate a political or issue space \nand whether those who are the most vocal are also the most interacted with \nby other users. Concerning the political candidates, we also ask whether \none candidate succeeds in \u201cinvading\u201d another candidate\u2019s namespace. As \none candidate mentions (often attacking or criticizing) another candidate, \ns/he may receive a high number of user interactions, therefore appearing \nin the top 50 posts of one of the opponents.\nArtificial amplification and follower analysis\nTo assess the authenticity of candidates\u2019 and parties\u2019 audiences and \ndetect signs of artificial amplification, we use the digital marketing tool, \nHypeAuditor. The tool provides a set of metrics for one Instagram ac -\ncount, which it compiles into an \u201caudience report.\u201d For each candidate and \nparty (Biden, Sanders, and Trump as well as the political party names), \nwe collect the Instagram usernames and then use HypeAuditor to obtain \nan audience report. The report provides an audience type breakdown, \ndividing followers into four categories: real people, influencers (> 5,000 \nfollowers), mass followers (>1,500 followers), and suspicious followers, \ndefined as \u201cInstagram bots and people who use specific services for likes, \ncomments and followers purchase\u201d (Komok, 2020). From the Hypeauditor \nreport, we also consider the followers\u2019 country analysis for each account, \nwhich breaks down followers by location and could also point to possible \nanomalies in the follower base.\nThe earne S T Pl aT for M 159\nCelebrities on Instagram\nIn the last part of the study, we zoom into the role of celebrities in the \nvarious political and issue spaces. In characterizing online celebrities, \nscholars have made the distinction between \u201csocial media natives,\u201d \nsometimes referred to as micro-celebrities to indicate the niche of their \nfame, whose \u201cactivities have been associated with social media from the \nbeginning\u201d (Giles, 2017), and established celebrities who become active \non social media and employ the techniques of micro-celebrities to engage \nwith their audience (Marwick and boyd, 2010). In our user activity analysis, \nrather than tracing where their fame originated from, we consider as \ncelebrities all public figures whose user accounts are labeled as \u201cverified\u201d \nby the platform.\nTo obtain a verified account on Instagram, reviewers assess whether an \naccount is \u201cin the public interest\u201d and (in addition to following the platform\u2019s \nterms of service) is \u201cauthentic, unique, complete and notable\u201d (Instagram, \nn.d.). Verified accounts must also be famous outside of Instagram, as the \nplatform \u201creview(s) accounts that are featured in multiple news sources\u201d \n(Instagram, n.d.) and assigns a verified badge only to those associated with \na \u201cwell-known, highly searched for person, brand or entity\u201d (Instagram, \nn.d.). Social media influencers who have not built up a public presence \noutside of the platform are not marked as verified. Once the badge of a \nverified account is earned, it is hardly revoked, and \u201cthere appear to be no \nconsequences when authentic, verified accounts share lies and half-truths\u201d \n(Ahmadi and Chan, 2020).\nAppendix\nOverview of queries used in CrowdTangle\nCovid-19 [corona, covid_19, covid, coronaviruspandemic, coronavirus]\n5G [5g]\nHealthcare [healthinsurance, medicareforall, medicare, medicareforallnow, \nhealth, healthcare, lowerdrugcosts, protectourcare, obamacare, Abortion, Medicare]Gun control [gun control, firearms regulation, gun restrictions, anti-gun, \ncarry permit, 2nd amendment, second amendment, right to keep and bear \narms, gun ownership]\n160  S abine ni ederer and ga briele co loMb o \nBiden [biden, joebiden, biden2020]\nSanders [berniesanders, sanders, feelthebern, bernie2020, votebernie]\nTrump [donaldtrump, trump, KAG2020, Trump2020, makeamericagreata -\ngain, maga]\nInstagram accounts that were part of the follower analysis with \nHypeAuditor\nPolitical candidate accounts: @berniesanders, @joebiden, @realdonaldtrump\nPolitical party accounts: @thedemocrats, @gop\nReferences\nAhmadi, A.A., and Chan, E.

It has raised concerns that parts of this sphere \nmay function as incubators for radicalization. In particular, the 2016 \npresidential elections in the United States were marked by the coarsening \nof the tone of political discourse, with candidate and eventual winner \nDonald Trump slandering his opponents, spreading conspiracy theories \nand provoking xenophobia. Alongside Trump\u2019s insurgent takeover of the \nRepublican party, his election campaign during 2015 and 2016 marked the \nemergence of the \u201calt-right\u201d political movement, which perceived Trump \nas an alternative to establishment conservatism.\nAs a libertarian movement with a strongly xenophobic, often racist stance \ntowards immigration, the alt-right was also characterized by its use of \nantagonistic vernacular. We can think of this antagonistic slang as \u201cmemes,\u201d \na concept typically used to refer to user-generated shared images that seem \nto spread across platforms and between communities, but which can also be \nused to refer to any \u201cbuilding blocks of complex cultures\u201d online, including \nwords and phrases (Shifman, 2011, p189). Indeed, in the analysis on offer \nhere, we view specific phrases and tokens as such memetic building blocks \nthat seem to propagate within and between distinct environments online. \nA platform of interest in this context is the far-right image board 4chan, \nwhich has been positioned as a \u201cbirthplace of memes\u201d (Ludemann, 2018), \nan incubator of conspiracy theories like QAnon (De Zeeuw et al., 2020), and \na place of rapid innovation of oftentimes antagonistic language (Peeters et \nal., 2021). It might therefore be expected that antagonistic alt-right slang \nincubated on the platform has the potential to spread to a wider audience, \nwith 4chan acting as a breeding ground. To study this hypothesis, we look at 4chan as well as a more mainstream platform that has been associated with the alt-right, Breitbart News.\nThe questions are particularly relevant as the alt-right is a relatively \nunique, insurgent far-right political movement that rose to international \nattention in 2015 with remarkably little in the way of a centralized organi -\nzational structure, and for whom the circulation of memes and internet \njargon was fundamental to its success (Hawley, 2017). Most emblematically, \nthe memetic subcultural icon of \u201cPepe the Frog\u201d became notoriously as -\nsociated with this school of thought during the first half of the 2010s and \nachieved widespread attention (Lobinger et al., 2020). Arguably, however, \namong the alt-right\u2019s most significant accomplishments was the extent to \nwhich their antagonistic slang succeeded in framing political discussion. \na f ringe Ma inS Tr eaMe d, or Tr acing an Ta goni S Ti c Sl ang  167\nIllustrative of this pattern was for example the expression \u201ccuckservative\u201d \nwhich emerged in early 2015 on (now deplatformed) alt-right websites such \nas My Posting Career, The Right Stuff as well as on 4chan\u2019s notorious /pol/ \nforum (Bernstein, 2015). In its original far-right subcultural usage the term \nreferred to a genre of often racialized pornography thereby connecting a \ncritique of establishment republicanism with the far-right\u2019s longstanding \npreoccupation with masculinity and miscegenation. By the end of the year, \nthe prolific alt-right author Vox Day had self-published a track with the \ntitle Cuckservative: How \u201cconservatives\u201d betrayed America , and this alt-right \nmeme had effectively worked its way into political discussion amongst \nmainstream Trump voters. It is this type of \u201cpropagation\u201d of politically \nextreme vocabulary that is under study in this chapter.\nConsidering these recent events, there is a legitimate concern that \nthe subculture associated with sites at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the internet could \ninsinuate itself (or has already done so) with an extreme and conspiratorial \ndiscourse into the American political debate across a continually evolving \nrange of platforms. There are indications that it has already transpired in the \nmore recent 2020 U.S. election campaign. The QAnon persona, central to a \nright-wing conspiracy theory positing, among other things, that prominent \nmembers of the Democratic Party are part of a Satan-worshipping can -\nnibalistic cult, started on 4chan but has since become a major factor in \nmainstream U.S. politics and as such is now discussed on a wide variety \nof platforms (De Zeeuw et al., 2020; Stanley-Becker, 2020). The polarized \nlanguage we study reflects this rift in recent American political discourse.\nAn understanding of the internet as having a \u201cbottom\u201d implies the exist -\nence of further \u201clayers.\u201d Along these lines, at the top we would find big media \nconglomerates, often rooted in \u201clegacy media\u201d such as major newspapers \nas the New York Times, cable broadcasters as CNN, and newer online-first \noutlets like Vox. As one moves \u201cdown,\u201d platforms grow more obscure, with a smaller reach and less clear editorial or content policies. At the bottom, \none finds \u201cfringe\u201d sites, with obscure subcultures; this \u201cdeep vernacular \nweb\u201d (De Zeeuw and Tuters, 2020) can appear culturally baffling as well as \noffensive to the uninitiated. Sites in this stratum usually have a relatively \nsmall number of visitors, compared to mainstream sites. 4chan is particularly \nrelevant here, as a fringe platform that has nevertheless been scrutinized for \nits production of internet memes (Bernstein et al., 2011), peculiar subcultural \npractices (Nissenbaum and Shifman, 2017) as well as language innovation (Tuters and Hagen, 2020; Peeters et al., 2021).\nOur findings are based on datasets centered on the 2016 and 2020 U.S. \nelections, collected from 4chan/pol/ and from the comment section of \n168  PeeTerS , Wi llaer T , TuTerS , beul S , Va n eec Ke and  Va n So eS T \nBreitbart News, a conservative, right-wing American news website especially \npopular during the first period as a staunch supporter of eventual winner \nDonald Trump. Although it has been described as \u201cfactually dubious\u201d (Guess \net al., 2018), Breitbart News occupied a crucial place in the political media \necosystem at the time. Benkler et al. (2018) offered an in-depth study of \nBreitbart\u2019s \u201cagenda-setting\u201d role in that election. Their analysis shows how \nBreitbart \u201canchored\u201d a network of other similarly dubious right-wing news \nsites such as Daily Caller, Gateway Pundit and Infowars. Though no formal or \neditorial association between these sites exists, they provide a similar brand \nof content characterized as a mix of \u201cparanoid conspiracy interpretations \naround a core of true facts\u201d (Benkler, 2018, p.\u00a034). Together they occupied a crucial position in the media ecology around the 2016 elections.\nIn this ecology Breitbart is a particularly interesting site for several \nreasons. One is that, at the time, Breitbart was the largest of these sites \nwith approximately 10% of the entire general news audience according to one estimate (Malone, 2016). Founded by the deceased Andrew Breitbart, \nformerly a reporter for the Huffington Post, under the more recent editorship \nof Steve Bannon the site championed the right-wing libertarian Tea Party \nand a strongly American populist, civic nationalist agenda (cf. Burley, 2017). \nReceiving substantial financial support from the billionaire Mercer family, \nwho initially backed Ted Cruz in the 2015 U.S. election campaigning, Breit -\nbart would develop into a nakedly partisan branch of the Trump campaign \nwhile at the same time Bannon famously claimed that he considered the \nsite to be a \u201cplatform for the alt-right\u201d (Posner, 2016). With a background in \nboth high finance and documentary filmmaking, Bannon is a self-styled \npublic intellectual noted for his interest in an obscure branch of far-right \npolitical philosophy known as Traditionalism, which also had a readership \non 4chan/pol/ (Teitelbaum, 2020; Tuters and OILab, 2020). Bannon would \nlater join the Trump campaign as its chief strategist (Green, 2017). In 2016, \nBreitbart published an article entitled An establishment conservative\u2019s guide \nto the alt-right , co-authored by the notorious alt-right provocateur Milo \nYiannopoulos. An investigative report later revealed it to have been written \nwith the participation of known alt-right ideologues (Bernstein, 2017). As \nsuch, the site combines a clear, alt-right editorial position and explicit ties to the Trump campaign with a relatively wide reach.\nEarlier analyses of Breitbart, including Benkler et al.\u2019s, were limited to \nthe editorial content of the site. We instead study the comment sections of \nBreitbart\u2019s articles that routinely receive thousands of comments, many only \ntangentially related to the article\u2019s subject. These appear to be moderated \nloosely, if at all. A 2017 report cites Disqus, which provides the technology on \na f ringe Ma inS Tr eaMe d, or Tr acing an Ta goni S Ti c Sl ang  169\nwhich Breitbart\u2019s comment section runs, promising that Breitbart \u201c[wants] to \nwork with us to figure out ways to minimize [hate speech]\u201d (Captain, 2017). \nIn this permissive setting, the comment section of Breitbart\u2019s London section \nwas characterized as \u201ca malignant swamp of race-baiting, nativism and \nantisemitic conspiracy,\u201d even accused of providing a platform for notorious \nalt-right celebrities (Mulhall et al., 2017). Appearing to function like a largely \nunmoderated discussion forum, the comment threads can thus serve to \nstudy the political views and discourse of the readership of a highly active \nelement of far-right politics that moved increasingly to the center of the \nAmerican Republican party around the 2016 elections.\nIn this same period /pol/, the self-described \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d \ndiscussion board of anonymous imageboard 4chan, overtook /b/ (the \n\u201crandom\u201d board) as the site\u2019s most active discussion forum. Previous \nquantitative research on /b/ has noted how the site was an \u201cexcellent \nvenue for studying innovation diffusion,\u201d due in part to the fact that it was \ngenerally considered as \u201cthe source of many online memes\u201d (Bernstein, \n2011, p.\u00a056). While in the earlier period in which /b/ had been more popular \n4chan was the source of innocuous memes such as LOLcats, /pol/ memes \nwere far more toxic, including offensive depictions of Pepe the Frog as well \nas the antisemitic triple parentheses phrasal meme (Tuters and Hagen, \n2020). While there has been some quantitative research into the diffusion \nof toxic /pol/ memes to other web communities (Zannettou et al., 2018), to \nour knowledge there is no previous empirical work focused specifically on \nthe crossover of vernacular language from /pol/ to another such threaded \ndiscussion forum.\nThis chapter, then, adds to a growing body of work focused on the \u201cmain -\nstreaming\u201d of previously \u201cfringe\u201d web spaces like 4chan as the source of a \n\u201cneoreactionary\u201d style of political discourse (Nagle, 2017; Wendling, 2018; \nBeran, 2019; Woods, 2019). 4chan and Breitbart represent two parts of the \nmedia ecosystem that are particularly interesting to study in the context \nof the polarized and increasingly extreme U.S. political landscape. As such, \nwe investigate whether 4chan\u2019s discourse resonates beyond its own borders \naround the time of the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections. Since so \nmuch of the discourse on 4chan\u2019s political discussion board, /pol/, can be \ncharacterized as conspiratorial, racist or otherwise extreme (cf. Tuters and \nHagen, 2020), its later occurrence on other platforms is of great interest to \nthose studying the mainstreaming of extremism and misinformation. While \nour analysis is primarily focused on the 2016 election campaign in which \nthe alt-right movement first gained prominence, we also provide an initial \nanalysis of the 2020 campaign for comparison.\n170  PeeTerS , Wi llaer T , TuTerS , beul S , Va n eec Ke and  Va n So eS T \nWe found that there are far more terms that appear only in the language \nof 4chan/pol/ than in the language of Breitbart comments. Additionally, of \nthe terms that over time are prominent first in one dataset and later in both, \nthose that first appear on 4chan are often highly political and furthermore \ncan be characterized as anti-Muslim and xenophobic (e.g., \u201cgermanistan\u201d), \nhomophobic or transphobic (e.g., \u201cxhe\u201d) or otherwise extreme (e.g., \u201cshitlibs\u201d). \nThese extreme terms are then later observed on Breitbart. Though a direct \nrelationship is difficult to ascertain, our initial findings suggested that \n4chan, an active but non-mainstream niche site, had an outsized impact \nthat reaches beyond its own confines.\nWe reflect on these findings, concluding that for the period 2015\u20132017 \n4chan/pol can be considered an originator or incubator of extreme discourse, \nwhere extreme idioms appear before propagating to the more mainstream \ndiscussion space of Breitbart News. Additionally, our observations indicate \nthat this propagation of idioms between 4chan and Breitbart News seem to \nbe less intense around the time of the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, and \nthat consequently, studies of extreme discourse and misinformation should \nconsider and monitor other platforms as the main sites of the mainstream -\ning of such terms. We end with a brief section on our data collection and \nanalytical methods.\nImplications\nOur findings indicate that around the time of the 2016 U.S. elections antago -\nnistic, highly political and problematic words that also can be characterized \nas xenophobic (e.g., \u201cgermanistan\u201d); transphobic (e.g., \u201cxhe\u201d) or otherwise \nextreme (e.g., \u201cshitlibs\u201d) first observed on 4chan later entered the discourse \nin the comment section of Breitbart News, a more mainstream platform with \nimportant connections to the Trump presidential administration. While \nearlier research has investigated the crossing over of particular ideas (e.g., \nconspiracy theories), our study provides empirical data that suggests that \nthis crossing-over also occurs on the level of language and is not bound \nonly to specific theories or ideas. The findings further support previous \nobservations about the sustained connection between 4chan/pol/ and \nBreitbart\u2019s comment section during this period.\nOne possible explanation for the propagation of extreme \u201cchan\u201d vernacular \ntowards Breitbart around the 2016 elections is that some 4chan posters \nalso frequent Breitbart\u2019s comment section. It would not be surprising if \nthey used the language they were familiar with, which could explain their \na f ringe Ma inS Tr eaMe d, or Tr acing an Ta goni S Ti c Sl ang  171\noccurrence in both spaces. Tracing whether actors move between these \nplatforms is difficult because 4chan is designed as an anonymous platform \n(Knuttila, 2011). 4chan posters are notoriously derisive of \u201cmainstream \nmedia\u201d and typically dismiss Breitbart as inadequately extreme. Although \nBreitbart has been described as having an \u201cextreme right-wing bias\u201d (Media \nBias/Fact Check, 2021), it is seen as a place for \u201cnormies.\u201d In the vernacular, \n\u201cnormies\u201d are those who follow mainstream media and otherwise adhere \nto common social norms (De Zeeuw et al., 2020). Nevertheless, it is possible \nthat some 4chan posters may also frequent Breitbart News, which would \nbe one explanation for the appearance of 4chan-like vernacular there. \nIt would be the manner for both this vernacular as well as the extreme \npolitical positions to which it implicitly and explicitly refers to spread to a new \u201cnormie\u201d audience.\nThough a direct relationship between both platforms remains difficult \nto ascertain, our initial findings suggest that 4chan, the active but non-\nmainstream niche site, had an outsized impact that reaches beyond its \nown confines. As such, we conclude that for the period 2015\u20132017 4chan/pol \ncan be considered an originator or incubator of extreme discourse, where \nextreme idioms appeared before they propagated to the more mainstream \ndiscussion space of Breitbart News. Additionally, our observations indicate \nthat this propagation of idioms between 4chan and Breitbart News seems to \nbe less intense around the time of the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, and \nthat consequently studies of extreme discourse and misinformation should \nconsider and monitor other platforms as the main sites of the mainstreaming \nof such terms.\nA key implication of our work, then, is that 4chan /pol/ might give an \nearly impression of problematic discourse that may become used by a wider \naudience at a later stage. As such, continued observation of the language \ndisseminated through these fringe platforms\u2014for which we offer one \nmethodological blueprint by addressing its propagation towards Breitbart \nNews\u2014might benefit journalists, researchers and policy makers seeking \nto signal the emergence of new extreme discourses on emerging platforms \nsuch as Parler (cf. Floridi, 2021) and others that have more recently gained prominence in the 2020 U.S. election campaign.\nMore fundamentally, our findings speak to the much-debated relationship \nbetween the \u201cbottom\u201d of the internet\u2014consisting of niche, often politically \nextreme sites\u2014and more mainstream sites. The observation and study of this \u201cbottom\u201d has acquired urgency as ideas and vernacular that originate \nin these parts have been implicated in several far-right terrorist attacks \nin the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Furthermore, sites like \n172  PeeTerS , Wi llaer T , TuTerS , beul S , Va n eec Ke and  Va n So eS T \n4chan serve as incubators for various impactful conspiracy theories, e.g., \n\u201cPizzagate\u201d (Tuters et al., 2018) and the figure of QAnon (De Zeeuw et al., \n2020). Indeed, while for many years the effects of the web were framed in \nterms of the democratic promise of participatory media (Jenkins, 2006; \nBenkler, 2006), the last half decade has shaken that narrative to its core \nwith the emergence of \u201cdark participation\u201d in the context of online political \ndiscussion (Quandt, 2018). The role of the upstart Breitbart in anchoring a \nright-wing news ecosystem that set the agenda for the 2016 U.S. election \nmay be seen as the fruition of earlier concerns over the fragmentation of the \nweb into personalized spheres (Pariser, 2011), which continue apace with the \nemergence of the alt-tech ecosystem that has benefited from social media \nplatforms\u2019 \u201cdeplatforming\u201d of the Trump movement (Rogers, 2020b). Given \nthe \u201cfringe\u201d quality of some of these sites we have good reason to believe \nthat their vernacular subculture will overlap with that of 4chan, as this \nstudy showed for the \u201cnormie\u201d website, Breitbart News, in the midst of the \n2016 U.S. election.\nFindings\nFor both the 2015\u20132017 and 2020\u20132021 periods, we split up the 4chan and \nBreitbart posts and comments in terms; each word, after filtering out \nhyperlinks and punctuation, is a term. For each term we can then classify \non which of the platforms it occurs on a per-month basis, resulting in a \npropagation pattern for each term (see Figure\u00a08.1).\nOur findings suggest that around the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, the \npolitical vocabulary associated with extreme right-wing politics consistently \nappears on 4chan first, and then on the more mainstream Breitbart News \nlater, potentially representing one strand of this propagation dynamic. We \nalso observed that this dynamic becomes less prominent around the 2020 \nelections, suggesting that the locus for this extreme idiom\u2019s propagation from \nthe \u201cbottom\u201d of the internet has again shifted. In particular, the analysis of \nthese propagation patterns allows for the following observations:\nFinding 1: Around the time of the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, the lan -\nguage of 4chan/pol/ contains more unique terms than that in the Breitbart \ncomment sections. Our analysis shows that there are more terms unique to \nthe /pol/ dataset than there are terms unique to the Breitbart dataset. Of \nthe 67,605 terms, 19,346 (28.6%) were classified as occurring in the 4chan/\npol/ dataset only, while 2,857 (4.2%) were classified as occurring only in the \nBreitbart dataset (see Figure\u00a08.2). 4chan has previously been described as a \na f ringe Ma inS Tr eaMe d, or Tr acing an Ta goni S Ti c Sl ang  173\nsource of subcultural and linguistic innovation (Nissenbaum and Shifman, \n2017). This finding empirically confirms the observation, at least concerning \nthe unique use of language on the forum. As English-language datasets, \nboth are concerned with informal political discussion focused primarily on \nthe United States context. Thus, while some variation may be expected; in \nprinciple, one might expect the language used to be similar between both, \nbut this is only partially the case.\n4chan\u2019s vernacular has been referred to as \u201cchanspeak\u201d: \u201cpeculiar in-\ngroup misspellings\u201d characterized by \u201cshortening, simplifying and cutting \ndown words\u201d (Fiorentini, 2013; Herring, 2012). While this is perhaps true for \nthe broader 4chan vernacular, the /pol/ slang we found is not adequately \ncaptured by this description. This can be attributed to the rapid linguistic \ninnovation on this forum (Peeters et al., 2020). The terms we find are more \nadequately described as \u201cphrasal memes,\u201d highly self-referential \u201cremixes\u201d \nof words, e.g., \u201ccuckerberg\u201d (a combination of \u201ccuck\u201d and \u201cZuckerberg\u201d). \nWhile a proper linguistic analysis of this vernacular is outside the scope \nof this article, the dataset on offer here could in the case of /pol/ serve as a \nstarting point for such a study.\nFinding 2: During the same period, a substantial number of terms are \nfirst only observed in the language on 4chan, the fringe platform, but later \nalso on Breitbart, the more mainstream platform, suggesting propagation \nof this vocabulary. Terms that occur on one platform first and later on \nanother platform or both platforms can be observed in both \u201cdirections\u201d; \nsome occur first on Breitbart while others occur first on 4chan/pol/. In total, \n2,043 terms (3%) follow such a pattern. Of these, 932 (45.6%) occur on 4chan \nfirst, while 1,111 (54.4%) occur on Breitbart first. This seems counterintuitive; \nit would imply that terms are first anchored in the language of Breitbart \nand only later in that of 4chan, which is difficult to reconcile with 4chan\u2019s reputation as a more innovative linguistic space as established in Finding \nfi gure\u00a08.1 Visualization of the monthly occurrence of the terms \u201ccuckerberg,\u201d \u201cgermanistan,\u201d \n\u201cxhe,\u201d and \u201cshitlibs\u201d around the time of the 2016 \nu.\nS. presidential elections, between June\u00a02015 \nand March\u00a02017. \nfo\nr each month, terms are classified (color-coded) based on a comparison of their \nrelative frequencies in 4chan/pol posts and in the comments on \nbr\neitbart \nne\nws. These words \nrepresent the political vernacular found within the 4chan dataset.\n174  PeeTerS , Wi llaer T , TuTerS , beul S , Va n eec Ke and  Va n So eS T \n1. On the other hand, Breitbart is a far larger and arguably more influential \nplatform, and agenda-setting power may be attributed to it in that capacity. \nFrom this perspective, the fact that a substantial number of terms occur on \n4chan first at all is significant and suggests that the terms might indeed \n\u201cpropagate,\u201d with language spreading\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014from 4chan \neventually to Breitbart.\nA closer look at these terms reveals that they can be divided into two \nbroad categories\u2014\u201cnamed entities\u201d and \u201cneologisms.\u201d Linguistically, named \nfi gure\u00a08.2 cl assifications of all words in the 2015\u20132017 data ( n  = 67,605) over time. The consecutive \noccurrences of each word are represented as a single row of per-month squares that are color-\ncoded for the occurrence of the word in 4chan/pol/ posts and \nbr\neitbart comments respectively.\na f ringe Ma inS Tr eaMe d, or Tr acing an Ta goni S Ti c Sl ang  175\nentities refer to all terms that are proper names, for example, countries \nand people. The other category, \u201cneologisms,\u201d are words that are neither \ncommon English nor otherwise used in \u201cnormal\u201d discourse. In practice, \nthese terms are mostly various slurs and part of a memetic vocabulary that \nis associated with 4chan discourse.\nThe named entities cannot reasonably be assumed to originate on either \nplatform. Instead, the likely explanation for the occurrence of these terms \nis that they refer to people, places or organizations that were discussed \nbecause they were relevant to a current event or news item. This indicates \nthat Breitbart users discussed these topics before 4chan, which is interesting \ninsofar as it provides insight into the type of topics discussed by both forums \nand how rapidly they enter the discourse. The \u201cneologisms\u201d (including the \nexamples in Figure\u00a08.1) on the other hand are likely to originate in the \nvernacular of online platforms (Peeters et al., 2021). As such, the fact that they \nappear on 4chan and later on Breitbart suggests that they do propagate from \nthe one to the other, either directly or via another intermediary platform.\nFinding 3: Around the time of the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, many \nterms that seem to propagate from 4chan/pol/ to Breitbart reflect an extreme \nfar-right politics. Of these terms that can be assumed to originate on 4chan/\npol/, most are implicitly or explicitly related to far-right and conspiratorial \ntheories or ideas. This is not surprising, since 4chan/pol/ itself has been \nassociated with the \u201cPizzagate\u201d political conspiracy (Tuters et al., 2018) \nand has been described as a \u201ckind of petri dish for concocting extreme \nand extremely virulent forms of right-wing populist antagonism\u201d (Tuters \nand Hagen, 2020, p.\u00a02223). Of the words that appear first on 4chan (see also \nFigure\u00a08.1) several are emblematic of an extreme political discourse, such as \n\u201ccuckerberg\u201d (a jab at Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg combined with the \nslur \u201ccuckold\u201d; other variations found were \u201ccuckservative(s),\u201d \u201ccucktard,\u201d \n\u201ccucky,\u201d and \u201ccuckery\u201d), anti-Muslim terms such as \u201cgermanistan\u201d and \n\u201cbritainistan,\u201d words like \u201cxhe\u201d (used mockingly to insult transgender people), \nand various slurs aimed at liberal U.S. voters like \u201cshitlibs\u201d and \u201cberniebots.\u201d1\nWhile 4chan/pol/ is well-known as a far-right discussion space (Hine et \nal., 2017; Ludemann, 2018), our data and analyses show that the vocabulary \nassociated with this discourse is not contained to this \u201cfringe\u201d platform but \nafter initial usage it also appears on more mainstream platforms. More \nspecifically, the various xenophobic or otherwise extreme slurs and phrasal \nmemes that are developed and incubated on 4chan/pol/ in some cases see \n1 T he full list of terms that propagate may be found in the dataset available from Zenodo at \nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5535341.\n176  PeeTerS , Wi llaer T , TuTerS , beul S , Va n eec Ke and  Va n So eS T \nuptake in the comments on Breitbart News. As most of this language is \nunambiguous, and hard to mistake for anything else than derogatory, it \nraises concerns that not only the language but also the extreme political \ndiscourse associated with it is shared across sites.\nFinding 4: Around the time of the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, the \naforementioned mainstreaming of extreme chan vernacular seems to be less \noutspoken. Around the time of the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, some of \nthe vernacular that propagated in 2015\u20132017 remains shared between 4chan \nand Breitbart, with notable examples including \u201ccuck\u201d and its derivatives, \nsuch as \u201ccucked.\u201d Further analysis shows, however, that comparatively fewer \nnew terms propagate from 4chan to Breitbart News around this time. As \nobserved in our 2020\u20132021 dataset, only 347 terms out of 57,602 (or 0.6% \ncompared to 3% for the 2015\u20132017 dataset) actually move from one platform \nto the other, and of those, only 124 were classified as moving from 4chan/\npol to Breitbart (see Figure\u00a08.3). Closer inspection of these moving terms \nreveals few original vernacular terms, even though the data suggest that \nduring this period, 4chan in and of itself remains an incubator for extreme \nvernacular. Examples that do point towards a continued mainstreaming of \n4chan terminology and memes concern the terms \u201ccoomer\u201d (which refers \nto the 4chan meme of the \u201c20-year-old coomer\u201d), and \u201clibshits\u201d (an inver -\nsion of the previously discussed term \u201cshitlibs\u201d), but in comparison with \nthe 2015\u20132017 period, the language propagation dynamics between both \nplatforms seems much less outspoken.\nAny comparison between the two datasets is necessarily tentative as we \nare yet to capture as much of the post-election period as we did for the 2016 \nelections. As such there remains a possibility that the propagation dynamic \nlags in this case, or that Breitbart\u2019s comment space has later become milder \nfor other reasons\u2014perhaps 4chan\u2019s interest in Breitbart has diminished, \nwhich may be found in a subsequent analysis. Nevertheless, the discourse \naround both elections may be assumed to reach its zenith in the months \nsurrounding the election date. As such, the data gathered around the 2020 \nelections should provide a representative impression of the discourse around \nthat election, even if it is quantitatively smaller and of a shorter duration \nthan the earlier dataset.\nThese empirical observations strengthen previous assertions in the \nliterature that the period 2015\u20132017 was one characterized by an intensi-\nfied and salient \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of harmful vernacular between 4chan/\npol and Breitbart News. Possible explanations for the relative decline in \nthe propagation of idioms from 4chan to Breitbart around the 2020 U.S. \npresidential elections include the fact the site experienced a precipitous \na f ringe Ma inS Tr eaMe d, or Tr acing an Ta goni S Ti c Sl ang  177\ndecline after Trump took office, ultimately losing as much as three quarters \nof its total audience (Ellefson, 2019). According to Steve Bannon the site \nappears to have struggled financially following an advertiser boycott, \nwhich began in 2016 and was organized by Sleeping Giant to protest the \nsite\u2019s bigotry and sexism (Klayman, 2019). The billionaire Mercer family \nsold their shares in the site in 2017 and are currently majority stakeholders \nof the alternative social media site Parler, connected to the 2021 storm -\ning of the DC Capitol (Lerman, 2021). The growth in significance of such \nfi gure\u00a08.3 cl assifications of all words in the 2020\u20132021 data ( n  = 57,603) over time. The consecutive \noccurrences of each word are represented as a single row of per-month squares that are color-\ncoded for the occurrence of the word in 4chan/pol/ posts and \nbr\neitbart comments respectively.\n178  PeeTerS , Wi llaer T , TuTerS , beul S , Va n eec Ke and  Va n So eS T \n\u201calt-tech sites\u201d can be seen as one of the bi-products of the \u201cdeplatforming\u201d \nof alt-right figureheads from social media\u2014including eventually Trump \nhimself (Rogers, 2020b).\nMethods\n4chan data was collected with 4CAT, a forum analysis toolkit (Peeters and \nHagen, 2021) that contains a dataset comprising 4chan /pol/ data from 2013 \nto the present. This data is collected continuously (as it is posted on 4chan) \nby the tool itself and, for the period prior to 2018, supplemented with data \nfrom 4plebs.org, a third-party 4chan archive which publishes semi-regular \ndata \u201cdumps\u201d on the Internet Archive, containing all posts made on a number \nof 4chan\u2019s boards, including /pol/. (Merged 4plebs\u2019 and 4CAT\u2019s datasets have \nbeen used in other research on 4chan, too (Tuters and Hagen, 2019; Vou\u00e9 et \nal., 2020; Jokubauskait\u0117 and Peeters, 2020).) Notably, posts are included even \nif they are later deleted from the site, as all posts eventually disappear from \n4chan itself, as threads are deleted after a period of inactivity.\nThe 2015\u20132017 Breitbart data was collected between September\u00a02\u20139, 2019 \nusing a custom scraper written in Python which first crawled breitbart.\ncom for internal links to create an index of all articles posted on the site, \nand then collected all comments for all articles posted between June\u00a02015 \nand March\u00a02017, using the Disqus API. The resulting dataset reflects the \nstate of the comment section as it was at the moment of scraping. There \nis a possibility that some comments were removed between the moment \nof posting and the moment of scraping, up to 4 years later; however, as \nmentioned earlier, Breitbart\u2019s moderation policy seems to have been lax \nduring the period we study, and it is unlikely that later policies were enacted \nretroactively. We therefore assume that the data is a reasonably accurate \nreflection of what the comment threads would have looked like closer to \nthe date the comments were posted. The 2020\u20132021 Breitbart data was \ncollected with the same technique, between February\u00a017 and March\u00a03, 2021.\nOur first dataset thus spans the period between the announcement of \nDonald Trump\u2019s candidacy for the U.S. presidential election (June\u00a02015) \nand his first months in office, whereas the second dataset comprises a \nsmaller interval around the 2020 U.S. elections in which Trump was again a \ncandidate (and lost). As data capture of this nature is cumbersome, we were \nunable to gather a dataset comprising an equal timespan so shortly after \nthe 2020 elections; a more direct comparison would be a fruitful avenue \nfor future work.\na f ringe Ma inS Tr eaMe d, or Tr acing an Ta goni S Ti c Sl ang  179\nBefore analyzing the captured data, for both datasets we cleaned the \nscraped comments and posts by applying case folding and removing punc -\ntuation, URLs, HTML tags (in Breitbart comments) and comment referral \nnumbers such as \u201c>>280207128\u201d (in /pol/ comments).\nAnalysis\nThis chapter addresses the questions of (1) whether we can empirically \nidentify terms that are first prominent in the language on 4chan/pol/ and \nlater also in the language of the Breitbart comment sections around the time \nof the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, (2) how to characterize the language \nused on 4chan/pol/ compared to that of Breitbart\u2019s comment sections at that \ntime, (3) whether the nature of these identified terms indicates a spread of \nextreme political thought, and (4) whether we can identify similar dynam -\nics between both platforms around the time of the 2020 U.S. presidential \nelections. We expect that we can observe this pattern for terms associated \nwith far-right thought, and that it constitutes a mainstreaming of fringe, \ntaboo or otherwise extreme political concepts.Quantitative analysis\nWe investigate corpora of posts and comments using methods from \nnatural language processing to empirically identify terms that occur first \non one platform and then on another, and to quantify the propagation \npatterns of these terms between both platforms (Willaert et al., 2020; \nWillaert et al., 2021). We collected two datasets for both platforms, a first \nset comprising posts from June\u00a02015 through March\u00a02017, and a second \nset containing data from May\u00a02020 through January\u00a02021. These texts \nwere then tokenized (split into individual terms). For both platforms, the \nmonthly frequencies of each term were counted, and those terms with an \nabsolute frequency of less than 200 were removed, as these were mostly \nless germane and included typos. Next, the relative monthly frequency of \neach term was calculated for both /pol/ and Breitbart. Relative frequencies \nwere used because we are interested in the prominence of the terms in \nthe language of each platform, and we aim to compare this prominence \nbetween platforms. We then compare these relative frequencies and \nclassify each term into one of four classification bins, indicating whether \nfor a given month the term:\n\u2013\n o\nccurred neither on /pol/ nor on Breitbart,\n\u2013\n o\nccurred on both /pol/ and Breitbart,\n180  PeeTerS , Wi llaer T , TuTerS , beul S , Va n eec Ke and  Va n So eS T \n\u2013 o ccurred exclusively on /pol/, or\n\u2013\n o\nccurred exclusively on Breitbart.\nFor each term, this analysis results in a sequence of classification bins. In \norder to reduce the influence of very low frequency terms, a term is only \nassigned to the Breitbart bin or /pol/ bin if it had a relative frequency of at \nleast 0.00001%. If not, its frequency is considered to be 0 for that month. \nThis filtering resulted in a classification sequence for each term, which was \nvisualized using color coding (Figure\u00a08.2).\nQualitative analysisThe initial quantitative approach yielded a subset of terms for both periods \nthat warranted further scrutiny; we are particularly interested in those terms \nthat were first observed as prominent on 4chan/pol/ and later also observed on \nBreitbart. Our approach here was to first remove any obvious named entities \n(people, countries, institutions) from the list as well as common English \nlanguage. The remaining tokens could then be analyzed in more detail via a \ncloser reading, in which the context and occurrence of the token on 4chan/pol/ \nas well as on other platforms is studied via 4plebs (the searchable archive of \n/pol/) and 4CAT (the modular web platform scraping tool). Here we retained \nwords with a clear political (sub)text, similar to those shown in Figure\u00a08.1.\nAs such, we have employed a quali-quantitative approach (Venturini \nand Latour, 2010), where we combine an initial computational analysis of \na large dataset to extract a relevant subset of the corpora at hand, which \nwe then analyze further with a more interpretative qualitative approach \nof this subset.\nReferences\nBenkler, Y.

More specifi -\ncally, TikTokers practiced types of engagement such as playful political \nperformance, in which they express sentiments about a candidate by \ndancing or singing. They also practice remix as ambivalent critique by \njuxtaposing news clips and music to comment on current events. These \nexamples evoke genres of ludic civic engagement such as flash mobs and \ntactical clowning while also exhibiting qualities specific to TikTok. The \nrhetorical power of playfulness and remix lies in distorting, exaggerating, \nand dramatizing; on TikTok, these practices are mainstream rather than \nfringe, raising questions about the contribution of the platform to political \ndiscourse.\nKeywords: TikTok, remix video, playful engagement, ambivalent critique, \nevent-commentary\nResearch questions\nHow are people using TikTok in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential \nelection, and how to characterize TikTokers\u2019 political engagement?\nRogers.

In doing so, TikTok became \u201cthe default platform \nfor millions of teenagers who want to educate themselves on issues, express \ntheir political ideologies and organize to take action\u201d (Lorenz, 2020a). \nJournalists reported, for example, on the TikTok teenagers that \u201cmeme the \nvote\u201d (Pardes, 2020), the activities of TikTok party-based coalitions or \u201chype \nhouses\u201d (Lorenz, 2020b) as well as the app\u2019s political misinformation problem.\nThese days people routinely use social media to engage with societal \nissues and events such as elections. For example, YouTube vloggers discuss \npolitics and conspiracy theories. Some of them amass large audiences and \nbecome ideological (social media) influencers (Lewis, 2020; Creech and \nMaddox, 2020). Remixing news content is also a popular sense-making \npractice and form of cultural commentary (Geboers, 2019). Reactions to \nevents circulate on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and 4Chan as memes and \nviral clips (Nagle, 2017; Tuters and Hagen, 2020). TikTok also assumed this \nrole in the run-up to the elections through its well-known cultural practices \nof lip-synching and creating sketches involving audio clips from popular \nmedia. TikTok has been described as a \u201cnever-ending talent show\u201d (Aroesti, \n2019, para. 4), for which people create content by replicating, remixing, and \nadapting media and sounds.\nOur research asks how people are using TikTok and its features politically. \nWe analyze popular TikTok videos associated with the 2020 presidential \ncandidates, Trump, Biden, and Sanders, using mixed methods. What we \nfind supports the argument that TikTok is an emerging tool for ludic civic \nengagement, ambivalent critique, event-commentary as well as the main-\nstreaming of polarizing satire. These findings are in line with the argument \nthat online media can facilitate \u201cparticipation through their performative, \nexperimental, and creative affordances\u201d (Glas et al., 2019, p.\u00a011). Moreover, \nthe practices that we explore in this chapter evoke ideas already familiar \nin media and political studies (e.g., using performance for political critique) \nwhile also exhibiting characteristics unique to TikTok as a medium. TikTok \nuse during the elections is, in this way, a recent example of the convergence \nbetween \u201ccitizenship, media technologies, and play\u201d (Glas et al., 2019, p.\u00a011).\nTikTok, we learn, remained \u201cfresh\u201d during the election cycle. The top \nvideos associated with Trump, Biden, and Sanders returned by the app (1,000 \nvideos per candidate), on two different dates, March\u00a02020 and January\u00a02021, \nshowed little overlap. Also, each set of videos addressed events current when \nPoli Ti cal Ti KT o K 189\nthe queries were made, thus offering evidence that TikTok is an emergent \nevent-commentary app.\nFurthermore, two media practices were predominant amongst the most \npopular videos. On the one hand, people use TikTok to practice playful \npolitical performance. By \u201cperformance,\u201d we refer to how people use \nsocial media to stage a persona\u2014in this case, a persona with a political \nstance\u2014while dancing, acting, and singing. In addition, we differentiate \nthree types of videos that involve this media practice. People \u201cstage an \nopinion\u201d about a candidate by acting and dancing, \u201cdocument and share \nactivities\u201d like voting, and \u201cgive speeches.\u201d Medina et al. (2020) describe the \npolitically engaged TikTok user in a similar way, namely, as a \u201cperformer \nwho externalizes personal political opinion via an audio-visual act, with \npolitical communication becoming a far more interactive experience than \non YouTube or Instagram\u201d (2020, p.\u00a0264).\nSecondly, we argue, TikTok users practice remix as ambivalent critique. \nThat means they use the app to re-edit, modify, and juxtapose clips from \nthe news and popular culture to comment on the elections. We see this \npractice in two types of videos. People \u201cdramatize\u201d news clips and remix each \nother\u2019s content to form counterarguments, which we call \u201cpartisan duetting \nand stitching.\u201d We add the term \u201cambivalent\u201d to emphasize that the intent and tone of these remix videos is difficult to pinpoint. Humor and serious \ncritique as well as engagement and disinterest appear to coexist in TikTok.\nFake news and conspiratorial narratives, we find, are mostly absent \nfrom the most popular content. However, the performative, playful, and \nambiguous tone of the videos, as well as its hyperpartisan and humorous \nnature invite reflection about problematic behavior on the app and the \ncontributions made to political discourse.\nImplications\nTikTok as an emerging app for event-commentary\nSocial media are described as \u201cevent-following machines\u201d when content \nabout an issue is fresh and aligns with current events. For instance, Twitter \nis the micro-blogging site where journalists, politicians, and lay people \nvoice opinions about pressing matters and inform themselves about what \nis happening during and in the aftermath of protests, natural disasters, and \ncultural events (Rogers, 2014, 2020; Bruns and Weller, 2016; Rathnayake and \nSuthers, 2018). A \u201cstale\u201d social media, on the contrary, is no longer the go-to \n190  S \u00c1nc heZ -q uerub \u00cdn,  Wa ng , dic Ke y and  benede T Ti \nspace to find information about what is happening or spread one\u2019s message. \nIt is also not an ideal source of data for cultural analysis.\nTikTok, we find, remained \u201cfresh\u201d during two different moments of the \nelection cycle. The most popular videos associated with Donald Trump, \nBernie Sanders, and Joe Biden, collected first in March\u00a02020 and later, \nin January\u00a02021, showed little overlap. Furthermore, each set of videos \naddressed events related to the elections that were important at the time the \nqueries were made. For example, videos associated with Trump, collected \nin March\u00a02020, featured clips from \u201cNamaste Trump,\u201d a rally held in India \nin late February\u00a02020. At the event, Trump was cheered by thousands of \nsupporting Indians (Crowley, 2020). Throughout and after the event, people \nused TikTok to share their sentiment about the upcoming election and \nvoting preferences. In February\u00a02021, the most popular videos addressed, \nby contrast, the outcomes of the election and issues such as misinformation \nand the alleged voter fraud to which, according to Trump supporters, Biden \nowed his victory. These findings add weight to the emerging argument that \nTikTok is a platform for political communication, issue-formation, and \nevent-commentary (Hautea, 2021).\nPlayful political performance: staging opinions, giving a speech, and \ndocumenting\nIn academic discussions, elections are theorized as theater, performance, and \nspectacles that depend on media coverage and are increasingly fashioned as \nentertainment (Chou and Roland, 2016). For example, politicians sit down \nfor interviews on television shows. Magazines report on the holidays and \nfashion choices of presidential candidates, making them into spectacles. \nPublic figures also promote themselves on social media like Twitter, a \nsoftware platform, but also, metaphorically, a place from which to speak \nto one\u2019s followers (Gillespie, 2010). Conventions and rallies feature musical \nacts and guest artists that lend candidates an air of coolness.\nCitizens also engage in political performance. Social media becomes a \ntool to stage a persona, with a political identity and stance. People use their \nsocial media accounts, for example, to share opinions about current issues, \ndonate, and make public their political affiliations. Sharing news articles, \nposting selfies wearing campaign gear, creating memes, and recording videos \ntalking about their experiences all can be forms of political performance.\nTikTok is a space for citizen political performance, too, albeit of a par -\nticular playful nature. In the context of the U.S. elections, TikTokers, we \nfind, combine political performance, in the sense of presenting a persona \nPoli Ti cal Ti KT o K 191\nwith a political stance online, with dancing, acting, and singing. When \ncreating this content, they also experiment with video editing techniques \nsuch as zooming, soundtracks, filters, special effects, and greenscreens. \nWe differentiate three types of TikTok videos that use playful political \nperformance: \u201cstaging opinions,\u201d \u201cgiving a speech,\u201d and \u201cdocumenting.\u201d\nIn Figure\u00a09.1, a woman dances and sings along to the song \u201cGreat Again\u201d \nby American musician James McCoy Taylor. The sound playing in the \nvideo features the verses, \u201cI voted for a man named Donald J. Trump / \n\u2018Cause when they\u2019re playin\u2019 the anthem I stand up / I know that half of \nAmerica will too / And we ain\u2019t scared of no Kim Jong-un.\u201d The video was \nposted as a response to a comment left on the woman\u2019s account, which \nis displayed also on the screen. It reads: \u201cI followed you and now you lost \nme. No more Trump.\u201d In another video, a man sings along to the \u201cTrump Theme Song.\u201d The song includes verses such as: \u201cRacism / Bigotry / Lying \n/ Polygamy / Immature asshole on God / Pride / Mediocrity / And how he \nhandled Iran\u2026\u201d These two videos are examples of what we call \u201cstaging an opinion.\u201d\nScholarship on music and politics has observed that soundtracks create \nemotional intensity around political personas. According to musicologist \nJames Deadville, specific sounds become associated with the different \npolitical camps and help \u201cto create a collective identity and to construct \nconsensus\u201d (Deadville, 2015, p.\u00a01). Songs are \u201cwritten or modified for a specific \ncandidate\u201d and concerts become political spaces (Deadville, 2015, p.\u00a01), \nlike when the \u201cDixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines infamously dissed \nBush at a 2003 concert in London\u201d (Henwood, 2017). Likewise, at public \nappearances, conventions, and rallies, the public expects certain playlists. \nOrganizers, Deadville (2015) explains, draw on new classics of patriotic \nand inspirational character such as Bruce Springsteen\u2019s song \u201cBorn in the \nU.S.A.\u201d for the Democrats. That \u201chardly any of the invited famous pop artists \nwanted to perform at [Donald Trump\u2019s] inauguration in January\u00a02017\u201d was reported extensively (Mehring, 2020, p.\u00a022). Moreover, outside convention \nfi gure\u00a09.1 \u201c i  voted for a man named do nald J. Trump\u201d [video frames]. a  TikTok user sings and \ndances to the pro-Trump song (and now, TikTok sound) \u201c gr\neat \nag\nain\u201d by \nam\nerican musician James \nMcco\ny Taylor.\n192  S \u00c1nc heZ -q uerub \u00cdn,  Wa ng , dic Ke y and  benede T Ti \nhalls, \u201cprotesters staged their own media-driven spectacles replete with \nmusic (and speech)\u201d (Deadville, 2015, p.\u00a08).\nThe activity on TikTok offers a recent example of the role music plays \nduring elections. When people \u201cstage their opinions,\u201d not unlike during \npolitical rallies and conventions, the lyrics and mood of a song become \nproxies for their feelings about a candidate (Mehring, 2020; Deadville, 2015). \nMusic also becomes a tool for contestation on TikTok. Trump supporters, \nfor example, used clips from the song \u201cRed Kingdom\u201d as a soundtrack for \ntheir TikTok videos. Red Kingdom, however, was intended as an anthem \nfor the Kansas City Chiefs, an American football team. Conservative \nTikTokers , according to a writer for the Kansas-based magazine The Pitch , \n\u201chave trolled themselves into thinking that a song by a Black activist for \na football team with a Black superstar quarterback was created for their \nhateful agenda\u201d (Searles, 2020, para. 3). To address the misappropriation, \nliberal TikTokers \u201cmade videos to flood the sound \u2018tag\u2019 with positive, \ninclusive content to \u2018drown out\u2019 the hateful posts\u201d (Searles, 2020). Luke \nBryan\u2019s song \u201cCountry Girl (Shake It for Me),\u201d similarly, was used by TikTok -\ners as a nod to the \u201cliberal cowboy,\u201d after it became public that the singer \nwas not a Trump supporter (Lenzen, 2020). Also, YG and Nipsey Hussle\u2019s protest track \u201cFDT\u201d (F\u2014 Donald Trump) \u201cmade similar waves but never \ngarnered as much TikTok fame as its conservative counterparts\u201d (Konrad, \n2021, para. 8).\nThe videos we discuss above were returned on top by TikTok\u2019s search \nengine when searching for the presidential candidates. They are successful \nexamples of broader trends and thus linked to other videos on the app, \nboth conceptually and technically by sounds and hashtags. Clicking on the \nhashtag \u201cRed Kingdom\u201d or the \u201cTrump Theme Song\u201d sound redirects users \nto other videos featuring these same auditory elements and engaging with \nthe same video concept, for example, by replicating or parodying it. TikTok \nis, in this sense, an \u201cevolving tapestr[y] of self-referential texts collectively created, circulated, and transformed by participants online\u201d (Phillips and Miller, 2017, p.\u00a030). On Facebook or Reddit, memes look like image macros \nannotated with text. There is scholarship that explores the role of these \nimage-based memes in contemporary politics, uncovering fringe visual \nand textual cultures. TikTok meme behavior is, however, performative, in \nthat \u201cusers replicate the same type of video or similar video concepts using \na sound or effect over and over again\u201d (Zulli and Zulli, 2020, p.\u00a010). TikTok \ninvites those interested in ludic civic engagement online to consider the \nrole of music in a new light.\nPoli Ti cal Ti KT o K 193\n\u201cStaging an opinion\u201d on TikTok also resonates with practices of ludic \ncivic engagement that make use not only of music but that also rely on \ntheatrical and humorous interventions (Glas et al., 2019). Stunts, tactical \nclowning, critical play, the carnival, and flash mobs are examples of such \nludic engagements. Majken Jul S\u00f8rensen (2016), a scholar specializing in \nthe subject of humor in activism, argues that these genres \u201cshare a playful \nattitude towards expression of dissent and use various creative or artistic ways of communicating\u201d (2016, p.\u00a012). For example, in 2013, a Spanish radio \nshow organized a flash mob in an unemployment office, at a time when \nSpain endured an unemployment rate of 26%. A small orchestra arrived \nunnoticed in the waiting room and played \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d by The \nBeatles (Urquhart, 2013). The intervention, while on the ground, aimed \nto spread awareness to Spain\u2019s growing economic crisis by going viral. \nOn another occasion, students staged a flash mob by dancing to Michael \nJackson\u2019s song \u201cThriller\u201d in \u201cfull Zombie regalia to protest the death of public \neducation in Chile\u201d (Colquhounon, 2013, para. 4).\nTikTok users also stage their opinions about the U.S. presidential elections \nusing theatrical gestures evocative of flash mobs and clowning. In Figure\u00a09.2, \nfor instance, a man uses Kamala Harris and Joe Biden\u2019s heads as drums. \nThe text on the video reads: \u201cwhich of the two has the most hollow head?\u201d In Figure\u00a09.3, another man bops to the viral sound, Bass Da Da Da , which \nis a fragment from a song by the same name. The text on the screen reads: \n\u201cDoes anyone else hear \u2018thank God for Donald Trump?\u2019\u201d The critiques posed \nby the Spanish and Chilean flash mobs are clear\u2014there is a discontent with \ncurrent employment and education situations. Spectators may read into the \nsymbology of a band of zombie dancing towards a public institution. In the \nTikTok videos we study there is, instead, ambiguity, a topic that we returned \nto in the next section. As a case in point, in Figure\u00a09.2, the discontent with \nBiden and Harris is clear, however much one may not infer a stance or goal \nfrom the video.\nBesides \u201cstaging an opinion,\u201d the two other types of videos that involve \nplayful political performance are \u201cgiving a speech\u201d and \u201cdocumenting.\u201d \nFigure\u00a09.4 is an example of \u201cgiving a speech\u201d; in the video, a man turns \nthe camera towards himself and warns viewers about the liberal party, \nwithout using dramatic embellishments such as music or the video editing \ncapabilities of TikTok. \u201cThe hard left,\u201d he says, \u201cthrows not facts just slurs\u201d and \n\u201cdoesn\u2019t care about facts or truth.\u201d Figure\u00a09.5 is an example of \u201cdocumenting.\u201d \nA man records himself from the inside of his car. The driver of the car \nbeside him has stepped outside and is hitting his window with a metal bar. \n194  S \u00c1nc heZ -q uerub \u00cdn,  Wa ng , dic Ke y and  benede T Ti \nOverlayed on the screen is the following text: \u201cThis is what happens when \nTrump supporters get mad. Someone identify him?\u201d\n\u201cGiving a speech\u201d and \u201cdocumenting\u201d are familiar online forms of political \nperformance. We find examples of \u201cdocumenting\u201d on Twitter from instances \nof citizen journalism to call outs and requests to find the perpetrator of a transgression. On YouTube, Facebook Live, and Instagram Stories people \nfi gure\u00a09.2 \u201c ho llow heads\u201d  [video frames]. in t his TikTok video a man uses editing effects to play \ndrums with the heads of the then presidential candidate, Joe \nbi\nden, and running mate, Kamala \nha\nrris.

It involves reediting \u201ctelevision, \nmovies, and news media for critical and political purposes\u201d (McIntosh, 2012, \npara. 1). \u201cDonald Duck Meets Glenn Beck in Right Wing Radio Duck,\u201d a remix \nvideo by artist Jonathan McIntosh, exemplifies the practice. Glenn Beck \nis an American conservative commentator, conspiracy theorist, and radio \nhost. McIntosh edited audio from Beck\u2019s radio show with Disney cartoons, \nsuggesting a narrative in which Donald Duck became radicalized. The aim of \nthe piece was \u201cto demonstrate how right-wing media paradoxically appears \nsympathetic while fear-mongering\u201d (burrough and Dufour, 2018, p.\u00a098).\nAnother example of remix is the parody video \u201cCandidate Obama Debates \nPresident Obama on Government Surveillance.\u201d The creator juxtaposes \nclips from different interviews during Obama\u2019s career, \u201cpointing out the \ninconsistencies in Obama\u2019s position on national security\u201d (Nunes, 2018, \np.\u00a0219\u2013220). The video essay is yet another form of audio-visual criticism. \nRemixed footage has, indeed, been part of \u201cexperimental cinema and film criticism for a number of decades\u201d (McWhirter, 2016, p.\u00a0372). Recently, also \nYouTube has seen an outburst of video essayists. These are all examples \nof what media scholar Henry Jenkins calls participatory politics, namely, \ninstances of citizens having \u201cthe means of creating political commentary \nthrough the reuse and reappropriation of the media content that makes up \nthe majority of our contemporary political discourse\u201d (Nunes, 2018, p.\u00a0219).\nRemixing is an important practice within TikTok. Users of the app tend \nto \u201ccomment on and rework existing cultural imaginaries and narratives \nby refashioning old media forms \u2026. [T]his is immediately visible in TikTok \nusers combining audio fragments from movies and TV news with mimicry to \npoke fun of current events\u201d (Vijay and Gekker, 2021, p.\u00a0717). In line with these \ntrends, in the context of the U.S. presidential elections, we found TikTokers \npracticing remix as ambivalent critique. That is to say, TikTokers are using \nthe app to juxtapose, combine, and enhance audio-visual materials related \nto the elections. Amongst the most popular content are the videos we label \nas \u201cdramatization of media clips\u201d and \u201cpartisan duetting and stitching.\u201d We \nsee them as medium-specific forms of remix and examples of participatory \npolitics.\n196  S \u00c1nc heZ -q uerub \u00cdn,  Wa ng , dic Ke y and  benede T Ti \nWe labeled videos as \u201cdramatization of media clips\u201d when TikTok users \njuxtapose and re-edit news clips (e.g., fragments from a televised press \nconference) with other clips, text, sounds, and voiceover commentary. \nBringing together news content with these new elements reframes and alters \ntheir meaning, often overstating, mocking, and exaggerating actions, or in \nother words, dramatizing them. Figure\u00a09.6 is an example of this practice. The \nvideo includes footage from a press conference held in the White House, in \nOctober\u00a02018. Donald Trump points to Cecilia Vega, a journalist from ABC \nNews, signaling that she can ask him a question. The sentence \u201cwait for it\u201d appears on the video. Then, Trump says \u201cshe\u2019s shocked that I picked her\u2026 \nshe\u2019s like in a state of shock\u2026 That\u2019s OK. I know you\u2019re not thinking. You \nnever do.\u201d The video transitions into a Trump lookalike dancing in front of \na background with the words Trump 2020\u2014a visual punchline.\nIn another example of the \u201cdramatization of media clips,\u201d a TikTok user \nrecords a segment from the late-night television show Jimmy Kimmel Live!  \nand adds a laugh track (Figure\u00a09.7). The show created a video including \nboth real images of Trump\u2019s visit to Pope Francis and edited images of him \nallegedly taking Pope Francis\u2019s hand and then of Francis slapping it away. \nThe sketch mocked Trump and the former first lady\u2019s cold relationship and a \nsimilar hand-slapping incident. The CNN logo is displayed on the video. This \nuser seems to be in on the joke\u2014the video is a parody. The Jimmy Kimmel \nLive!  video, however, had to be debunked by fact-checker website Snopes \n(Evan, 2017), indicating that once outside the context of the television, not everyone was aware of its nature.\nSimilarly, a TikTok user records his television, where we see Joe Biden \ntaking part in a Wired magazine \u201cAutocomplete\u201d interview in May\u00a02020. \nDuring the segment, guests answer the most \u201cGoogled\u201d questions about \nthemselves (Figure\u00a09.8). One of the questions for Biden is: Does Joe Biden \nhave a brother? Biden responds by saying, \u201cI got a sister who is the love of \nmy life.\u201d The focus of the video shifts to a teenager, sitting in front of the \ntelevision, playing \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d on his guitar and tipping his \nhat. In this context, the song plays on the stereotype that incest abounds \nfi gure\u00a09.6 . \u201cWait for it\u201d [video frames]. The video is an example of \u201cremix as ambivalent critique\u201d \nand, specifically, of the \u201cdramatization of media clips.\u201d \na\n TikTok user edits together footage from \nthe press conference when Trump insults \nce\ncilia Vega, a journalist from \nabc\n \nne\nws, with images of \na Trump look-a-like dancing before the slogan Trump 2020.\nPoli Ti cal Ti KT o K 197\nin the American South, hinting that Biden\u2019s relationship with his sister is \ninappropriate. This particular moment in the interview generated numerous \nmemes.\nYet another memetic dynamic built into TikTok is the \u201cduet\u201d function. \n\u201cDuet\u201d means creating a split screen to display one\u2019s video side-by-side a \nvideo created by someone else. People \u201cduet\u201d to create a scene by bringing \ntogether two separate videos, dance parallel to someone else, or comment \non content created by other TikTok users. If a person uses the \u201cstitching\u201d \nfunction, instead of having a split-screen, the videos are integrated into \neach other. It is often about re-using snippets of other people\u2019s video clips \nto create responses and remixes on the same theme. We find that these \nfunctions are used to engage with the elections and offer a TikTok-specific \nform of competition or contestation between political parties. We call this \ntype of video \u201cpartisan duetting and stitching.\u201d\nAn example of duetting can be seen in Figure\u00a09.9. The original video \nfeatures a young Trump supporter, marching to the song \u201cKings & Queens\u201d \nby Ava Max and lifting her hand towards the edge of the screen. The text on \nher screen reads, \u201clet\u2019s start a chain of women for Trump.\u201d The invitation is for other women to post similar videos and to duet or stitch them together. \nfi gure\u00a09.7 \u201c do nald Trump and The Pope\u201d [video frames]. a  TikTok user records and overlaps \nwith a laugh track a comedic sketch from the television show Jimmy Kimmel Live!  where Trump \nappears to reach for Pope \nfr\nancis\u2019s hand and the latter slapping it away.\nfi gure\u00a09.8  \u201cbi den and his sister\u201d [video frames]. a  TikTok user records his television as Joe bi den\u2019s \nWired  magazine \u201c au\ntocomplete\u201d interview plays. When asked if he has a brother, Joe \nbi\nden \nresponds by saying, \u201c i\n got a sister who is the love of my life.\u201d The focus of the video shifts to a \nteenager playing \u201cSweet \nho\nme \nal\nabama\u201d on his guitar and tipping his hat, joking that \nbi\nden\u2019s \nrelationship with his sister might be inappropriate.\n198  S \u00c1nc heZ -q uerub \u00cdn,  Wa ng , dic Ke y and  benede T Ti \nIf they imitate the way the creator of the original video raises her hand, \nonce the videos come together it would be like they were all holding hands. \nIn Figure\u00a09.9, however, it is a young man who responds and parodies the \noriginal video. He marches to the same song but when the time comes to join \nhands, he lifts an iron, even including a hissing sound. In yet another video, a \nTrump supporter uses a spray bottle to demonstrate how liquid goes through \na mask. The video is \u201cstitched\u201d by a Biden supporter who conducts their own \nexperiment, demonstrating that masks, indeed, work. In yet another example, \nin Figure\u00a09.10, a young woman combs her eyebrows while the following text \nappears on the screen: \u201cwhen I can attract both genders.\u201d The video is stitched \nby a man wearing a Trump hat. He says, \u201cahh, so there are only two genders. \nThank you for proving my point sweetheart. He winks and tips his cap.\u201d\nTikTok, one could argue, has popularized a new form of political remix \nvideo. Yet, this is not to say that the TikTok videos we study are the same as \nthe work of artists as McIntosh, who are explicit about their political intent. \nTikTok videos are, instead, often ambivalent. We use the term ambivalent \nin similar fashion as Phillips and Milner (2017) and Tuters and Hagen (2020) \ndo (see also Niederer and Colombo, this volume). These authors remark how \nonline political communication (e.g., in forums as Reddit) is characterized \nfi gure\u00a09.9 \u201c le t\u2019s start a chain of women for Trump\u201d [video frames]. a  TikTok user invites women to \nrecord themselves marching to the song \u201cKings & \nqu\neens\u201d by \nav\na Max and stitch them together \nto show support for \ndo\nnald Trump. \nin t\nhe video, a man parodies the original video and mocks the \ncontent creator.\nfi gure\u00a09.10 \u201cWhen i  can attract both genders\u201d [video frames]. a  TikTok user combs her eyebrows, \nwhile the sentence \u201cwhen \ni\n can attract both genders\u201d hovers on the screen. The video was stitched \nby a man wearing a Trump hat. \nhe s\nays \u201cahh, so there are only two genders.

It can be \u201cantagonistic \nand social, creative and disruptive, humorous and barbed, the satirizing of \nproducts, antagonization of celebrities, and creation of questionable fan art\u201d \n(Phillips and Milner, 2017, p.\u00a010). Ambivalent can be understood in opposition \nto earnest or aligned with a clear agenda. TikTok, indeed, often leaves the \nviewer with the sensation that the absurdity of the current political reality \nis the object of critique. On TikTok, the lines between earnest and mocking \nentertainment and political engagement are constantly blurred\u2014\u201csharing a \n\u2018funny\u2019 video that has a certain political stance does not mean committing \nor aligning to that politics\u201d (Vijay and Gekker, 2021, p.\u00a0178).\nTikTok\u2019s misinformation problem\nWe have presented three arguments so far. We first posit that TikTok \nremained \u201cfresh\u201d during the elections as evidence of its function as event-\ncommentary medium. Then, we identified two media practices present in \npopular election-related videos: \u201cplayful political performance\u201d and \u201cremix \nas ambivalent critique.\u201d We also differentiate between types of videos that \ninclude these practices, such as \u201cstaging an opinion\u201d and \u201cdramatizing media \nclips.\u201d Furthermore, we discussed these videos and practices vis-\u00e0-vis playful \nactivism, parody, and political remix videos. TikTok videos relate to these \ngenres while also being medium-specific modes of ludic civic engagement. \nIn this section, we revisit \u201cplayful political performance\u201d and \u201cremix as \nambivalent critique\u201d in relation to the issue of information disorders.\nAccording to Claire Wardle (2017), co-founder of First Draft News, in -\nformation disorders are types of content that raise concern in the context \nof issue-making and democratic process. Existing studies have already \nidentified disorderly information on TikTok in the form of hyperpartisan, \nmisleading content, manipulated content, and false context content about \nthe U.S. presidential elections. For instance, Media Matters, a non-profit \norganization that scrutinizes right-leaning media, identified eleven examples \nof election conspiracies and misleading claims spreading on TikTok. These \ninclude videos with narratives about alleged voter fraud and a deceptively \nedited clip of Joe Biden, which accumulated hundreds of thousands of views \n(Little, 2020). To combat the problem, TikTok set up content guidelines for \nthe elections and moderated \u201cterms associated with hate speech, incitement \nto violence, or disinformation around voter fraud, such as ballot harvesting\u201d \n(TikTok, 2021). Posting about conspiracies like QAnon and anti-vaccination \nnarratives is now banned (TikTok, 2021). Media Matters reported that \nafter their investigation, TikTok removed the flagged videos, reduced the \n200  S \u00c1nc heZ -q uerub \u00cdn,  Wa ng , dic Ke y and  benede T Ti \ndiscoverability of other problematic posts, and added banners linking \nsuspicious content to authoritative sources about the election.\nAmong the most popular videos\u2014from a subset of content returned in \nJanuary\u00a02021\u2014there are no fake and conspiratorial videos, for example, \nassociated with QAnon and other known, flagged topics. It is not entirely \nsurprising given the app\u2019s information cleaning efforts. What we did find are \nvideos in which misinformation is a topic. For example, in Figure\u00a09.4 a man \nclaims that the Democratic Party has no regard for the truth, a familiar argu-\nment amongst Trump supporters. This video is example of \u201cplayful political \nperformance\u201d and, specifically, \u201cgiving a speech.\u201d In another video, a TikToker \nduets an anti-mask video. They conduct an experiment that shows that masks \nactually block sprayed liquid. The parody clip created by Jimmy Kimmel Live!  \nfeatured Pope Francis brushing of Trump\u2019s hand is fake and plays on rumors \nabout Donald and Melania Trump\u2019s cold marriage. (As mentioned, the parody, \nnevertheless, had to be debunked by Snopes, the fact-checking organization.)\nTikTok videos beyond the examples above invite yet another line of \nquestioning. Playful performance, remix, and humor are dominant modes \nof expression on TikTok, and their meaning-making capacities depend \non altering, juxtaposing, exaggerating, and dramatizing. The goal is not \nto correct remix and playfulness, or humor. These practices are not new \nand exist in forms of activism, political cartoon, and comedy shows. As \nwe explored earlier in this chapter, they have important critical, civic, and \npolitical capacities to them by making \u201cpolitical issues into a piece of theater \nwhen their attacks on dominant discourses disrupt, subvert, oppose and \ntransform business as usual\u201d (S\u00f8rensen, 2016, p.\u00a013). Yet a challenge TikTok \nposes, we argue, is considering playful performance, remix, and humor \nnot as fringe critical practices but as mainstream modes for engaging with \nelections. Or, in other words, considering, for example, that one may learn \nabout an event first through its parody or remix.\nFor example, Ride It by Regard is a viral sound for TikTokers to create fin -\nger dancing videos with word bubbles denoting cultural misunderstandings. \nThese in-video texts usually display inaccurate representations of a culture, \na nation or a minority group. In the Netherlands, for example, local creators \nuse the sound to make videos indicating that not all Dutch people live in \nAmsterdam or the sunshine over the canals is a typical misrepresentation of Dutch life as wind and rain are a more common occurrence. For young \nvoters in the U.S., the same sound is widely deployed to make dancing videos \nengaging with the \u201caccusations\u201d of being Trump supporters, which include \n\u201cget called racist 24/7,\u201d \u201cget yelled at for presenting facts,\u201d and \u201caccused of not \nrespecting women.\u201d Aligning with the study that finds sounds on TikTok \nPoli Ti cal Ti KT o K 201\nfunctioning as a story builder to convey a specific message (Medina et al., \n2020), Trump supporters employ the sound to suggest that these accusations \nare untrustworthy and even entertaining.\nIn another video, a young man wearing a \u201cMAGA\u201d hat performs a finger \ndance with the caption \u201cnot sorry if you\u2019re offended by facts,\u201d referring to \n\u201cabortion is murder,\u201d \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people do,\u201d and \u201ctaking away \nguns is unconstitutional.\u201d These are slickly produced videos, using creative \ntools at once to entertain and to put forward misunderstanding as the root \nof disagreement with Trump politics.\nIn the study of misinformation, parody or satire is said to sometimes fool \nthe viewer, albeit unintentionally. Here we find that the sarcastic videos that \nparody candidates seem to be motivated by an intention to instill mistrust. \nMoreover, their lightheartedness could fool the viewers into thinking that it \nwas just for fun. To consider here is how the \u201cnon-serious nature of TikTok \nfurther obscures its actions as a playfield for (political) persuasion\u201d (Vijay \nand Gekker 2021, p.\u00a0714). TikTok has also raised concern \u201cabout its distorting \nimpacts on political discourse and participation\u201d (Vijay and Gekker, 2021, \np.\u00a0714). Also challenging is the mainstreaming of ambivalence: what is \nlabeled as \u201csatire\u201d is often hateful, polarizing and divisive content but it \nmust not be taken seriously because it is a \u201cjoke.\u201d\nFindings\nFinding 1: TikTok is an event-commentary medium, active and topical \nduring the election cycle. The hashtags linked to videos concerning the \nthen-presidential candidates, Joe Biden (#biden2020), Donald Trump \n(#trump2020, #maga2020), and Bernie Sanders (#bernie2020), were ac -\ntive between March\u00a02020 and February\u00a02021. Comparing the 1,000 most \nengaged with videos on TikTok for each hashtag query in March\u00a02020 and \nJanuary\u00a02021 revealed the most popular videos changed, an indication of \nactivity. Popularity on TikTok is measured in terms of cumulative interac -\ntions, including the number of views, likes, comments, and shares that a \nvideo receives. The videos popular in 2020 and in 2021 have content that \nis highly topical. That is, it is connected to current events such as Trump\u2019s visit to India in 2020, the tensions with Iran, and Bernie Sanders dropping out of the race. They treat current events by way of remixing, dramatizing \nand in general manipulating or creating original media content based on \nthose events. These digital activities are a key form of participating in the political discourse surrounding current events.\n202  S \u00c1nc heZ -q uerub \u00cdn,  Wa ng , dic Ke y and  benede T Ti \nFinding 2: There are typical TikTok political engagement practices. The \nresults of the coding of 120 TikTok videos collected in 2021 (30 per hashtag) \nresulted in 5 different types of videos, which were further subsumed under \ntwo media practices (see Table\u00a09.1).\nTable\u00a09.1  M edia practices and types of election-related TikTok videos.\nMedia practice Video Concept Description\nPlayful political \nperformanceStaging an opinion TikTok users engage in performative activities such as lip syncing, dancing or roleplaying to express their political ideas.\ndo\ncumenting/sharing a\n pre-existing piece of media is reposted \non TikTok with no meaning-altering embellishment.\ngi\nving a speech TikTok users use only the video capacity of TikTok to record and share a short speech, with no editing or embellishment.\nre\nmixing as \nambivalent critiqueTheatricalization of media TikTok users add embellishments such as sounds, music, laugh tracks, dub dialogue or other editing techniques to existing media clips in a way that frames or alters the meaning of the original clip(s).\nPartisan stitching and duettingTikTok users use the \u201cstitching\u201d tool, which places their own video next to another user\u2019s video, to create contrast with the latter. \nof\nten, the new video contests \nor mock\u2019s the content of the video it is stitched to.\nStrategy Count Percentage \nTheatricalization of media clips 48 40%\ndo\ncumenting/ sharing 24 20%\nac\nting an opinion 19 15.8%\nStitching and duetting as contrast 5 4.2%\ngi\nving a speech 2 1.7%\noth\ner 22 18.3%\nMethodology\nThe data was gathered using the TikTok-scraper (Drawrowfly, 2021), a \nsoftware tool that uses TikTok\u2019s Web API to scrape media and related \nmeta-information. We collected the 1,000 most popular videos associated \nPoli Ti cal Ti KT o K 203\nwith the hashtags #Trump2020, #maga2020, #biden, and #bernie2020 on \nMarch\u00a023, 2020 and January\u00a04, 2021. The scraper collected the video ID, \nusername, date of creation, video URL, caption, hashtags, and engagement \nmetrics such as view count for each of the videos. The dataset consists of \n8,000 videos. We extracted the top 30 videos per hashtags, creating a subset \nof 120 videos. We answered the first research question by comparing the \n1,000 videos collected for each of the hashtags on the two dates. Our goal \nwas to determine if the most popular videos changed. The techniques used \nby TikTok users and the various types of political videos were identified \nthrough a qualitative exploration of the top 30 videos per hashtags. Each \nvideo from this sample was coded according to the performative and remix \ntechniques used by its creator. This began with an open coding process \nto develop a consistent coding schedule which was then repeated several \ntimes. The four authors acted as coders and controlled for the consistency \nof the coding by employing an inter-researcher reliability test.\nReferences\nAroesti, R. (2019, November\u00a01).

More specifically, the platforms\u2019 content moderation, as it \nis termed, includes warning, labeling, demoting as well as removing posts \nand users when they break platform rules. When a user is removed, it is \ncalled \u201cdeplatforming,\u201d but it may also refer to broader sanctioning such \nas suppression of content about multi-user movements such as QAnon, a \nwide-ranging conspiracy theory concerning the actions of operators inside \ngovernment. Facebook, in particular, has sought to ban QAnon content, \nremoving it from the platform.\nThe deplatforming debates also revolve around the extent to which the \nplatforms are doing too much or too little moderation. They concern whether \n(and when) it is justified as well as effective (and for whom). While the \nvolume authors do not address these questions directly, in the following I \nwould like to take up what we have found when studying the \u201cmisinforma -\ntion problem\u201d and the contributions we can make to the debates, however \nindirectly.\nIn all, I touch on five points where the misinformation problem relates to \nthe deplatforming discussion: the classification of problematic content (and \nits politics), platform privileging of certain content and users, the work put \ninto establishing editorial authority, the difference in content moderation per platform as well as the methodological challenges (and opportunities) in studying content and user removal. Each is taken in turn, whereupon I conclude with a modest proposal to re-orient the discussion.\nEspecially in the Facebook chapter but also in others, we have taken \na common approach to classifying sources as problematic or less so. The \napproach is both historicized as well as comparative. By historicized, I mean \nRogers. R. (ed.), The Propagation of Misinformation in Social Media: A Cross-platform Analysis . \nAmsterdam: Amsterdam University Press 2023\ndoi: 10.5117/9789463720762_after\n208  T he Pro Pa gaTion  of Mi Si nfor MaTion  in\u00a0Social Media\nthat there has been an evolution in the definition and terminology of what \nwas incipiently referred to as \u201cfake news\u201d in 2016 by Craig Silverman of \nBuzzFeed News , when writing up his findings concerning the types of sources \nthat were performing well on Facebook in the run-up to the U.S. presidential \nelections (2016). When comparing engagement scores, or tallies of likes, \nshares and comments, he found that those from fly-by-night, imposter \nas well as \u201chyperpartisan\u201d sources received more engagement than those \nhe called mainstream. Subsequent scholarly work expanded the types of \nsources under study to \u201cproblematic information\u201d as well as \u201cjunk news,\u201d \nadding (for example) satire as well as \u201ccomputational propaganda\u201d which \nincludes amplification efforts such as fake followers and bot work (Jack, \n2017; Bolsover & Howard, 2018). Facebook but also certain journalists, for \ntheir part, then narrowed the classification of problematic content to \u201cfalse \nnews,\u201d focusing on hoaxes and imposter sources and removing from the \ndefinition the \u201chyperpartisan,\u201d originally referring to \u201copenly ideological \nweb operations\u201d (Herrman, 2016). Nowadays the term misinformation \n(which would include non-intentional falsehoods) is enjoying currency \nas an umbrella term. The evolution of the definitional led us to consider \na comparative perspective where we found that an ample classification \n(including hyperpartisan) would enlarge the misinformation problem and a \nnarrower definition (excluding hyperpartisan) would reduce its size, making \nit more ordinary. There is an accompanying political dimension, given that \nthe hyperpartisan sources (receiving the highest engagement) are often \nmore conservative in bent, at least at the time of writing. When classifying \nthem as fake, junk or problematic, the adjectives become sectarian markers, \nand any content moderation along those definitional lines seems to take \nsides and invites backlash.\nAs related particularly in the Twitter studies, the second observation \nconcerns which content as well as users are privileged by platforms. For some \ntime during our work, a New York Times journalist would tweet the most \nengaged-with sources on Facebook, pointing out how they disproportionately \nfavor hyperpartisan, conservative sources (Owen, 2021). A subsequent debate \nbetween the journalist and a Facebook representative took up whether \nthose sources were enjoying as much exposure as the engagement metric \nmight suggest, ultimately pointing to Facebook data in company transpar -\nency reports showing how the results of another metric\u2014reach\u2014indicate \notherwise. In fact, that data seemed to show that Facebook has a problem \nwith \u201cspammy, clickbait\u201d content, apart from that of the popularity of its \n\u201cright-wing pages\u201d (Warzel, 2021). The discussion points up the question \nof which users and content do well, metrically, both overall as well as per \nafTe r Wor d: The MiSi nfor MaTion  Pr oble M a nd Th e de Pl aTf or Mi ng deba TeS 209\nsocial media platform. It was at least partially answered in the expos\u00e9 of \nFacebook\u2019s privileging mechanisms, made possible by the former Facebook \nemployee, Frances Haugen, who presented news organizations with internal \ndocuments showing, among other things, that Facebook boosts posts which \nhave received \u201cangry\u201d reactions over those who have been merely \u201cliked.\u201d \nThus, one is able to score higher or have greater impact with posts that \nmake other users reply with anger. No similar whistle-blowing revelations \nhave been made of other platforms, but on Twitter, we made a finding \nakin to the New York Times journalist\u2019s. Hyperpartisan sources receive a \ndisproportionate amount of retweets, compared to other source types. Apart \nfrom the spammy or clickbait-like, driving engagement on major social media \nplatforms are source types variously characterized as \u201cmisinformation, \ntoxicity and low-quality news\u201d (Merrill and Oremus, 2021). As platforms \ncrack down on such content as misinformation and toxicity, it follows \nthat they are moderating popular material, which attracts attention to \nsuch moderation rather than keeping it out of sight, as was the case with \ncommercial content moderation from the beginning.\nPrior to the fake news crisis of 2016 and beyond, the critique made of \nsocial media content moderation concerned the kind of \u201csoul-crushing\u201d \nlabor behind it (Chen, 2014). Low-wage and outsourced, content moderation \nworkers did not enjoy the status (and benefits) of company employees \n(Roberts, 2016). They also worked at a rapid pace, monitored for their capacity \nto decide accurately which disturbing content should be deleted or ignored. \nIn our study we focus on the type of content that rises to the top when \nusers engage with posts concerning national elections and the COVID-19 \npandemic. Such material may intersect with the areas of conventional \ncontent moderation (such as violence and pornography) but are also moder -\nated, rather exceptionally, for misinformation. The labor still could be \ncalled content moderation by the companies, but given the partnerships \nmade with fact-checking organizations to undertake some of it, it more \nreadily would be called editorial (Perez, 2021). We discuss those social media \nplatforms and search engines specifically targeting misinformation around \nnational elections and the pandemic (including, in our study, Facebook, \nInstagram, Twitter, TikTok as well as Google Web Search) as employing \n\u201ceditorial epistemologies,\u201d curating lists of authoritative sources returned \nfor election- and pandemic-related queries and otherwise adjudicating \ncontent either automatically detected or flagged by users as problematic. \nIt is arguably novel editorial work undertaken by the platforms and opens \nthe questions of which other subject matters apart from elections and the \npandemic should also deserve scrutiny and which expertise is required. For \n210  T he Pro Pa gaTion  of Mi Si nfor MaTion  in\u00a0Social Media\nexample, is climate change or another pressing social issue so deserving? \nThe shift in moderation culture would put the platforms on a footing where \nauthority for content demotion or deplatforming is achieved by editorial \nexpertise and delivered as fact checks.\nAs has been pointed out, all platforms perform content moderation, and \nit could be considered at the heart of a platform\u2019s business model (Gillespie, \n2018). The extent of its presence as well as its absence are objects of study, \ngiven how certain platforms have emerged known as \u201calt tech\u201d that explicitly \ntrade on low moderation or \u201cfree speech.\u201d They do not profess to the practice \nof deplatforming. For the platforms under study here, 4chan could be said to \noffer the least content moderation and Facebook (and Instagram) perhaps \nthe most. Whether the platform has high or low content moderation is \nworthy of study, but also of interest is which actors platforms privilege. \nOne could argue that platforms privilege their own \u201cperformers\u201d rather \nthan, say, news organizations. These performers may post hyperpartisan \ncontent, thereby making it more prominent on the platform. Indeed, as we \nreported in one of the Twitter chapters, mainstream news is marginalized \nnot through a lack of content moderation per se but rather by virtue of the \nabundance of hyperpartisan sources present in the posts that perform well \non the medium.\nFinally, there are methodological challenges in studying deplatform -\ning, and its connection to the misinformation problem, for the content is \nno longer available for scrutiny. It is also demanding to study demotion, \nespecially if one relies on engagement metrics to surface pertinent content \nfor study. Having been demoted, it is no longer ranked highly. One avenue \nis taken in the 4chan chapter, which ultimately deals with the extent to \nwhich an \u201calternative influence network\u201d is influential there. The researchers \nextracted the links from a 4chan board and examined the extent to which \nthey point to YouTube alt-influencers, especially on the right of the political \nspectrum. The approach may be called \u201cplatform perspectivism,\u201d whereby \none uses the data available on one platform to study another. The approach \npreviously was used to create a list of extreme YouTube videos linked from \n4chan in order to check whether they are still available on the video sharing \nplatform. Some had been deleted whereas others remained online, raising the \nquestion of the threshold for removal as well as the technique for identifica -\ntion. With respect to demotion, at the time of our study, TikTok introduced \ncontent removal or suppression policies which it later expanded to videos \nconcerning the war in Ukraine. While not explicitly undertaken in the TikTok \nstudy, its approach offers a means to study demotion. Continually archiving \nof the results of a query (as ranked video URL lists) and graphing their ranked \nafTe r Wor d: The MiSi nfor MaTion  Pr oble M a nd Th e de Pl aTf or Mi ng deba TeS 211\nplacement overtime would show whether there are any precipitous dips of \nsingle videos compared to the others in the list.\nIn conclusion, research on misinformation recalls debates about the qual -\nity of information on the internet more generally and content moderation \ndiscussions about approaches to make \u201crelevant\u201d sources rise to the top of \nsearch engine rankings (and what relevance means). The debates continued \nwith the shift in emphasis to the effects of personalization as a \u201csolution\u201d to the relevance problem. Personalization brought with it the atomization or individualization of media exposure. Individual feeds on social media, \noptimized for one\u2019s interests but also for one\u2019s trigger points (so to speak), are \nin a sense a further extension of personalization together with a more evident \naffective component, with the canonical example now being how Facebook \noptimizes for \u201cangry\u201d content or \u201cangertainment.\u201d When we find that social \nmedia, which dominates as an informational medium, is marginalizing the \nmainstream and mainstreaming the fringe, we are returning to the question \nof how to address the quality of information online but also how to handle \nthe affective dimension. These are somewhat different points of departure \nfrom the question of whether or when to deplatform misinformation, but \nthey could be re-introduced to guide the discussions.\nRichard Rogers\nAmsterdam, November\u00a02022\nReferences\nBolsover, G. and Howard, P.

temperature of public debate. Posts that exhibit agitation garner disproportionate engagement. Within this clamour, fringe sources and viewpoints are mainstreaming, and mainstream media are marginalized. This book takes up the mainstreaming of the fringe and the marginalization of the mainstream. In a cross-platform analysis of Google Web Search, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, 4chan and TikTok, we found that hyperpartisan web operators, alternative influencers and ambivalent commentators are in ascendency. The book can be read as a form of platform criticism. It puts on display the current state of information online, noting how social media platforms have taken on the mantle of accidental authorities, privileging their own on-platform performers and at the same time adjudicating between claims of what is considered acceptable discourse.\nRichard Rogers, PhD, is Professor of New Media and Digital Culture, Media \nStudies, University of Amsterdam, and Director of the Digital Methods Initiative.
