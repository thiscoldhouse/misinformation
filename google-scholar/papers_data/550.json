In the context of\nunderstanding the mesoscale of networks it is often assumed that node groups based on metadataand node groups based on connectivity patterns are intrinsically linked. This assumption isincreasingly being challenged, whereby metadata might be entirely unrelated to structure or, similarly,multiple sets of metadata might be relevant to the structure of a network in different ways. We proposethe metablox tool to quantify the relationship between a network \u2019s node metadata and its mesoscale\nstructure, measuring the strength of the relationship and the type of structural arrangement exhibitedby the metadata. We show on a number of synthetic and empirical networks that our tool distinguishesrelevant metadata and allows for this in a comparative setting, demonstrating that it can be used aspart of systematic meta analyses for the comparison of networks from different domains.\nBlock structure in networks is characterised by the grouping of nodes on the\nbasis of shared connectivity patterns1,2. Such networks can be generated by\nStochastic block models (SBMs)3which \u2014in turn \u2014c a nb eu s e da sb a s e l i n e\nmodels to infer block structure from observed networks. The latter isbecoming increasingly popular due to a number of considerable advances inthe development of SBM variants with closer resemblance of real networkstructure\n4, the introduction of \ufb02exible, nonparametric inference\napproaches5, and increasingly ef \ufb01cient inference algorithms6,7.B l o c k sm a y\ntake the shape of commonly studied me soscale structures, such as assor-\ntative communities or internally cohe sive clusters. However, other struc-\ntural arrangements on the mesoscale, such as core-periphery structures,disassortative (bipartite) structure s as well as (nested) combinations of the\nabove, are also possible, owing to the relatively general de \ufb01nition of simi-\nlarity of the SBM. It is oft en assumed that blocks \u2014whichever speci \ufb01c\nstructural arrangement they may have \u2014correspond to a latent \u2018meaning \u2019,\ni.e. some external similarity exhibited by the nodes that has made it morelikely for them to connect to other nodes in the network in a similar way, orvice versa. In practice, this \u2018meaning \u2019is often attributed to additional\ninformation on the network nodes, which we call metadata . In the literature,\nnode attributes available as part of network analyses have sometimes beenassumed to be intrinsically linked to the network \u2019s structure, an assumption\nthat\u2013as has been demonstrated on multiple occasions\n8\u201310\u2014cannot be\nreadily made.\nImagine a set of users who interact with each other on some social\nmedia platform and for whom \u2014in an idealised scenario \u2014some metadata is\nknown to us: for each user we know their preference for one of two politicalparties. We can construct a network that represents the users \u2019conversation\naround some political topic, by pla cing an edge between user nodes who\ninteracted within the context of the topic. Assume we observe homophily in\npolitical leaning (called assortativity in network science): users with shared\nparty preferences are more likely to endorse each other \u2019s content than that of\nusers who support other parties, something that has been observed in theliterature around online interactions repeatedly\n11\u201313.T h es t a t i c \u2018snapshot \u2019of\nan interaction network between these users, which might look somethinglike the toy network in Fig. 1a, would show an alignment of a partition of\nusers by party preference and one according to connectivity patterns. Wecould also say that the generative process of this network was, at least to some\nextent, likely governed by this particular set of metadata under an assorta-tivity modelling assumption.\nSuch alignment between metadata pa rtitions and block structure has\nbeen observed in social networks on many occasions\n14\u201316which may partly\nexplain the widespread assumption of an intrinsic connection between\nmetadata and node structure. Motivated also by a lack of knowledge on the\u2018real\u2019generative processes of empirical networks, node metadata has often\nbeen viewed as theground truth for the block structure of a network, to\nevaluate\n4,17,18or to improve19\u201323the performance of community detection or\nother inference algorithms. Howev er, a number of recent works in the\ncomplex networks community has challenged the notion of an intrinsicalignment between metadata and community structure\n8,9,24,25;m e t a d a t a\nmight be entirely unrelated to structure or, similarly, multiple sets ofmetadata might be relevant to the structure of a network in different ways\n10.\nWe can illustrate this on our example set of social media users for which we\n1Centre d \u2019Analyse et de Math\u00e9matique Sociales (CNRS/EHESS), 54 Bd Raspail, 75006 Paris, France.2Computational Social Science Team, Centre Marc Bloch\n(CNRS/MEAE), Friedrichstr. 191, 10117 Berlin, Germany. e-mail: lena.mangold@cnrs.fr\nCommunications Physics |           (2024) 7:331 11234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\nimagine a second set of node metadata: whether or not a user is an expert on\nthe political topic that is being discu ssed in this particular network. Assume\nthat in terms of structural features, th e network exhibits some assortativity\n(of party preference) but the network also has a relatively well connectedcore of users \u2013in which there are connections even between users of different\nparty preference \u2014and a loosely connected set of peripheral nodes. This\nstructure then corresponds to the node attribute of expert (core) vs non-e x p e r t( p e r i p h e r y ) ,a ne x a m p l eo ft h i sc a nb es e e ni nF i g . 1b. Overall, we thus\nhave two sets of metadata that are both linked to the network structure while\nexhibiting different structural arrangements.\nBesides emphasising the possible exi stence of multiple relevant meta-\ndata, this example can also be underst ood in the context of the diversity of\nlikely node partitions exhibited by r eal networks: when focusing purely on\nthe connectivity patterns in a network we can, in many cases, identifymultiple, potentially qualitatively different partitions that divide the nodesin a\u2018plausible \u2019way\n26. This, in turn, accentuates the notion that multiple sets\nof metadata can be related to the network structure, even if they divide thenetwork \u2019s nodes in very different ways. It has been demonstrated, for\nexample, that we can generate syn thetic networks whose mesoscale \u2014like\nthe one in our toy example \u2014is similarly well explained by (a) a division into\ntwo assortative communities and (b) a division into a well-connected core\nand a sparsely connected periphery\n27.B y\ufb01tting an SBM to such a network\nand sampling from the posterior distribution of partitions, we are likely to\ufb01nd two locally optimal partitions \u2014a bicommunity and a core-periphery\npartition \u2014which may be aligned with different sets of metadata. In other\nwords: not only might multiple sets of metadata be relevant to the network\nstructure in general, but they might be relevant in structurally very differ-ent ways.\nTo add to the complication, we can extend our social media thought\nexperiment by considering the \u2018reversed \u2019situation: instead of one network\nrepresenting a political discussion wi th multiple sets of metadata, we ima-\ngine multiple networks with node attrib utes of one particular type. Firstly,\nwe imagine that we are able to construct multiple networks for the same set\nof user nodes, such as networks of diff erent interaction types (e.g. endor-\nsement vs exchange of opinions) or snaps hots recorded at different points in\ntime. Secondly, we might have collect ed data on different topics from a\nvariety of categories, leading to the co nstruction of multiple topic-induced\nnetworks with different (but potenti ally overlapping) user node sets but\nshared type of metadata. To summarise and in all generality, we can divide\nour thought experiment into three scenarios worth thinking about: whenstudying social networks, we might be dealing with a situation with (I) asingle network and multiple sets of metadata, (II) one set of metadata andmultiple networks with the same user sets, and \ufb01nally (III) one set of\nmetadata and multiple networks in the same context , but with possibly\ndifferent node sets.\nHaving outlined three types of s cenarios, we come back to the ques-\ntions we might be asking to investigate metadata-block structure relation-ships: Is there a way to measure the strength of the relationship betweenmetadata and network block structure, to enable comparisons between sets\nof metadata for one given network (I) a nd multiple metadata-network pairs\n(II and III)? If a set of node attributes isrelevant to the structure of a\nparticular network, can we quantify the particular structural arrangement athand (assortativity vs some other stru cture)? Answering these questions\nrequires rigorous, statistically gr ounded methods and we argue that gen-\nerative models lend themselves particularly well in this context: they providemathematical justi \ufb01cation, help us deal with uncertainties connected to\nmodel selection and facilitate comparisons of different models and\nnetworks.\nTo our knowledge, we lack a framework that makes it possible, for a\nsingle given network and in a comparative setting for a collection ofnetworks, to appraise the relative strength of the connection betweenvarious sets of metadata and various types of intermediate-scale struc-tures. Related work that has gone furthest in this direction, and thatserves as a motivation for our measure, is that by Peel at al.\n10. The authors\ndemonstrated convincingly that multiple ground-truth partitions can beresponsible for the generation of a given network. They proposed twoseparate approaches, one to measure the statistical signi \ufb01cance of the\nmetadata-structure connection and one to explore the relationship\nbetween speci \ufb01c sets of metadata and the partition landscape of a net-\nwork. Their \ufb01rst measure (which we outline later on in this work) serves\nas apvalue and thus answers a simple yes-no question with respect to the\nsigni\ufb01cance of metadata-structure relevance; their second measure is an\ninferential approach based on SBMs, which \u2014upon visual inspection of\nthe results \u2014provides insights into the extent to which different sets of\nmetadata are related to different parts of the partition landscape of anetwork. While these measures enable an in-depth analysis of individualnetworks and their metadata, they cannot be easily used for directcomparative purposes, since the strength of metadata-structure rela-tionships cannot be measured and visual analysis is required for com-\nparative studies of multiple sets of metadata; a direct comparison\nbetween networks is also not possible. Another relevant method is a labelpropagation approach to calculate a pvalue for the signi \ufb01cance of\nmetadata and structure\n28has similar problems and thus does not lend\nitself well for large-scale comparative meta analyses of multiple networkseither.\nIn this work, we propose the metadata block structure exploration\n(metablox) tool, which utilises microcanonical SBMs and methods from\ninformation theory to quantify the connection between node metadataand the block structure of a network. Our measure exploits the feature ofthe minimum description length (MDL) principle\n29, which penalises\noverly complex models, and enables comparison across multiple sets of\nnetwork-metadata pairs with respect to the strength of the relevance of\nthe metadata to the block structure and regarding the prominenttype of block structure exhibited by the metadata. We design the\nmeasure to enable such comparative analyses for the scenarios I-IIIdiscussed above.Fig. 1 | Two partitions of a toy network. a Example\nnetwork described in main text, with nodes coloured\naccording to their block membership in the plantedbicommunity partition. bThe same example net-\nwork, with nodes coloured according to their block\nmembership in the planted core-periphery parti-\ntion.

We will refer to this\ndivision of the nodes as the metadata partition and denote it by the vector\nd={di}, where didenotes the metadata label of node i.T h ep e r h a p sm o s t\nobvious way to measure the relationsh ip between a metadata partition and\nthe block structure of a network would be to infer the optimal partition bopt\nof the network in some way and then measure the alignment between the\nmetadata partition and the optimal partition through a similarity measures=f(b\nopt,d), such as the Rand index30, variation of information31,o rp a r -\ntition overlap26. However, this approach may fail as soon as the detection\nmethod yields multiple simi larly likely partitions that are not well-aligned in\nterms of their node groups: if the metadata partition is similar to one of thehighly likely partitions that is not theoptimal one, we would not capture the\nmetadata relevance.\nInstead of directly measuring partiti on similarities, we take a Bayesian\napproach to the problem. Speci \ufb01cally, we note that in the Bayesian SBM\nframework, one generally considers the entire distribution over the possible\npartitions that could have been respons ible for generating the network under\nthe given SBM. With this in mind, we hypothesise that a metadata partitioncould \u2014in theory \u2014appear among the partitions in the posterior distribution\nof the SBM with some non-zero probability. Unfortunately, calculating theposterior distribution of the SBM exa ctly turns out to be an intractable\nproblem and one therefore needs to r esort to approximations, e.g. by\nsampling from it using an MCMC method. Since we cannot rely on \ufb01nding\nan exact copy of our metadata partition among the samples taken from theposterior, we instead take the reverse approach: we determine where in theposterior distribution the metadata partition would f a l l ,w e r ei tt oh a v eb e e n\ninferred by \ufb01tting an SBM to our observed network. The schematic in Fig. 2a\nshows an idealised partition landscape of a synthetic network (upon \ufb01tting\nan SBM) and illustrates the idea of the metadata being positioned more\nclosely \u2014in terms of description length (i.e. model \ufb01t)\u2014to a non-optimal\npartition than to the optimal partition; in panels 2band2c,w es h o ws i d e -\nby-side the approach of directly measuring partition similarities describeda b o v ea n dt h ea p p r o a c hw ew i l lb et a k i n gi nt h i sw o r k ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .Microcanonical SBMs and description length . To lay the groundwork\nfor this approach, we \ufb01rst outline the microcanonical SBM framework\nand its connection to the concept of description length, which we will useto quantify the metadata relevance. We focus on the so-called degree-\ncorrected SBM\n4, which con \ufb01gures an ensemble of networks with block\nstructure, while making it possible to take into account heterogeneousdegree distributions (in contrast to the traditional SBM). For a networkwith Nnodes and Bblocks, it is parameterised by an N-dimensional block\nmembership vector b={b\ni}, a degree sequence k={ki}, and a B\u00d7Bedge\ncount matrix e={ers}. In its microcanonical form, the degree sequence\nand edge count matrix are speci \ufb01edexactly , making it possible to count\nthe number of possible networks that can be generated with a set ofparameters, so that the likelihood P(A\u2223k,e,b), i.e. the probability of\nobserving a network Agiven the SBM parameters, can be calculated as\n\u03a9(k,e,b)\n\u22121, the inverse of the ensemble cardinality32. When using a\nparametric framework to detect the optimal partition from a network,\none would \ufb01nd the partition bthat maximises the log-likelihood, which\namounts to minimising the microcanonical entropy S\u00bcln\u03a9\u00f0k;e;b\u00de32,33.\nIn the nonparametric approach \u2014which allows for the number of\nmodel parameters to be inferred from the data \u2013, one considers the joint\ndistribution of the generative model, including the notion of priors on themodel parameters in addition to the model likelihood. The hard constraintsof the microcanonical approach imply that one does not need to sum overthe remaining parameters to calculat e the marginal likelihood. The joint\ndistribution can therefore be written as P(A,k,e,b)=P(A\u2223k,e,b)P(k\u2223e,b)\nP(e\u2223b)P(b). This is where an information theoretical lens lets us write\nP(A,k,e,b)=e\n\u2212\u03a3,w h e r e \u03a3\u00bc/C0 lnP\u00f0Ajk;e;b\u00de/C0lnP\u00f0k;e;b\u00deis called the\ndescription length of the data: the amount of information necessary todescribe a network given a model plus t he information required to describe\nthe model itself, via its parameters\n5. Maximising the posterior distribution is\ntherefore equivalent to minimising the SBM description length, which \u2014in\nturn \u2014is the same as \ufb01nding the partition which provides the most compact\ncompression of the network and therefore amounts to being the best model.\nSimilarly, one can identify the more likely of two partitions b1andb2(under\nSBM variants m1and m2respectively) by comparing the network \u2019s\ndescription length for each of them, which amounts to calculating theirp o s t e r i o ro d d sr a t i o .F o r \u03a3\n1<\u03a32, for example, partition b1(under variant\nm1) is the more likely of the two (see the \u201cMethods \u201dsection for a detailed\nexplanation). Note that we use descri p t i o nl e n g t ha st h eb a s i sf o rm o d e l\nselection (i.e. \ufb01n d i n gt h eb e s tm o d e lb yp e n a l i s i n go v e r l yc o m p l e xm o d e l l i n g\nchoices) since it is the natural choice w hen considering a posterior inference\nframework, but in certain circumstan ces other possible model selection\ncriteria could be considered as well. In particular, we favour it over popularexisting information criteria (such as AIC\n34and BIC35), which are built on\nassumptions that do not hold for com parisons between the standard and\ndegree-corrected SBM36. Another commonly used model selection\napproach is cross-validation, which is widely used in machine learning and\ncertain network science applications that allow for splitting the data into test\nand training sets (e.g. link prediction ). While cross-validation can help reject\nmodels that are overly complex by favouring those that generalise better tounseen data, it is not inherently designed to penalise model complexity asdirectly as criteria like description length.\nMeasuring metadata relevance . To tie in these concepts with our\nmetablox measure, we realise that one can simply count the nodes in eachmetadata block (i.e. those that share the same metadata category), and the\nedges within and between them, and arrive at quantities that areequivalent to the parameters of the microcanonical SBM. Given themetadata partition by d, we denote the edge counts within and between\nmetadata blocks by e\n0. By plugging the quantities derived from the\nmetadata and from the observed network into the SBM description\nlength calculations \u2014which, in the microcanonical case, can be done\nexactly by using combinatorics5\u2014we can straightforwardly calculate \u03a3m\nd,\nthe description length of the network under the metadata partition dand\na given SBM variant m. In this work, we use the description length\ndescription length di erence partition similarity\nf(      ,      ) \n- Description lengthOptimal \npartitionMetadata\nFig. 2 | Schematic of a partition landscape. a Partition landscape10,26for a toy\nnetwork, with the negative description length on the vertical axis, for which we have\nhighlighted the positions of the optimal inferred partition (blue/red), a second\npartition (blue/red), and a metadata partition d(purple/green). bApproach of\nmeasuring partition similarity directly. cProposed metablox approach, of measuring\nthe distance of the network \u2019s description length under the metadata partition from\nthe network \u2019s description length under the optimal partition.https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-024-01819-y Article\nCommunications Physics |           (2024) 7:331 3\ncalculations from existing work5, which we provide in the \u201cMethods \u201d\nsection.

We therefore also separately \ufb01tt h eS B Mv a r i a n t mto our\nobserved network (ignoring the met adata labels), using the graph-tool\nlibrary37, and compute the description length \u03a3m\noptof the optimal partition.\nWe can then simply calculate the description length difference of the twoquantities, \u0394\u03a3\u00bc\u03a3\nm\nd/C0\u03a3m\noptto understand how well the metadata partition\n\ufb01ts the given network, compared to the optimal partition: if \u0394\u03a3is close to\nzero we conclude that the metadata parti tion is strongly relevant to the block\nstructure; if \u0394\u03a3\u226b0, the metadata partition \ufb01ts the network much less well\nthan the optimal partition, under the SBM variant m. Note that for better\nreadability, we dropped the superscript mfor\u0394\u03a3=\u0394\u03a3m.\nStatistical signi \ufb01cance and comparability . There are two major\ncaveats of quantifying the metadata relevance by simply using \u0394\u03a3:\ndescription length increases with growing networks size, which meansthat simply taking the absolute description length difference does notenable inter-network comparisons and we therefore need to normalisethe measure in some way. Furthermore, we need to include a notion ofstatistical signi \ufb01cance, to ensure that the \ufb01t of the metadata partition is, in\nfact, better than a partition we would \ufb01nd at random. We address both\ncaveats at once by turning our measure into a ratio and including a\ndistinction from randomness as follows: additionally to \u03a3\nm\ndwe calculate\nthe description lengths of the same network under an SBM with multiplesets of randomised metadata. Each time we randomise the nodes \u2019meta-\ndata labels, we can plug in the resulting quantities d\n*(the randomised\nmetadata partition) and e*(the edge counts between and within the nodes\nin each randomised metadata category) in the description length for-mulas again. This approach is inspired by the blockmodel entropy sig-ni\ufb01cance test (BESTest)\n10, which produces a metadata pvalue, i.e. the\nprobability that a randomised version of the observed metadata describesthe network better than (or equally well as) the observed metadata. TheBESTest pvalue is calculated by generating a large set of randomised\nmetadata partitions (whereby the number of elements in each metadata\ncategory is \ufb01xed), computing the SBM entropy under each of the ran-\ndomised partitions, and \ufb01nally comparing the SBM entropy under the\nobserved metadata partition to that of the randomised partitions.However, SBM entropy decreases for an increasing number of groupswhich greatly complicates direct comparison of metadata models (i.e.different metadata partitions and/or different SBM variants). Descriptionlength enables model selection and can thus be used to compare differentpartitions, whether induced by metadata categories or inferred based onconnectivity patterns.\nInstead of calculating a pvalue from distributions of description\nlengths, we identify the randomised metadata description length \u03a3\nm\n/C3,w h i c h\n\u2014for a signi \ufb01cance level of \u03b1=0 . 0 1 \u2014is equal to the \ufb01rst percentile of the\ndescription length distribution of the randomised metadata partitions under\nSBM variant m. The choice of \u03b1is, to some extent, arbitrary; here, we make\nthe choice based on conventions in measuring statistical signi \ufb01cance,\naccording to which \u03b1= 0.01 denotes strong evidence against the null\nhypothesis, i.e. that the network is described equally well by randomisedmetadata. We emphasise that other c hoices can be made when our measure\nis used, as the required level of signi \ufb01cance may depend on the speci \ufb01c\ncontext. In our measure, we take \u03a3\nm\n/C3to be the maximum description length\nfor which we would still conside r the description length of the observed\nmetadata to be relevant, and we use it to normalise \u0394\u03a3by\u0394\u03a3/C3\u00bc\u03a3m\n/C3/C0\u03a3m\nopt.\nProbing structural arrangement . Before we put these components\ntogether, we note that we can use the above approach to formulate ameasure that not only quanti \ufb01es metadata relevance but that also helps us\nprobe for speci \ufb01ctypes of structural arrangements of the metadata blocks:Since we can follow the above procedure for any SBM variant for which\nthere is a microcanonical formulation with a straightforward descriptionlength calculation, we can directly plug in the structure-speci \ufb01c SBM\nvariant of interest. In this work, we focus on three SBM variants that are\nspeci\ufb01c to three different types of block structures, which we brie \ufb02y\noutline in the following. In the \u2018standard \u2019SBM (i.e. non-degree-corrected,\nNDC), the placement of an edge between two nodes depends solely on theblock membership of each node and on the probability of two nodes fromthe two blocks being connected. Similar to the random graph model, onemajor drawback of this model is that the generative process producesnetworks that have blocks within which node degrees are Poisson dis-tributed. To overcome this caveat, that makes the model unlike many realnetworks whose node degrees often have power-law degree distributions,the degree-corrected variant (DC) \u2014which we introduced above to\nmotivate out approach \u2014was proposed\n4. In this variant, edge placement\ndepends on node degrees as well as block membership, thus accounting\nfor heterogeneous degree distributions. A third variant we include in ouranalysis is the assortative \u2018planted partition \u2019SBM (PP), which \u2013as part of\nthe generative process \u2014assumes assortativity\n38. The description length\nformulations for the three variants used in our measure are based on thework in refs. 5,32,38, as detailed in the \u201cMethods \u201dsection.\nNote that we are focusing here on undirected graphs, so that any\nnetwork for which our measure is used has to be treated as such. Anextension of our measure to directed ne tworks is straightforward and should\nbe considered as part of future research.\nMeasure .W e \ufb01nally put together these components to create the meta-\ndata block structure exploration (metablox) tool, which produces thevector \u03b3\ndfor a metadata partition d, where each element represents the\nmetadata relevance under a different SBM variant m. It can consist of as\nmany elements as we include SBM variants to probe for different structuralarrangements. Here, we will work with the three variants outlined above(DC, NDC, and PP), thus \u03b3\ndis a vector with three elements. For a metadata\npartition d, the metablox vector \u03b3dthus consists of elements\n\u03b3m\nd\u00bc\u0394\u03a3m\n\u0394\u03a3m\n/C3\u00bc\u03a3m\nd/C0\u03a3m\nopt\n\u03a3m\n/C3/C0\u03a3m\nopt\u00f01\u00de\nfor each SBM variant m. In summary, \u03a3m\ndis the description length of\nmetadata partition dunder model m,\u03a3m\n/C3is the randomised metadata\ndescription length, and \u03a3m\noptis the description length of the optimal partition\nof the network. Recall that the differe nce in description length between two\nmodels is equal to the log of the posterior odds ratio of the two models. Thenumerator of \u03b3\nm\ndthus measures how much more likely the optimal partition\nis compared to the metadata partition under model m. Similarly, the\ndenominator represents how much more likely the optimal partition is tothe randomised metadata partitions under all models. The total measure isthe former normalised by the latter.\nWith this de \ufb01nition, each element can then be interpreted as follows:\nfor\u03b3\nm\nd\u22651 we say that this set of metadata is not relevant to the structure\nunder model m, since more than 1% of the randomised metadata partitions\ncompress the network more ef \ufb01ciently than our observed metadata, under\nthe given model. For \u03b3m\nd< 1, the metadata is relevant to the structure under\nthe given model, and the closer \u03b3m\ndis to 0, the stronger the relevance of the set\nof metadata to the block structure and the closer the structural arrangementof the metadata to the typical type of structure generated under the givenmodel m. Another way of interpreting \u03b3\nm\ndis: relative to the best compression\nwe can \ufb01nd, how ef \ufb01cient is the compression of the observed metadata d\nunder mcompared to partitioning the network by randomised versions of\nthe metadata.\nLimitations and network compressibility . One limitation of our\napproach is that the inequality \u03b3m1\nd<\u03b3m2\ndfor a network with some meta-\ndata partition dmerely indicates that the metadata dis relatively closer to\nthe best partition under model m1than to the best partition under modelhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-024-01819-y Article\nCommunications Physics |           (2024) 7:331 4\nm2. It does not necessarily mean that the block structure of our network as\na whole is optimally explained by m1: since our measure is a ratio of\ndescription length differences, it is possible that in fact \u03a3m1\nopt>\u03a3m2\noptor that\nthe model m2provides a better explanation for the network overall. This\nlimitation arises from the comparative nature of the measure, which\ninherently focuses on relative rather than absolute \ufb01t to enable com-\nparisons across metadata and networks.\nAnother limitation is related to the case of inter-network comparison,\nin particular in the context of different network topology. While metablox isrobust with respect to the number of nodes in a network (see the \u201cMethods \u201d\nsection), certain aspects of a network \u2019s topology do affect the measured\nmetadata relevance. Let us assume that we are comparing two node\nattributed networks AandA\n0, with the signal in the community structure of\nnetwork Abeing signi \ufb01cantly stronger than that of network A0(i.e. the\ncommunities of network Aare more clearly separated). All other things\nbeing equal \u2014including the level of alignment of the metadata partition with\nthe optimal detected partition \u2013we will have \u03b3<\u03b30.S i n c e \u03a3m\noptdecreases when\nthe network becomes more compressible due to a stronger signal in theblock structure, \u0394\u03a3*increases (since \u03a3\nm\n/C3does not decrease with \u03a3m\nopt)a n d\ndoes so more quickly than \u0394\u03a3. This apparent con \ufb02ation of block structure\nsignal strength and metadata block-structure relevance points to a questionaround the de \ufb01nition of this \u2018relevance \u2019, which in turn relates back to our\nearlier point of going beyond the direct measurement of partition alignment.We argue that the concept of measuring the relevance of metadata to blockstructure in fact should include the notion of block structure strength: we do\nnot want to retrieve the same \u03b3for the described networks AandA\n0merely\nbecause there is alignment of metadata partition and optimal partition.\nInstead, the relevance of the metadata should be quanti \ufb01ed as stronger (i.e., a\nlower \u03b3) when the network exhibits more signi \ufb01cant block structure.\nThe elements of the measure that lead to these limitations are part of the\ndesign that enables comparative work and what enables the measure tocapture metadata-structure relations hips in the intended way. However, there\nmight be reasons for a researcher using this measure to require insights \u2013\nalongside the metablox vector \u03b3\nd\u2013into the absolute \ufb01to ft h eo p t i m a lp a r -\ntition, which acts as the main point of co mparison in the partition landscape,\nor to disentangle block structure signal and metadata partition correlation. Toaccount for this, the edge compression c\nm\u00bc\u03a3m\nopt=Ecan be referred to as a\nsecond dimension in our measure, which quanti \ufb01es the absolute compression\nof the optimal partition per network edge. It can serve as a point of referencefor the structure of the optimal partition and help us understand how much of\u03b3is explained by correlation vs compre ssibility of the network under a given\nmodel. In the \u201cMethods \u201dsection we include an analysis of the sensitivity of\nour measure to network topology and the role of the second dimension.\nSimulations\nWe now summarise the metablox pipel ine and state the choices we make for\nany calculation of \u03b3din the remainder of this work: We calculate \u03a3m\ndbyplugging the required quantities, as obtained by the metadata partition d,\ninto the description length formulas for SBM variant m.F o r\u03a3m\nopt,w eu s et h e\ngraph-tool library to \ufb01tv a r i a n t mto the observed network and \ufb01nd the\npartition bm\noptthat minimises the description length, re \ufb01ning the result of the\nagglomerative algorithm by running 1000 sweeps of the merge- \ufb02ip MCMC7.\nWe calculate \u03a3m\n/C3by performing 500 permutations of the metadata labels,\ncalculating the description length of the network under each of them, and\ufb01nding the description length for which only 1% of permutations have a\nlower description length.\nSynthetic network . To illustrate the metablox measure, we generate a\nnetwork with multiple, non-aligned, plausible explanations in terms of itsblock structure, create multiple sets of synthetic metadata and calculatemetablox on two dimensions: under a degree-corrected (DC) and aplanted partition (PP) SBM. More speci \ufb01cally, we generate the network\nwith the Stochastic cross block model (SCBM)\n27, which facilitates the\ngeneration of such networks with \u2018ambiguous \u2019mesoscales structures, by\n\u2018planting \u2019(similar to the planted partition model39) multiple coexisting\npartitions. We use the SCBM to generate a network with N= 100 nodes,\nB= 2 blocks and expected degree k= 10. We plant two coexisting parti-\ntions, so that the network exhibits bicommunity (BC) structure (i.e. twoassortative communities) as well as core-periphery (CP) structure (seethe\u201cMethods \u201dsection for details on how this network was constructed).\nFigure 1shows this network in two separate visualisations, with nodes\npainted according to their block membership in the BC partition inFig.1a and according to their block membership in the CP partition in\nFig.1b. We also generate multiple sets of synthetic metadata, in a way\nsuch that the labels align with the block structure of the network tovarying degrees, similar to related work\n10. We correlate half of the syn-\nthetic metadata with the BC partition and the other half with the CPpartition, with varying level of correlation \u03c1. The metadata label of each\nnode is equal to the node \u2019s block assignment of the planted structure with\nprobability (1 +\u03c1)/2. We increase \u03c1from 0 to 1 at steps of 0.01, yielding a\ntotal of 202 sets of metadata, half of which being \u2018bicommunity-like \u2019and\nthe other half being \u2018core-periphery-like \u2019.\nIn Fig. 3, each dot represents one set of metadata dfor which we are\nplotting \u03b3\nDC\ndand\u03b3PP\ndfor increasing correlation \u03c1, for the bicommunity-like\nmetadata (Fig. 3a) and the core-periphery-like metadata (Fig. 3b). For Fig. 3\nonly, we additionally calculate the BESTest pv a l u et oi l l u s t r a t et h ec o n -\ntribution of metablox compared to t he most similar existing measure10.\nFor the bicommunity-like metadata, we can see that both dimensions\nof\u03b3are a decreasing function of the correlation \u03c1: the more strongly cor-\nrelated the metadata, the higher the relevance assigned to it by the metabloxmeasure. As expected, we cannot make a distinction between the general(DC) and assortative (PP) SBM variant, since \u2014by design \u2014the metadata in\nthis case is similar to the block structure that was created under an assor-tativity assumption. For core-per iphery-like metadata, however, \u03b3\nDC\nd\nFig. 3 | Metablox and BESTest values for a synthetic network.

Both panels show an increasing correlation \u03c1between\nmetadata and block structure on the x-axis.https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-024-01819-y Article\nCommunications Physics |           (2024) 7:331 5\ndecreases similarly to the previous case, while \u03b3PP\ndis now an increasing\nfunction of \u03c1, suggesting that \u2014as we know is true \u2014if we were to assume\nthat this metadata was responsible for ge nerating this network, assortativity\nwould be much less likely to explain its structure.\nFor comparison, we observe that the BESTest values become non-\ndistinguishable once the correlation \u03c1has crossed a certain threshold.\nWhen the SBM entropy under a given metadata partition is lower than\nthe SBM entropy under allsets of randomised metadata partitions then\nthepvalue is 1/ np(where npis the number of randomised metadata\npartitions) and we cannot compare this metadata to another set ofmetadata for which this is also true. For example, BESTest does not allowus to compare a metadata partition that is nearly perfectly correlated withthe planted block structure, to one for which \u03c1= 0.7, in both the\nbicommunity and core-periphery case. For comparison, the metabloxvalues for DC cross the signi \ufb01cance line \u03b3= 1 at a similar point as\nBESTest becomes signi \ufb01cant, for both the bicommunity and core-\nperiphery-like metadata. However, it proceeds in the shape of a con-tinuous decreasing function with a minimum of 0 at \u03c1= 1, which is what\nwe would expect as the metadata partition is equal to the planted block\nstructure at this point. The \ufb01rst contribution of metablox is therefore\nthat, by comparing the metadata partition to the optimal partition (while\nstill taking into account statistical signi \ufb01cance), we are able to make\ndirect comparisons between metadata sets. The second contribution isillustrated by the fact that BESTest does not tell us anything about likelystructural arrangements of the metadata, while the difference between thetrajectory of \u03b3\nPP\ndon the left and right \ufb01gure demonstrate the way in which\nmetablox does allow for this.\nWe also apply the metablox measure to three real-world networks, in\neach case referring to one of the three scenarios (I-III) introduced above. As\noutlined previously, our measure can be extended to include any number of\nstructure-speci \ufb01c SBMs. For our applications to real networks, we focus on\nthe non-degree-corrected (NDC), the degree-corrected (DC), and theassortative \u2018planted partition \u2019(PP) SBM. This means that we calculate a\nthree-dimensional metablox vector for every network-metadata pair.\nApplication: law \ufb01rm.W e \ufb01rst demonstrate our method on a number of\nnetworks from the Lazega law \ufb01rm networks collection40. In this collec-\ntion, there are three different networks among the same set of nodes, inwhich edges represents different types of connections between theemployees of a corporate law \ufb01rm: coworkers, friendship, and advice. For\nthe employees, we have \ufb01ve sets of node attributes - their status in the\n\ufb01rm, gender, the of \ufb01ce in which they work, which type of law they\npractice, and which law school they attended. Figure 4shows the meta-\nblox results for the three networks, each on a separate panel. On eachpanel, we show the results for the respective network and compare the \ufb01ve\ndifferent metadata partitions. Each panel thus represents a case ofscenario I, while we can also compare network-metadata pairs which\nshare a type of node attribute by comparing across panels (scenario II).Note that we have highlighted the SBM variant which gave the best peredge compression with a red marker. We can see some considerablevariation in how the sets of metadata are related to the networks \u2019block\nstructure under each of the SBM variants. Firstly, we observe that thestrongest metadata-block structure relevance can be observed between\nthe type of law practiced by an employee and the block structure in the\nadvice network, under an assortative SBM assumption. This implies thatemployees are more likely to seek advice from colleagues who practice thesame type of law as themselves. The same set of metadata is also stronglyrelevant in the cowork network. However, in the friendship network thelaw practiced by an employee does not seem relevant to the formation ofblocks under any of the SBM variants. Employees \u2019status, on the other\nhand, is the most strongly relevant metadata out of all attributes we havefor the friendship network, under PP and DC. This indicates that adivision of the network \u2019s nodes into the two available categories (partner\nand associate) in this set of metadata is more strongly aligned with a\nplausible partition according to shared connectivity patterns in the net-\nwork, under the modelling assumptions of both PP and DC. In otherwords, the nodes that share a metadata attribute (partner or associate) arenot only likely to share connectivity patterns independent of their nodedegrees (DC), they are also more likely to connect to employees withwhom they share the status than with others (PP). Status matters less inthe advice network (albeit still signi \ufb01cantly relevant) and is essentially\nirrelevant in the cowork network. The of \ufb01ce in which employees were\nlocated is the only set of metadata that is highly relevant for all threenetworks, indicating that the physical location of employees \u2019plays a large\nrole in determining connections. Both employees \u2019gender and the law\nschool they attended are not related to the block structure under any SBM\nvariant and therefore appear to be essentially irrelevant in the tie gen-eration process. In this example, we have been able to both comparedifferent sets of metadata for a given network (scenario I) as well asdifferent networks with the same node set and shared metadata (sce-nario II).\nPeel at al.\n10used the same networks to demonstrate both of their\nmethods, which we outlined above. Using the BESTest signi \ufb01cance test, they\nreached similar conclusions for the network-metadata pairs. Using a secondmethod \u2013which admittedly relies on visual interpretation and does not\nexplicitly serve to compare the strength of metadata relevance \u2014the authors\nconcluded that for the friendship n etwork, the law school attended by\nemployees was more strongly structure-relevant than the of \ufb01ce in which\nemployees are located. This \ufb01nding is the opposite of that given by metablox.\nWhile the methods proposed by the abov e authors can provide insights into\nthe signi \ufb01cance of metadata relevance and the quality of the relationship for\na given network-metadata pair, they do not enable a direct quanti \ufb01cation ofFig. 4 | Metablox values for multiple metadata on law \ufb01rm networks.

As a\nresult, they also do not enable a direct comparison of different networks(either made up of different or the same node sets), something our measureis designed to do as shown in the following paragraphs.\nApplication: impact investing . We continue with a second example for\nscenario II, in which we investigate the metadata-block structure rela-\ntionship in Twitter/X retweet networks of users discussing the topic of\u2018impact investing \u2019\n41. In October 2021 we exhaustively collected tweets\nmentioning any term belonging to a small subset of hashtags directlyrelevant to this topic. This amounted to 1.89 m tweets published byaround 300k accounts since 2007. We deemed users who posted less thana tweet a month on average or who never posted more than one year apartto be insuf \ufb01ciently active in that \ufb01eld and \ufb01ltered them, leading to a core\nset of around 16k users. We subsequently inferred likely home countriesfrom the geolocation voluntarily shared by users in their pro \ufb01le\ndescription. Most users appeared to come from an English-speaking\ncountry: countries with at least 1000 active accounts include only the US,\nCanada, Australia and the United Kingdom, covering 72% of the data.Focusing on these country users, we eventually study 13 static networksrepresenting each a snapshot for each year between 2009 and 2021 (weexcluded 2007 and 2008 which yielded trivial networks)\n42.\nThis time, the edges in the differen t networks represent the same type\nof interaction at different moments in time. The metadata here is thecountry which the user declares being located in and which we consider tobe\ufb01xed over time, being inferred at the moment of data collection in 2021.\nWe calculated the three metablox dimensions for each network snapshotand also highlighted, for each network, the SBM variant that provided the\nbest compression per edge for its optimal partition. In Fig. 5a, we can see that\nthe country in which a user is located s tarts being relevant to the network \u2019s\nblock structure in 2010, under all SBM variants but most strongly under PP.\nIn the next \ufb01ve years (until 2015) the metadata becomes more strongly\nrelevant in general and assortativity r emains the prominent arrangement of\nthe metadata. In 2016, there seems to be a change in the structural orga-nisation of the network in relation to the metadata: the country in which\nusers are located remains relevant to the block structure but in 2017 and\n2018, PP is replaced by DC as the best \ufb01t for the metadata, before it swaps\nagain starting in 2019 up until the last year of data collection. It is worthnoting that for each year, DC is the S BM variant for which the optimal\ninferred partition provided the bes t compression. Overall, the quanti \ufb01cation\nof the relevance of the metadata afford ed by metablox enables us to observe\nchanges over time that should serve as a starting point to \u2018zoom into \u2019the\nnetworks for those particular events to gain a deeper understanding of therelationship between the users \u2019location and their tweeting behaviour: the\nchange from 2009 to 2010 when the country user location becomessigni\ufb01cant, the years 2014 and 2019 when the metadata is most strongly\nrelevant under PP; and the years 2016 \u20132018, in which the networks seem to\nexhibit a change in the metadata-structure relationship.\nApplication: Twitter/X . In our \ufb01nal example, we proceed with another\nset of networks created from Twitter/X, this time demonstrating meta-\nblox for networks in the same context and not necessarily with the same\nset of nodes (scenario III). In particular, we use data from three debates onpolitical topics in the US, for which we are studying the metadata-blockstructure relationship for the same type of node attributes. The tweetsfrom which these networks were created were collected between 2015 and2016, and are based on conversations on abortion, Obamacare, and guncontrol\n43,44. In all three networks, the available node metadata re \ufb02ects two\ncategories of political orientation as either liberal or conservative. Theliberal-conservative opinion categories are based on a continuous scorebetween \u20131 and+1 that were calculated\n44based on a method that uses\nURLs shared by Twitter accounts and the categorisation of websites\nbehind these URLs on https://mediabiasfactcheck.com45. The two cate-\ngories used as node metadata are based on users below and above a\u2018neutral \u2019score of 0. Note that we do not know to what extent there is\nan overlap between the set of users participating in the debates repre-sented by the three networks, neither do we care; here, the subject ofcomparison is the topic that is discussed in each network and to whatextent the political stance of users is related to the block structure foreach topic.\nIn Fig. 5b, we plot the metablox vectors for these interaction networks\nwith binary political ori entation metadata. We observe that for the topics of\ngun control and abortion, the metadata partition into liberals and con-\nservatives is relevant under all variants but most strongly under PP, while\nDC provides \u2014again \u2014the best overall \ufb01t. For the obamacare network, the\nmetadata is barely relevant under NDC and not signi \ufb01cantly relevant under\nthe other variants. We can conclude th at for gun control and abortion, the\nmetadata partitions were likely to be at least somewhat related to the edge\ngenerating process and that assortativity is the prominent structuralarrangement of the metadata in those cases. Our \ufb01ndings seem equivalent to\nprevious \ufb01ndings on polarisation levels in these networks, which classi \ufb01ed\nall three networks to be polarised to some extent with the Obamacarenetwork being the least polarised\n44. Similar to our work, their polarisation\nmeasure also considers both network structure as well as a metadata\ndimension. However, their measure co nsiders continuous node attributes \u2014\nspeci\ufb01cally political ideology on a continuous left-right scale \u2014and specia-\nlises on measuring polari sation rather than the more general approach we\ntake here. So although our measure has a different purpose, it might be ableto pick up speci \ufb01c network properties (such as polarisation or fragmenta-\ntion) while also being general enough to enable broader comparisons.Fig. 5 | Metablox values for multiple Twitter/X networks.

Our metabloxpipeline, which produces the vector \u03b3, is designed to provide insights into the\nrelevance of metadata to a network \u2019s block structure and the likely structural\narrangement in various scenarios: fo r the comparison of multiple sets of\nmetadata for one given network (scenario I) and to compare the metadata-block structure relationships for entire collections of networks that share thesame type of metadata, for networks that have the same node set (scenarioII) and for networks within the same context (scenario III).\nWe have demonstrated the metablox measure on a synthetic network\nand applied it to a number of real networks, including the Lazega law \ufb01rm\nnetworks and networks representing d ifferent social media debates. The\nresults reveal variations in the relevance of metadata partitions to blockstructure, and the likely structural arra ngement, therefore providing insights\ninto the underlying dynamics of these networks. By covering examples from\nthe three scenarios (I-III), we have demonstrated that our measure allows fora comprehensive inter- and intra-network comparison, enabling research-ers to quickly identify networks where speci \ufb01c metadata partitions are\nclosely related to structure or where certain structural arrangements are\nlikely or unlikely un der the metadata.\nWe have discussed a number of limitations of the measure, related to\nthe speci \ufb01c design of metablox as a comparative measure, and proposed\nways to address these. Additional limitations are connected with the speci \ufb01c\ntype of node attributes for which relevance can be measured. In itscurrent framework, metablox can only quantify the relevance of non-\noverlapping categorical metadata, while overlapping, real-valued or multi-\ndimensional metadata cannot be evalu a t e d .F o rt h ec a s eo fo v e r l a p p i n g\nmetadata, it is conceivable that an o verlapping SBM variant may be used.\nFor real-valued and multidimensional metadata, the options are less clear.\nWe therefore see a possible research dir ection in an alternative version of the\nmetablox tool for real-valued metadata . While this clearly requires a number\nof non-trivial decisions with respect to suitable generative models, providing\nan equivalent measure for non-discrete metadata seems a valuableextension.\nOther potential research directions evolve around the particular type of\nstructural arrangements of metadata categories. Currently, we focus on\ndegree-corrected (DC), non-degree-co rrected (NDC), and planted partition\n(PP) Stochastic block models. Howe ver, networks often exhibit more\ncomplex structural arrangements beyond these models and so might theirmetadata. Future work could explore the integration of other SBM variantsthat are tailored to speci \ufb01c structural motifs, such as core-periphery struc-\ntures, bipartite structures or nested patterns. The current measure has beenimplemented for undirected graphs, but extensions to more complex net-work structures such as directed graphs are straightforward and should also\nbe considered as part of future research.\nOur measure has the potential to ser ve as a tool for conducting large-\nscale comparisons of collections of n etwork-metadata pairs, for networks\ncoming from a variety of research \ufb01elds \u2013as long as categorical node\nmetadata is available. Obvious examples are: different types of social net-works, for which metadata may include a range of demographics oraf\ufb01liations; biological networks such as gene regulatory networks, protein-\nprotein interaction networks, and ecological networks with metadata relatedto genes, proteins, or species; economic and \ufb01nancial networks, such as trade\nnetworks, supply chains, and stock ma rket networks, for which metadata\nmay relate to industries, sectors, or companies; or networks from science ofscience, where networks represent collaborations and knowledge \ufb02ows, and\nmetadata may include \ufb01elds of scienti \ufb01cr e s e a r c h .\nMethods\nData compression & microcanonical SBMs\nTo justify the use of description length as part of the metablox formulation,\nwe expand on the Results section in the main text and more throughlyexplain the minimum description le ngth (MDL) principle and its rela-\ntionship with microcanonical SBMs. MDL is a model selection criterionaccording to which one should favour the model that achieves the smallest\ncompression of the data. The idea behin d this is that compression is possible\nwhen we \ufb01nd regularities in the data which, in turn, means that we \u2018learn \u2019\nabout patterns in the data\n29. MDL is sometimes described as a formal\ninterpretation of Occam \u2019sr a z o r \u2014also known as the principle of parsimony\n\u2013which is the idea that one should try to \ufb01nd the explanation with the\nsmallest number of assumptions possi ble. In more formal terms, the best\nhypothesis H(e.g. a model with its parameters) for a data set D,i st h eo n e\nthat minimises the sum S(H)+S(D\u2223H), where S(D\u2223H) is the amount of\ninformation required to describe the data Dwhen it has been encoded with\nthe hypothesis Hand S(H) is the amount of information necessary to\ndescribe the hypothesis itself. This demonstrates the \u2018automatic \u2019over\ufb01tting-\nprevention property of MDL, which makes it an attractive model selectioncriterion: with a more complex hypothesis, we need less information todescribe the data given the hypothesis, but we need more information to\ndescribe the hypothesis itself.\nThere is a strong relationship between MDL and Bayesian inference in\ngeneral\n29and the Bayesian interpretation of the SBM more speci \ufb01cally,\nwhere it was \ufb01rst used to infer network part itions without knowing the\nnumber of blocks in advance46. To calculate the description length of a\nnetwork under a particular model, one needs to derive the entropy of theindividual components of the SBM, w hich is an ensemble of networks that\ncan be generated from a set of parameters (i.e. the partition). In general,microcanonical network ensembles \u2014for which structural constraints need\nto be satis \ufb01e de x a c t l yr a t h e rt h a no na v e r a g e \u2014can be described by their\nentropy S\u00bcln\u03a9\u00f0\u03b8\u00de,w h e r e \u03a9(\u03b8) is the total number of networks that can be\ngenerated under the given set of parameters \u03b8\n33. The higher the entropy of a\nnetwork ensemble, the more \u2018disordered \u2019(or\u2018random \u2019) is the ensemble.\nMore concretely, let us assume that we have a network Agenerated by a\nmodel with parameter set \u03b8.P(A\u2223\u03b8) is the probability of observing the\nnetwork Ain an ensemble generated by the model with these parameters\n(i.e. the likelihood) and we assume t h a ta l ln e t w o r k so c c u rw i t ht h es a m e\nprobability P\u00f0Aj\u03b8\u00de\u00bc1\n\u03a9\u00f0\u03b8\u00de. From this assumption, one can straightforwardly\nmake a connection between the microcanonical entropy Sand the log-\nlikelihood: L\u00bclnP\u00bc/C0 ln\u03a9\u00f0\u03b8\u00de\u00bc/C0 S32. By minimising the entropy Sone\ncould therefore \ufb01nd the maximum likelihood parameters, such as the most\nlikely partition, given an observed n etwork. While maximum likelihood\nmethods work well in many cases, in the particular case of model selection\nwith SBMs, maximum likelihood estimation can lead to over \ufb01tting if the\nnumber of model parameters is not \ufb01xed. For example, if the number of\nblocks Bis not known, minimising the entropy would lead to the trivial\npartition of every node being its own block, i.e. B=N,w h e r e Nis the number\nof nodes. Peixoto proposed the MDL pri nciple as part of a microcanonical\nnonparametric approach to SBM inference, to address the over \ufb01tting issue\nand enable the use of \ufb02exible priors and hyperpriors on the model\nparameters5,46.S p e c i \ufb01cally, this means considering the full joint distribution\nof the network and the SBM model pa rameters as part of the inference\nprocess, rather than just the SBM likelihood, which can be interpreted as\ncalculating the description length of the network under the given model, via\nits parameters.\nWe recall that for a network Aof size Nwith Eedges, we denote the\ndegree of a node ibyki, and we use the following notation for the parameters\nof a microcanonical SBM with Bblocks. The block assignments of the nodes\nis denoted by the vector b={bi}o fl e n g t h N,t h e B\u00d7Bmatrix e={ers}\nrepresents the edge counts within and between two blocks rands(with twice\nthe number of edges on the diagonal, as is convention), and the B-dimen-\nsional vector n={nr} describes the number of nodes in each block r.T h ef u l l\njoint distribution of the degree-corrected SBM is, as introduced above, givenbyP(A,k,e,b)=P(A\u2223k,e,b)P(k\u2223e,b)P(e\u2223b)P(b). In terms of the generative\nprocess of this model, this means that one \ufb01rst samples a partition of the\nnodes into blocks, then samples the numbers of edges within and between\nthe blocks, then samples the half-edg es according to the node degrees, and\n\ufb01nally connects half-edge s accordingly to create the network (i.e. sampling\nfrom the networks that are possible given the partition and numberof edges).https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-024-01819-y Article\nCommunications Physics |           (2024) 7:331 8\nWhen using the nonparametric Bayesian framework for inference\npurposes, one can then use this formulation to maximise (or sample from)theposterior distribution of partitions\nP\u00f0bjA\u00de\u00bcP\u00f0A;b\u00de\nP\u00f0A\u00de\u00bcP\u00f0Ajb\u00deP\u00f0b\u00de\nP\u00f0A\u00de: \u00f02\u00de\nThis is where the microcanonical form ulation helps simplify the inference\nproblem, which allows us to write P(A\u2223b)=P(A\u2223k,e,b)P(k\u2223e,b)P(e\u2223b). The\nmarginal likelihood is usually P(A\u2223b)=\u2211eP(A\u2223k,e,b)P(k\u2223e,b)P(e\u2223b), but\ndue to the \u2018hard \u2019constraints of the microcanonical SBM, there is only one\nnon-zero element in this sum46.\nIt turns out that this is where we can r e-introduce information theo-\nretical interpretation. In particular, the posterior can be rewritten as\nP\u00f0bjA\u00de\u00bcP\u00f0Ajk;e;b\u00deP\u00f0kje;b\u00deP\u00f0ejb\u00deP\u00f0b\u00de\nP\u00f0A\u00de\u00bce/C0\u03a3\nP\u00f0A\u00de\u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u03a3\u00bc/C0 lnP\u00f0Ajk;e;b\u00de/C0lnP\u00f0k;e;b\u00deis the description length.\nEquivalently to the more general introduction to description length above, the\ufb01rst component is the amount of information required to describe the net-\nwork under the SBM and the given parameters and the second component isthe amount of information needed to describe the parameters themselves (innats). Due to this de \ufb01nition, \ufb01nding the partition bthat minimises the\ndescription length is equivalent to \ufb01nding the partition that maximises the\nposterior, i.e. to \ufb01nding the most likely partition of the network.\nThe description length can be used to identify the most likely model\ngiven the observed data, upon comparing multiple competing models. Oneway of interpreting a \u2018model \u2019in this context is as a particular partition b\n1\nunder an SBM variant m1. We can identify for which of two partitions b1and\nb2(under models m1andm2respectively) there is more evidence in the data,\nby calculating their posterior odds ratio\n\u039b\u00bcP\u00f0b1;m1jA\u00de\nP\u00f0b2;m2jA\u00de\n\u00bcP\u00f0Ajk;e1;b1;m1\u00deP\u00f0kje1;b1;m1\u00deP\u00f0e1jb1;m1\u00deP\u00f0b1jm1\u00deP\u00f0m1\u00de\nP\u00f0Ajk;e2;b2;m2\u00deP\u00f0kje2;b2;m2\u00deP\u00f0e2jb2;m2\u00deP\u00f0b2jm2\u00deP\u00f0m2\u00de\n\u00bce/C0\u0394\u03a3;\u00f04\u00de\nwhere \u0394\u03a3=\u03a31\u2212\u03a32and\u03a3i\u00bc/C0 lnP\u00f0Ajk;ei;bi;mi\u00de/C0lnP\u00f0k;ei;bi;mi\u00deis\nthe description length of model i(e.g. of the network under SBM miwith\npartition bi).

One can therefore identify the more likely model (interms of the speci \ufb01c parameters) by calculating the description lengths of the\nnetwork under each model and partition. For \u039b=1o r ,e q u i v a l e n t l y , \u03a3\n1=\u03a32,\nthe models are equally likely and for \u039b>1(\u03a31<\u03a32)m o d e l m1is more likely\nthan model m2.\nDescription length calculation\nAs described above, the description length \u03a3of a network Aunder an SBM\nwith a set of parameters \u03b8can be directly derived from its full joint dis-\ntribution, since \u03a3\u00bc/C0 lnP\u00f0A;\u03b8\u00de\u00bc/C0 lnP\u00f0Aj\u03b8\u00de/C0lnP\u00f0\u03b8\u00de. Here, we detail\nthe description length calculation for each of the SBM variants discussed in\nthe main text, by providing their joint distributions, made up of modellikelihood and priors. We will see that the microcanonical framework makesit possible to derive the likelihood and priors through combinatorics. Spe-ci\ufb01cally, to be as parsimonious as possible, the priors tend to be uniform\ndistributions over the number of possibl e realisations of a particular para-\nmeter under the given modelling assumptions.\nNote that in the formulas of the description length calculations, we\nuse the notation introduced for the SBM parameters. However, in themetablox measure, the description length is not only used as part of the\ninference of the optimal partition but it is also calculated for the metadatapartition. To calculate the metadata description length, we simply replacethe parameters b, e, n, Bby the respective metadata quantities that can be\ndirectly induced by d. For example, e\n0is the number of edges within and\nbetween the node sets with shared node attributes, n0is the number of\nnodes that share each type of node attributes, and B0is the number of\nunique node attributes in d.\nThe formulations we provide here for the likelihood and priors for the\nnon-degree-corrected (NDC) and degree-corrected (DC) SBM are based onthe work in refs. 5,32, those for the assortative planted partition (PP) SBM\nare from ref. 38.\nFor NDC, the only model parameters are the edge counts e\nrsbetween\nblocks rand sand the block assignment vector b, so the model is fully\ndescribed by P(A,e,b)=P(A\u2223e,b)P(e\u2223b)P(b), where P(A\u2223e,b)i st h em o d e l\nlikelihood of NDC, P(e\u2223b)i st h ep r i o ro ne d g ec o u n t sa n d P(b)i st h ep r i o ro n\nthe partition.

For PP, the prior on\nthe edge counts serves as a constraint on the network to favour assortativestructure. The full joint distribution can be written asP(A,e,k,b)=P(A\u2223e,k,b)P(k\u2223e,b)P(e\u2223e\nin,eout,b)P(ein,eout\u2223E,b)P(E)P(b),\nwhere Eis the total number of edges in the network, einandeoutare the\nnumber of edges within and between blocks respectively, and where we usethe model likelihood of DC\n38.\nWe start with the elements of the joint distribution of NDC,\nP\u00f0A;e;b\u00de\u00bcP\u00f0Aje;b\u00deP\u00f0ejb\u00deP\u00f0b\u00de\u00f0 5\u00de\nThe model likelihood of NDC is given by\nP\u00f0Aje;b\u00de\u00bcQ\nr<sers!Q\nrerr!!Q\nrnerrQ\ni<jAij!Q\niAii!!\u00f06\u00de\nThe prior for the block matrix ersis a uniform distribution over the total\npossible number of symmetric block matrices given B, with the constraint\nthat the sum of all elements must equal 2 E:\nP\u00f0ejb\u00de\u00bcB\u00f0B\u00fe1\u00de=2\nE/C18/C19/C18/C19 /C01\n\u00f07\u00de\nThe prior on the partition is de \ufb01ned as\nP\u00f0b\u00de\u00bcP\u00f0bjn\u00deP\u00f0njB\u00deP\u00f0B\u00de\n\u00bcP\nrnr!\nN!N/C01\nB/C01/C18/C19 /C011\nN\u00f08\u00de\nHere, P(B)a n d P(n\u2223B) are hyperpriors on the number of blocks Band on the\nblock sizes nrrespectively, to be as parsimonious as possible about these\nparameters.\nIn the case of DC, the model likelihood includes terms for the degree\nsequence k,s ot h a t :\nP\u00f0Aje;k;b\u00de\u00bcQ\nr<sers!Q\nrerr!!Q\niki!Q\nrer!Q\ni<jAij!Q\niAii!!\u00f09\u00de\nAdditionally, the DC case also includes a prior on the degree sequence k,\nnamely\nP\u00f0kje;b\u00de\u00bcY\nrQ\nk\u03b7r\nk!\nnr!Y\nrq\u00f0er;nr\u00de/C01\u00f010\u00de\nwhere \u03b7kdenotes the number of degree- kn o d e si ng r o u p randq(x,y)i st h e\nnumber of ways an integer xcan be partitioned into a maximum of yparts5.https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-024-01819-y Article\nCommunications Physics |           (2024) 7:331 9\nFor PP, the prior on the block matrix needs to be de \ufb01ned differently, to\nencode the constraint that is put on the structural arrangement47.I nf a c t ,\nZhang and Peixoto38proposed two different versions of this probability: one\nwhich assumes that uniform expected number of edges within each com-\nmunity and one that allows the number of expected edges to vary across\ncommunities ( non-uniform ).

In Figs. 4,5, we used edge compression to highlight the parti-\ncular SBM variant whose op timal partition provided the best partition of the\nnetwork and therefore illustrated ho w this second partition can be used to\naddress the \ufb01rst limitation. Including this additional information enabled a\ndistinction between the cases in which the metadata is closest \u2014in terms of\nhow well it compresses the network \u2014totheoptimal partition among the\nvariants included in the analysis, or me rely to the particular variant beingmeasured. In other words, when the strongest relevance is measured under\nDC and DC is also the model whose optimal partition provides the best \ufb01t\noverall, we know that the metadata par tition is strongly relevant not just\nunder the particular model but in comparison to the most optimal partition\nwe have for this network.\nHere, we provide a concrete example for the ability of the second\ndimension to disentangle the signal of t h eb l o c ks t r u c t u r ea n dt h em e t a d a t a\ncorrelation. For the purpose of this de monstration, we generate a total of\n300 synthetic networks with communi ty structure, for each of which we \ufb01x\nsizeN= 200, expected degree k= 10 and number of blocks B.W ec r e a t et h e\nnetworks in this collection such that we end up with three sets of 100networks with differently \u2018strong \u2019community structure. The stronger the\nsignal of the community structure, the more pronounced the difference\nbetween the within- and between -block edge probability. Speci \ufb01cally, we\ngenerate the networks using an SBM with block matrix\n\u03b8\u00bc2E1/C0\u03bc\u03bc\n\u03bc 1/C0\u03bc/C18/C19\n,w i t h \u03bc= 0.1 for the strongest signal, \u03bc=0 . 2f o ra\nmedium signal and \u03bc= 0.3 for weak community structure. For each net-\nwork, we generate three sets of catego rical node metadata, correlating with\nthe planted block structure with correlation \u03c1= 0.7; 0.8; 0.9. In Fig. 6,w e\nvisualise an analysis of the NDC element of metablox for these networks; werefrain from including it for other dime nsions as those yielded very similar\nresults. In the panel on the left-hand side of Fig. 6a, we see that increasing\nmetadata correlation leads to lower values of \u03b3.F o rF i g . 6b, we disaggregated\nthe data by signal strength. We obse rve that for each correlation value \u03c1,t h e\n\u03b3values for the networks with strong and medium community structure are\nessentially indistinguishable, while the networks with weak communitystructure have a larger value of \u03b3for the same \u03c1.W h i l e \u03b3on the whole does a\ngood job at differentiating between the correlation strength of the different\nnetwork-metadata pairs, the differe nces we observe upon separating by\ncommunity strength call for further analysis. Especially in light of workingwith real networks, whose generative process is unknown to us, theseinsights demand a tool to disentangle the different impacting factors on the\nmetadata relevance. In Fig. 6c\u2013e, we demonstrate the way in which the edge\ncompression mitigates this limitatio n: As expected, the stronger the com-\nmunity structure, the \u2018better \u2019(i.e. smaller c) the compression of the optimal\npartition per network edge.\nRobustness analysis\nTo understand the suitability of metablox to be used as part of comparativestudies, we analyse the sensitivity of the measure to networks of differentsizes and topologies. We \ufb01rst discuss the parameters to which we do and do\nnot expect the measure to be robust. For an inter-network comparison, it is\nimportant that our measure is robust with respect to varying network size N,\nwhich is not a trivial question since the description length of a networkincreases with growing N. For structural differences between two networks\nthat are related to the compressibility under an SBM, such as the number of\nblocks, the edge density, or the signal strength of the block structure, the\nquestion becomes more nuanced. In fact, we have already discussed in\u2018Limitations and network compressibility \u2019that\u2014due to our de \ufb01nition of\nmetadata-block structure relevance \u2014weexpect the measure to be impacted\nby the compressibility of a network: metadata is more relevant to a networkwith stronger block structure signal. W e therefore expect metablox to yield\nstronger relevance for network-meta data pairs for which the SBM variant\nprovides better compression e.g. for increasing numbers of blocks.\nTo test these assumptions, we genera te a number of synthetic networks.\nSpeci \ufb01cally, we increase Nfrom N=1 0 0t o N= 1000 at steps of 100, and\ngenerate 50 networks for each N, all with expected degree k=1 0a n dw i t h\nplanted bicommunity structure ( B= 2).

We clearly see the intended normalising effect, as \u03b3\nremains stable for growing Nfor all three variants.https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-024-01819-y Article\nCommunications Physics |           (2024) 7:331 10\nTo test the measure \u2019sb e h a v i o u rf o rv a r y i n gn u m b e r so fb l o c k s ,w e \ufb01x\nthe network size at N= 400 and leave all other parameters as above,\nincreasing Bfrom 2 to 10, again generating 50 networks at each step. In\nFig.8aw es h o wt h er e s u l t sf o r \u03b3NDC\nd(the results for the other two variants are\nsimilar). We observe that, for each value of \u03c1,\u03b3decreases with the number of\nblocks, con \ufb01rming our expectation of the measure capturing stronger\nmetadata relevance for more compressible networks. In Fig. 8b\u2013d, we show\nhow the edge compression of the network can be used as a second\ndimension, if a distinction between meta data correlation and block structure\nsignal strength is required. The three \ufb01gures show the edge compression con\nthe x-axis and \u03b3on the y-axis. A lower value of cimplies better compression,\nand we can see that the second dimensi on separates the compressibility\nfrom the metadata correlation by placing the most compressiblenetworks (B=10) low on the x-axis and low on the y-axis. In a network\ncomparison, in which disentangling these two factors is important,researchers can plot the two dimensions in this way to draw the correctconclusions.\nHeterogeneous partition landscape\nFor the synthetic network used to illlustrate the measure in the Resultssection, we demonstrate here that this network does, in fact, exhibit a\nheterogeneous partition landscape \u2014as designed by the SCBM\n27. Recall\nthat we created a network with N= 100 nodes, B= 2 blocks and expected\ndegree k= 10, generated in a way such that upon \ufb01tting an SBM to the\nnetwork and sampling from the posterior distribution, one recovers at least\ntwo \u2018clusters \u2019of partitions \u2014a bicommunity partition (BC) and a secondFig. 7 | Metablox values for networks of varying size.

The probability of\nthe existence of edges in this network depends solely on the block mem-\nbership of nodes and on the edge probab ility given by these two matrices.\nFor the purpose of demonstrating that this network \u2019s partition land-\nscape does have multiple competing explanations, we \ufb01ta nS B Ma n ds a m p l e\nfrom the posterior distribution by using the methods from the graph-toollibrary\n37. In particular, we use the degree-corrected SBM variant (DC),\nwhich is meant to account for heterogeneous degree distributions withinblocks\n48. The description lengths \u03a3DCof the network according to these\npartitions are plotted in grey dots on the x-axis in Fig. 9c. We also calculate\nthe description lengths \u03a3PPof the network according to each partition under\nthe planted partition SBM (PP), the variant of the model that assumesassortativity\n38; these are shown on the y-axis of the same \ufb01gure.

We show representative partitionsfor each partition cluster in the tw o network visualisations in Fig. 9aa n db ,i n\nwhich nodes are painted according to b lock assignments. We clearly see a\nstrong similarity between these inf erred partitions and each of the twoplanted partitions in Fig. 1and we therefore conclude that we have suc-\ncessfully created a network with the desi red diverse partition landscape. We\nalso observe that for those inferred partitions that are similar to the plantedbicommunity partition, the PP offer s a similarly good encoding of the\nnetwork as the DC, since \u03a3\nPP\u2248\u03a3DCfor those partitions. In contrast, for the\ninferred partitions that are similar t o the planted core-periphery parti-\ntion, we have \u03a3^PP > \u03a3^DC. This illustrates that c alculating the description\nlength of a network under different models can help us probe its partitionlandscape.\nIn line with the objective of our measure, we use this example network\nto support our hypothesis that using des cription length is a suitable tool to\nunderstand the way in which metadata is relevant for different parts of the\npartition landscape. For this purpose, we calculate \u03a3\nDC\ndand\u03a3PP\ndfor each of\nthe 202 sets of metadata that we generated for this network, as introduced inthe \u201cResults \u201dsection and plot the resulting description length values\nalongside the grey dots (i.e. alongside the description length values of the\ninferred partitions) on Fig. 9c. The red stars represent the metadata parti-\ntions that are correlated with the planted bicommunity structure, the bluestars represent those that are similar t o the core-periphery structure, with\ndarker colours depicting higher values of \u03c1. As expected, we observe that\nunder the more general of the two models, the partitions with the highestvalues of \u03c1have the lowest description length : the stronger the correlation of\nthe metadata with the planted structure, the lower the description length,since the metadata partition is similar to the two ground truth partitions that\nwere responsible for generating the net work. The description lengths under\nthe PP on the y-axis illustrate that a dditional to measuring the extent to\nwhich metadata is related to structure, we can also probe the type ofstructural arrangement: the bicommunity-like metadata are encoded as wellunder PP as under DC, indicating that assortativity was a prominent featureFig. 8 | Metablox values for varying number of blocks.

In analogy to gro-\nceries, where nutrition labels help consumers\nmake choices that they consider best for them-\nselves, information nutrition labels tag online\nnews articles with data that help readers judge\nthe articles they engage with. This paper dis-\ncusses the choice of the labels, their imple-\nmentation and visualization.\n1 Introduction\nNowadays, the amount of online news content is\nimmense and its sources are very diverse. For the\nreaders and other consumers of online news who\nvalue balanced, diverse and reliable information,\nit is necessary to have access to methods of evalu-\nating the news articles available to them.\nThis is somewhat similar to food consumption\nwhere consumers are presented with a huge va-\nriety of alternatives and therefore face the chal-\nlenge of deciding what is good for their health.\nThis is why food packages come with nutrition\nlabels that guide the consumers in their deci-\nsion making. Taking this analogy, Fuhr and col-\nleagues (2018) discuss the idea of implement-\ning information nutrition labels for news arti-\ncles. They propose to label every online news\narticle with information nutrition labels that de-\nscribe the ingredients of the article and give\nreaders a chance to make an informed judgment\nabout what they are reading. The authors dis-\ncuss nine different information nutrition labels:\nfactuality, readability, virality, emotion/sentiment,opinion/subjectivity/objectivity, controversy, au-\nthority/credibility/trust, technicality and topical-\nity. Gollub and colleagues (2018) categorize these\nlabels into fewer dimensions. Their aim is to es-\ntablish group labels that are easily understood by\nreaders. However, both studies do not go beyond\ndiscussing, proposing and grouping the labels.\nIn this work we actually implement information\nnutrition labels and deliver them as a browser plu-\ngin that we call NewsScan . Therefore we provide\na basis for evaluating how well labels describe\nthe online news content and for investigating how\nuseful they are to real users for making decisions\nabout whether to read the news and whether to\ntrust its content. To avoid biasing the user in any\nway with respect to the consumption of an article,\nthe information is solely presented but not inter-\npreted. Judgments about news sources should be\nmade by users themselves. Whether an article will\nbe read or discarded depends on the user\u2019s own\nweighing of importance of the information nutri-\ntion labels.\nThe plugin supports the reader in these tasks\nthrough easy-to-understand visualizations of the\nlabels. In this paper we discuss the methods be-\nhind the label computation (Section 2) and the de-\nsign of the user interface (Section 3).\n2 Information nutrition labels\nNewsScan implements six information nutrition\nlabels: source popularity, article popularity, ease\nof reading, sentiment, objectivity and political\nbias.Ease of reading, sentiment andobjectivity\nhave been proposed by Fuhr et al. (2018). We pro-\npose to add three more nutrition labels: Source as\nwell as article popularity and political bias. Sim-\nilar to food nutrition labels the information nutri-\n29tion labels aim to provide the reader some base to\njudge about the reliability of the article\u2019s content.\nThe credibility nutrition label proposed by Fuhr et\nal. (2018), for instance, is able to give the reader\nthe indication whether e.g. the source where the\narticle come from is credible or not. However,\nthe credibility label entails already a judgment.\nIt already sums some pieces of information and\nmakes conclusion based on them. We think in-\nstead of providing the reader such a judgment the\nuser might be better informed when we provide\ninformation that are possible bases for computing\ne.g. the credibility label. The proposed three new\nlabels aim this purpose, i.e. providing enough de-\ntails to enable the user to make an informed judg-\nment about an articles content.\nIn the following we describe the nutrition labels\ncurrently implemented within the plugin.\n2.1 Source popularity\nThe label source popularity encompasses two di-\nmensions: the reputation of the news source and\nits in\ufb02uence.\nThe reputation of a source is analyzed using the\nWeb of Trust Score1. This score is computed\nby an Internet browser extension that helps peo-\nple make informed decision about whether to trust\na website or not. It is based on a unique crowd-\nsourcing approach that collects rating and reviews\nfrom global community of millions of users who\nrate and comment on websites based on their per-\nsonal experiences.\nThe in\ufb02uence of a source is computed using\nAlexa Rank, Google PageRank2and popularity on\nTwitter.\nAlexa Rank is a virtual ranking system set by\nAlexa.com (a subsidiary of Amazon) that audits\nand publishes the frequency of visits on various\nwebsites. The Alexa ranking is the geometric\nmean of reach and page views, averaged over a\nperiod of three months.\nGoogle PageRank is a link analysis algorithm\nthat assigns a numerical weight to each element of\na hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World\nWide Web, with the purpose of measuring its rela-\ntive importance within the set.\nTwitter Popularity is calculated as an average\nof the scores for the following two metrics:\n1https://www.mywot.com/\n2https://www.domcop.com/openpagerank/\u000fFollowers Count : This gives the amount of\nusers that are following a source.\n\u000fListed Count : This indicates the number of\nmemberships of the source to different top-\nics. It is based on the user\u2019s activity to\nadd/remove the source from their customized\nlist. The higher it is, the more diverse the\nsource is.\nAn overall source popularity score shown to the\nuser is calculated by averaging these four metrics.\nHowever, when the icon card is \ufb02ipped the user\ncan also get detailed information about each of the\nabove scores.\n2.2 Article popularity\nPopularity =alog (bx+ 1) (1)\nwhere xis the average amount of tweets per\nhour, so that the article popularity is 0when xis\n0. The most popular article we found had around\n23 tweets per hour in its peak 24 hours. This is\nused as a reference value, i.e. an article must have\nthis many tweets to reach a score of 100. The log-\narithmic function is used because the output has to\nbe scaled properly. For example, an article with\n\ufb01ve tweets per hour is still relatively popular, even\nthough it is just a fraction of the reference score.\nChoosing a large value for bwill make the func-\ntion close to being linear, which will cause even\nthe relatively popular articles to have low scores.\nA small bwill make the function more curved.\nIfbis too big however, any article with a decent\namount of tweets will have a score very close to\n100. bis chosen empirically to be 1so that the\nscores are distributed well between 0 and 100 over\na variety of typical news articles. ais determined\nto be 73to give the reference article a score of 100.\n2.3 Ease of reading\nAs described by Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005)\nthe readability level is used to characterize the ed-\nucational level a reader needs to understand a text.\nThis topic has been in research since 1930 and sev-\neral automatic solutions have been proposed to de-\ntermine the readability level of an input text (Vaj-\njala and Meurers, 2013; Xia et al., 2016; Schwarm\nand Ostendorf, 2005). The core concept in these\nstudies is to use machine learning along with fea-\nture engineering covering lexical, structural, and\nheuristic based features. We followed this core\nconcept and used Random Forest with features in-\nspired by earlier studies. This approach achieved\n3073% accuracy on a data set of texts written by\nstudents in Cambridge English examinations (Xia\net al., 2016). The classi\ufb01er predicts \ufb01ve different\nlevels of readability varying from A2 (easy) to C2\n(dif\ufb01cult) (Xia et al., 2016). We map these values\nto percentages so that A2 becomes 100% (easy to\nread) and C2 becomes 20% (dif\ufb01cult to read) (see\nTable 1)\nTable 1: Levels of readability\nText level A2 B1 B2 C1 C2\nValue 100% 80% 60% 40% 20%\n2.4 Sentiment\nA text containing sentiment is written in an emo-\ntional style. To determine the sentiment value of\nan article, our algorithm uses the pattern3.en li-\nbrary (Hayden and de Smet). In this library every\nword is assigned a sentiment value, which can be\nnegative or positive [-1; 1]. If a word shows in-\ntense positive emotions (e.g. happy, amazing), it\nis given a high positive value. In line with that,\na term indicating intense negative emotions (e.g.\nbad, disgusting) is assigned a high negative value.\nA word not containing any emotions (e.g. the, you,\nhouse), has a value of near to zero. First, the algo-\nrithm calculates the sentiment value for every sen-\ntence by averaging all absolute values of sentiment\nfor the distinct words. After that, the overall senti-\nment value of the whole news article is calculated.\nFor that, the average of the sentences is taken and\nmultiplied by 100.3\n2.5 Objectivity\nObjectivity is given when a text is written from a\nneutral rather than a personal perspective. Phrases\nlike\u201din my opinion\u201d or\u201dI think\u201d are used by au-\nthors to re\ufb02ect their individual thoughts, beliefs\nand attitudes. The process of determining the ob-\njectivity of a text is similar to the process of cal-\nculating the sentiment value. The aforementioned\nlibrary pattern3.en (Hayden and de Smet) also in-\ncludes a value of subjectivity for every word.4\nTherefore we use it to obtain an objectivity score\nfor articles. Values range from 0 to 1, with a value\n3Since we use the absolute values of the sentiment scores\nwe are interested in knowing how sentimental a news article\nis rather than focusing on the valence of emotions.\n4Similar to sentiment the algorithm calculates the subjec-\ntivity score for every sentence by averaging all subjectivity\nscores of its words.near to 0 indicating objectivity and a value near\nto 1 indicating subjectivity. The overall score for\nsubjectivity contained in an article is calculated as\nthe average over all sentences. However, since we\nwant to examine the objectivity and not the sub-\njectivity of a text, the values need to be inverted:\nObjectivity = 1\u0000Subjectivity (2)\nThis score is normalized by multiplying it by\n100 to attain a consistent score range for all labels.\n2.6 Political bias\nBias measures the degree to which an article is\nwritten from a one-sided perspective that enforces\nusers to believe in a speci\ufb01c viewpoint without\nconsidering opposing arguments.\nFor calculating political bias we followed Fair-\nbanks et al. (2018) and used two classes that repre-\nsent different political orientations: conservatism\n(sources that are biased towards the right) and lib-\neralism (sources that are biased towards the left).\nThe authors also argue that the content of the ar-\nticle is a strong discriminant to distinguish be-\ntween biased and non-biased articles. Following\nthe authors we built a content based model for\nprediction of political bias in the news articles.\nTo achieve that, a logistic regression classi\ufb01er is\ntrained on a dataset containing articles from The\nGlobal Database of Events Language and Tone\nProject (The GDELT Project). This database mon-\nitors the world\u2019s broadcast news in over 100 lan-\nguages and provides a computing platform. How-\never, it does not contain any information about the\npolitical bias. To retrieve the bias contained in\nan article, we crawled from the Media Bias Fact\nCheck5the required bias information. The Media\nBias Fack Check contains human annotated fact\nchecks for various source domains. For our arti-\ncles we have left-biased, right-biased and neutral\nlabels. We use a simple bag-of-words approach\nas features to guide our logistic regression model.\nAs the label values in our plugin are all shown\nin a range from 0-100%, the label\u2019s landing page\nshows 0% when the article has no political bias\notherwise 100% \u2013 regardless whether the article\nis left or right biased. When the label\u2019s card is\n\ufb02ipped the reader can see whether the article has\nleft or right political bias.\n5https://mediabiasfactcheck.com\n313 Visualization\n3.1 Colors and icons\nOur information nutrition labels are represented\nby simple, easy-to-identify and well-known icons,\nwhich have been shown to be easily understood by\nusers (Antunez et al., 2013; Campos et al., 2011;\nHersey et al., 2013; Roberto and Khandpur, 2014).\nMoreover, previous work reports that simple addi-\ntional texts allow for a quicker processing of in-\nformation represented by an icon (Campos et al.,\n2011). Therefore the information nutrition label is\nshown additionally as text.\nTo make nutrition labels more comprehensible,\ncolors indicating amounts of nutrients are helpful\n(Aschemann-Witzel et al., 2013; Crosetto et al.,\n2016; Ducrot et al., 2016). Relevant research\nreports that both traf\ufb01c light colors and mono-\nchromic colors work equally well (Aschemann-\nWitzel et al., 2013). Traf\ufb01c light colors are most\ncommon with red indicating high (i.e. negative)\nand green indicating low (i.e. positive) levels of\nnutrients (Kim et al., 2018). Since we do not want\nto bias the users towards reading an article or not,\nbut rather give information about its content, we\nchose to use different shades of blue in our plugin.\nA light blue indicates low and a dark blue indi-\ncates high levels of a certain label. Additionally,\nblue stands for trust, honesty and security (Ven-\nngage, 2018), which should indicate that the user\nis operating a reliable tool.\nWhen deciding on what charts and \ufb01gures to\nuse, we again took into account that simple and\ncommonly known visualizations are easiest to\ncomprehend (Campos et al., 2011). Thus, we\nchose plain bar charts for representing overall nu-\ntrition label scores as well as scores of sub-labels.\nAdditionally, we enriched it with percentages as\nwell as coloring. Consequently, the amount of a\nlabel contained in a news article is visualized in an\nunderstandable and easy-to-process way.\nFor lettering, the font Futura is used. It is a\nmodern, straightforward and clean typeface often\nused in state-of-the-art websites and \ufb01ts the simple\nand genuine layout.\n3.2 Positioning and information distribution\nFollowing the so-called gestalt laws of grouping6,\nobjects that are closer to each other ( law of prox-\nimity ) are perceived as belonging together. More-\n6e-teaching.org\nFigure 1: NewsScan plugin\nover, to indicate the grouping of information, sep-\narations between those groups are useful ( law of\ncontinuity ). Therefore, the distinct labels are sep-\narated from each other by horizontal and vertical\nlines.\nTo obviate information overload (Eppler and\nMengis, 2004) when using NewsScan , we reduced\nthe information on the landing page to a minimum.\nOnly the icons with their respective overall score\nare visible on the front side of the cards we used\nfor visualization (as shown in Figure 1 for article\npopularity, ease of reading, sentiment, objectivity\nand political bias). Therefore, the users can get a\n\ufb01rst impression about different nutrition labels of\nthe article. When time is scarce, a simple visual-\nization where users can \ufb01nd the demanded infor-\nmation easily is most practicable (Crosetto et al.,\n2016). However, if users are interested in getting\nmore detailed information, we created a backside\nfor each card. The backside also shows the total\nscore and, if available, relevant sub-labels that are\nused to calculate the overall scores (see Figure 1:\nsource popularity). Additionally, on hovering over\nthe names of the labels and sub-labels, the user\ngets a short explanation about what the wording\nand score mean. To further avoid possible con-\nfusion on the user side, all of the labels are rep-\nresented in the same way. Overall and sub-label\nscores are mapped to a range from 0-100% and\n32icons, texts and charts are arranged consistently.\n4 Evaluation\nTo evaluate NewsScan in terms of wording, color-\ning and usability, we will conduct qualitative user\nstudies. Participants will be interviewed and asked\nabout their perception of the tool in general as well\nas concerning speci\ufb01c features. Since our aim is\nto not bias the user towards a consumption of one\nnews article or another, we need to evaluate the\nplugin regarding that. Especially the wording of\nthe features could affect the user in forming an\nopinion about an article. However, we want to\nhelp our users making an informed decision, so we\nneed some kind of guiding, hence wording. To en-\nsure that our tool only works as a guide and not a\nspeci\ufb01c recommender, we do not interpret, for ex-\nample, an easy-to-read article as being not worth-\nwhile reading but just easy to understand. How-\never, we believe some threshold label values about\nworthwhile and not worthwhile articles would in-\ndeed help readers in their decision making. In our\nevaluation we will aim to incorporate such infor-\nmation and draw conclusion between cases with\nthreshold and without threshold values.\n5 Conclusion and implications\nIn this paper we introduced NewsScan , a browser\nplugin to assist consumers of online news websites\nin their decision making about the content they\nengage with. Readers are guided to make an in-\nformed decision about editorials based on six la-\nbels: source popularity ,article popularity ,ease of\nreading ,sentiment ,objectivity andpolitical bias .\nLabel values are computed when a news article is\nretrieved. Through simple visualizations and an\nintuitive design, the user is confronted with the\nmeta-information of the respective piece. To avoid\nbiasing the user in any way with respect to the con-\nsumption of an article, the information is solely\npresented but not interpreted. Judgments about\nnews sources should be made by users themselves.\nIf an article is read or discarded relies on the user\u2019s\nopinion and individual weighing of the importance\nof the six labels.\nIn our immediate future work we plan to con-\nduct user studies to analyse the validity of infor-\nmation nutrition labels and their usefulness for\nusers. We also plan to investigate and integrate\nfurther information nutrition labels. Moreover it\nwould be interesting to apply NewsScan to furthermedia like videos or images accompanying news.\nReferences\nLucia Antunez, Leticia Vidal, Alejandra Sapolinski,\nAna Gimenez, Alejandro Maiche, and Gaston Ares.\n2013.

In this work, we introduce the task\nofmultimodal ideology prediction , where a\nmodel predicts binary or \ufb01ve-point scale ide-\nological leanings, given a text-image pair with\npolitical content. We \ufb01rst collect \ufb01ve new\nlarge-scale datasets with English documents\nand images along with their ideological lean-\nings, covering news articles from a wide range\nof US mainstream media and social media\nposts from Reddit and Twitter. We conduct\nin-depth analyses of news articles and reveal\ndifferences in image content and usage across\nthe political spectrum. Furthermore, we per-\nform extensive experiments and ablation stud-\nies, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted\npretraining objectives on different model com-\nponents. Our best-performing model, a late-\nfusion architecture pretrained with a triplet ob-\njective over multimodal content, outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art text-only model by almost\n4% and a strong multimodal baseline with no\npretraining by over 3%.\n1 Introduction\nIn an increasingly divided world rife with misin-\nformation and hyperpartisanship, it is important to\nunderstand the perspectives and biases of the cre-\nators of the media that we consume. Media bias can\nmanifest in many ways and has been analyzed from\na variety of angles: the news may favor one side\nof a political issue (Card et al., 2015; Mendelsohn\net al., 2021), select certain events to report on (Mc-\nCarthy et al., 1996; Oliver and Maney, 2000; Fan\net al., 2019) or even distort or misrepresent facts\n(Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2006; Entman, 2007).\nIdentifying a news article\u2019s underlying political\nslant is the task of ideology prediction , which has\n* Equal contribution.\n(a)\n (b)\nFigure 1: Two images from separate sources depict-\ningFederal Judge Pauses Justice Department Effort to\nDismiss Michael Flynn Case . In (a), from New York\nTimes, Flynn is shown with several other \ufb01gures and\nhas a positive expression. In contrast, in (b), from Fox\nNews, Flynn is the sole \ufb01gure, with a negative expres-\nsion.\nfocused largely on political texts like news arti-\ncles and has been tackled with a variety of mod-\nels, including Bayesian approaches with attention\n(Kulkarni et al., 2018), graph neural networks (Li\nand Goldwasser, 2019), and LSTMs and BERT\n(Baly et al., 2020). However, past work focuses\nsolely on news articles\u2019 text; news articles contain\nother forms of non-verbal information in which the\nunderlying ideology may be realized.\nConsider Figure 1a and Figure 1b, two images\nfrom articles depicting the same news story, but by\nnews sources with opposing ideologies (New York\nTimes and Fox News, respectively). The underly-\ning ideology of the news source may in\ufb02uence the\nchoice of image: in Figure 1a, Michael Flynn is\ndepicted with a happy expression and surrounded\nby other \ufb01gures, while in Figure 1b, Flynn bears\na stern expression and is the sole \ufb01gure. Images\nare an integral part of news articles: over 56% of\narticles in AllSides1include at least one image.\nImages are often used to frame certain issues or\nin\ufb02uence the reader\u2019s opinion. For example, liberal\nwebsites devote more visual coverage of Donald\nTrump and also portray Trump with more nega-\n1allsides.com , a website that categorizes media out-\nlets and news articles by political slant. It associates multiple\narticles with a single story about which these articles were\nwritten.arXiv:2211.02269v1  [cs.CL]  4 Nov 2022\ntive emotions compared with conservative websites\n(Boxell, 2021). In addition, images of groups of\nimmigrants, in contrast to individual immigrants,\ntend to decrease survey respondents\u2019 support for\nimmigration (Madrigal and Soroka, 2021). These\n\ufb01ndings naturally lead us to conduct a study of\npolitical images. In Section 3.3, we present a thor-\nough analysis of images, \ufb01nding, inter alia , that\n(1) liberal sources tend to include more \ufb01gures in\nan image, (2) conservative sources have a higher\nusage of collage images, and (3) faces are more\nlikely to show negative or neutral emotion rather\nthan positive.\nAlthough modern American politics have cen-\ntered around two polar opposites (Klein, 2020),\n38% of US adults identify as politically indepen-\ndent and do not agree wholly with left or right ide-\nologies.2Ideology exists on a spectrum (Bobbio,\n1996), and we wish to predict more \ufb01ne-grained\nideology than merely left or right. Thus, we de-\n\ufb01nemultimodal ideology prediction in this work as\npredicting one of \ufb01ve ideological slants (left, lean\nleft, center, lean right, right) given both an article\u2019s\ntext and cover image. To support this new task,\nwe present several new large-coverage datasets of\nnews articles and images across the ideological\nspectrum from various sources including AllSides,\nReddit, Twitter, and 11 independent news sources.\nWe experiment with several early and late fu-\nsion architectures and evaluate several continued\npretraining objectives to improve the image and\ntext encoder separately as well as jointly. Our\ntechnical contributions include a novel triplet mar-\ngin loss over multimodal inputs, and the \ufb01rst sys-\ntematic study on multimodal models for ideol-\nogy prediction, which reveals several \ufb01ndings:\n(1) images are indeed helpful for ideology pre-\ndiction, improving over a text-only model espe-\ncially on right-leaning images; (2) late-fusion ar-\nchitectures perform better than early-fusion archi-\ntectures; (3) ideology-driven pretraining on both\nthe text and image encoders is bene\ufb01cial; (4) \ufb01ne-\ntuning with a joint triplet difference loss encour-\nages the model to learn informative representations\nof ideology. Code and datasets can be found at\ngithub.com/launchnlp/mulmodide .\n2https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/15/\nfacts-about-us-political-independents/2 Related Work\nMedia Bias/Ideology on Texts The study of me-\ndia bias and ideology has a long history going as\nfar back as White (1950). Computationally, re-\nsearchers have studied various approaches in classi-\ncal machine learning as well as neural methods (e.g.\nEvans et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2008; Sapiro-Gheiler,\n2019; Iyyer et al., 2014). However, these works\nfocus solely on text. There exist several resources\nof news articles across the political spectrum, com-\npiled for the purpose of educating users on media\nbias (Park et al., 2009, 2011; Hamborg et al., 2017,\n3,4,5). Multimodal studies such as ours need anno-\ntated data for training and testing. Thus, we collect\nseveral datasets containing both political text and\nimages from various sources.\nMedia Bias/Ideology on Texts and Images\nOnly very recently has there been much study on\nmedia bias with respect to both text and images. Ex-\nisting work on characterizing political images has\nbeen limited to narrow domains such as Russian\ntrolls on Twitter (Zannettou et al., 2020), political\nmemes (Beskow et al., 2020), and COVID content\non TikTok (Southwick et al., 2021). In addition,\ndata containing both text and images annotated\nfor political ideology are not readily available.6\nThus, we collect, annotate, and analyze a variety\nof new datasets, focusing on political \ufb01gures in\nnews images. For the tasks of multimodal ideol-\nogy prediction, one similar work to ours is Thomas\nand Kovashka (2019), who investigate adding text\nto help an image encoder train an enhanced repre-\nsentation of images. Afterwards, they ignore the\ntext and focus on ideology prediction from images\nalone. They consider only left or right ideologies,\nin contrast to our more \ufb01ne-grained 5-way set.\n3 Data\nIn this section, we describe several datasets col-\nlected in this work for pretraining and \ufb01netuning\nthe proposed models.\n3.1 Pretraining Datasets\nWe build two pretraining datasets based on\nBIGNEWSBLN(Liu et al., 2022a), a corpus of over\n3https://adfontesmedia.com\n4https://www.allsides.com\n5https://mediabiasfactcheck.com\n6Thomas and Kovashka (2019) claims to have released\nsuch a dataset, but their link was dead. Their dataset also does\nnot annotate \ufb01ne-grained ideology.\n1.9M English news articles collected from 11 news\nsources balanced across the political spectrum.\nBN-I MGCAP We \ufb01rst collect a new dataset, BN-\nIMGCAP, of 1.2M images that occur anywhere in\na news article,7along with their captions, from\nseven news sources represented in BIGNEWSBLN,\nchosen to roughly cover equal proportions of left-,\ncenter-, and right-leaning ideologies. Details of this\ncollection process are described in Appendix A. We\nuse these image-caption pairs in our experiments\nfor pretraining the image encoder with the InfoNCE\nloss and bidirectional captioning loss (Section 4.3).\nBNA-I MG Liu et al. (2022a) also introduced a\nsubset of BIGNEWSBLNcalled BIGNEWSALIGN\ncontaining articles associated with a story cluster,\ni.e., news articles from different news sources but\nwritten about the same story, for pretraining with\nan ideological triplet loss. From this subset, we\nidentify articles containing images and crawl these\nimages from each article\u2019s corresponding webpage.\nWe call this dataset of article text and images BNA-\nIMGand use this for pretraining the cross-modal\nattention with our proposed triplet margin loss (Sec-\ntion 4.3). Table 1 summarizes these datasets.\n3.2 Evaluation Datasets\nAllSides We extract a dataset of news articles\nand images from AllSides, which associates stories\n(e.g., of a particular event) with multiple articles\nabout that story but written by various news sources\nacross a 5-point ideology scale (left, lean-left, cen-\nter, lean-right, and right). We crawl the AllSides\nwebsite to obtain (story, article, source) tuples from\n2012/06/01\u20132021/08/31, focusing on articles from\nthe 25 news sources with the most number of arti-\ncles in AllSides and spanning the complete range\nof ideology (see Appendix B for the complete list).\nFor each news article, we extract the article text\nand cover image from each article\u2019s correspond-\ning news source\u2019s website, totaling 5,662 stories\ncontaining 12,471 articles.\nReddit We also collect a dataset of 357k Red-\ndit posts with images from the past 10 years from\n\ufb01ve subreddits representing both the left-leaning\n(r/Liberal, r/democrats, r/progressive) and right-\nleaning (r/Conservative, and r/Republican) politi-\ncal stances, chosen for being among the largest and\nmost active partisan subreddits. For each post, we\nkeep the post title and the image itself, as long as\n7In contrast to just the cover image.\n# Posts0 10K 20K 30KLeftRightPosts by Subreddi ts\nr/Liberal\nr/progressive\nr/democrats\nr/Republican\nr/ConservativeFigure 2: Proportion of posts with images from each\npolitical subreddit.\nthe post was not removed (\u02dc2,300 posts). In order\nto avoid data leakage, we \ufb01lter out all posts linking\nto images from the 11 news sources represented\ninBIGNEWS, resulting in a set of 313k posts. In\naddition, because the number of posts from right-\nleaning subreddits overwhelms the number of left-\nleaning posts, we subsample the right-leaning posts,\nresulting in a balanced dataset of 65k posts with\nimages, half from each political leaning. The Red-\ndit dataset is summarized in Figure 2. In contrast to\nnews articles, Reddit imposes a 300-character limit\non the post title.8Thus, this dataset and the Twitter\ndata described below provide a good opportunity\nto examine how our models perform on short texts,\ncompared to the longer-form news articles.\nTwitter We additionally collect a dataset of 2.1M\npolitical tweets from Twitter from the past 10 years\nusing the Twitter Decahose stream, selecting tweets\nby political \ufb01gures included in a list of 9,981 US\npoliticians and their Twitter handles (Panda et al.,\n2020). In contrast to AllSides, Twitter does not\nexplicitly annotate discrete ideologies. Thus, we\nlabel tweets with their author\u2019s ideology, identi-\n\ufb01ed based on their DW-NOMINATE9dimension\n(Boche et al., 2018), a measure of a politician\u2019s vot-\ning history: a positive number indicates a conser-\nvative leaning (e.g. Donald Trump, 0.403), while\na negative number indicates a liberal leaning (e.g.\nBarack Obama, -0.343). We partition politicians\ninto left, center, and right ideologies, containing\nthose whose ideology score is less than -0.2, be-\ntween -0.2 and 0.2, and above 0.2, respectively.\nThe distribution of these scores is shown in Fig-\nure 3. Finally, we discard tweets without images,\nleaving 57,093 tweets from 1,422 politicians as our\n\ufb01nal evaluation dataset.

We employ DeepFace (Taigman et al.,\n2014), a state-of-the-art facial recognition frame-\nwork. Given an input image, DeepFace identi\ufb01es\nfaces and matches them to a set of reference im-\nages; we construct a set of 10 reference images\n10Figure, face, and person are synonymous in this work.\nFaces are used in the facial detection process by DeepFace,\nbut in some cases, faces are not visible and are thus not identi-\n\ufb01able.for 722 political \ufb01gures using a combination of\nentity linking and manual heuristics, detailed in\nAppendix C. We also employ DeepFace to detect\ngender (male/female), race (Asian, Black, Indian,\nLatino, Middle Eastern, or White), and emotion\n(neutral, angry, fear, sad, disgust, happy, surprise)\nin AllSides images.11\nPitfalls of Facial Recognition While using\nDeepFace, we encountered a few pitfalls. First,\nDeepFace is often unable to recognize faces that\nare small, blurred, or in side pro\ufb01le. This corrob-\norates existing work showing that reduced quality\nof faces is detrimental to the detection of faces and\nemotions (Jain and Learned-Miller, 2010; Yang\net al., 2016, 2021). Second, we noticed frequent\nmistakes with a few high-pro\ufb01le \ufb01gures. For exam-\nple, DeepFace often classi\ufb01es Barack Obama and\nEric Holder as Hispanic or Middle Eastern, and\nDonald Trump as Asian, showing that DeepFace\ncan be faulty even for famous people with lots of\ntraining images.\nManual Annotation of Images No facial recog-\nnition tool is perfect, and aspects of images that\ncould be relevant for ideology, such as main \ufb01gures\nor the presence of certain objects, are not captured\nby DeepFace. Therefore, we manually annotate\n400 random images from AllSides. For each image,\nwe identify the number of people in the image (1-\n5, or \u201cgroup\u201d if there are 6 or more people). We\nidentify the main \ufb01gure(s) in the image. For each\nmain \ufb01gure, we identify their name (if a known\npolitical \ufb01gure), gender ,race, and emotion (Pos-\nitive, Negative, or Neutral).12If the \ufb01gure is of\nmixed race (e.g., Barack Obama) or if the \ufb01gure\nis unknown (i.e., not easily identi\ufb01able after exam-\nining the article\u2019s text and searching Google), we\nlabel their most salient race.\nWe also identify any salient aspects of the im-\nage that help convey the image\u2019s message. This\n11These categories are those supported by DeepFace, not\nspeci\ufb01cally chosen by us.\n12We only annotate three categories of emotion, because we\nfound it hard to distinguish between the \ufb01ne-grained negative\nemotions detected by DeepFace.\n(a) Collage\n (b) Composite Image\nFigure 4: Collages are composed of separate images\narranged adjacently, while a composite image is com-\nposed of partial images edited together.

We also annotate special image classes :\nwhether the image is an invalid/missing image, a\nnews source banner, a cartoon drawing, a collage,\nor a composite image. The difference between the\nlatter two is explained in Figure 4.\nAnalysis We present annotator agreement be-\ntween DeepFace and humans in Appendix D. In\nthis section, we focus on drawing insights from the\nanalysis of the images.\nWe \ufb01rst examine the number of \ufb01gures in the\nimage (Table 3). We \ufb01nd that images from lib-\neral sources on average contain more \ufb01gures than\nimages from conservative sources. Speci\ufb01cally, a\nhigher percentage of left-leaning and center images\ncontained 5 or more faces. Within the 5+ faces\ncategory, a large fraction are unknown \ufb01gures (i.e.,\nnot well-known politicians), though these images\nmay contain more notable politicians (e.g., Trump\nat a podium surrounded by supporters). The dis-\ntribution of the number of \ufb01gures in these images\nmay re\ufb02ect liberals\u2019 focus on equality as a group in\ncomparison to conservatives\u2019 focus on self-reliance\nas part of their political identity, as revealed by\nprior work (Hanson et al., 2019).\nWe also examine the distribution of face occur-Left Lean Left Center Lean Right Right\nRegular 85% 93% 100% 95% 85%\nRemoved 7% 0% 0% 0% 0%\nBanner 2% 0% 0% 2% 2%\nCartoon 0% 0% 0% 2% 0%\nCollage 0% 6% 0% 0% 12%\nComposite 5% 1% 0% 0% 1%\nTable 4: Type of images in a random sample of 400\nimages from AllSides.

Notably, a\nlarge fraction of Right images are collages (i.e., 12%),\nindicating a common strategy by right-leaning media.\nrence by topic of the article. We \ufb01nd images about\ntopics such as civil rights, labor, and holidays have\nthe most \ufb01gures on average, while topics such as\nnational defense, FBI, and criminal justice have\nrelatively fewer people. This is simply a natural\nre\ufb02ection of the nature of the topic. Within a topic,\nthe distribution largely follows the liberal images\nhave more \ufb01gures rule. For example, in the gun\ncontrol topic, lean-left images contain on average\n4.9 people, while lean-right images contain on av-\nerage 2.0 people.\nRoughly 12\u201319% of images contain no face. We\n\ufb01nd that the majority of these images contain inani-\nmate subjects mentioned in the news articles, which\nare about e.g. an oil tanker that caught on \ufb01re, or\nrubble from an earthquake, rather than about a spe-\nci\ufb01c political \ufb01gure. Around 13% of these no-face\npictures contain well-known government buildings\nincluding the White House, the Capitol building,\nand the Supreme Court building. One explanation\nis that these images represent the three branches\nof government in the US and are thus a form of\nmetonymy, e.g. the White House can refer to not\nonly the president but also the country as a whole.\nHowever, future work is needed to understand why\nreporters would select, e.g., an image of the White\nHouse instead of an image of the president.\nWe also investigate types of images in Table 4.\nMost are ordinary images, but we \ufb01nd that over\n12% of images from Right sources are collages,\nwhich are often arranged in the form of a narra-\ntive. For example, in Figure 4a, from an article\ndescribing a bombing in France, the \ufb01rst image\ncontains the police scene, while the second image\nis the suspect. Existing work has demonstrated\nlinks between the usage of collages and the dissem-\nination of misinformation (Krafft and Donovan,\n2020). Composite images make up over 5% of Left\nimages, and we observe that these images are often\nused to indicate confrontation between the \ufb01gures\nPositive Negative Neutral0204060%/uni00A0of/uni00A0ImagesFacial/uni00A0Emotions/uni00A0in/uni00A0AllSides\nLeft\nLean/uni00A0Left\nCenter\nLean/uni00A0Right\nRightFigure 5: Facial emotions strati\ufb01ed by ideology from\nhuman annotations of AllSides.

We\n\ufb01nd a trend that articles from a particular ideology\ntend to have more images of the opposing \ufb01gure\n(e.g., right-leaning media contains more images of\nObama). This is likely a result of attack politics\n(Haynes and Rhine, 1998; Theilmann and Wilhite,\n1998), where politicians attack their opponent in-\nstead of bolstering their own position, especially\nwhen campaigning. This type of negative cam-\npaigning has been shown to be employed more by\nRepublicans (Lau and Pomper, 2001).\nLastly, we analyze the emotion of the \ufb01gures\nin AllSides (Figure 5). Across all ideologies, the\nmajority of faces have negative or neutral emo-\ntion. Consumers actually prefer negative news\nover positive news (Trussler and Soroka, 2014),\nand negative images in news are more memorable\n(Newhagen and Reeves, 1992; Newhagen, 1998).\nSpeci\ufb01cally for facial expressions, liberal and con-\nservative news sources have differences in portray-\nals of Donald Trump (Boxell, 2021). Angry facial\nemotion primes also tend to increase trust in neg-\native news messages (Ravaja and K\u00e4tsyri, 2014).\nThis may explain why more extreme Left and Right\nnews sources, which are more likely to contain less\ncredible news (Allen et al., 2020), have a higher\nrate of negative emotion faces than Lean-Left and\nLean-Right.\n4 Models\nArmed with new diverse datasets of articles and im-\nages, we now propose several models, input encod-\ning strategies, and pretraining regimens to tackle\nImage\nEncoder\nText\nEncoderArticle\nImage\nText\nOnMonday, President JoeBiden\ncalled forcalm intheaftermath\nofafatal police shooting of\nDaunte Wright, a20-year-old\nblack man, inMinneapolis ;this\ncomes shortly after the\nMinneapolis police chief said he\nbelieved the officer involved\nmistakenly used agun instead of\naTaser .\u2026Cross -\nModal\nAttnClassifier IdeologyFigure 6: High-level structure of the late-fusion model\narchitecture.

Because of our\nfocus on faces, we experiment with several face-\naware image preprocessing methods before encod-\ning the images. These methods are described in Ap-\npendix F but were ultimately not successful. Thus,\nwe use the images unchanged.\n4.2 Multimodal Models\nEarly Fusion Also known as single-stream, an\nearly fusion model takes the joint sequence of text\nand images as input and merges both modalities\nto obtain a single representation. We experiment\nwith VisualBERT (Li et al., 2019) and ViLT (Kim\net al., 2021), two Transformer-based models that\nhave demonstrated strong performance on a series\nof vision-and-language downstream tasks such as\nVQAv2 (Goyal et al., 2017), NLVR2 (Suhr et al.,\n2019), and Flickr30K (Plummer et al., 2015). Visu-\nalBERT concatenates words and image segments\nidenti\ufb01ed by an object detector, with an additional\nembedding indicating the input modality. Instead\nof using object detectors, we feed in faces detected\nby DeepFace, as we consider political \ufb01gures more\nrelevant to the ideology prediction task. ViLT is\na similar architecture, but with separate positional\nembeddings for the text and image inputs and does\nnot use an object detector. We use the pretrained\nweights released publicly by the authors.\nLate Fusion Also known as dual-stream, two\nmodels separately encode each modality; then the\ntwo representations are joined into a single rep-\nresentation. This is in contrast to early fusion,\nwhere a single encoder processes the image and\ntext jointly. We use RoBERTa to encode the text,\nand Swin Transformer to encode images.\nWe evaluate several representation joining mech-\nanisms: concatenation, Hadamard productJ,\ngated fusion (Wu et al., 2021), and cross-modal\nattention (LXMERT; Tan and Bansal, 2019). Gated\nfusion combines the two representations by learn-\ning a gate vector \u0015so that the combined repre-\nsentation is h=htext+\u0015Jhimg. For cross-\nmodal attention, (Hendricks et al., 2021) has com-\nprehensively analyzed different types of attention\nmechanisms and found that the coattention scheme\n(given queries from one modality, e.g., image,\nkeys and values can be taken only from the other\nmodality, e.g., language) has the best performance.\nTherefore, we use the co-attention scheme for our\ncross-modal attention module; our implementation\nlargely resembles the cross-modal attention module\nin LXMERT, with the number of cross-modality\nlayers NXincreased from 5 to 6.\n4.3 Continued Pretraining to Inject\nKnowledge of Ideology\nRecent work has shown that continuing to train\na pretrained model on domain-speci\ufb01c data or on\nan auxiliary task can improve the model\u2019s perfor-\nmance on the target task (Beltagy et al., 2019; Gu-\nrurangan et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020). In this vein,\nwe aim to improve our ideology prediction model\nby performing continued pretraining with relevant\nobjectives and auxiliary data.\nFor pretraining the image encoder, we experi-\nment with an InfoNCE loss (Sohn, 2016; Van den\nOord et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2021), a con-\ntrastive loss computed within each batch, where\nthe image and text encoders are trained to maxi-\nmize the cosine similarity of the image and text em-\nbeddings of the ncorrect pairs in the batch, while\nminimizing the cosine similarity of the embeddings\nof then2\u0000nincorrect pairings. We use this loss\nwith images and their captions, with the hypothesis\nthat supervision from captions will allow the image\nencoder to develop a more robust representationand potentially learn features of the image that are\npresent in the caption.\nWe also experiment with a bidirectional cap-\ntioning loss (VirTex; Desai and Johnson, 2021), in\nwhich the image embedding is passed to an image\ncaptioning Transformer head, which generates a\ncorresponding caption token by token in both the\nleft-to-right and right-to-left directions.\nFinally, we propose a novel triplet mar-\ngin loss on triplets of news (anchor, positive,\nnegative), where the positive pair shares\nthe same ideology with the anchor, while\nthe negative image has a different ideol-\nogy than the anchor. Mathematically, L=P\nt2T\u0002\njjt(a)\u0000t(p)jj2\u0000jjt(a)\u0000t(n)jj2+\u000b\u0003\n+,\nwhereTis the set of news triplets in the training\nset;t(a),t(p), andt(n)are the joint representations\nof text and image (concatenated and passed\nthrough a linear transformation) of the anchor,\npositive, and negative news in triplet t.\u000bis a\nbias term; and [\u0001]+is the ramp function max(\u0001;0).\nThis is inspired by the triplet loss used in FaceNet\n(Schroff et al., 2015) and is similar to the triplet\nideology loss proposed by (Liu et al., 2022a), who\npretrain a text-only ideology prediction model with\nthis loss. We apply this loss to pretrain the image\nencoder, text encoder, and embedding combination\ncomponents of our model.\n5 Experiments\nWe \ufb01rst perform preliminary experiments compar-\ning single-modality models to determine whether\nthe inclusion of images helps ideology prediction.\nThen, we evaluate multimodal experimental setups,\nexhaustively selecting an image encoder, embed-\nding combination methods, and pretraining meth-\nods; performing the continued pretraining; then\n\ufb01netuning the entire model on the task of ideology\nprediction.\nImplementation Details We implement the new\nmodels in PyTorch, importing existing models from\ntheir authors\u2019 respective GitHub pages. All mod-\nels were trained for a maximum of 20 epochs with\nearly-stopping patience of 4. For detailed hyperpa-\nrameters for pretraining and \ufb01netuning and other\nspeci\ufb01c implementation details, please refer to our\ncode on the project page.\n6 Results and Analysis\nText-Only and Image-Only Models We \ufb01rst\npresent unimodal experiments on AllSides in Ta-\nText Enc Image Enc Image Prep Acc.

Early fusion models perform worse than text-\nonly baselines (found in Table 5). In late fusion mod-\nels, the embedding joining methods show no signi\ufb01cant\ndifference. However, the best performing model with\nno pretraining is the late fusion RoBERTa+Swin model\nwith cross-modal attention.\nble 5. We \ufb01nd that the vision-only model performs\nsigni\ufb01cantly worse than the text-only baseline, in-\ndicating that an image alone is inadequate for pre-\ndicting ideology. Surprisingly, Swin-Small slightly\noutperforms Swin-Base (which is larger in size),\nthough the difference is not substantial. Thus, we\ndecided to use Swin-Small (Swin-S) as the image\nencoder backbone for our multimodal models due\nto its performance and size. These baseline results\nmotivate the premise of multimodal ideology pre-\ndiction, in which we use images as additional signal\nto augment the text.\nMultimodal Models without Pretraining Next,\nwe present multimodal model results without pre-\ntraining in Table 6. We \ufb01nd that early fusion mod-\nels cannot outperform the text-only baselines, in\ncontrast to late fusion models, indicating that the\ncombination of text and image is bene\ufb01cial for ide-\nology prediction, but the choice of architecture is\nimportant. The late fusion architecture with cross-\nmodal attention performs the best, and thus we take\nthis model as our starting point for the rest of the\nexperiments in this paper.Multimodal Models with Pretraining We then\nexhaustively experiment with combinations of pre-\ntraining objectives for each component of the\nmodel (language encoder, image encoder, and\ncross-modal attention) for ablation and analysis.\nResults on the AllSides evaluation set are shown in\nTable 7.\nFirst, we \ufb01nd that replacing RoBERTa with the\npretrained POLITICS model already gains a 1% im-\nprovement to the overall model. By pretraining on\nsimilar domain text, the model is able to generate\nbetter text representations. Liu et al. (2022a) \ufb01nd\nthat the POLITICS objective allows the model to\nperform much better on left-leaning articles, which\nhave higher perplexity (i.e. the language is more\ndiverse). In a multimodal setup, we \ufb01nd that this\ntext encoder helps the multimodal model improve\non right-leaning input data more than left-leaning,\nindicating that the inclusion of images helps the\nclassi\ufb01cation of right-leaning ideology.\nFor pretraining the image encoder, our experi-\nments show that the VirTex-style bidirectional cap-\ntioning loss performs better than the InfoNCE con-\ntrastive learning objective. This pretraining method\nallows the model to better capture the similarities\nbetween the image and its associated text. Text\nmay also provide a more semantically dense signal\nthan contrastive approaches (Desai and Johnson,\n2021), thus leading to better performance.\nFor pretraining the cross-modal attention, we\n\ufb01nd that our proposed Triplet Margin Loss objec-\ntive, which optimizes all three components (image\nencoder, text encoder, cross-modal attention) of the\nentire model, improves over no pretraining.\nOverall, ablation experiments show that the best\ncombination (RoBERTa pretrained with POLITICS\nloss, and Swin pretrained with VirTex loss on the\nimage encoder) contribute around 1 percentage\npoint and 2 percentage points respectively (Table 7).\nFurther combining them with the triplet margin loss\nleads to the best-performing model, with more than\n3 percentage points over the baseline late-fusion\nmodel.\nTwitter & Reddit Finally, we evaluate our mod-\nels on the Reddit and Twitter datasets to get a more\ncomprehensive perspective of the model\u2019s ideology\nprediction ability on different domains. Results\nare presented in Table 8.

Due to domain\nmismatch, performance on Reddit and Twitter is worse than on AllSides. However, the addition of pretraining\nimproves overall performance. For a detailed breakdown by ideology, see Tables G.1 and G.3.\nnews articles. However, the improvements over a\ntext-only baseline are more substantial than on All-\nSides, where the long text already contains enough\ninformation for predicting ideology. We also \ufb01nd\nthat for Twitter, which was split into left, center,\nand right ideologies, the models perform poorly\non Center tweets, probably due to high dataset im-\nbalance (Table 2), though the addition of images\ngreatly improved over text-only models.\n7 Conclusion\nThis paper introduces the task of \ufb01ne-grained mul-\ntimodal ideology prediction, where a model pre-\ndicts one of \ufb01ve ideologies leanings given a pair\nof text and an image. We collect \ufb01ve new large-\nscale datasets of political images and present an\nin-depth characterization of these images, exam-\nining aspects such as facial features across ideolo-\ngies. We experiment with a combination of state-\nof-the-art multimodal architectures and pretraining\nschemes, including a newly-proposed triplet mar-\ngin loss objectives. Along with the release of our\ndatasets, our experimental \ufb01ndings will inform the\nselection of models and training objectives in future\nwork and spur future research in politics, ideology\nprediction, and other multimodal tasks.Acknowledgments\nThis work is supported in part by the National Sci-\nence Foundation under grant III-2127747 and by\nthe Air Force Of\ufb01ce of Scienti\ufb01c Research through\ngrant FA9550-22-1-0099.

The\narticles and images from AllSides, Reddit, Twitter,\nand the 11 news sources are copyrighted by their\nrespective sources. We consulted Section 10713\nof the U.S. Copyright Act and ensured that our\ncollection action fell under the fair use category.\nAs we are not the copyright holders, we do not\nrelease the images that we collected. Rather, we\nprovide code for analyzing these datasets for those\nwho may already have the datasets. In addition, to\ndiscourage the misuse of the data, we warn users\nabout potential misuse and any ethical concerns\n13https://www.copyright.gov/title17/\n92chap1.html#107 .\nthat could raise from improperly dealing with the\ndata.\nFacial Recognition\nWe use DeepFace to perform facial recognition as\nwell as attribute recognition for gender, race, and\nemotion. However, in this work, we only use Deep-\nFace to perform analysis (rather than prediction)\non our new datasets, and we compare DeepFace\u2019s\nanalyses with human annotations. The categories\nfor gender, race, and emotion are de\ufb01ned by Deep-\nFace. Though some may question these categories,\nit is not within the scope of this paper to argue for\nor against them.\nAs mentioned in Section 3.3, DeepFace often\nclassi\ufb01es Barack Obama and Eric Holder as His-\npanic or Middle Eastern, and Donald Trump as\nAsian. This is likely due to models learning that\ndark skin or squinty eyes, respectively, are impor-\ntant features predictive of race. As researchers, we\nmust be aware of these biases in the models and\nbe careful not to reinforce racial stereotypes due\nto models\u2019 predictions. We do not explicitly use\nrace, gender, or ethnicity as features in our predic-\ntion model. Moreover, we call on all researchers\nto deal with automatic facial recognition tools like\nDeepFace carefully and take all possible biases into\nconsideration.\nIdeology\nIn our work, we have made several assumptions\nabout ideology, namely that the ideology of a\nnews source, Reddit subreddit, and Tweet author\nis consistent. This may not always be true; a left-\nleaning post may appear in r/Conservative ,\nor a politician on Twitter may be a moderate whose\ntweets re\ufb02ect liberal and conservative stances on\ndifferent issues. However, these are relatively rare\ncases, and we will warn all potential users about\nsuch cases.\nModel\nIntended Use The use case we have described\nfor our multimodal ideology prediction model is\nto educate users about ideology bias in media of\nvarious genres with both texts and images.\nFailure mode The failure mode referred to a case\nwhere our model fails to predict the correct ideol-\nogy of a piece of media work with both text and\nimage. While we showed that these models have\nhigh accuracy, the models are not 100% perfect.End users of our model must not take model pre-\ndictions as fact. We encourage end users to consult\nmachine learning experts as well as political scien-\ntists when using our models.\nLimitations\nFacial Recognition As our analysis has shown,\nDeepFace is not 100% reliable as an automatic\nannotation tool. To con\ufb01dently use DeepFace as an\nanalysis tool, manual annotation (which we have\ndone in the paper) is necessary but time-consuming,\nrequiring human labor.\nCompute Resources - GPUs Due to the scale of\nthe data (summarized in Table 1) and the size of\nthe model (summarized in Table 9), pretraining is\nextremely computationally expensive and requires\nlarge GPU resources. Our experiments are per-\nformed using 2 NVIDIA RTX A6000 and 2 Quadro\nRTX 8000 GPUs. Batch sizes are chosen to meet\nhardware constraints and we pretrain the models\nfor 2500 steps. The pretraining on BN-I MGCAP\nandBNA-I MGtakes approximately 3 and 4 days,\nrespectively.\nModel # parameters\nRoBERTa / POLITICS 125M\nSwin-T 29M\nSwin-S 50M\nSwin-B 88M\nRoBERTa+Swin-S 175M\nRoBERTa+Swin-S+Cross-modal Attn. 273M\nTable 9: Number of parameters in each model.\nReferences\nJennifer Allen, Baird Howland, Markus Mobius, David\nRothschild, and Duncan J Watts. 2020.

Images were obtained by searching for\n<img> tags within the article\u2019s HTML. The cap-\ntions were obtained as follows. We started with\nexamining the alt attribute of the <img> tags,\nwhich often contain the caption. For Associated\nPress, we identi\ufb01ed captions in a different part of\nthe HTML and extracted them using regex match-\ning. To ensure that captions adequately describe\ntheir images and prevent data spillage, we use\nregex matching to remove portions of the captions\ncontaining names of photographers and the news\nsource name, such as \u201c(TOM SMITH/NEW YORK\nTIMES)\u201d. We also discard captions shorter than 30\ncharacters, which were often a series of keywords\nrather than an entire sentence.\nB List of News Sources from AllSides\nThe following are the 25 news sources in AllSides:\nBBC News, Breitbart News, CBN, Christian Sci-\nence Monitor, CNN, Fox News, HuffPost, Na-\ntional Review, New York Times, Newsmax, NPR,\nPolitico, Reason, Reuters, Salon, The Guardian,\nThe Hill, TheBlaze.com, Townhall, USA TODAY ,\nV ox, Wall Street Journal, Washington Examiner,\nWashington Post, Washington Times.\nC Preprocessing Images for DeepFace\nWe \ufb01rst perform entity linking on the text portion\nof AllSides articles using the Google Cloud Natural\nLanguage API,14identifying 9,556 entities (73K\ntotal occurrences) that have Wikipedia pages. We\nkeep 817 entities with more than 10 occurrences in\nthe AllSides training set and also discard entities\nsuch as God,Jesus , orRussians that are clearly not\npolitician names, resulting in a list of 722 entities.\nFor each of these entities, we query Google Images\nwith their name and download 50 images \ufb01ltered\nto contain only a single face (as detected by Deep-\nFace). Finally, we compute the similarity between\neach of the 50 images to select 10 reference images\nwith the highest average similarity.\nD Annotator Agreement with DeepFace\nAgreement with DeepFace Because inter-\nannotator agreement on the pilot study was high,\n14https://cloud.google.com/natural-\nlanguage/docs/analyzing-entitiesone author of this paper annotated images from\n200 news stories following the above guidelines.\nWe compute Cohen\u2019s kappa to measure the agree-\nment between our annotator and the DeepFace\npredictions. A summary of statistics is shown in\nFigure D.2. We examine each aspect of the images\nin turn.\nFor the number of people in an image, \u0014= 0.69\nindicates relatively high agreement. Note that we\nbin 6+ people into the \u201cgroup\u201d label. In most cases,\ndisagreement stemmed from DeepFace recognizing\nmore faces than the annotator; these faces were\noften small, blurred, or partially obscured.\nFor the main \ufb01gures in an image, DeepFace does\nnot explicitly have such a notion, and we did not\ntell the annotator what a \u201cmain \ufb01gure\u201d should be.\nBy examining the annotations, we \ufb01nd that main\n\ufb01gures tend to be large, often in the center of the\nimage, and in focus (i.e., not blurred). The num-\nber of main \ufb01gures per ideology is presented in\nFigure D.1.\nDeepFace however does rank the extracted faces\nby their saliency. For each image, we examine\nthe most salient face identi\ufb01ed by the model and\ncompare it with our annotator\u2019s labels. First, we\n\ufb01nd that identifying the \ufb01gure\u2019s name results in\nlow-annotator agreement ( \u0014= 0.32). We observe\nthat DeepFace is often not able to recognize faces\nif they are relatively small in the image, or if the\nface is in side pro\ufb01le, even if the image is of a\nwell-known \ufb01gure. This indicates that although\nfacial recognition tools are adept at detecting the\npresence of a face, they may be sensitive to the\nsize of the face when identifying the face. We\nalso \ufb01nd that DeepFace incorrectly predicts Matt\nBevin (former governor of Kentucky) and Jacob\nBlake (a black man who was a victim of a police\nshooting) for many images. Due to their unusually\nhigh frequency in model predictions, we believe\nthat these two images may represent the model\u2019s\nnotion of a \u201cstereotypical\u201d white man and black\nman, respectively.\nFor gender, DeepFace shows high agreement ( \u0014\n= 0.76) with our annotator. Gender can be easily re-\ntrieved from a database once the person is correctly\nidenti\ufb01ed. Nevertheless, we \ufb01nd it interesting to\nnote that DeepFace\u2019s mistakes were all misclassify-\ning women as men; these instances included Hillary\nClinton, Samantha Power, Gina Haspel, and Patty\nMurray.\nSimilar to gender, race can also be queried if the\n012340.00.20.4Left\n012340.000.250.50Lean Left\n01234\n# of Main Figures0.00.5Center\n012340.000.250.50Lean Right\n012340.000.250.50RightFigure D.1: Number of main \ufb01gures in images from different ideologies.

However, race is also problem-\natic in several regards, one of which is mixed-race\n\ufb01gures (e.g., Barack Obama). DeepFace predicts\na single most apparent race, and we asked our an-\nnotator to do the same. Annotator agreement on\ngender prediction was relatively low ( \u0014= 0.34).\nSome common errors by DeepFace include Barack\nObama and Eric Holder being misclassi\ufb01ed as His-\npanic/Latino (possibly due to skin color) and Don-\nald Trump being misclassi\ufb01ed as Asian (possibly\ndue to eye size).\nEmotion is dif\ufb01cult to annotate. Our annota-\ntor labeled \ufb01ne-grained emotion for about 20% of\nimages, remarking that it was dif\ufb01cult to distin-\nguish negative emotions. By grouping emotions\ninto three large bins (positive, negative, neutral),\nDeepFace achieves moderate agreement ( \u0014= 0.45)\nwith the annotator. The main disagreements were\nbetween negative and neutral emotions.\nE Information about Reddit and Twitter\nDatasets\nThe top 10 tweeters from each ideology, along with\ntheir tweeting stats, are shown in Table E.2.\nSimilar to Reddit, Twitter imposes a character\nlimit on the length of posts (280 characters).\nF Models\nImage Preprocessing Our preliminary analysis\nof images in our dataset shows that the majority ofLeft Lean Left Center Lean Right Right\nContains Trump 15.1% 9.1% 10.5% 16.2% 12.1%\nContains Obama 3.5% 3.4% 1.8% 4.6% 5.5%\nContains Clinton 3.1% 3.3% 1.2% 4.1% 3.4%\nContains Biden 1.2% 2.3% 4.7% 2.9% 2.2%\nWith Trump 2.4 1.6 2.3 1.0 0.7\nWith Obama 0.7 1.5 0.0 1.8 0.6\nWith Clinton 1.8 4.0 0.0 0.6 1.4\nWith Biden 0.0 0.9 0.5 0.2 1.0\nTable D.1: Analysis of images in AllSides, focusing on\nthe top 4 most frequent politicians.

Overall, our VirTex-style late-fusion\nmodel with the triplet margin loss performs best.However, accuracy is worse than on the AllSides\ndataset due to data mismatch: the models are\ntrained on entire news articles, but Reddit titles\nare short.\nTable G.2 presents results on the Twitter dataset\nfor the 3-way classi\ufb01cation task (Left, Right, Cen-\nter). We \ufb01nd that performance on the Center ideol-\nogy is low, due to the relative lack of training data\ncompared to Left and Right ideologies. In addition,\nthe late-fusion multimodal models surprisingly per-\nform worse than the text-only models. Because\nperformance on the Center class was poor, we also\nexperimented with a 2-way classi\ufb01cation of Left\nvs. Right, whose results are shown in Table G.3. In\nthis experiment, we again \ufb01nd that pretraining with\nour triplet margin loss improves performance, es-\npecially on Right-leaning tweets, over vision-only\nbaselines.\nReddit\nCategory Model Overall Acc.

The hypothesis is that posted prompts and the bench \nitself will increase website traffic and visibility of susta inable actions at Western Michigan \nUniversity. Website traffic will be monitored using Google Analytics software which will allow \nfor tracking of website visits specifically from scanning the QR code. Thus, data from bench \ninstallation and from bench insta llation with prompts will be compared with baseline data from \nbefore installation of the bench and before installation graphic prompts. Data that supports the \nhypothesis, increased website traffic, will lend additional backing to other research on the use of \ngraphic prompts and QR codes to increase behavior and interaction with online entities as well as \nusage of the solar charging bench by participants. Future research with collection of participant \ndemographics could be conducted in order to analyze which  groups out of a more general \npopulation may be influenced more by prompts, QR codes, and usage of the bench. This has \nlarge implications relating to the advancement of sustainability at Western Michigan University \nand the increased visibility of sustainab le actions being taken by the university.  \n  \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                3 \n The Effects of QR Code Prompts Posted to a Solar Charging Bench on Website Sustainability  \n \nOn December 12th, 2015, the majority of nations across the world created a document \nrecognizing the immense need to cultivate a sustainable future. This document, known as the \nParis Agreement, was created at the United Nations Climate Change Conference and comprises \ngoals and charges for each signatory nation to reach regarding the reduction of their individual \nimpacts on the environment. One of the main goals is to keep the global temperature from rising \nmore than two degrees Celsius  this century by red ucing greenhouse gas emissions. According to \nthe United Nations Climate Change Convention website, much of the agreement is comprised of \nways to reach the goals and charges set forth by outlining the impacts of climate change and a \nfinancial pathway toward s reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To date, 184 of 197 United \nNations countries have signed the agreement while the United States has withdrawn their \nratification. The Paris Agreement is an excellent example of the majority of nations around the \nworld re cognizing the impact humans are leaving on the environment and how harmful it has \nbecome. A global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a necessary step towards a \nsustainable future.  \n The current United States government administration withdrew the ir ratification of the \nParis Agreement with a formal announcement of the withdrawal from United States president on \nJune 1st, 2017. With many harsh criticisms of the withdrawal, ScienceDirect , a news source with \nhighly factual, science -based , and middle ground  reporting (Van Zandt, 2016), notes that there \nare many sources of speculation as to why the United States withdrew from the climate \nagreement, but one of the most import aspects to focus on in the situation is the impact the \nwithdrawal could have on t he environment. One main concern, is a lack of research funding \ncoming from the United States (Zhang, Dai, Lai, & Wang, 2017) .  \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                4 \n The United States is p erhaps one of the most well -equipped countries in which \nimperative sci entific research can be done . The country is wealthy and has a multitude of \nresearch -focused government agencies which, due to the climate agreement withdrawal, will not \nbe focusing on the reductions of greenhouse gas emissions as outlined in the Paris Agreement. \nWhile this limits th e ability of the United States to actively reduce climate change, it also has a \nharmful impact on smaller countries ratified to the agreement. Smaller, poorer countries may not \nhave the financial and governmental resources to conduct their own research on climate change, \nand will rely on research done by other countries. Without the United States\u2019 research, these \nsmaller countries efforts to fit in accordance to the agreement could suffer. One reaction to the \ngovernment\u2019s inability to provide relevant resea rch, is to look to research universities in th e \nUnited States, as discussed  by Atkinson and Blanpied (2008). The United States has some of the \nbest research universities in the world and they are able to contribute published empirical \nresearch to the field  of environmental sustainability. Additionally, many university entities have \nentered into university -wide agreements to work toward reducing their harmful impacts on the \nenvironment. Two ways colleges have started to implement sustainability institution -wide are the \nTalloires Declaration and STARS.  \n The Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future (ULSF) published the \nTalloires Declaration in October 1990 after Tufts University president, Jean Mayer, brought \ntwenty -two university presidents together in Talloires, France to brainstorm about the state of the \nworld. According to the Brief History of the Talloires Declaration page on the ULSF website, \nthey, together, created a list of charges that institutions must take on in order to foster a \nsustainable future (ULSF 2015). As of July 1st, 2018, 504 institutions in 59 countries have \nsigned. The declaration is a ten -point action plan on how universities will pledge to promote a \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                5 \n sustainable future. Those ten point are: \u201c(a) Increase awareness of en vironmentally sustainable \ndevelopment, (b) create an institutional culture of sustainability, (c) educate for environmental \nresponsible citizenship, (d) foster environmental literacy for all, (e) practice institutional ecology, \n(f) involve all stakeholders , (g) collaborate for interdisciplinary approaches, (h) enhance capacity \nof primary and secondary schools, (i) broaden service and outreach nationally and \ninternationally, and (j) maintain the movement. Institutions, once signed to the declaration, are \ncharged with its implementation\u201d ( Talloires Declaration, 1990) . The ULSF provides information \non how different universities have implemented the points of the declaration.  \nIn similar fashion to the ULSF\u2019s Talloires Declaration  (1990) , the Association for the \nAdvancement of Sustainability in Higher Education  (AASHE), is an organization with a mission \n\u201cto inspire and catalyze higher education to lead the global sustaina bility transformation\u201d \n(AASHE, 2005, p. 1 ). The association launched in Portland, Oregon in 20 05 with two staff \nmembers, and since then have taken great strides towards the education and implementation of \nsustainable practices in higher education. One of their main programs is Sustainability Tracking, \nAssessment & Rating System (STARS). AASHE descr ibes this assessment as \u201ca transparent, self -\nreporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their susta inability performance\u201d \n(AASHE, 2005, p.3 ). Universities are invited to complete the assessment and then receive  one of \nfive ratings: Report er, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Each rating level is broken down into \nfour additional categories of sustainable interventions: Academics, Engagement, Operation, and \nPlanning and Administration. An institution receives a score based on points it ear ns by working \ntowards credits in the four main categories ( AASHE , 2019 ). Credits are given to universities \nusing the following considerations :  \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                6 \n \u25cf \u201cExtent to which the achievement of the credit ensure s that people acquire the \nknowledge, skills and dispositions to meet sustainability challenge;  \n\u25cf To what extent does the achievement of the credit contribute to (a) human and ecological \nhealth and mitigate negative environmental impacts; (b) secure livelihood s, a sustainable \neconomy and other positive financial impacts, and (c) social justice, equity, diversity, \ncooperation, democracy, and other positive social impacts and;  \n\u25cf To what extent are the positive impacts associated with achievement of the credit not \ncaptured in  other STARS credits?\u201d (AASHE, 2019, p .2). \nThis rating is public information universities can us e it to track their progress as  they try \nto move further towards a higher level of sustainability. They are also able to compare their \nperformance aga inst other institutions who have completed the assessment. This assessment goes \nhand in hand with the Talloires Declaration in that it is a guide for universities to implement the \ncharges they are given once signed on to the declaration.  \n The general publ ic wants to see a greater reliance on solar energy (Burger, 2012). It is \none of the most widely accepted and least worried about forms of renewable energy currently \nbeing used. Several hundred individuals in the Rutgers University community were interviewe d \nfollowing the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011  in which radiation from nuclear power \ngenerators was released and a large oil spill ensued.  Participants were asked to rate their worry \nabout seven different types of energy sources [nuclear, chemical, coa l, hydro, solar, wind, a nd \ngas] across six different categories [exposure from everyday occurrences, transportation, \nexposure from plant, exposure from food or water, worker exposure, and exposure to wildlife]. \nSubjects were also asked to rate individual r isk factors related specifically to each category \nwhere solar energy\u2019s was \u201charmful UV radiation exposure to wildlife\u201d as well as subject rating \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                7 \n on not wanting future development of each energy source. Results showed that solar and wind \nenergy were the lea st worried about energy sources. So lar was the second lowest category in the \n\u201cpercentage that do not want future development\u201d section with hydro power slightly lower. The \npublic wants solar energy and trusts solar energy. While it can be difficult to imple ment new \ntrial-type interventions focused on sustainability at the business and even governmental level, \ncolleges can be a great alternative setting. They are institutions of higher learning and foster \nsetting of community engagement and communication whil e often putting an emphasis on the \n\u2018cutting edge\u2019 of new research.  \n One example of this is illustrated by Petersen, Shunturov, Platt, and Weinberger (2007) \noutlining an intervention in which college dormitory residents reduced their electricity \nconsumptio n by implementing feedback and incentives. This study separated groups into \u201chigh -\nresolution\u201d immediate web -based feedback and \u201clow -resolution\u201d feedback delivered once per \nweek based on the overall dorm\u2019s ability to reduce electricity use. The purpose of t his study was \nto show that education on a sustainability issue, in this case electricity consumption, while \ncombined with feedback would cause participants to engage in behaviors that would reach the \nend-goal. This study is a great example of how sustainab le interventions can start and thrive at \nthe higher -education level. However, one limitation is that specific behavior was not monitored. \nResearchers were unsure of what specific behaviors residents were engaging in in order to reduce \ntheir electricity con sumption, just that their wide array of behaviors was causing them to achieve \nthe terminal goal of the study.  \n Anot her university -level study focused  on individual sorting behavior. Binder  (2012)  \nconducted a study out of Western Michigan University, where  it was found, during a waste audit, \nthat almost one third of landfill waste from a university building was material that could have \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                8 \n been recycled. If proper sorting behavior could be established, there was potential for a reduction \non recyclable materials  ending up in the landfill. Binder introduced a multi -faceted intervention \nconsisting of three separate components: (a) \u201caesthetically pleasing\u201d waste receptacles with three \ndifferently -shaped openings for each type of w aste: landfill, paper/cardboard recy cling, and \nglass/plastic/m etal recycling, (b) the creation  and implementation of new signage on trash \nreceptacles outlining in text what could be placed in each section of the bins mounted above the \nrespective openings, and (c) placement of trash receptacl es in central locations through out the \nbuilding (Binder 2012, p. 11 -12). The results lent support to the conclusion that centrally -located \ntrash receptacles with appropriate signage and removal of trash receptacles from classrooms led \nto an increased amount of correct sorting behavior (Binder, 2012, pp. 38). Binder also analyzed \nsocial validity  measures noting that participants who took part in an optional survey found that \nthe new recycling/waste disposal method made it easier to correctly sort recycling and trash and \nthe new bins were well -liked.  \n While both of th e previous studies, Petersen et al. (2007) and Binder (2012), are excellent \nexamples of university -level sustainability interventions, they still may encompass barriers to \ncampus sustainability as identified by Horhota, Asman, Strat ton, and Halfacre (2 014) in an \nanalysis of the behavi oral barriers to many studies on campus sustainability. Four main \nbehavioral barriers in college setting were identified: \u201c(a) lack of engagement; (b) \ncommunication issues; (c) lack of proper campus infrastructure; and (d) financial conc erns\u201d \n(Horhota et  al., 2014 , p.346). From the previously discussed s tudies, the first two barriers, lack of \nengag ement and communication issues, can be explicitly seen. In the Petersen et  al. (2007) study \nlooking at electricity consumption, one main limitation was the inabil ity to measure specific and \nindividual behaviors. Researchers did not communicate with residents about their specific \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                9 \n behaviors that led to the reduction of electricity consumption and as a result, a lack of \nengagement may have been overlooked. Some reside nts may not have engaged in any behaviors \nto reduce electricity consumption while others in the same building could have been \u2018pulling the \nweight\u2019 and engaging in more extreme behaviors. Binder (2012) focused on increasing proper \nrecycling behavior where t here may have been a lack of engagement by some participants. \nAgain, there was no way to study individual behavior. Two ways to curb a lack of engagement \nand communication issues in campus sustainability interventions is to increase the saliency of the \ninterventions and to pair that with free -choice learning experiences.  \n Many opportunities for people to learn about sustainability come from formal education \nwhere i t is usually a requirement to do  readings and complete coursework on sustainability \nissues. O ne little -explored alternative to formal education of sustainability is free -choice \nlearning. This involves education outside of formal education programs where individuals \nchoose on their own accord to seek out the relevant information. It is noted that i nformal \neducation, or free -choice learning, is generally aimed at subjects much broader than those in \nformal education.  \nBallantyne and Packer (2005) explain that free -choice learning can play to the advantage \nof sustainability where desired learning outco mes are often broad such as inspiring curiosity \nabout the subject and evoking emotions in hopes of leading to environmentally sustainable \npractice s (p. 281 -282). The article is a review of where the field was at with literature, in 2005, \nwith regards to th e use of free -choice learning to increase sustainable behavior and attitudes. One \nway to encourage free -choice learning is through issue exhibitions. This involves experiences, \nusually set up in public places such as museums, which  encourage individuals to interact with \ntangible objects related to a social issu e (p. 287). With the implementation  of exhibits, learners \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                10 \n are often able to increase their awareness of the issue through interaction. In many cases \ndescribed in the article, exhibits are used to challenge the perspectives of learners and require \nthem to think critically. The current study will take a step back from this, where the goal is to \nspark interest through interaction, but the principal of the exhibit still applies. Ad ditionally, i n \norder to increase interaction with these sort of exhibitions, it is important to increase their \nsaliency.  \n O\u2019Neill, Blanck, and Joyner (1980) focused on how to increase stimulus control, or \nsaliency, of objects in order to achieve a higher level of interaction with those objects. This study \naimed to increase proper disposal of litter into trash receptacles at a large universi ty football \nstadium. O\u2019Neill et  al. (1980) states that while reinforcement can reduce littering, it is \nimpractical and  difficult to provide reinforcement in natural setting where there are cost \nproblems and also logistical problems with distribution of reinforcers. Thus, the idea to increase \nstimulus control over trash receptacles was implemented. Some of the regular tras h receptacles, \n55-gallon orange drums, were modified to include a door with the word \u201cPUSH\u201d written on it \nand when done so, a makeshift plywood hat, modeled after hats commonly worn to the stadium, \nwith built in electronics would be lifted along with the u nderside of the door which said \n\u201cTHANKS\u201d being exposed.  Except for one out of the four monitored football games, the weight \nin litter deposited into the trash receptacles was near double for the modified receptacles when \ncompared to the original receptacl es. The more salient, and novel, receptacles had increased \nstimulus control and led to an increase in proper litter disposal.  \n Several studies have been conducted using graphic prompts to increase consumer  \nlearning and engagement. Lai, Chang , Li, Fan, and Wu (2013) used QR codes to increase mobile \nlearning. As mentioned previously by B allantyne & Packer (2005), learning taking place outside \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                11 \n of the classroom had qualities that can go above and beyond traditional education. Whereas \nBallantyne &  Packer (2005) focus on the free -choice aspect, Lai et  al. (2013) focus on an \noutdoor environment as a way to provide contextual experiences. They use  smartphones, which \nhave the ability to read QR codes and have wireless internet access, as a way to acces s learning \nexperiences in outdoor environments. While students were still under instruction, it was in an \nenvironment related to their content. Students were put in contact with learning content as a \nresult of scanning QR codes in outdoor locations. In imp lementation, students were taken on \nexploration activities and used their smartphones to scan the QR codes to gain access to \ninformation such as information about plants found in the outdoor area. This type of learning, \nwhile still formally instructed, did  provide students access to a tangible learning experience and \nease of access to information on mobile devices.  \n One positive aspect of QR codes are that they are very low -effort. With very little \ninstructi on, users can understand how to use QR codes in order to access information more \nquickly than looking it up manually. Gao, Liu, and Paas (2016) examine d the effort of QR code \nuse versus manual selection. This study focused on using QR codes versus manual selection \nwhen students were required to pick out  specific types of plants. For the manual selection phase, \nstudents had to search for pictures of specific plants and for the QR code phase, students could \nscan QR codes attached to specific plants. It was found that when there were a high number of \nplants  to choose from, the lower -effort QR codes were more preferred to the manual selection \ntechnique. This lends support to the construction of the current study, which uses QR codes to \nimplement and prompt learning in a low -effort manor.   \n The current study aims to address each of the behavioral barriers to sustainability as \noutlined by Horhota et al. (2014) by increasing saliency of sustainable interventions and \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                12 \n implementing the use of QR code graphic prompts. This will involve the placement of a solar \ncharg ing bench in the outdoor area on the campus of a large Midwestern university and using QR \ncode graphic prompts posted to the bench to increase website traffic. The behavioral barriers to \nbe addressed are \u201c(a) lack of engagement; (b) communication issues; ( c) lack of proper campus \ninfrastructure; and (d) financial concerns\u201d (Horhota et  al., 2014 , p.346). Lack of engagement will \nbe diminished with the placement of the bench itself. This is a large, flashy, and salient new \nstructure being added to a very busy part of campus and it has opportunities for interaction. \nStudents will be able to sit and study under the solar panel canopy and have their electronic \ndevices charging from the energy gathered by the solar panels. Communication issues will  be \ntaken care of  with the info -graphic prompt which will have an embedded QR code for users to \nscan and gain access more information on why the bench is there and how it is sustainable. The \ncurrent lack of proper campus infrastructure will be taken care of by installation  of the bench \nitself and due to this study being funded by a grant and research being conducted as part of a \nproject, this will be cost -free to the university. Additionally, specific behavior will be measured \nthrough the use of unique URL data collection a nd a plug -load monitoring system. The current \nstudy aims to create a low -effort, salient, and free -choice learning experience in a contextual \noutdoor environment. This will be done by use of a large solar work station with info -graphic \nprompt QR codes to a llow users to access learning experiences.   \nMethod  \nParticipants and Setting  \nParticipants will be any users of the Sunbolt Campus XL solar charging bench. All of \nthose who scan the QR code and get directed to the website will be participants. There will be no \nexclusionary criteria. The study will be completed at the inst allation si te of the Campus XL, \nMiller Plaza near Brown Hall (Appendix B)  on Western Michigan University  campus. The \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                13 \n participants will scan the QR codes when prompted by graphic prompts attached to hardware and \nthe plug load monitoring system within the bench itself,  will record number of chargers clicked \nin, amount of solar energy harvested, and amount of solar energy output to devices.  \nApparatus and Materials  \nSolar charging bench. This research will be conducted using a Sunbolt Campus XL \nsolar charging bench which i s a branded solar charging bench (Figure 1) as well  as a graphic \nprompt specifically designed for the study (Figure 2 ). The solar charging bench will be placed in \nMiller Plaza due to its high volume of foot traffic. The close proximity to a large parking garage, \na large community auditorium situated on campus, and central location to many academic \nbuildings are the cause  of foot traffic. The bench  features two 4\u20196\" W\" x 1\u20192 \u00bd\u201d L bench seats on \neither side of a 4\u20196\u201d W x 3\u20196\u201d L table top. There is an ASTM A -500 Grade B structural steel \nvertical tube in the middle of the tabletop with a thickness of 3/16\u201d that supports a til ted solar \ncanopy with 8\u20193 \u00bd\u201d clearance on the high side and a 6\u201911 \u00be\u201d clearance on the low side. The \noverall table footprint of the bench measures 4\u20196\u201d W x 7\u20190\u201d L and the bench weighs 1,450 lbs. \nOverall. The structure is powder coated steel with wooden tab le and bench tops. The bench has a \nwind speed rating of 90mph self -ballasted meaning no surface attachment is required. The solar \ncharging system features a 1kW DC capacity array, four 120V electrical plugs, and eight USB \ncharging ports. The battery charge d by the solar array is 225 amp -hour and the charge is \ncontrolled by Morningstar TS -MPPT -45 (maximum power point tracking). The daily energy \nproduction of the bench can reach 3,800Wh. There is a twenty -five year warranty on solar panel \noutput.  \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                14 \n  \nFigure  1.

The current study will implement use of quick response \n(QR) codes embedded into a 4\u201d x 6\u201d graphic p rompt (Figu re 2) posted to the solar charging \nbench that participants may use to be directed to the website of interest; in this case, the Western \nMichigan University Office For Sustainability website. The QR code was generated by the \nexperimenters through qr-code -generator.com . When a participant opens the camera feature on \n\nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                15 \n their smartphone and has the QR code in the camera\u2019s view, they will be prompted to visit the \nwebsite.  \n \nFigure 2.

The prompts will feature text telling users to learn more by \nscanning the QR codes featured on them which will direct them by way of unique URL to the \nWestern Michigan University sustainability website. The QR codes generated online and posted \non the bench  will link participants to the Western Michigan University Sustainability website \nusing a unique URL created using Google Analytics (Trevellyan, 2017) allowing for monitoring \nof website hits generated specifically from the graphic prompts on the bench.  \nExperimental Design and Procedures  \n         This study will be run using an AB design.  There are limitations with using  an AB \ndesign, however, in the case of the current study, it will be necessary and some of the \nconfounding variables will be removed. In AB designs, there is no opportunity for reversal, \nwhich is used to show that the intervention is the variable that is changing results. In the current \nstudy, a complete reversal would not be possible. Due to the size of the Campus XL and the one -\ntime effort t o install it as a permanent fixture on Western Michigan University Campus, there \nwould be no way to remove it completely and then reinstall it. The graphic prompts can be \nremoved, however, it is not necessary. The QR codes will be the only way to access th e website \non the prompts. That is, there will be no link displayed. Due to this, scans on the QR codes will \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                17 \n generate their own unique URL allowing researchers to monitor which website hits come from \nthe graphic prompts and which did not. The future researc h section will examine possible \nextensions of the study in relation to changing the graphic prompts. For the purposes of the \ncurrent study, though, examination of just the implementation of the graphic prompts and bench \nare what will be analyzed.  \nBaseline. Baseline data will be collected by monitoring Western Michigan University \nsustainability website traffic before the implementation of the graphic prompts in the form of \nhow many users, unique and repeat, visit the website on an average weekly basis. Baseline data \nwill be collected for three weeks.  \nInstallation  of bench and QR p rompt . The Campus XL will be installed on the steps of \nBrown Hall in Miller Plaza on Western Michig an University Campus ( Figure 3 ) in fall 2019. \nThe Campus XL will be shipped, by Sunbolt, its manufacturer, from Pennsylvania to Western \nMichigan University, and from there, facilities will complete installation using the installation \nguide provided by the company. Miller Plaza is an ideal location for the solar bench. There is a \nhigh amount of foot traffic from Miller Auditorium, Brown Hall, Dalton Hall, Sprau Tower, the \nFrostic School of Art, and the large parking garage for students, faculty, and visitors. This area \nwill provide high visibility for the bench and show students the efforts Western Michigan \nUniversity is making to be a sustainably responsible school. A solar bench in Miller Plaza would \nalso bring a modern aspect of sustainability to an area of campus that may be lacking d ue to  \nmany older buildings. Intervention data will be collected for three weeks.  \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                18 \n  \nFigure  3.. Bench Location: Red area indicated on image is the approximate location of the \nCampus XL bench on Western Michigan University Campus .

Maintenance to the solar bench would include keeping the solar panels \nclear from snow and debris as well as diagnosing potential  electrical problems. Western \nMichigan University landscaping takes care of the outside area around Miller Plaza, where the \nbench will be located, and would potentially be responsible for those tasks. The company who \nmanufactures the bench, Sunbolt,  can be  contacted about electrical issues with the panels as they \ndo include a twenty five year warranty on solar panel output. For the graphic prompts, student \nresearch assistants will be able to take care of anything having to do with placement or damage \nto the  prompt.  \n \n\nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                19 \n Potential Results/ Discussion  \nPotential Results  \nIt is expected that with implementation of the info -graphic prompts, website usage will \nincrease. Due to the QR code embedded in the prompts having a unique URL, a change from \nbaseline to intervention will be analyzed using any usage of the unique URL and also a general \nincrease in website traffic. The data to be analyzed will be a weekly amount of website visits \nspecifically from scanning the QR code located on the Campus XL as well as a daily amount of \nall website visits.   \nImplications   \n If the results of  the current study are as expected, from the aspect of the Campus XL \nhaving an acceptable amount of usage by those on Western Michigan University Campus, the \nuniversity may take further action. The university has recently started construction on a new \ndorm itory \u201cneighborhood\u201d and has multiple non -solar benches all around campus. After a \nmeeting with the head of space management for the university, the possibility of more solar \ncharging benches both in the new neighborhood and in replacement of current non -solar benches \nis very strong with positive usage of the Campus XL. The installation of more benches had \nimplications within itself, such as the possibility to work bench power intake into the university \nmainframe and use benches to help power university bui ldings.  \nThe current proposed placement of the bench also helps to spread the visibility of \nsustainability throughout campus. Currently, the sustainable interventions around the university \nare concentrated or difficult to see/interact with. For example, th e newly -renovated building that \nhas little -known solar panels and rooftop gardens is in one part of campus. This building is a \ntalking point for sustainability on campus tour for prospective students. There is no way to \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                20 \n interact with sustainable aspects of  this building as with the solar farm on a satellite campus that \nis only visible from a highway. The placement of the Campus XL in a different part of campus, \nwith high foot traffic and much older buildings, will help to spread sustainability throughout \ncampus and also function as a way for students to directly interact with clean energy by charging \ntheir devices using energy powered by the sun. Students will also be more involved and informed \nabout sustainability both from simple usage of the bench and int eracting with the sustainability \nwebsite by way of the info -graphic prompt.  \nIn addition to visibility and interaction with sustainability, there is potential for students \nto be directly involved with sustainable research as a result of the installation of  the bench and \ninfo-graphic prompts. Using a class titled Behavioral Approaches to Sustainability, students \nwould be able to monitor energy intake, output, amount of plug -ins to the bench, and amount of \nwebsite hits generated by the QR code graphic prompt.  This would allow students to have a more \ninvolved interaction with sustainability and understand the implications of sustainable research \nand interventions. In addition to research on the current study by students, future research could \neventually be cond ucted.  \nFuture Research  \nThe results of this study have potential for continued  research. For example, there is the \npotential to collect demographic information. Scanning the QR code could still lead to the \nWestern Michigan University sustainability website, but a small pop -up quiz about demographic \ninformation could be presented bef ore access to the website. This would allow researchers to \nbetter their understanding of what types of people were scanning the QR code as well as a brief \nview of their current knowledge about solar power. Additionally, weekly visual feedback on \nenergy sav ed by using the charging bench could increase usage, as it did in a 2007 study \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                21 \n conducted by Petersen et  al. which examined electricity and water use reduction in college \ndormitories by implementation of visual feedback. If the results do not turn out as ex pected, that \nis, participants are not scanning the QR code, changes to the graphic prompt could be made. This \ncould be in the form of larger text, brighter colors, different placement of the prompt , or an \nincentive for scanning the QR code such as the chan ce to be entered in a giveaway . \nConclusion  \nThe results of this study will have large implications on the visibility of sustainable \npractices at Western Michigan University. They will provide an outloo k on how something as \nsalient as the  solar bench, when paired with prompts, contributes to student education on and \nengagement with on -campus sustainability. A furthered study that could gather demographic and \nbaseline knowledge on sustainable practices would be yet another step towards making Western \nMichigan University one of the most sustainable college campuses. Furthermore, installat ion of \nthis single bench, and positive study results, will open the door to installation of more benches \nthus keeping with Western Michigan University\u2018s goal of continuing to strive for a sustainable \natmosphere.   \nEFFECTS OF QR CODE PROMPTS                22 \n References  \nAASHE.

Increasing attention is paid to improving the quality of life \nof the population. The relevance of this article is due to the fact that the \nissues of improving the quality of life of the population form the basis for \nthe formation of an innovative way of developing the modern economy of \nRussia. The article presents the results of the author's research on the \nquality of life of the population of Russia as a strategic priority of economic \npolicy and state security. The place of the quality of life of the population \nin the system of economic security, its regulatory and legal base, and the \nsystem of indicators have been determined. Trends in the dynamics of \nlife quality indicators are analyzed, threats to the economic security of \nRussia are identified and assessed. The final section of the article defines \nthe strategic priorities of the state policy to improve the quality of life and \nproposes measures to reduce threats to Russia's economic security.\nKeywords : quality of life, strategic priorities, economic security, \nindicators of quality of life, human potential, system of indicators of quality \nof life, digital transformation.\nIn modern conditions, the most important factor in the development of \nany state is the quality of life of the population, which contributes to the \naccumulation of the country's national wealth and, accordingly, the devel -\nopment of human potential. Research and development of the concept of \nthe socio-economic category \"quality of life\" is associated with the progres -\nsive development of society and depends on the economic progress of a \nparticular state. The focus of the long-term socio-economic policy of the \nstate is the steady growth of well-being and improving the quality of life of \n9\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthe population.\nThis has been repeatedly emphasized in the speeches of the leaders \nof the Russian Federation, documented in the Decree of the President of \nthe Russian Federation of July 2, 2021 \u2116 400 \"National Security Strategy \nof the Russian Federation, the Decree of the President of the Russian \nFederation of May 07, 2018 \u2116 204 (as amended on July 21, 2020) \"On \nnational goals and strategic objectives of the development of the Russian \nFederation for the period up to 2024\" and the Decree of the President of \nthe Russian Federation of July 21, 2020 \u2116 474 \"On the national develop -\nment goals of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2030\"[1,2,3].\nToday, the quality of life is an interdisciplinary and multidimensional cat -\negory, which requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to the \nstudy, noted by Russian scientists [4,5,6,8,14]. This fact gives rise to con -\ntroversy over the definition of the concept of \"quality of life\" to this day .\nThe category \"quality of life\" consists in its distinctive feature: quality of \nlife is a complex multidimensional socio-economic category that encom -\npasses all spheres of life of society, which, in turn, contains a description \nof people's life, as well as the conditions and circumstances of their quality \nof life. The concept of \u201cquality of life\u201d is broader than \u201cstandard of living\u201d \nand includes components that relate to social well-being and security, the \nstate of the environment, the political situation, the level of development \nof education and health care, as well as the psychological comfort of the \nindividual [9].\nThe main problem that hinders the improvement of the quality of life is \nthe decline in the level of well-being of citizens, which led to the aggrava -\ntion of property stratification and the unevenness of the socio-economic \ndevelopment of the regions. The solution to this problem is possible by \nreducing the poverty level of the population, modernizing the education \nand health care systems, ensuring the affordability of housing, increasing \nsocial payments to the population, and creating jobs [15].\nThe strategies \"Strategy of the National Security of the Russian Fed -\neration\" and \"Strategy of the Economic Security of the Russian Federa -\ntion\" make it possible to formulate in the most complete format the main \npriorities and directions of state policy in improving the quality of the use \nof human potential. The role of human potential in the system of economic \nsecurity is to ensure the reproductive function of the economy. The impor -\ntance of improving the quality of life of the population is expressed as a \nresult of measures to increase the efficiency of social reproduction, which \nleads to an increase in the level of economic security of the state. Improv -\ning the indicators of the quality of life of the population has a positive effect \n10\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentson the level of economic security of the country. \nThe category \"quality of life\" as a multidimensional socio-economic cat -\negory is governed by an extensive set of normative legal acts, which are \narranged in a hierarchical multilevel order and correlate with each other. \nThe legal framework, according to the authors, must comply with the ob -\njective conditions of development and the current economic policy of the \nstate, as well as comply with international rules and standards [19]. Moreo -\nver, the system of indicators of the quality of life should characterize the \nmost complete list of spheres of human activity and reflect the level of im -\nplementation of the individual's needs in accordance with social standards \nin conditions of limited resources. An important condition for the formation \nof a system of indicators of the quality of life of the population in the aspect \nof economic security is the threshold values   that determine the likelihood \nof a risk of socio-economic damage, as well as the likelihood of adverse \nconsequences. The inconsistency of the indicators of the quality of life of \nthe population with their threshold values   can lead to a threat to national \neconomic security.\nMaintaining a high level of well-being of the population are priority ar -\neas, strategic priorities in Russian state policy and are aimed at: \n\u2013 increasing the population by creating conditions for stimulating demo -\ngraphic state policy;\n\u2013 the optimal ratio of the population's cash income and the growth rate \nof labor productivity; \n\u2013  job creation, effective regulation of the labor market to counteract the \nnegative dynamics of the unemployment rate;\n\u2013 comprehensive support for citizens of retirement age by increasing \nthe dependence of singing and wages of employees of organizations;\n\u2013 development of the education and health care system through a com -\nprehensive modernization of these areas;\n\u2013 providing the population with affordable and high-quality housing;\n\u2013 creating a favorable ecological environment and reducing the amount \nof harmful emissions;\n\u2013 reducing the crime rate and others.\nAccording to the results of the author's calculations for the period from \n2015 to 2019. The Russian Federation, the integral indicator of the quality \nof life occupied the interval from 0.55 to 0.75 (which corresponds to the \npre-crisis state of the national economy [10, 12]. It should be noted that the \nintegral indicator has a negative trend and shows a natural decline in the \nquality of life of the population since 2015. \nThe interests of Russian society and national security are interrelated \n11\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsand aimed at the long-term perspective, the definition of goals and objec -\ntives of the state security policy, as well as their implementation through a \nsystem of public administration measures.\nIn accordance with the Decree of the President of the Russian Federa -\ntion of July 21, 2020 \u2116 474 \"On the national development goals of the \nRussian Federation for the period up to 2030\", the main priorities of state \npolicy are presented, aimed at improving the quality of life in Russia in the \nlong term (Fig. 1):\nFig. 1. The main priorities of state policy aimed in the long term \nat improving the quality of life in Russia [3]\nThe system of measures to improve the quality of life of the population \nis focused on a programmatic nature and is mainly implemented through \nthe implementation of national projects and government programs. \nThus, the state program \"New quality of life\" includes measures to \nachieve high standards of personal safety and environmental safety. The \nnational project \"New quality of life\" provides development in various \nspheres of human life: education, health care, ecology, culture and others. \nIndicators of the quality of life of the population should be included in stra -\ntegic plans, policies, development programs at all levels of government. \nImproving the quality of life of the population of Russia should be consid -\nered as a strategic priority of the long-term strategy of socio-economic \ndevelopment [16].\nThe strategic basis of national projects are activities that are aimed at \neliminating and minimizing problem areas that hinder the socio-economic \ndevelopment of the country. The effective implementation of government \nprojects and programs directly depends on the degree of participation in \nthem as a society, public institutions, including scientific communities. \n12\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsThe strategic priority of the economic security of Russia and the socio-\neconomic policy of the state, which is documented in the main normative \nlegal acts aimed at the long term, is the quality of life of the population.\nNext, we will consider the main proposals for reducing threats to Rus -\nsia's economic security in the field of ensuring the quality of life of the \npopulation.\nIt should be noted that the main task of any state in almost all spheres \nof human life is the primary solution to socio-economic problems of the \nquality of life of people. As noted earlier, in modern conditions, improving \nthe quality and living standards of the country's population is one of the \npriority tasks of state policy. Which should be addressed by reducing inter -\nregional differentiation in relation to people living below the poverty line. To \ndo this, it is necessary to increase the efficiency and the number of social \nbenefits and other types of support for low-income citizens, develop a sys -\ntem of support for the population based on the family's social passport for \ntargeted assessment of a specific low-income family and identify the needs \nof society, as well as create special conditions to ensure self-employment \nof the poor on the basis of development of projects to stimulate the pas -\nsage of retraining programs, training and the creation of a personal econ -\nomy. We also need a positive dynamics of real incomes, the purchasing \npower of the Russian population. No less important is a decrease in the \nunemployment rate and a decrease in the proportion of people below the \nsubsistence level [7, 13.20, 21].\nThe authors identified potential threats in terms of the economic secu -\nrity of the state:\n1. Long-term decline in the country's population as a result of low fertil -\nity and high mortality.\n2. High divorce rates and weakening of the institution of the family.\n3. Increase in the number of unemployed citizens.\n4. The poverty level and significant differentiation in income levels still \npose a threat to the economic security of the country.\n5. The amount of social security for pensioners remains substantially \nlow.\n6. High morbidity of the population and an unfavorable trend in the dy -\nnamics of health care indicators for the future. \nIn the course of the forecast, the authors revealed that only one indica -\ntor will reach the threshold value - the unemployment rate will leave the \ncrisis zone by 2022 [11]. Nevertheless, after 2022, the indicator will be \nclose to the critical value, that is, it will be in a pre-crisis state, which means \nthe need for close monitoring of the development of the situation by public \n13\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsauthorities. The rest of the indicators during the forecasting period from \n2020 to 2024 will remain in the crisis zone, which indicates the persistence \nof threats to national economic security. \nThe main directions of activity of the state and its power structures \naimed at improving the quality and standard of living of the country's popu -\nlation were proposed:\n1. Creation of conditions for population growth, improvement of the \nquality and life expectancy of people.\n2. Preservation of spiritual and moral traditions of family relations.\n3. Actively pursuing a policy of promoting employment of the popula -\ntion.\n4. Improvement of state policy to equalize the level of income of the \npopulation, reduce the level of poverty.\n5. Improving the quality of life of pensioners through the development \nof the pension system.\n6. Formation of conditions and creation of impulses for the develop -\nment of human capital by increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of \nhealthcare, as well as countering the new coronavirus infection.\nThus, the proposed main directions of activities of the state and its \npower structures aimed at improving the quality and standard of living of \nthe country's population will improve the quality of life of the population.  \nComprehensive study of problem areas of citizens' life will make it possible \nto avoid negative scenarios for forecasting threats to economic security. To \nensure the required level of national security of Russia, it is necessary to \nconstantly monitor the system of security indicators in order to bring all in -\ndicators to a level at least no worse than the maximum critical values. This \nwill provide an opportunity to improve the quality of life as a strategic prior -\nity of economic security through the formation of a competitive innovative \neconomy capable of responding to the challenges and threats of our time. \nThis has been reiterated in the \"30th Anniversary Human Development \nReport 2020, which is the latest in a series of global Human Development \nReports published by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) \nsince 1990 as an independent, analytically and empirically informed dis -\ncussion critical development issues, trends and policies\"[22].\n14\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsReferences\n1.

In this article with the purpose of creation of the strategy of \nintensifying of innovative potential of the enterprise that characterizes the \npossibility of innovative development of the aforementioned enterprise, it is \nsubmitted to calculate the level of the innovative potential in the context of \ndigital economy on the basis of introduction of the integrated index which \nincludes the group of elements such as factors of internal environment \nof the enterprise namely production technology resources, the level of \ninnovative development, availability of informational resources and factors \nof external environment namely competitiveness of the enterprise on the \nmarket and participation in realization of the principle of \u00abtriple helix\u00bb-the \npartnership of the state, science and business. \n Keywords : innovative potential, digitalization, innovative economy, \nassessment methods,  integral indicator.\nOne of the main components of innovative economy developing on \nthe basis of equal usage of scientific knowledge, intellectual potential and \ninnovative products, readiness to their practical realization in different \nspheres of human activity is digitalization. Occasionally this component is \ncategorized as \u00abdigital economy\u00bb.\nRussian passage from the creation of free market economy to it in -\nnovative type of development means at the same time active usage of \naccumulated innovative potential namely fundamental research findings \nand applications, results of intellectual activity (RIA) in the form of patents. DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.46.87.002\n17\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsThis innovative potential is necessary for the passage to innovative type of \ndevelopment, but the actual showings of innovative activity remain low [4].\nAt present moment development of digital platforms that can render dif -\nferent services which are the basic elements of digital economy of Russia \nare developing.\nWhat does it mean \u00abinnovative potential\u00bb? In general, innovative po -\ntential of any object equals to conditions in which innovative activity is re -\nalized successfully. Innovative activity of the enterprise is the source of \ndevelopment only in case of the active and sometimes aggressive strat -\negy of promotion and also in case of creation of enabling environment for \nlaunching of new products, technologies and services.\nAn enterprise with high innovative potential is the enterprise that exists \nin developed infosphere, owns patents, research findings and applications, \ninventions, new ideas, new technologies, untapped needs etc. Bearing in \nmind all mentioned above there is an multialternative interactive and ex -\npert \u2013 based approach for decisions making.\nThe main difference of an innovative organization is ultimately its aims \nsuch as development of corporate and workforce innovative potential, pro -\nviding of long-time vitality, satisfying the potential requirements of consum -\ners and development of the own market. The management of innovative \npotential is the necessary part of management of innovations. It resolves \nissues of planning and realization of innovative strategies of stable de -\nvelopment of the enterprise. Development of innovative strategies bases \non the evaluation of potential possibilities and innovation potential of the \nenterprise and on an analyze of external environment of the enterprise. An \nincreasingly larger role of innovations makes new demands to the choice \nof effective mechanisms of usage and evaluation of innovative potential \nand also to management of innovations in the enterprise. That is why na -\ntional researches and researches abroad pay more and more attention to \nthe role of innovations in development of the enterprise.\nThe definition of \u00abinnovative potential\u00bb for the growth of the system \ndue to innovations was firstly introduced by Christopher Freeman in 1970-\n1980. He thought that innovation is the system of measures to design, \ndevelopment, usage and exhaustion of economic, social and institutional \npotential which are at the heart of innovation.\nA practical aspect of \u00abinnovation potential\u00bb is reflected in works of Pe-\nter Drucker  [5] where he looks into beginnings of development of modern \nindustry. For instance, he remarked that innovation began from the ana -\nlyze of existing potential with the purpose of its effective usage. In majority \nof cases the authors concentrate on the analyze of separate aspects of \n18\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsinnovative potential, there are some definitions that are inconsequent and \ndo not place the emphasis on methodological essential of the concept.\nA team of authors under the direction of V.Barancheev [6] defines inno -\nvative potential of the enterprise as the measure of readiness to fulfillment \nof tasks providing achievement of innovative aims of the enterprise.\nB.K.Lisin and V. Fridlyanov [7] give the following definition to \u00abinno -\nvative potential\u00bb of the enterprise. Innovative potential is the complex of \nscientific, technical, technological, infrastructural, financial, legal, sociocul -\ntural and other possibilities, providing apprehension and launching of in -\nnovation.\nA team of authors under the direction of M.N.Titov [8] thinks that in -\nnovative potential is capability of the unit of real sector to provide a suf -\nficient level of updating of operational factors, their combinations in the \noperational process, organizational and management structures and also \nthe  internal culture.\nB.A.Pateev [9] supposes that innovative potential  of the enterprise is \nthe mixture of informative, technical, technological, intellectual, spatial, fi -\nnancial, organizational, managemental, juridical and business resources \nthat forms the single system for appearance and development of ideas, \nproviding competitiveness of final products or services in accordance with \naims and strategies of the company.\nS.V.Kortov [10] regards the innovative potential as an assembly of re -\nsources containing human resources, material and technical resources, \nfinances, management that are sufficient for realization of whole innovative \ncycle and satisfying the developed requirements in innovation. Innovative \npotential of the enterprise is often regarded as the set of resources with \ndifferent level of detailing.\nTo sum up the discussion of methodological essential of innovative po -\ntential it has to be concluded that innovative potential is not only resources \navailable for innovation but also innovative mechanisms including develop -\nment of innovative potential via innovation and investments.\nWith purpose of stable and effective development of the enterprise it \nis important to evaluate and increase its innovation potential. The authors \nof this article interpret innovation potential as integrated index that char -\nacterized the level of readiness of the enterprise for the development and \nrelease of innovative products. Evaluation of the level of innovative poten -\ntial of the enterprise and its increase allow to speed up commercialization \nof novelties (patents, know-how, ideas) and realize them in real sector of \neconomy.\nExperts divides indexes of innovative potential on internal and external \n19\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsindexes (external environment). Internal indexes in turns divide on groups:\n-  technological indexes;\n- indexes of level of innovative development of the organization\n-  indexes of availability of information resources\nExisting methods of evaluation of innovative potential of enterprise in -\nclude following elements: processing opportunities, effectiveness of the \nscience and technology infrastructure, availability of means for financing of \ninnovative activity, availability of the staff that can think outside the box etc. \n[3]. In majority of cases these methods base on expert evaluation methods. \nIt provides subjectivity in procedure of evaluation of innovative potential. \nThe authors have developed the system of indexes based on the possibil -\nity of their calculation and reflecting the level of innovative potential of the \nenterprise in conditions of digital economy. This system consists of tech -\nnological resources that are necessary for realization of innovative activity, \nthe level of innovative development, availability of information resources.\nNowadays introduction of indexes of information block for the calcula -\ntion is particularly topical as one of the key priorities of our state develop -\nment is the focus on digitalization of economy [1].\nIn conditions of passage to digital economy in group of indexes of in -\nformative availability besides availability of personal computers and neces -\nsary software in the enterprise it is necessary to bear in mind such element \nas level of digitalization of internal business processes of the enterprise. \nIt is offered to include this index as ratio of number of digitized business \nprocesses to the whole number of business processes of the enterprise.\nThe level of innovative development of enterprise is characterized ulti -\nmately by innovative activeness of the enterprise. Innovative activeness of \nthe enterprise is complex characteristic of its innovative activity including \ninnovativeness (the feature of the consumer of an innovative product), the \nlevel of  intension performing actions connecting with transformation of \nnovelties and their timeliness (the feature of the supplier of an innovative \nproduct), capability for mobilization of potential of necessary quality and \nquality, capability to provide justification of applying methods, reasonable -\nness of the technology of innovative process  referring to composition and \nsubsequence of operations. Innovative activeness characterizes the readi -\nness to renewal of key elements of innovation system namely knowledge, \ntechniques, information and communications technologies and conditions \nof their effective usage (structure and culture) and also open-mindedness.\nIn general, the system of indexes of level of innovative potential may be \npresented as follows.\n1. Technological resources that are necessary for innovative activity \n20\nProcess Management and Scientific Developments(P1)\n1.1. Availability of intellectual property (patents, computer programs, \nknow-how etc.) characterizes the existence of objects of intellectual prop -\nerty (own or purchased) in the organization (P11).\n1.2. Share of expenses for researches and development (concerning \nthe time or payment) in general volume of expenses for development of \ninnovative product (technology) (P12);\n1.3. Acquisition of new equipment and technologies characterizes the \ncapability of the organization for acquisition of new productions (share of \nexpenses for purchasing of new equipment and technologies in whole vol -\nume of cost of operating resources) (P13).\n1.4. Acquisition of manufacture of new products (share of new released \nproducts in whole production data sheet ) (P14).\n2. The level of innovative development of organization (P2):\n2.1. The share of employees who are engaged in researches and de -\nvelopment in total quantity of staff (P21).\n2.2. Share of expenses for education of staff in total volume of operat -\ning expenses (P22).\n2.3. Profitability of innovation (ratio of profit that was earned from reali -\nzation of the innovative product to the revenues from its realization) (P23).\n2.4. Innovative activeness (ratio of quantity of innovative products to \nthe total number of released product for the last year) (P24).\n3. Availability of information resources (P3)\n3.1. Availability of personal computers (level of availability of personal \ncomputers in organization) (P31).\n3.2. Availability of software (level of availability of necessary software in \norganization)) (P32).\n3.3. Relative degree of digitalization of business processes of organi -\nzation (ratio of the number of digitalized business processes to the total \nnumber of business processes in organization) (P33).\nIt has to be recognized that innovative potential of the enterprise in \nspite of its full determination does not guarantee realization of its strategic \naims. It is invidiously to define innovative potential without bearing in mind \nfactors of external environment of the enterprise namely availability of ne -\ncessity in released product, competitiveness on the market, possibility of \nrealization of public private investment partnership. Without reference to \naforementioned elements innovative potential of enterprise like a \u00abdead \ncargo\u00bb. \nThat is why indexes of external environment in which the enterprise is \nworking are introduced:\n21\nProcess Management and Scientific Developments4. Factors of external environment (P4):\n4.1 Competitiveness of organization (share of the market of products of \norganization in whole volume of the market) (P41).\nIt is important to diversify the share on the market according to the \nquantity of players on the market.\nFor instance, if there are 10 or more players multiplying co-efficient \nequal to 1.5 is introduced, if there are 20 or more players multiplying co-\nefficient equal to 1.6 is introduced etc.\n4.2 Participation of organization in realization of principle of \u00abtriple he -\nlix\u00bb- cooperation of the state, science and business or public-private part -\nnership (principle of \u00abdouble helix\u00bb- cooperation of the state and business) \n(P42).\nGeneral integrated index of potential is calculated as the sum of index -\nes of all elements with weighing coefficient, which reflects the significancy \nof each index:\n(1)\nwhere Pi \u2013is a value of i-th group of indexes of innovative potential of \nthe enterprise.\nIt has to be marked that value of each index fluctuates from 0 to 1 that \nallows to calculate the level of innovative potential of the object.\nThere are 13 indexes, thus, integrated index of the level of innovative \npotential fluctuates from 0 to 13.\nLet\u2019s calculate the level of innovative potential of one of the enterprises \nof the Murmansk region.\n\u00abAlpha\u00bb that is a franchisee of \u00ab1\u0421\u00bb is engaged in the development of \nsoftware for automatization of business processes of different organiza -\ntions and also in rendering of consultation services in this sphere. \u00abAlpha\u00bb \ndevelops and launches on platform that is called \u00ab1\u0421:Enterprise 8\u00bb, has \nan experience in creation of sites and portals with appliance of decisions  \nof \u00ab1\u0421- Bitrix\u00bb and databases maintenance with PostgreSQL, makes deci -\nsion to questions connecting with support of technical infrastructure  and \nwork optimization of products of 1C. Different developed software products \ncan be referred to the intellectual property of the company. The big share \nof expenses of the company includes expenses on the investigation of \nnew productions and application fields of software solutions  in order to \nincrease customer database. Projects of  \u00abAlpha\u00bb are applied in different \nspheres among which there are production and fishery, fish farming, trans -\nport and logistics, education, medical care and medicine, power economy, \n22\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentshousing and utility sector, shipbuilding and ship repairing. The company \nactively works together with state-owned enterprises.\nThe indexes of \u00abtechnological resources\u00bb group:\n P1 = (1+0,4+0,3+0,5)=2,2\nAbout one third of employees of \u00abAlpha\u00bb are engaged in researches \nand development, recruitment and education are taken place.\nThe indexes of \u00abinnovative development of organization \u00bb group:\nP2=(0,3+0,1+0,6+0,3)=1,3\nEach employee of \u00abAlpha\u00bb is equipped with computerized work place \nwith set of licensed software products. Business processes and coopera -\ntion inside the company are automatized and are taken place in digital \nformat.\nThe indexes of \u00abinformation resources\u00bb group:\nP3=(1+1+0,9)=2,9\n\u00abAlpha\u00bb works in conditions of severe competitiveness and has 6th \nplace and 6% share on the market of informational resources. Public-pri -\nvate partnership is realized within participation in projects of cooperation \nand supporting of organizations of state sectors.\nIndexes of \u00abexternal environment\u00bb group\n\u04204=(0,06x1,6+0,4)=0,0496 ~  0,5, where 1.6 is co-efficient of market \ncompetitiveness.\nIntegrated index of innovative potential of organization:\n = \u04201+\u04202+\u04203+\u04204 = 2,2+1,3+2,9+0,5 = 6,9\nThe calculation of level of innovative potential of the enterprise gives \nopportunity to develop corresponding recommendations referring to the \nincrease of innovative potential of the enterprise. Obviously, actions cor -\nrespond to low level of corresponding indexes.\nIn this case we have low level of \u042022  (share of expenses on the increase \nof competence of staff) and \u042024  (innovative activeness). That is why the  \ncompany should pay attention to these parameters.\n The example of recommendations is in Table 1.\n23\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsTable 1.

The article is devoted to the problem of innovative development \nof human capital with the aim of forming and rational use of managerial and \nleadership competencies; is the acquisition of the necessary theoretical \nand practical knowledge and skills for effective management of economic \nactivities of various types and purposes.\nKeywords:  digitalization, innovative development, human capital, \nleadership competencies  \n The strategy of \"digitalization\" of the national economy is a long-term \nnational project designed to implement qualitative changes in the field of \ninformation and analytical activities of economic entities, aimed at devel -\noping the market for intelligent information services in order to meet the \ninformation needs of consumers in the main sectors of the economy: state, \nbusiness and household. The production factors of information services \nare intelligent information systems (materialized capital) and skilled labor \n(human capital). At its core, \"digitalization\" is a global project affecting all \nspheres of human activity, where the leading, fundamental area is, in our \nopinion, the economy. \nThe fundamental management decision for the economy is the choice \nof a national economic model. Almost all countries of the world have now \npreferred a market model of economic management, subject to active state \nregulation of the economy to exclude the so-called \"market failures\", that \nis, its inability in certain market situations to positively develop on the basis \nof the market self-regulation mechanism. This model allows for freedom \nof entrepreneurial activity within socially acceptable boundaries. Such a DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.73.10.003\n26\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsrestriction of business freedom objectively reduces the economic opportu -\nnities of entrepreneurs, limits the growth of their income, but allows them \nto harmonize entrepreneurial activity with the interests of society. Thus, \nmanagement activity in the field of economics is its integral part, requires \nfrom each market entity, individual and collective, the formation and de -\nvelopment of economic and management competencies, especially in the \nfield of skilled labor.\nThe development of human capital with the aim of forming and ration -\nal use of managerial competencies consists in acquiring the necessary \ntheoretical and practical knowledge and skills for effective management \nof economic activities of various types and purposes. The introduction of \n\"digitalization\" in the educational process makes it possible to multiply the \ninformation base of training sessions, allows you to move on to the creation \nand widespread practical application of intelligent information and training \nsystems for replacing experience in the field of professional management \nactivities. The formation of an active pseudo-market environment is based \non intelligent imitators of market entities that implement feedback, the re -\nsponse of the market environment to the adopted management decisions. \nApplication of the system of quality criteria for functional management de -\ncisions allows to integrally assess the degree of mastering by the \"player\" \nof economic and management competencies.\nThe use of \"digitalization\" in the real economy opens up the opportunity \nfor managers of all levels of economic and organizational management to \neasily operate with large amounts of data when optimizing management \ndecisions, focus on the quality of management decisions of a complex \nstructure, relying on the artificial intelligence of management information \nsystems. There is a possibility of restructuring the management of eco -\nnomic processes on \"new rails\", which has become mandatory, due to the \nneed to generalize the multitude of data streams in the \"digital economy\". \nTo automate and accelerate the processes of making managerial deci -\nsions, taking into account the multitasking functions in the activities of a \nleader, search information systems are just needed. \nModern large databases provide an opportunity not only to analyze sta -\ntistics, but also to qualitatively predict economic processes at the macro \nlevel, the level of individual regions, industries and enterprises. Modern \ndigital devices have penetrated all spheres of life, without them it is al -\nready impossible to imagine the exchange of information, communication \nbetween the seller and the consumer, which occurs at a greater speed \nwhen using gadgets and devices, smartphones, online stores. Thus, the \nstreams of data transmitted by these devices make it possible to create \n27\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsdigital models of technological processes, consumer preferences and, ac -\ncordingly, optimize business processes.   \nToday in Russian society the stabilization, \"achievement\" and \"projec -\ntive\" type of motivation prevails [1]. The desire to motivate for well-being \nreduces motivation of the \"higher order\", that is, alienation is formed, which \nblocks the optimal, that is, resource-saving solutions and the innovative \nand symbolic potential of the organization is not realized. The adoption of \n\"situational decisions\" [2] aimed at \"consolidating\" the performing roles of \nthe organization's functioning is dominant, due to the lack of higher moti -\nvation to overcome the difficulties of a technological, organizational and \ncommunicative order [2]. \nThe concept of human capital and understanding of its role in the eco -\nnomic development of the country is controversial. In the theory of eco -\nnomic growth, human capital is defined as skilled labor, the ability to which \nis acquired through education, in the process of which professional knowl -\nedge and skills are accumulated. In the economic theory of labor, they \nare added: acquired physical and intellectual abilities, personal and social \nqualities. Human capital as a fundamental factor in the labor potential of a \nmanager is the acquired, accumulated ability of a person, it goes through \nthe stages: formation, accumulation, development and use in the process \nof managerial activity, requires significant investments for its growth. The \nresults of the innovative development of human capital in management \nare new organizational skills that ensure the growth of the size, productiv -\nity and quality of management and, as a result, a significant increase in \nthe production of new products and technologies to meet the expanded \nneeds of the population and the production sector of the economy, lead to \nan increase in the incomes of entrepreneurs, the state and households [3].     \nIn order to solve the existing economic problems of the country, in our \nopinion, it is necessary to create conditions for stimulating the correspond -\ning investment needs in the development of a key factor of the economy \n- human capital, as well as activating rational state regulation of promis -\ning trends in the development of the market environment. At present, the \nexternal environment has a dominant influence on the optimization of the \ndevelopment of human capital as a leading factor in the economy and \nmanagement; it has a reactive, competitive nature, and is the main source \nof prospective uncertainty in the development of the economy. Without \nlong-term forecasting of the dynamics of development of the external en -\nvironment, its trends and phases, the issue of effective development of \nhuman capital cannot be strategically justified [3].\nThe national economy is a so-called reflexive system, the main prop -\n28\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentserty of which is the economic activity of its elements. This activity lies in \ntheir purposefulness, focus on solving the basic tasks of the economy: \nsurvival and development for the current and long term. The problem of \nsurvival becomes relevant in a crisis phase, and the problem of devel -\nopment - when the economy seeks to move into the phase of economic \ngrowth. In both cases, attempts are made to positively change by optimiz -\ning the process of decentralized management of economic development. \nDecentralization of management is due to the combination of the market \nmechanism of management with the desire of the state to implement the \nstrategic goals of the economy aimed at achieving sustainable competi -\ntiveness. The state program \"Digital Economy of the Russian Federation\" \nis designed until 2024. [4] It is based on the development of information \ninfrastructure and the formation of a new technological basis for the social \nand economic sphere. One of the conditions for its implementation is the \ntraining of personnel who will be able to manage the transparent space of \ncommunication networks, the data processing center, security and storage \nof data, importing data and other Specialists who currently own the tools \nof end-to-end technologies or technologies based on a distributed ledger \nare not enough [3].\nIn this situation, it is impossible to do without working with human re -\nsources for its formation, cultivation and increase in the capacity of the as -\nset.We use robotics and virtual reality technologies, neurotechnology and \nsensing, but it is worthwhile to think now what the company will do in 5-10 \nyears in conditions of the need for application big data, blockchain, quan -\ntum computing, artificial intelligence The more human intellectual capital a \ncompany has, the more reliable and competitive it is. In our country, there \nare funds, within the framework of large corporations and at the state level, \ntools for investing in talented youth are successfully working, even at the \nstage of study at universities. This is a long investment, but undoubtedly \ncorrect and important, with a horizon of 5-7 years for the country's econo -\nmy and business economy. Human capital has no depreciation losses, it \naccumulates every year and increases with experience on a progressive \nscale. The capitalization of a company is, among other things, the capitali -\nzation of human capital. Human resources as a whole and each individual \nindividually contribute to making a profit, form the company's image. Per -\nsonality is ultimately the determining and main factor in the success of any \ncompany. To solve the problems of forming human capital, it is necessary \nto invest in personal development, building new guidelines for state policy \nin the field of human capital development.\nIn May 2019, a new state program prepared by the Ministry of Telecom \n29\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsand Mass Communications of the Russian Federation was sent for de -\npartmental approval. Within the framework of the Digital Economy of the \nRussian Federation program, it was planned to train 60 thousand IT pro -\nfessionals in universities by 2020, and 100 thousand people by 2025 [4] \nIn addition, it is planned to prepare a regulatory framework for distance \neducation in Russia. Even earlier - in 2015 - the government fixed in the \nlist of specialties in priority areas of modernization: ICT, nanotechnology, \nenergy, transport and space systems, information security.\nHuman capital as a key factor in economic growth in a modern \neconomy.  [5]   The potential and vectors of economic development of \nthe regions of the Russian Federation must be identified and implemented \nwithin the framework of the general basic trends of \"digitalization\" emerg -\ning in the modern world. One of the conditions for increasing the competi -\ntiveness of the domestic economy is the development of human capital. \nIts importance in the context of globalization of the world economy and the \ncurrent level of development of civilization, as a factor of socio-economic \ndevelopment at the national, regional and transnational levels, is steadily \nincreasing. It should be borne in mind that the insufficiently high level of \nhuman capital [5] is today the main obstacle to the country's economic \nrenewal. \nThe transition of the Russian economy to the phase of economic growth \nis objectively predetermined, but not effective enough. There are many ex -\nplanations for this, such as \"economic sanctions\", \"coronavirus pandemic\", \n\"intense international competition\", \"inertia of the beneficial effect of invest -\nments\", \"ineffective partnership\", \"strategic uncertainty\", \"low economic ac -\ntivity of the population\" \"insufficient state stimulation\",\"market failures\", etc. \nThe expectation of economic growth stretched out for an indefinite period. \nWe offer one more explanation: \"insufficient attention to the development \nof human capital as a key factor of economic growth\". Let's consider sev -\neral arguments in favor of such a hypothesis: \nKnowledge and skills are central to achieving economic success, both \nfor individuals and for countries and peoples. Learning requirements have \nchanged due to new social and economic conditions, information and \ncomputer technologies, globalization of economic activity and the trend \ntowards greater individual responsibility and autonomy. The key role of \nknowledge and competencies in ensuring economic growth is widely \nrecognized among economists and politicians. To ensure the advanced \ndevelopment of human capital in accordance with modern realities, it is \nnecessary to abandon passive policies. An active development strategy is \nneeded, based on the model of a social market economy. The intellectu -\n30\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsalization of production at the present stage has led to a new stage in the \ndevelopment of society, more favorable conditions have been created for \nthe realization of the creative potential of a person in political, economic, \nsocial and cultural life.\nAt present, the competitive advantages of the economy and the possi -\nbilities of its modernization are largely determined by the accumulated and \nrealized human capital. It is people with their education, qualifications and \nexperience that determine the boundaries and possibilities of technologi -\ncal, economic and social modernization of society.\nTherefore, in Russia it is necessary to pay more attention to human \ncapital as a factor in innovative development. The transition to innovative \ndevelopment means that it is necessary not only to create new technolo -\ngies, to introduce them into production, but also to promote products on \nthe market, and have an adequate communication infrastructure. The de -\nvelopment of a society is called innovative only when intellectual capital \nbecomes its basis, which determines the competitiveness of the economic \nsystem.\nThe concept of human capital and understanding of its role in the eco -\nnomic development of the country is controversial. In the theory of eco -\nnomic growth, human capital is defined as skilled labor, the ability to which \nis acquired through education, that is, the process of accumulating profes -\nsional knowledge and skills [6] In the economic theory of labor [7], they are \nadded to: acquired physical and intellectual abilities, personal and social \nqualities. Human capital as a fundamental factor of labor potential is the \nacquired, accumulated ability of a person, it goes through the stages: for -\nmation, accumulation, development and use in the process of labor activ -\nity, requires significant investments from the household, the business sec -\ntor and the state for its multiplication. The results of the innovative devel -\nopment of human capital are new labor abilities that ensure the growth of \nthe size, productivity and quality of labor and, as a result, the production of \nnew products and technologies to meet the expanded needs of the popula -\ntion and the manufacturing sector of the economy, lead to an increase in \nthe incomes of entrepreneurs, the state and households. \nBy the \"digital economy\" we mean a modern type of business, charac -\nterized by the predominant role of data and methods of managing them, \nas a determining resource in the field of production, distribution, exchange \nand consumption. In the structure of the digital economy, three main in -\nterrelated components can be distinguished that determine the level of \ndevelopment of society: the spheres of activity in which the interaction of \nsuppliers and consumers is carried out; innovative technological platforms \n31\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthat create conditions for the dynamic development of various fields of ac -\ntivity; institutional and infrastructural environment, providing conditions for \nthe development of technological platforms, as well as effective interaction \nbetween the subjects of market relations. \nThe main elements of the digital economy are considered e-commerce, \nInternet banking, electronic payments, online advertising and electronic ac -\ncess to government services. The degree of accessibility and active use of \nthese areas is determined by the DEI state digitalization index, the Digital \nEvolution Index. But the digital economy needs more than just developers \nand ideologues, it also needs ordinary users. Last year, for the first time, \nRussia entered the top ten leading countries in the digital economy due to \nthe high involvement of people. E-commerce has grown by more than a \nquarter. To expand the circle of users of electronic services, appropriate \naccess to them is needed, therefore, infrastructure will become the second \ndirection of digitalization in the country. To implement these processes in \n2017 in order to implement the Strategy for the Development of the Infor -\nmation Society in the Russian Federation for 2017 - 2030, approved by the \nDecree of the President of the Russian Federation dated May 9, 2017 N \n203 \"On the Strategy for the Development of the Information Society in the \nRussian Federation for 2017 - 2030\" by order The Government of the Rus -\nsian Federation N 1632-rot On July 28, 2017, the State Program \"Digital \nEconomy of the Russian Federation\" was approved.[8]  \nThe Strategy for the Development of the Information Society formulates \nthe definition of the digital economy, which is considered as an economic \nactivity, the key production factor in which is data in digital form, contribut -\ning to the formation of an information space, taking into account the needs \nof citizens and society in obtaining high-quality and reliable information, \ndeveloping the information infrastructure of the Russian Federation, the \ncreation and application of Russian information and telecommunication \ntechnologies, as well as the formation of a new technological basis for the \nsocial and economic sphere.\nThe main goal of the Program \"Digital Economy of the Russian Federa -\ntion\" [4] is to create a special economic environment of an institutional and \ninfrastructural nature, expressed in digital form, providing the maximum \npossible interaction between various economic agents to reduce restric -\ntions on the creation and development of high-tech industries competitive \non the world market in various branches of the economy. The first and most \nimportant element of digitalization will be people. Smart people make a \nsmart country. This is not only about the leaders of change, but also about \nthose who are able to translate ideas into scientific projects, innovative \n32\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsproducts, management decisions. \nAs you know, one of the key, strategic resources of an enterprise is a \nperson, his intellect, practical knowledge and skills, social experience. The \ninner world of people, needs, interests, attitudes, experiences, etc. every -\nthing that we call the human factor can have a strong impact on the results \nof an enterprise. Novospherization and socialization of the economy gives \nparticular importance to the social component in its sustainable develop -\nment. Social processes at the enterprise should be subordinated to the \ngoals of social responsibility and the formation of a positive influence of \nthe human factor on the sustainable development of the enterprise through \nthe appropriate organizational and economic mechanisms. These mecha -\nnisms include: the formation of the organizational structure and culture of \nthe organization, motivation of personnel to work effectively in connection \nwith the final results of the enterprise, ensuring a high quality of working \nlife.\nInnovative human capital management in Russia - as a special \ntype of management activity  At present, the competitive advantages of \nthe Russian economy and the possibilities of its modernization are largely \ndetermined by the accumulated and realized human capital. It is people \nwith their education, qualifications and experience that determine the \nboundaries and possibilities of technological, economic and social mod -\nernization of society. The potential and vectors of economic development \nof the regions of the Russian Federation must be identified and imple -\nmented within the framework of the general basic trends of \"digitalization\" \nemerging in the modern world. Therefore, in Russia it is necessary to pay \nmore attention to human capital as a factor of innovative development. The \ntransition to innovative development means that it is necessary not only \nto create new technologies, to introduce them into production, but also to \npromote products on the market, and have an adequate communication \ninfrastructure. The development of a society is called innovative only when \nits basis becomes intellectual capital, which determines the competitive -\nness of the economic system.\nHuman capital is understood as both innate and constantly accumu -\nlated as a result of financial and moral investments such factors as the \nlevel of education, health, motivation, abilities of an individual or society, \nwith subsequent use in the production process, as well as affecting the \namount of income of the owner of human capital [9] Human capital and its \ncomponents - intellectual and emotional capital, more often began to be \nincluded in the \"statutory fund\", to be patented as an idea, system, know-\nhow. In this case, it brings income to the company, becomes its economic \n33\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentscomponent, the basis for the development of the company in the context of \nglobalization and digitalization [1].\nFig 1. Human capital and its components\nNew management methods are needed, in the context of economic \nglobalization, using new approaches to the strategy of enterprise develop -\nment, improving the style and management procedures, and this is possi -\nble only in the conditions of the formation and implementation of manage -\nment innovations. As a result, in the context of innovative development of \nenterprises, the role of human capital is increasing. Innovative develop -\nment is understood as a process that creates the need for change. This \nincludes the creation and diffusion of innovation through the innovation \npotential of entrepreneurs-innovators, driven by internal and external fac -\ntors. This, in turn, leads to the creation of innovations - through structural \nchanges, business and knowledge reengineering and progressive man -\nagement methods. [10] The key to introducing innovations in the Russian \neconomy is human capital and high-quality public administration, provided \nthat comfortable conditions for an innovative business are created. \nInstitutional modernization of Russia, new strategies for Russia's global \ncompetitiveness based on institutional changes and innovations, provides \nfor the formation of demand from the state - to create an innovation sys -\ntem The center of gravity of innovation policy lies in improving the public \nadministration system. The basis for the creation of innovations and their \nsuccessful implementation is primarily human capital.\n34\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsInnovative human capital management is a special type of management \nactivity aimed at the formation and development of a person's creative po -\ntential in an unstable internal and external environment of an organization. \nAt the same time, it is necessary to supplement and develop this potential \nby identifying the special conditions of human capital management and the \ndistinctive characteristics of its innovative management. The formation of \nhuman assets of a modern organization is a continuous investment pro -\ncess that covers the entire life cycle of human capital (the period of time \nfrom the inception of the need for human assets to the retirement of the \nformed capital for natural reasons or in connection with the achievement \nof the organization's goals and the replacement of retired assets with new \nones) [11]. For the innovative development of enterprises, management \ninnovations are especially relevant, which lead to the improvement of tra -\nditional principles, procedures and methods of management or established \norganizational forms, with the subsequent replacement of the entire man -\nagement system of the company. As a result of managerial innovations, \nbusiness leaders begin to work more efficiently. The way managers work \ncan be changed by revising the procedures that govern their work. These \ninclude: strategic planning, financing, search, certification and promotion of \nemployees, internal communication and knowledge management - those \nfactors through which the entire management mechanism will work. \nTo function effectively in a complex environment, organizations require \nan organizational culture and leadership that can ensure sustainable de -\nvelopment through the acquisition of adaptability, resilience and, at the \nsame time, readiness for change, creativity, innovation. Successful leaders \nfor innovative human capital management combine three important forces: \nknowledge, trust, power. The main requirements for a leader are the con -\nstant acquisition of knowledge and the creation of a climate conducive to \nunlocking the potential of the personnel. Signs of the culture of creative \nand successful people: have a well-developed abstract thinking; able to \naccept opposites; have high emotional stability in difficult situations; rely \non facts in their activities and seek to give them an interpretation; optimis -\ntic; positively perceive unexpected, unplanned events; confident in them -\nselves and in what they are doing, regardless of the result.\nIn the modern Russian economy, the improvement of the organizational \nand economic tools for human capital management is becoming one of the \nmost important areas of enterprise development, and the intensive growth \nof competition in the economy makes the study of the phenomenon of this \ntype of production resources and, to a greater extent, the economic mech -\nanisms of knowledge and innovation management actual. However, the \n35\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentssocio-economic systems of enterprises and corporations, which include \nmany coordination mechanisms - from informal communication to interfirm \ninformation planning systems (alliances) and complex integration struc -\ntures - are still poorly understood in terms of developing rules for managing \ntheir resources, especially intangible assets. At the same time, the problem \nof many enterprises is to change the current management system, since \nthe implementation of managerial innovations is more susceptible to resist -\nance than technological innovations. This may be due to the reluctance of \nstaff to restructure their thinking, with ineffective use of human capital, as \nwell as due to lack of experience and professionalism. Also, managerial \ninnovations, going from developer to user, can degenerate into pseudo-in -\nnovations, since the inertial control system adapts them for itself, depriving \nthem of their own content. Or enterprises use certain innovations in man -\nagement methods to solve problems without fully adapting them to modern \nRussian conditions. Thus, domestic practice is sometimes characterized \nby an imitation mode of introducing innovations, since not every enterprise \nhas a subdivision engaged in the scientific development of managerial in -\nnovations. This position complicates the information exchange of manage -\nrial innovations [10]. \nConclusion: Thus, directly Russian leaders need to take into account \nchanges in the organizational structure, which should change in accord -\nance with the stages of the organization's life cycle, the transformation of \ncorporate culture, there should also be processes of self-organization and \nimprovement, raising the level of qualifications. But there is also the obliga -\ntion to reconstruct relations with the state, including giving business more \nindependence and a certain weakening of control by the inspection bodies.\nReferences \n1.

Topical issues of the relationship between organizational \nculture and economic security of an organization are considered. The \nanalysis of threats to the economic security of an organization determined \nby an ineffective organizational culture and mechanisms for their \nneutralization is presented. \nKeywords:  economic security, organizational culture, economic \nefficiency, return on investment in human capital, threat.\nHistorians have come to the conclusion that the main motives for the \nemergence of the state was the need to regulate economic relations be -\ntween the three main classes: artisans (farmers, etc.), creating material \nwealth and providing material needs; clergymen who create spiritual goods \nand provide spiritual needs; and warriors who provide security from exter -\nnal intrusions. \nThus, in the community of people, a social contract arose between its \nmembers, within the framework of which income is exchanged for security \nand a culture of interaction is formed in the field of ensuring the economic \nsecurity of the individual and society.\nThe problem of ensuring the economic security of the individual and \nthe state was considered from different points of view in the works of many \ndomestic and foreign scientists. However, this task cannot be solved once \nand for all. The world is changing, changing threats and methods of pre -\nventing them, one thing remains unchanged - the relationship between \npeople as a key factor in ensuring security. In turn, the effectiveness of \nthe relationship depends on the level of culture of all participants in the \nprocess.DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.91.91.004\n38\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsThere are many definitions of the economic security of an organization. \nIn this context, the economic security of an organization is understood as \nthe ability of the organization's management to ensure the protection of \nthe vital interests of the owner, investors and labor collective on the basis \nof the effective use of resources to prevent threats and ensure sustainable \ndevelopment. Achieving this goal is possible on the basis of the conclusion \nof a social contract between all participants and its effective implementa -\ntion. One part of this agreement is in the legal plane, the other - in the plane \nof the organizational culture.\nIn the scientific literature, there are different approaches to the defini -\ntion of organizational culture. On the basis of the integration of the ap -\nproaches of V. Sate, E. Stein, R. Quinnie, E. Jacusa, R. Cleemann and \nother researchers, it seems possible to define organizational culture as a \nsystem of values that determines the mission of an organization; the way \nof thinking, methods of action, norms of behavior of employees, formed as \na result of the search for ways to achieve the goals of the organization in a \nspecific cultural and historical context.\nThe issue of the impact of organizational culture on economic security \nis especially relevant for large companies, due to the fact that the owner \ncannot personally lead the entire team and convey the values   and princi -\nples of work to the entire work collective in the course of personal com -\nmunication. In this regard, organizational tools are used: \"Regulations on \ncorporate culture\", \"Ethical code\", \"Ethics cards\", \"Rules of conduct in con -\nflict situations\", corporate events, etc. However, it should be noted that for \nsmall businesses, organizational management culture creates pronounced \neffects - awareness of the values   of the organization, on the basis of which \na unique selling proposition (USP) is formed; improvement of the SPK; \ncost savings due to reduced staff turnover; the formation of additional in -\ncome in connection with the improvement of customer service.\nThe results of sociological research indicate that 85% of large Rus -\nsian corporations pursue a policy of introducing and developing corporate \nculture. In medium business this figure drops to 42%, in small business \n- 35%.1\nIn modern conditions, effective management of organizational culture \ncreates not just additional profit, but is the most important strategic re -\nsource in ensuring its economic security.\nLet's turn to statistics. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)2 \nover the past 5 years, every 5th Russian company surveyed has faced \n1 According to Cap Gemini Ernst & Young\n2 According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)\n39\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentseconomic crimes, which is 2 times higher than the global indicator. Both in \nthe Russian Federation and in the world, the main damage to companies \nis brought by middle managers, however, the damage from the actions of \ntop managers in Russian companies is 2 times higher than in the world. \nI would like to draw your attention to the fact that, in addition to direct fi -\nnancial and economic damage to the company, economic crimes harm the \nmoral and psychological climate in the team, business relations and the \nreputation of the company, relationships with regulatory bodies suffer from \nthe criminal actions of unscrupulous employees. In the end, everything is \nreflected in the financial results of operations, and for publicly traded com -\npanies - in the value of shares.\nIn addition, damage occurs when staff turnover (for example, hiring an \nemployee costs on average 25% of the annual wage, and if we are talking \nabout a top manager, then 150%); in case of unauthorized pauses in work \n(on average 20% of working time, i.e. the cost of maintaining an employee \nincreases by 20%), in case of petty theft and operation of organizational \nequipment for personal purposes, etc.\n  Earlier it was about real damage, but there is also the concept of \u201clost \nprofit\u201d. Lost profit - insignificant opportunities for earning income, profit due \nto an unsuccessful choice of a course of action. Most often, the effect of \nlost profits arises in connection with ineffective organizational behavior of \nemployees. First of all, we are talking about purchases not made by cus -\ntomers due to the lack of a smile, selling scripts, possession of sales tech -\nniques; unfinished contracts due to lack of negotiating competence; about \ntimely decisions not taken due to the fact that employees, being in a con -\nflict on time, did not transmit information, etc. Loss of profits, determined \nby factors lying in the field of organizational culture, averages 253 of profits.\nA separate group of threats to economic security is associated with \ninformation. The dissemination of confidential information entails signifi -\ncant consequences - from conflicts in the team, reducing productivity, and \nending with the loss of business. Every employee in the enterprise is a \npotential security threat. Employee actions can be intentional or uninten -\ntional. To localize the threats of unintentional spread of confidential infor -\nmation, one should use regulatory mechanisms and prescribe regulations \nfor working with information.  The reasons for the deliberate dissemination \nof information lie in the plane of values and motivation. Accordingly, the \norganization should not only be spelled out the regulations for its activities, \nbut also constantly work on the management of corporate culture, ensuring \nthat employees comply with the regulations on the basis of adherence to \n3 According to research by the author\n40\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentscorporate values.   \nAny economic crime or ineffective actions that form lost profits are based \non a person's decision. Organizational culture technologies are aimed at \ncreating conditions that motivate employees to make decisions that are \neffective for the company. Thus, a well-established organizational culture \nmanagement process is the most important means of preventing threats.\nSumming up the above, we can highlight the main directions of the \npositive influence of corporate culture on the economic security of the or -\nganization.\n1. Labor productivity increases as corporate culture forms a favora -\nble socio-psychological climate, due to this, staff turnover, conflicts are \nreduced, motivation, creativity, cohesion and initiative increase.\n2. The level of achievement of the set goals increases, because \ngoals are based on clear values   shared by employees.\n3. The return on investment in human capital is growing.\n4. The efficiency of managerial decisions is growing: the speed of \nmaking increases and more non-standard creative decisions appear that \ncan bring processes to a new level, because the fear of making a wrong \ndecision decreases.\n5. The economic efficiency of the workforce is increased since the \nemotional and energetic intelligence of the team is growing.\n6. Reduced transaction costs in the external environment.\n7. Elements of the external environment (consumers, suppliers, local \npopulations, financial institutions, etc.) turn from \u201cenemies\u201d into \u201cstakehold -\ners\u201d, which creates a synergy effect that leads to an increase in income.\n8. The effectiveness of the marketing strategy is increased as the \nunique value proposition is based on corporate values, which increases \ncustomer loyalty.\n9. Goodwill is on the rise. Goodwill can be an aggregate financial \nmeasure of investment in organizational culture.\n   In conclusion, it should be stated that an effective organizational cul -\nture directly affects the economic security of the company. It unites the \nteam, enhances staff involvement, reduces dysfunctional conflicts, with ef -\nfective corporate culture management, new employees quickly socialize \nand join the work, thanks to the formulated traditions, each employee has \nan idea of   how to act in a certain situation. As a result, there is no stupor \nin extraordinary circumstances, and the company does not lose money \nbecause of this. Initiative and creativity develops, which leads to break -\nthroughs in business and ensures sustainable development. Any success -\nful organization has a developed corporate culture, because it is the link \n41\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsbetween all members of the organization, it is like a skeleton on which the \nentire body of the organization rests. \nReferences\n1.

This article focuses on the fact that in the context of the \nstrengthening of globalization processes and the dynamic penetration of \ninformation and communication technologies into all spheres of human \nlife, society, business entities, civil law as a branch of law cannot ignore \nthe rapid development of new technologies. The authors note that digital \ntechnologies should not influence in any way the conceptual foundations \nand foundations that have developed historically and carry continuity in civil \nlaw as an industry. The article poses the question: will civil legislation be \nable to protect the rights of subjects of civil legal relations through significant \nand fundamental changes and it is determined that digital technologies will \nchange the nature of relationships between people in the implementation \nof property and non-property rights, change the \"civil landscape\", which \nwill lead to a change in all spheres of public life generally.\nKeywords: digital technologies, business entities, the Internet, civil \nlaw, globalization.\nRapid globalization and large-scale dynamic changes in the social and \ntechnological life of mankind over the past few decades have led to the \npenetration of the Internet into all spheres of human life. Legal scholars \nare increasingly conducting scientific discussions about how to ensure the \nright of all people to access the Internet, as well as how to effectively regu -\nlate public relations on the World Wide Web with the help of democratic \nlegal instruments. There is also ongoing debate over whether human rights \nassociated with the development of the Internet should be classified as DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.83.64.005\n43\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsfourth generation human rights, and attempts are being made to classify \nsuch rights within the fourth generation of human rights.\nThe purpose of the scientific work is to disclose the content of human \nrights associated with the development of information and communication \ntechnologies, based on an analysis of the characteristics of certain catego -\nries of these rights.\nAs digital technology has transformed the way business is done in vari -\nous industries over the past decade, the advancement of digital technol -\nogy has brought new levels of efficiency to nearly every industry. In 2016, \nthe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created a com -\nmittee to develop an international standard for blockchain technologies. \nBlockchain allows you to automate transactions without using a third party; \nis a distributed system of consensus and trust; is an infrastructure that \nprovides proof of identity. All transactions are carried out in one environ -\nment and can be easily tracked by checking the corresponding addresses, \nwhich have a sign of immutability and stability of information, which means \nthat it is impossible to change or delete records and provides access to the \nregistry of any subject.\nDigital signatures have gained even more recognition. For example, \nany Eversign electronic signature must comply with the clear security re -\nquirements of US and European law. The power of the digital signature \nphenomenon is obvious, as digital signatures added to a document keep \nit secure because it cannot be copied. Safety is the top priority of the E-\nContract.\nThrough digital signatures, domestic, national and international sub -\njects of agreements can conclude an agreement on transparent and fa -\ncilitated terms and accelerate the process of its signing. Technology has \nchanged the way contracts are managed and archived. Implementing digi -\ntal signatures allows partners to know that their counterparty is applying \nthe latest technology when it comes to contract execution.\nRecruiting appropriate actualization, in the digital age, and the protec -\ntion of personal moral rights. This is due to the volume of the informa -\ntion that a person independently provides, primarily on the Internet, and \nthe collection and systematization by enterprises, institutions, organiza -\ntions of a database of citizens as business entities. However, there are \ncorresponding problems in terms of what information is considered to be \ntransmitted by the person himself for the processing of personal data. The \nproblem is of a fundamental nature, and its solution requires new legisla -\ntive approaches. It is not necessary to patch holes, but to take concrete \nsteps to improve civil legislation, adopted taking into account the legislative \n44\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsnorms of those industries that are naturally influenced by the norms of civil \nlaw and vice versa.\nDigital technologies could not help but hurt the relations arising from \nthe results of intellectual activity and means of individualization of goods, \nworks, services, legal entities. Indeed, in the context of the development \nof digital technologies that determine the digital economy, the issue of pro -\ntecting intellectual property is strategic, since the protection of the latter \nstimulates the development of patent activity of subjects of civil legal rela -\ntions.\nIn the context of the development of the information society, it is neces -\nsary to take into account those factors that are naturally inherent in civil law \nas an industry: subject, method, functions, principles of legal regulation, \netc., without which it is impossible to create law and improve legal regula -\ntion [4].\nModern states are increasingly moving to digital methods of govern -\nment in the form of \"electronic government\" (\"electronic state\") due to the \nneed to reduce administrative costs and improve the efficiency of public \nadministration, as well as due to the increasing demands of citizens for the \nquality and availability of public services in cooperation with government \nagencies using Internet technologies [8].\nIn addition to the considered areas of application of digital technologies \nin law, it should be noted that certain elements of informatization are now \npresent in education and science, the system of taxation and tax adminis -\ntration, notarial activities, and the like.\nWith regard to the issue of access to the Internet, then, first of all, it \nshould be noted that, according to the position of some scientists, the right \nto the Internet is an online form of the right to access and disseminate \ninformation and includes the obligation of states to ensure the develop -\nment of information infrastructure and communications; create a market, \nthe price threshold of which will make Internet resources available; to en -\nsure freedom of access to information on Internet resources in general or \non specific sites, with the exception of certain cases [6].\nAs a rule, in international legal acts, national constitutions and laws, as \nwell as in judicial practice, the right to access the Internet is considered, \nfirst of all, as a condition and guarantee for the realization of traditional hu -\nman rights. At the same time, taking into account the special importance of \nthe Internet for the implementation of a significant number of human rights, \nthe development of the newest system of modern civil society, the trans -\nparency of public administration, access to it is increasingly recognized by \nscientists as an independent human right [2].\n45\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsThe right to access the Internet, as the right of everyone to freely use \na safe and open Internet, must cover two aspects. The first aspect is the \nprohibition of states to unreasonably restrict access to the Internet, in par -\nticular, to disconnect the Internet throughout the country or certain regions. \nBlocking individuals' access to the Internet may be justified, but only with \ngood reason and with proven reasoning and facts. The second aspect of \nthis right obliges states to take all reasonable steps to ensure that their citi -\nzens have maximum access to the Internet. For example, develop and im -\nplement specific and effective policies to ensure that the Internet is widely \naccessible, open and affordable for all groups of the population.\nInternational acts adopted by the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE and \nother international organizations are of key importance for understanding \nthe standards of access to the World Wide Web. Thus, the resolution of the \nUN Human Rights Council \"On the promotion, protection and implementa -\ntion of human rights on the Internet\" of July 5, 2012 calls on all states to \n\"promote and facilitate access to the Internet and international cooperation \naimed at the development of the media and communications in all coun -\ntries\" [16]. It should also be noted that blocking access to information in the \nmodern world is considered a violation of human rights, because accord -\ning to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone \nhas the right to \"Seek, receive and disseminate information and ideas ... \nregardless of state borders\" [12].\nThe practice of the European Court of Human Rights shows that the is -\nsue of access to the Internet is also the subject of a separate consideration \nin the ECHR. In particular, in the ECHR Chamber judgment, case Ahmet \nYildirim v. Turkey (statement N 3111/10) stated that \"the right of unhin -\ndered access to the Internet should also be recognized\". The court noted \nthat \u201cthe preventive measures were illegal and could not be considered as \naimed solely at blocking access to the controversial site, since they caused \nthe general blocking of all sites that were hosted by Google Sites. At the \nsame time, judicial control over the blocking of access to Internet sites did \nnot provide for conditions sufficient to prevent abuse: national law does \nnot provide any guarantee to prevent that blocking measures aimed at a \nspecific site are not used as a means of general blocking\" [14].\nConsider also the issue of the right to free speech on the Internet. Real -\nizing the right to freedom of expression on the Internet includes at least the \nfollowing principles: no one should be forced to act or speak out contrary \nto their beliefs; The right to seek and receive information means not only \nthat the state should not interfere when a person himself searches for in -\nformation online, but also in some cases should facilitate access to such \n46\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsinformation, for example, to respond to information requests of citizens. \nThe right to impart information and ideas includes not only the dissemina -\ntion of neutral information, but also the dissemination of statements that \nmay offend, shock or disturb. But only on condition that they do not violate \nother rights and freedoms, and are not illegal [2].\nIt is obvious that the basic document in this area, along with the Univer -\nsal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights, is the European Convention for the Protection of Human \nRights and Fundamental Freedoms, article 10 of which guarantees the \nright to freedom of expression, equally applies to a person : journalist, me -\ndia, artist, scientist, anyone who wants to spread certain information. This \nfreedom applies both to traditional communication channels (press, radio, \ntelevision, etc.) and to the dissemination of information on the Internet.\nThe already mentioned resolution of the UN Human Rights Council of \nJuly 5, 2012 reflects that \"the realization of human rights, in particular the \nright to freedom of speech on the Internet, is an issue of increasing interest \nand importance, since the fast pace of technological development enables \npeople around the world to use new information and communication tech -\nnologies\". In addition, a very important principle has been formulated, ac -\ncording to which \"the rights that a person has when working offline should \nbe equally protected online, in particular freedom of expression, is applied \nregardless of borders and through any media of his choice. in accordance \nwith article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Inter -\nnational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\"[10].\nThe right to be forgotten (the right to be forgotten). Note that this right \n(right to be forgotten) is an important part of the right to the protection of \npersonal data, which provides for the right of a person in certain specific \nsituations to demand the deletion of data about his person or his family \nmembers. The formation of the right to be forgotten is caused by the pos -\nsibility of finding information about individuals in search engines at any \ntime, regardless of the timing of its placement. In fact, it means the right \nto demand exclusion from search engines of URLs that have been legally \nposted on the Web, including by a person on their own, due to their obso -\nlescence or changing circumstances. [11]\nAt the same time, it should be noted that at one time the EU Court \nmade a decision that became fateful, because it was to them that the right \nto be forgotten was almost for the first time recognized at the official level \n[9]. The starting point of the case was an appeal from the Spanish citi -\nzen Mario Costech Gonzalez, who complained about newspaper adver -\ntisements (the electronic version of the publication was contained on the \n47\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentswebsite), published in 1998, but were still available on the Internet. They \nconcerned bankruptcy and a real estate auction for the sale of his house \nfor debts. Google searches for his name led to links to these pages. Mario \nCostech wanted them to be removed, since his debts had long been paid \noff and this information was irrelevant and did not reflect the objective state \nof affairs in which he was engaged today, which damaged his reputation. \nThe European Court of Justice has held that in order to secure the rights \nprovided for in the provisions of the then-effective Directive, \"the search \nengine operator is obliged to remove from the list of results returned in \nresponse to a search query based on the name of a person, links to web \npages posted by third parties containing information about this person, \nalso in the case when the name or information is not removed before or at \nthe same time from the web pages themselves, and even when the publi -\ncation on these pages is posted on a legal basis\"[15]. \nGoogle has created a system that allows a person to make a request \nfor \"oblivion\", that is, that search results in information systems are no \nlonger associated with his name. Since this decision was made, appeals \nto search engine operators have become widespread. Pages are removed \nonly on results in response to queries related to person's name. Google \nremoves URLs from all European Google domains (google.fr, google.de, \ngoogle.es etc.) and uses geolocation signals to restrict access to URLs \nfrom the country of the person requesting removal on all domains [5].\nThe next important step towards recognizing the right to be forgotten \nwas the adoption on April 27, 2016 of the General Data Protection Regula -\ntion - GDPR of the European Union, article 17 of which reads: the control -\nler is obliged to erase personal data without any unreasonable delay in \nthe event of one of the following grounds: (a) there is no longer a need for \npersonal data for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise \nprocessed; (B) the data subject revokes the consent on which the process -\ning is based, pursuant to paragraph (a) of Article 6 (1) or paragraph (a) of \nArticle 9 (2), and if there is no other legal basis for the processing; (C) the \ndata subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) and there \nis no overriding legal basis for the processing, or the data subject objects \nto the processing pursuant to Article 21 (2); (D) the personal data has been \nprocessed unlawfully; (E) the personal data must be erased in order to \ncomply with a statutory obligation in Union or Member State law that ap -\nplies to the controller; (F) the personal data were collected in connection \nwith the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8 (1)\" [7].\nSo, under the influence of the development of digital technologies, hu -\nman rights also evolve and change, as a result of which we can talk about \n48\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthe formation of a new category of human rights of a new generation, spe -\ncial in content and internal characteristics [16]. Despite some consolidation \nof certain aspects of these rights in international legal acts, acts of national \nlegislation, as well as in judicial practice, a significant number of issues \nremain unresolved related to a clear understanding of their nature, prop -\nerties and determination of status in the catalog of human rights (or are \nthese new rights, or whether they are an updated version of human rights \nthat were formed much earlier). The presence of diametrically opposed \nopinions in the plane of legal doctrine is a clear evidence of this. In any \ncase, the fact that the recognition of new human rights associated with the \ndevelopment of information and communication technologies, the expan -\nsion of the existing list is one of the trends in the transformation process of \nthe legal status of an individual, dictated by the requirements and needs of \nour time, remains unconditional. At the same time, it is not enough to rec -\nognize these rights, it is important to create and provide effective, efficient \nmechanisms for their implementation.\nReferences\n1. Boer V.M.

In the article, based on a review of the practice of attempts to \nexercise the right of secession in modern states, the author's views on the \nconnection between the methods of ensuring the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination and the preservation of state unity with the decentralization \nof the territorial organization of the \"mother state\", close to the signs of a \nfederal structure, are expressed; on the differences between treaty and \nconstitutional federations regarding the issue of secession.\nKeywords: state unity, sovereignty, secession, national and cultural \nidentity, constitutional identity, the right of peoples to self-determination, \nhuman rights.\nOne of the most discussed topics of state studies in the modern world \nis the issues of the law of state unity - as the main indicator (main feature) \nof state sovereignty and the right of secession (which is understood as \nthe question of the secession of some part of the state from this state). \nInitially, the relevant problems were related to the federal state structure \nand concerned a single case - the American practice associated with the \nattempt by six southern states in 1861 to secede from the United States, \nwhich caused a civil war, but the unity of the Federation was preserved1. \nHowever, after the Second World War, a new history of secession began, \nwhen its discussion arose as a collective right of the people. So, the au -\nthors: Soili Nisten-Haarala, professor of international law and comparative \nlaw at the University of Lapland (Finland) and Dmitry Furman (professor, \nInstitute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences), characterizing \n1 See about this: Buchanan A.

At the same time, according \nto these authors: \"the assertion of the right to self-determination should be \nqualified as its\" victory \"over the principle of sovereignty.\"3 The statement \nis clearly relative. Moreover, the authors themselves referring to two UN \nConventions of 1966: (the Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the \nConvention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) and the Declaration \non Friendly and Good Neighborly Relations adopted in 1970 by consensus \n(UN General Assembly Resolution 2625, XXV )\", Which \"speaks of the \nright to self-determination of all peoples, without limiting it by the colonial \npeoples \"and that\" the same principle is confirmed by the decisions of the \nInternational Court of Justice for Namibia and Western Sahara\", neverthe -\nless it is rightly noted that: \"from here to the real application of this declared \nprinciple to non-colonial peoples - almost as far as it was from the procla -\nmation of the legal equality of all people during the creation of the United \nStates to the real provision of the rights of black Americans\"4.\nThe new history of the realization of the people's right to self-determina -\ntion is associated with the post-war period, and applies not only to federa -\ntions, but also to unitary states. Thus, the widespread practice of seces -\nsion arose in the wake of the collapse of the colonial system (based on the \nDeclaration of Decolonization, 1960). Since the 90s of the XX, the practice \nof secession has been associated with the crisis of the world socialist sys -\ntem: in particular, with the collapse of such federal states as the USSR, \nSFRY and CCSR. Instead of the disintegrated USSR, 15 new states arose \n- the former Soviet republics of the USSR, between which separate territo -\nrial disputes arose, since the internal borders in the Union were not clear, \nhad an administrative rather than a political nature; the phenomenon of \nthe so-called \"unrecognized republics\" arose (Abkhazia, South Ossetia, \nNagorno-Karabakh - in the past autonomous republics that were part of the \nformer Soviet republics of the USSR). In 1980, 1995 and 2014, three refer -\nendums were held in the French-speaking province of Quebec, a subject \nof Federal Canada, the last of which was successful, but the legal position \n2 Soili Nisten-Haarala, Dmitry Furman.

The media noted the possible activation \nof separatist movements and organizations in other European states: in \nFrance - in Corsica and Brittany, in Italy - the \"League of the North\", and \nsome others.5  At the same time, the only case when the separation from \nthe state of its part in Europe was called for by most European countries \nand the United States was the separation of Kosovo from Serbia, carried \nout with the help of weapons, which is argued by the fact that there was an \nacute ethnic conflict between the Albanians and Serbs, supported by \"for -\neign force\" (Serbia).6 The processes of secession in modern times have \neven affected such a Mega-federal entity as the European Union: June \n23, 2016. a referendum was held on Britain's membership in the European \nUnion. 51, 89% of Britons voted for Brexit, slightly less against: 48, 11.\nAll the events described above, on the one hand, confirm the relevance \nof international law as the law of states, international guarantees of state \nsovereignty and the salvation of the world \"from wars and chaos\"7, on the \nother hand, the principles of the priority of human rights actualize discus -\nsions on the development of international legal and constitutional legal the \nfoundations of ensuring state unity in situations where there are problems \nin the relationship of the national state with the demands of domestic oppo -\nsition movements, either with another state, or with the international com -\nmunity as a whole, regarding the realization by the people constituting the \nnational minority of this state of their right to national self-determination \n- since in In all these cases, we are talking not only about the collective \n5 Timofeev V.

There can be many different forms and degrees of group \nautonomy within a state... the international community should reduce the \nattractiveness of secession by: a) providing more effective protection of mi -\nnority rights and b) encouraging the development of various kinds of intra-\nstate autonomy and ensuring that both parties respect autonomy agree -\nments... secessions, as the most extreme means against the most serious \ninjustices, should be isolated as special, exceptional cases, and at the \nsame time the spread of intrastate autonomies of the most varied kinds, \ndepending on the characteristics of different specific situations, should be \nencouraged\"8.\nActually, along this path - the creation of intrastate autonomies of \nvarious kinds - are modern processes of modification of unitary forms of \ngovernment in European countries, such as: Spain, Italy, France, partly \n- Portugal; outside Europe - China, which is a state \"with autonomous \nunits, possessing such a degree of autonomy, which is actually possible \nonly in a federal state, but with the official extension of the unitary form \nof the territorial structure characteristic of the rest of the state to these \nunits, and the proclamation of the prospect of integration of all parts to \na unitary state\"9. In analytical studies, they are characterized as states \nwith a new form of organization of territories, which in some features ap -\nproach the subjects of a federal state and stand out in a special kind of \nform of political-territorial structure, called: regionalized (regionalist) states, \nstates of autonomies, or \"quasi-unitary states\" (in in the latter case, we \nare talking about China). As Professor V.V. Maklakov: \"The Council of Eu -\nrope is in every possible way encouraging\" the idea of developing region -\nalism.\" According to him: \u201cWithin the framework of the European Union, \nthe European Parliament in 1988 adopted the Charter on Regionaliza -\ntion, which defined regions as units with historical, geographical, cultural, \netc. kinship; in these regions, the population is recognized as having the \nright to form territorial units in various forms, for example, in the form of \na region, a national association or a constituent entity of the Federation. \n8 Buchanan A.

M.: Eximo Publishing \nHouse, 2005. P. 524\n54\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsFederalism in this context is seen as a possible form of regionalization.\"10 \nThis approach presupposes the use of the possibilities of the constitutional \nlaw of the respective national state, in which the problem of relations be -\ntween the authorities and national minorities has arisen. A hint regarding \nthe subject of constitutional and legal regulation is provided by the study \nof secession as a right of exceptional cases - on the basis of a compara -\ntive analysis of the demands of separatist movements. European practice \nshows that among a number of reasons in connection with which the ques -\ntion of secession is raised: a) the lack of economic benefits of the stay of \nthe corresponding territory (a subject of the federation, or Megafederation; \nor autonomy as part of a unitary state) - overstated budgetary obligations \nof these territories as the most economically developed to the federal (cen -\ntral) government; b) expansion of the bureaucratic apparatus of the central \n(federal) government, which is turning into a barrier to business develop -\nment; c) the desire of compactly living national minorities to preserve the \nsigns of their national and cultural identity (national traditions, customs, \npreservation and development of the national language); social problems, \nincreased cost of living.\nWe would single out two types of constitutional instruments, on the ba -\nsis of the introduction of which into the subject of constitutional regulation, \nit would be possible to \"remove\" the tension in relations between the nation \nstate and ethnic minorities regarding the exercise of the right to self-deter -\nmination: cultural identity; b) introducing into the relationship between the \ncentral government and the regions (autonomies) to a certain extent the \nelements of delimiting the legislative subjects of jurisdiction and powers, \ni.e. vesting autonomies with separate legislative powers.\nThe issue of including in the subject of constitutional regulation of signs \nof national and cultural identity is associated with scientific ideas about the \nrelationship between the concepts of \"national identity\" and \"constitutional \nidentity\" Some experts oppose their combination. So, E. Lukyanova, in \nconnection with the analysis of the law of the European Union, comes to \nthe conclusion that: \"the combination of identities (national and constitu -\ntional) is at least controversial, and at most erroneous.\" The author argues \nthis by the fact that: \"The constitutional justice bodies of the EU member \nstates\" recognizing, in general, the priority of the EU law over national \nlegislation, tried to establish its conditions and limits, reserving the right in \nexceptional cases and under certain circumstances to consider the issue \nof non-application EU acts in national legal order. It was convenient to do it \n10 Maklakov V.V. Constitutional law of foreign countries. A common part. Textbook. M. \nWolters Kluwer. 2006. P 808-809; Chirkin V.E.

Ac -\ncording to Lukyanova: \"artificially created constitutional identity\" is a mani -\nfestation of \"defensive judicial constitutionalism\", the term \"constitutional \nidentity\" masks the \u201cdispute about sovereignty\".11 It is difficult to agree with \nthe reasoning of the distinguished author that the first step has been taken \ntowards the creation of a kind of \"universal constitution\", that a \"new com -\nmon constitutional identity\" is being born, that there is a \"tendency to inter -\nnationalize constitutional law\". Brexit refutes this.\nTo ensure state unity in the face of the threat of secession, in federal \nand unitary states through the use (modification) of such tools of the fed -\neral form of state structure as the delimitation of the subjects of jurisdiction \nand powers between the central government and the authorities of its ter -\nritories: for example, through the introduction of a sphere of joint jurisdic -\ntion of two levels of government , depending on the specific alignment \nof political forces, to ensure the development of cooperative or dualistic \nprinciples in the relationship between the central government and regional \nauthorities, autonomies in a unitary state (or subjects of a federal state.) \nIn connection with the assessment of the federal structure of the state \nin the context of the analysis of the law of secession as a right of an excep -\ntional case, in addition to the above, we note the importance of classifying \nfederations into contractual (i.e., created on the basis of a treaty between \nindependent states) and constitutional (i.e., proclaimed as federal in con -\nnection with the adoption (or amendments) of the Constitution of the state.) \nAs rightly noted in the scientific literature: \"Depending on the specified dif -\nference in these federations, controversial issues will be resolved in differ -\nent ways: assignment of powers to the federation or subjects, issues of se -\ncession, etc.\"12 In this regard, in relation to the practice of Russia, we note \nthat Russia is a constitutional Federation, which provides explanations for \nthe critical appeals of foreign scientists regarding Russian practice.\nThe federal structure of Russia was first proclaimed in two constitution -\nal acts: the Declaration of the Rights of the Working and Exploited People \n(of January 25 (12), 1918) and in the first Soviet Russian Constitution (July \n10, 1918), which confirmed the principles of federalism declared in the \nDeclaration rights of the working and exploited people, included this docu -\nment in its text as Section I of the Constitution. The Declaration and the \nConstitution declared that: \"The Soviet Russian Republic is established on \nthe basis of a free union of free nations as a federation of Soviet national \nrepublics\" (clause I.2; IV of the Declaration). In addition to the republics, \n11 Lukyanova E Identity and transformation of modern law // Comparative constitutional \nreview. 2020.\u21163 (136). P 130-\n12 Andreeva G.N. Ind. Works. P.507\n56\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthe Constitution of 1918 also mentioned this type of subjects of the Rus -\nsian Federation as autonomous regional unions. It is interesting to note \nthat on the date of Russia's declaration by the Federation, the circle of its \nsubjects was not determined, only in connection with the constitutional pro -\nvision on the federal structure in Russia (since 1918), autonomous regions \nand autonomous republics began to be created: the Crimean ASSR was \ncreated, formed mainly on the site regional Tauride republic (in Tsarist Rus -\nsia - it was called the Tauride province). In 1921, the Gorsk and Dagestan \nAutonomous Republics, the Adyghe and Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous \nRegions were created. In the 1920s-1930s the multinational Gorsk ASSR \nwas reorganized, on its basis the Kabardino-Balkarian, North Ossetian, \nChechen-Ingush autonomous regions were created, which, with the adop -\ntion of the next Constitution of the RSFSR - 1936, received higher statuses \n- autonomous republics13. \nIn conclusion, we note that the development of the modern science of \nsecession is based on the theory of the so-called remedial secession as \npart of the science of modern international law. The theory of remedial se -\ncession is based on the idea that the right to secede from one state arises \nonly in the presence of systematic and gross violations of human rights \nagainst a national minority or a certain people by the government of the \nparent state or by a part of its population whose actions are justified by the \ngovernment14.\nNew aspects in the development of the theory of remedial secession \nare created by judicial practice. So, of interest is the legal position for -\nmulated by the Supreme Court of Canada after the winning referendum \non the separation of French-speaking Quebec from Canada, which, ac -\ncording to experts, is a landmark \"regarding the legality, according to both \nCanadian and international law.\" This decision deserves its recognition as \na judicial precedent at the level of an international legal source. According \nto the decision of the Court: the exercise of the right to secession \"must \nbe sufficiently limited to prevent threats to the territorial integrity of the \nexisting state\" and (let's pay attention to this reservation!) its territory on \nthe basis of equality and without discrimination and respects the principles \nof self-determination in its internal structure\". Only a state that adheres to \nthese principles of building relationships with its people \"has the right to \nprotection in accordance with international law\" to protect against threats \nto its territorial integrity (the content of the decision of the Supreme Court \n13 See about this: Hovsepyan Zh.I.

The article deals with the issue of moral education of children \nof senior preschool age. The authors share the experience of one of the \npreschool educational organization with the approximate basic general \neducational program of preschool education \"From birth to school.\" On \nthe basis of the preschool educational institution, diagnostics was carried \nout to identify the level of moral education of children of senior preschool \nage. To study the formation of moral upbringing in older preschoolers, \ndiagnostic methods were carried out by G.A. Uruntaeva, I. B. Dermanova.\nKeywords. Morality, education, personality formation of a preschooler, \nchildren's health, the younger generation, innovations, technologies, senior \npreschool age.\nFor many years, the preschool organization has kept the best tradi -\ntions of upbringing a healthy generation, through ensuring the physical \nand mental health of the child, the search for innovative technologies for \nworking with preschool children is constantly being carried out.\nIn one of the preschool educational institutions of Almetyevsk, the Re -DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.74.70.007\n59\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentspublic of Tatarstan (Russia), an approximate basic general educational pro -\ngram of preschool education \"From birth to school\" is being implemented.\n  This program is an innovative general educational program document \nfor preschool institutions, it is based on the best traditions of domestic \npreschool education and is revised in accordance with the current Federal \nState Educational Standards (FSES) version of the \"Education and Train -\ning Program in Kindergarten\" edited by M. A. Vasilyeva, V. V. Gerbova, T. \nS. Komarova.\nThe PEO general education program provides a diversified devel -\nopment of children aged 2 to 7 years, taking into account their age and \nindividual characteristics in the main areas - physical, social-personal, \ncognitive-speech and artistic-aesthetic. The program ensures that pupils \nachieve school readiness. The standard term for mastering the program \nis 5 years.\nOn the basis of PEO, diagnostics was carried out to identify the level of \nmoral education of older preschool children. This study involved 20 people \naged 5-7 years.\nOlder preschoolers are no longer as strongly attached to toys, things, \nfor example, as younger preschoolers. 55% of older preschoolers share \ntheir toys quite calmly. But, there are also children who show ownership \nin things, in toys and it is rather difficult to part with them, and in our case, \nolder preschoolers keep more toys for themselves than they give to oth -\ners. Such children accounted for 35%, namely 7 children. Despite all the \nexplanations of the rules of the game, there were some children who did \nnot want to share toys at all, there were 10% of such children (2 people). \nPerhaps this happened against the background of the fact that the children \ndid not get enough sleep, were in a bad mood.\nBased on this diagnosis, it can be concluded that the child's behavior in \na situation of moral choice is dependent on mood, state during the period \nof the game. From the answers it is clear that 55% of older preschoolers \nshare with pleasure to a greater extent. According to the analysis of the \nmoral upbringing of older preschool children, we see that the level of moral \nupbringing is at a low level than we would like. Of course, there are older \npreschoolers whose moral upbringing has no negative sides. But never -\ntheless, we see from the revealed results that there are those who need to \nchange their level of moral upbringing.\nTo study the formation of moral upbringing in older preschoolers, we \ncarried out the diagnostic technique \"Subject pictures\" (the emotional-\nvalue aspect of morality), where the teacher shows pictures depicting the \npositive and negative actions of peers and the child must give a moral as -\n60\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentssessment to the actions shown in the picture, which will reveal the attitude \nchildren to moral standards.\n28 people, aged 5-7 years, took part in this diagnosis, where from Fig -\nure 2 it can be seen that 65% of older preschoolers showed an average \nlevel of formation of an emotional attitude to moral norms, 15% have a low \nlevel and 25% of older preschoolers have a high level, which shows the \nneed to increase the obtained level among older preschoolers, namely \nthose who have low and medium levels.\nFor a more complete analysis of moral upbringing, we conducted a \nconversation with older preschoolers using the method of G. A. Uruntaeva \n\"Finish history\" (the cognitive component of moral upbringing).\n60% of older preschoolers have an average level of formation of moral \nstandards, 30% of children have a low level and 10% of older preschool -\ners showed a high level, which shows the need for additional measures to \nimprove the level of moral education.\nThis result shows that work should be carried out with older preschool -\ners, which has additional measures to increase the level of formation of an \nemotional attitude to moral norms.\nFor a deeper analysis of the activities of kindergarten teachers on the \nmoral upbringing of older preschoolers and understanding of parents for \nthe need for moral upbringing of children studying in a preschool educa -\ntional organization, we conducted a survey among parents.\n17 parents took part in the survey. There are parents of older preschool -\ners who do not believe that in modern society there is an acute problem of \nthe moral upbringing of children, namely 18%, which is a far from correct \nanswer.\nIn fact, such a problem exists in our world and it all depends on the up -\nbringing of parents and the support of this problem by a kindergarten. 47% \nof parents also agree with this point of view, which is less than half and \nrequires a conversation with parents so that they can change their minds \nbased on certain facts. There are parents who are not enlightened in this \nmatter - 35%.\nConsequently, there are parents who do not see the problem in the \nmodern world in the moral upbringing of children, which is a rather sad \nresult. There are parents who do not know this problem, or rather do not \nrecognize it at all.\nThese results need to be changed for the better with the help of conver -\nsations, round tables, where clear criteria for the need for moral education \nin a preschool institution and at home will be presented. The majority of \nparents believe that work on moral education in a preschool educational \n61\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsinstitution can be carried out, namely, 53%. This result is good, but not \nexcellent, because other parents either do not consider it possible and \nnecessary (12%), or do not know the answer to this question (35%).\nBased on Figure 5, it can be seen that slightly less than half of the par -\nents do not know and do not consider it possible to carry out work on moral \neducation in a preschool institution. This result is not positive and requires \na change and education of parents in this area. A rather small number of \nparents are ready to take part and help educators in a preschool institution \nin spiritual and moral education, namely, 47%. There are parents who are \nabsolutely not ready to cooperate with a preschool institution (35%) and \n18% do not know the answer to this question.\nConsequently, parents are not ready to cooperate with a preschool insti -\ntution, and this is a rather big problem, because the result of the moral edu -\ncation of preschool children depends not only on the preschool institution, \nbut also on the upbringing of the parents. If parents control themselves in \nexpressions and actions, both among themselves and among themselves, \nthen in a preschool institution such children only need to consolidate the \nknowledge that they already have.\nCooperation with PEO guarantees joint work on the moral education \nof older preschoolers in connection with the fact that the work aimed at \nmoral education will go from all sides. When asked what qualities a teacher \nneeds to carry out the process of moral upbringing of children, the majority \nof parents (59%) answered: love, kindness, understanding; 41% of parents \nchose the answer: kindness, hard work, emotional sensitivity.\nFrom these data, it follows that one of the criteria presented in the \nresponses is kindness. Consequently, all parents believe that the moral \neducation of children contains, first of all, kindness. Consequently, par -\nents of preschoolers believe that understanding and responsiveness to the \nteacher is more necessary. But in our opinion, parents should also have \nthe same qualities.\nMost parents imagine that kindness, responsiveness, love, understand -\ning, and the desire to help are an indicator of moral upbringing. There are \n71% of such parents, which is a good result. All parents chose love and \nresponsiveness as an indicator of a person's moral upbringing.\n88% of parents teach their children the correct behavior in public trans -\nport, society, etc. But there are those parents who do not teach the correct \nbehavior of their preschoolers at all, namely 12%. Consequently, most of \nthem strive to teach their children the correct behavior, but there are those \nwho believe that they should teach all the norms in the kindergarten, but \nlearning takes place both at home and in the kindergarten.\n62\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsIt is the responsibility of the parents to educate and teach, and the re -\nsponsibility of the preschool educator to support this learning.\nThus, MBPEI implements an approximate basic general education pro -\ngram of preschool education \"From birth to school\", as well as additional \neducational programs and paid additional educational services.\nAfter analyzing the annual curriculum of activities for the moral educa -\ntion of older preschoolers, it was revealed that all of the listed activities are \naimed at the moral education of older preschool children in a preschool \neducational organization, but due to the fact that their number is not large \nto achieve a good result, it was proposed a set of measures developed for \nthe moral education of senior preschoolers to teachers and a methodolo -\ngist of a preschool educational organization.\nTo diagnose the moral upbringing of older preschoolers, we used the \nmethodology of I. B. Dermanova \"Shared the toys\", the method \"Scene \npictures\", the method of G. A. Uruntaeva \"Finish the story\" and the ques -\ntioning of parents \"Moral education in PEI.\"\nFrom our analysis it is clear that the level of moral upbringing in older \npreschoolers must be increased, as well as the level of understanding of \nthe need for moral upbringing of preschoolers among their parents must \nalso be raised with the help of round tables, conversations, presentation \nmeetings, where convincing facts will be presented.\nThe following problems were identified: not all children know how to \nshare toys (activity component), not everyone can explain and distinguish \nbetween good and bad actions (emotional component); a small part of \nolder preschoolers have an idea of   moral norms (cognitive component).\nIn order to increase this efficiency and the level of moral education in \ngeneral, a set of measures was developed. On the moral education of \nolder preschoolers through didactic games: the game - travel, \"The world \naround us\", the game \"In the country of the polite\", the game \"Who knows \nmore kind words\", the game \"Teach obedience\", the game \"It is necessary \nand impossible\", the game \"Explain why?\", \"How can you?\" Game, \"Hugs\" \ngame, \"Love Pyramid\" game,\"Love and Friendship Day\" entertainment.\nFor parents on the problems of moral education of children: par -\nent meeting \"Rules of conduct in society\", conversation \"Good and bad \ndeeds\", watching a movie about what polite words should be used in the \nvocabulary with children so that they also know and use them and etc. We \nheld these events on the basis of PEO.\nThus, these activities, through didactic games, are aimed at increasing \nthe level of moral upbringing of older preschoolers in a children's educa -\ntional organization. They will help to expand the idea of   older preschoolers \n63\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsabout the concept of morality, to look for and find new solutions for the \nformation of moral education.\nReferences\n1.

The article examines the role of folk pedagogy in the \ndevelopment of children of primary school age. Especially, mobile folk \ngames are analyzed. The problem of introducing younger students to the \nexperience, culture, traditions, and customs of their people is raised. The \nviews and approaches to the problem of the Russian and Tatar advanced \nrepresentatives of KD Ushinsky, G.A. Vinogradova, E.A. Pokrovsky, K. \nNasyiri, R. Fakhreddin, G. Tukai are analyzed.\nKeywords:  folk pedagogy, development, mental education, culture of \nthe people, moral values, common human culture, outdoor games, the \noriginality of the language.\nMany scientists, practicing teachers write about introducing a child to \nthe culture of their people, they say a lot. Domestic and foreign educators \nwrote about this. Those who are involved in the upbringing and training of \nthe younger generation are concerned about this problem.\nIf we turn to the heritage of our people, of course, it fosters respect, \npride in the land on which you live. Therefore, both teachers and parents \nbelieve that children need to know and study the culture of their ancestors. \nHere the emphasis is placed on knowledge of the history of the people, \ntheir culture. This will help our children in the future to treat the cultural \ntraditions of other nations with respect and interest.\n It is known that every nation has its own fairy tales, songs, dances, \ngames, and they all pass on from generation to generation the basic moral \nvalues: goodness, conscience, honor, friendship, mutual assistance, and DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.87.34.008\n65\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsdiligence.\nThus, we can say that the introduction of a child to folk culture begins \nfrom childhood, where the basic concepts and examples of behavior are \nlaid.\nToday we are increasingly turning to the experience of our ancestors, to \nthe origins of public education and upbringing, because it is there that we \nfind answers to many difficult questions of today.\nThe norms and rules of upbringing, developed by folk pedagogy, are \nalive and working in the modern world. They are influential, used by teach -\ners, parents, adults, because they are time-tested. All folk wisdom, which \nhas been formed over the centuries, is concentrated in them. We also find \nuniversal human values   in them.\nFor example, a folk game. She is one of the means of raising children. \nIt is believed that the folk game is a unique phenomenon of human culture. \nIt's no secret that every century, every era, generation has its own games. \nThese favorite games are passed on from one generation to the next.\nThe relevance of this problem is due to the fact that the wisdom of the \npeople is an irreplaceable means of replenishing a child's knowledge and \nideas about the world around him, the development of intellectual, moral \nqualities, thinking. The younger schoolchild, through a folk outdoor game, \ngets to know the history, culture, and customs of his people. Since ancient \ntimes, they have reflected the way of life of people, their way of life, nation -\nal traditions, ideas about courage, honor, courage. It is especially impor -\ntant to note the role of outdoor games. Outdoor games teach you to show \nendurance, will, ingenuity. Folk games are a traditional pedagogical tool.\nOutdoor games in pedagogy are considered as an important means of \nthe all-round development of the child. Outdoor games are in the culture \nof every nation, they have a deep meaning - they develop the child both \nphysically and spiritually, help the formation of moral development. Lead -\ning representatives KD Ushinsky, G.A. Vinogradova, E.A. Pokrovsky and \nothers, taking care of education, enlightenment of the masses, paid spe -\ncial attention to folk games. They urged through outdoor games to convey \nto the descendants folk customs, forms and content of spoken texts, the \noriginality of the language. Folk games attract children from preschool age \nwith their imagery. The games include moments of struggle, competition, \nthey evoke emotions of joy, fears, warn of caution, this captivates children. \nThrough play, children develop interest and respect for the culture of Rus -\nsia, develop patriotic feelings and love for the Motherland.\nRussian educator, educator Konstantin Dmitrievich on the educational \nvalue of folk outdoor games for the development of the child's personal -\n66\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsity. Ushinsky wrote that education, created by the people themselves and \nbased on folk traditions, has an educational power based on abstract ideas \nor borrowed from other peoples.\n  K. D. Ushinsky also believed that special attention should be paid to \nfolk games. Folk games are a rich source for the upbringing of children and \na powerful educational tool for the development of a harmonious personal -\nity.\nA.P. Usova. She noted that good children's play is an example of high \npedagogical skill. It is not only a separate game that has educational sig -\nnificance, but in folk pedagogy the sequence of folk games from infancy \nto maturity is determined. Folk games, fairy tales, songs created by the \npeople are passed on from the older generation to the younger, providing \ngreat educational value to the upbringing of children [3, p. 325].\nThe enormous educational value of folk games was pointed out by ev -\neryone who, in one way or another, encountered them in their pedagogical \nor scientific activities.\nE.A. Pokrovsky noted that since ancient times, various types of games \nand merrymaking occupied a leading place in the life of the people. Out -\ndoor games are of great educational value, they require extensive partici -\npation in all bodily and spiritual forces, dexterous agile body movements. \nBased on the analysis of national games, he came to the conclusion that \nthe character of the people, undoubtedly, leaves its noticeable imprint on \nmany manifestations of public and private life of people. This character \nalso affects children's games, reflected in them the sharper and more dis -\ntinctly, the more enthusiasm and ease the children play, and therefore with \nmore freedom to manifest their national character.\nP.F. Lesgaft wrote that the folk games of the child are introduced to the \nhabits and customs of only a certain area, family life, a certain environment \nsurrounding him. He considered folk games to be the most valuable means \nof comprehensive education of the child's personality, the development of \nhis moral qualities: honesty, truthfulness, endurance, discipline, camara -\nderie.\nP.F. Lesgaft was one of the first to suggest using outdoor games in \nraising children. He wrote: \"We should use games to teach them (children) \nto master themselves.\" In play, one must \"teach them to restrain their di -\nvergent feelings and thus teach them to subordinate their actions to con -\nsciousness\" [6].\nYa.I. Khanbikov notes that the game folklore of the Tatar people is rich \nand diverse. It is also valued for its motor content. Walking, running, jump -\ning, throwing, throwing and catching, other types of movements - all this \n67\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentscan be found in Tatar folk games. Almost all of them, to a greater or lesser \nextent, contribute to the formation of vital skills, improvement of physical \ndevelopment, bring up the necessary moral and volitional qualities in chil -\ndren of primary school age [3, p. 78].\nEncyclopedist, educator, teacher of the late XIX and early XX centuries \nRizaetdin Fakhretdinov wrote in his instructions on the problem of the rela -\ntionship between mother and child. The educator argued that no one can \ntreat their children like their own mother, and therefore he believes that no \none can replace their own mother in raising children, not even their own fa -\nther. \"The upbringing received in childhood from the mother, children retain \nin themselves until gray hair\", \"Raised mothers create a positive motivation \nto get an education\" [1, p. 33].\nWe understand that he wrote about cleanliness, neatness, neatness, \neducation of culture, instilling a culture of a healthy lifestyle in the life of \nchildren. All this is realized with the help of traditions, people's experience, \ncustoms, folk games.\nThey have not lost their relevance in modern conditions and can serve \nas a good example of a humane attitude in raising children. This shows \nthe talent of the teacher, thinker, philosopher Rizaetdin Fakhretdinov, who \nmanaged to reveal the essential, deep issues of raising children.\nThe works of the great Tatar poet Gabdulla Tukay contribute to the for -\nmation in children of love for their native land, respect for their country. As \none of the aspects of the formation of a harmoniously developed personal -\nity, G. Tukay pointed to aesthetic education. The poet considered the most \nimportant means of aesthetic education to familiarize children and youth \nwith examples of fiction, folk art, dramatic and visual arts, music, secular \nsinging, as well as direct observation of wildlife.\nThe folk wisdom used by the author characterizes the heroes of the \nworks and various situations, helps to reflect the thoughts and state of \nmind of the characters. In his article \"Our Poems\" (\"Shigyrl\u0259rebez\") Tukai \npointed out that folk songs are the basis of Tatar literature. Love for these \nsongs from childhood developed in the child a love for his native language. \nThe poet skillfully revealed the educational and upbringing significance of \nhis native language. Tukay welcomed the growing interest of young people \nin music and folk songs. The choice of a good book, song, work of art is \ndetermined by the general development of a person, his preparedness for \nthe correct understanding of works of art and folk art. Therefore, Tukay \nurged to tirelessly improve the culture of the people, especially the growing \ngeneration [7].\nMany pedagogical scientists believe that folk games, with their imag -\n68\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsery, captivate children of both preschool age and younger schoolchildren. \nGames contain an element of competition, struggle, and, therefore, evoke \nemotions of joy, fear, induce caution, and thus captivate children.\nPlay is the main activity of preschoolers. She is the main activity of chil -\ndren in kindergarten. The game comprehensively develops and educates \nchildren.\nIn the educational process of primary school, play is given great impor -\ntance in the social development of a child's personality, and playing skills \nare considered as one of the indicators of the development of a younger \nstudent.\nScientists believe that folk games in combination with other educational \nmeans form the basis for the formation of a harmoniously developed, active \npersonality, which combines moral purity, spiritual wealth and a physically \ndeveloped personality. The role of games in the development of younger \nstudents is enormous. They activate the brain, broaden their horizons, chil -\ndren's ideas about the world around them, and improve mental processes. \nPromote the stimulation of the transition of the child's body to a higher \nstage of development [3, p. 15].\nThe folk game introduces children to folk culture, performs such func -\ntions as entertainment, cognitive, diagnostic, corrective, and developmen -\ntal. An active folk game, a game is a joy, it is laughter, a way of communi -\ncation between children, which has great educational power. It is known \nthat play will help in the development of friendly relations between children \n(help, mutual assistance). Such qualities as kindness, respect for elders \ndevelop, the physical qualities of children develop.\nAlso, games help to make the work of students at a creative-search \nlevel, in the learning process, in the pedagogical activity of a teacher inter -\nesting and exciting.\nThe game, as you know, accompanies children from the first days of \nlife. Through play, through their attitude to the toy, they comprehend their \nsurroundings. And at school age, the game becomes more complicated, \nbut still occupies one of the most important places in the minds and activi -\nties of children.\nIn our opinion, play helps to make the educational process alive, to \nsuccessfully assimilate the content of new activities, facilitates adaptation \nto educational conditions and provides psychological comfort, arouses cre -\native interest in what is being studied, develops the child's independence \nand activity among peers.\nWith the help of the game, you can develop attention, memory, thinking, \nimagination of the child, i.e. those qualities that are necessary for later life. \n69\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsWhile playing, a child can acquire new knowledge, abilities, skills, develop \nabilities, sometimes without realizing it. Play is a natural form of learning \nfor a child. Through play, the teacher delivers educational material in a way \nthat is convenient and natural for children to accept.\nThe amusement of the conditional world of the game makes the monot -\nonous activity of memorizing, repeating, consolidating or assimilating in -\nformation positively emotionally colored, and the emotionality of the game \naction activates all mental processes and functions of the child.\nAnother positive side of the game is that it promotes the use of knowl -\nedge in a new situation, thus, the material assimilated by students passes \nthrough a kind of practice, brings variety and interest to the educational \nprocess. Play is an essential learning tool for primary school students. \nGames specially selected for a particular lesson help to solve many edu -\ncational problems. Each game is a child's communication with adults, with \nother children.\nThe game is a school of cooperation. In this school of cooperation, the \nchild learns relationships and rejoice at success. What is very important, \nthe junior schoolchild learns to rejoice at both his own and others', and to \nendure failures steadfastly [3].\nA characteristic feature of the use of the game in the educational process \n(game technologies) is the modeling of vital situations (practice-oriented \nsituations) and the search for ways to solve them. The leading method of \ngaming technology is the game. Organizational forms of this technology \ncan be business games, role-playing games, story games, travel games, \ndidactic games [5, p. 567]. In addition, play has another aspect that is \nimportant in organizing work with children - prevention, diagnosis and cor -\nrection of undesirable options for child development.\nThus, we can conclude that through folk traditions, games, folklore, a \nchild can develop, can show his skills, imagination, show himself in games, \nparticipating in various competitions, the child can express himself and \ndevelop.\nAt the primary school age, the child realizes half of the information \nthrough the game, and he put a lot of instructive things into the people in \nhis children's games.\nTake folk tales, for example. Fairy tales tell the child about the world \nin which the child lives, about his native country, about his ancestors. It is \nimportant to acquaint children with folk traditions at school. This will help in \nthe development of the younger student.\nIf we analyze the educational value of folk wisdom, it becomes clear \nthat folk pedagogy, wisdom encourages the younger student, children to \n70\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsstrive to follow good examples, already attached, established norms and \nrules.\nEach teacher should remember that it is important to create in children \na specific attitude towards the traditions and customs of their people. It is \nimportant to create feelings of respect, understanding of their essence, \nincluding the desire to study and follow the example of folk wisdom.\nFor all peoples, the main goal of educating the younger generation was \nto care for the preservation, strengthening and development of folk cus -\ntoms and traditions, to take care of passing on to the younger generations \ntheir good experience, including pedagogical experience, accumulated at \nall times.\nSo, we can say that the strength of folk pedagogy, folk traditions, first of \nall, lies in a humane, kind, humane approach to the personality of a child.  \n References\n1.

One of the options for \nsolving the identified problem of integrating various courses is the creation \nof a base of interdisciplinary tasks. As a test of the effectiveness of the \napplication of this type of problems, it is proposed to use testing, including \nthe problems of various courses.\nKeywords: Interdisciplinary relations between physics and \nmathematics; integration of taught courses; interdisciplinary tasks; an \nintegrated approach; modification of the principle of presentation of the \nmaterial; conical sections; stress tensors in mathematics and physics; \nmoment of inertia; mathematical apparatus; physical and mathematical \ntraining.\nModern economic conditions determine the increasing requirements for \nspecialists with higher education, the quality of their training. In addition to \nfundamental knowledge in the field of mathematics and physics, graduates \nof the natural science faculties of higher educational institutions should be \nable to use the acquired skills as a tool for solving various applied prob -\nlems.\nHowever, in connection with the past education reform, there was a \nreduction in classroom hours allocated for the study of subjects of the natu -\nral science block in universities and schools. Thus, a certain contradiction \nhas appeared between the increasing requirements for mathematical and DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.39.87.009\n72\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsphysical education and the reduction in the time allotted for studying both \nthe course of higher mathematics and the course of general physics. One \nof the ways to resolve the noted contradiction is the reorganization of the \nindependent work of students, and the integration of these courses also \nbecomes relevant.\nStudying a cycle of physical and mathematical disciplines often turns \ninto a waste of time from the point of view of students. Even students in the \nareas of training directly related to the in-depth study of mathematics and \nphysics do not see the connection between the subjects of the physics and \nmathematics cycle and their practical orientation. Only by working on the \nfinal qualifying work, students begin to realize the need for the disciplines \nstudied earlier. \"How would I study if I knew that I would need all this!\" - \nFrom time to time we hear from students of graduation courses.\nThe traditional system of physics and mathematics education in higher \neducation is least of all focused on giving the student a tool for solving \nspecific problems.\nImagine that students of a radio engineering university until the last \nyear are taught to assemble detector receivers, while the students are not \nable to turn on the TV on their own. The absurdity of this picture is obvious, \nbut the teaching of physical and mathematical disciplines is often built ac -\ncording to this scheme. Having spent a lot of time studying mathematics, \nphysics and computer disciplines, students turn out to be absolutely help -\nless in solving real problems.\nIn lectures and practical classes in physics and special disciplines, one \nhas to make constant mathematical digressions in order to tell or remind \nstudents about the mathematical apparatus that will be used in presenting \nthe material (a significant part of the lecture is often spent on mathematical \ntransformations that obscure physical ideas). The problem is that students \ndo not see the connection between the various disciplines being studied. \nIn this regard, it is impractical to teach \"pure\" mathematics for technical \nspecialties. The mathematical apparatus must be presented with a specific \napplication in a particular practical area, although this is a certain difficulty \nfor some teachers due to the limited time for teaching the discipline, while, \naccording to new standards, it is also necessary to focus on the competen -\ncies that are prescribed for each of the taught disciplines. Thus, the phys -\nics course can be considered as an excellent field for the application and \nconsolidation of the skills in applying mathematical methods.\nThe teaching of physics and special disciplines is often not coordinated. \nYou may encounter a situation when, for example, the physical founda -\ntions of mechanics within the framework of the physics course and theo -\n73\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsretical mechanics, electrodynamics and electrical engineering disciplines \nare taught simultaneously or almost simultaneously. At the same time, dif -\nferent terminology, different designations, different methods of solving es -\nsentially identical problems are used. The students get the impression that \nthe physics course has nothing to do with real problems. Interdisciplinary \nconnections are not traced due to a narrowly pragmatic view of the sub -\nject of teachers of special disciplines and an overly theorized approach \nto teaching physics. As a result, not only students do not see the point in \nstudying a physics course, but also graduating departments, which leads \nto a systematic decrease in the number of hours devoted to studying a \nphysics course for technical specialties.\nAs an experiment, an analysis of the content of courses in higher math -\nematics and general physics for students of engineering specialties was \ncarried out, as a result of which some topics of sections of the course of \nhigher mathematics and general physics were identified, in which the use \nof integrated approaches would be the most effective.\nThe presentation of certain topics of the physics course requires an \nadequate application of the mathematical apparatus. On the other hand, \ncertain issues of the physics course can be viewed as the application of \nmathematics to solving physics problems. It makes sense to apply this ap -\nproach in teaching in higher education. For this, it is necessary to modify \nthe principle of presenting the material, both in mathematics and physics. \nSince in our time mathematics is the language of modern natural science, \nit is very important in the classroom in mathematics to provide an integrat -\ned connection with subjects such as physics. This can be achieved both \nby selecting the tasks of the physical content, and by clarifying the physi -\ncal, geometric and mechanical meaning of the concepts used. A deeper \nintertwining of these two disciplines can be realized by studying the various \nsections. Let's take a look at some of them.\n\u00b7 Conical sections and motion of cosmic bodies in the course \"Analyti -\ncal geometry\".\nConical sections play a certain role in physics, and not only in celestial \nmechanics, but also in optics. In astronomy, conical sections are obtained \nby studying the motion of celestial bodies. They are formed at the inter -\nsection of a straight circular cone with a plane. Conical sections include \ncurves of the second order: ellipse, parabola and hyperbola. Thus, when \nstudying conic sections in the course \"Analytical Geometry\", it is possible \nto consider the trajectories of motion of cosmic bodies as examples [1].\n\u00b7 Stress tensors in mathematics and physics.\nA tensor in mathematics is a quantity that has components in each \n74\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsof a given set of coordinate systems, and the components, when pass -\ning from one coordinate system to another, are transformed according to \na certain law. Tensor calculus, or \"absolute differential calculus\", allows \nscientists to formulate and consider general covariant physical laws that \nremain in force in the transition from one coordinate system to another. \nTensors are defined in geometric spaces of any number of dimensions \nand play an important role in differential geometry, quantum mechanics, \ncelestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, elasticity theory, and especially in \ngeneral relativity. Vectors and scalars are special cases of tensors. Thus, \none of the main tasks of tensor calculus is to find analytical formulations \nof the laws of mechanics, geometry, physics, independent of the choice of \nthe coordinate system [2].\n\u00b7 Moment of inertia.\nMoment is a mathematical concept that plays an important role in me -\nchanics and probability theory. The first-order moment in mechanics is \ncalled the static moment, and the second-order moment is called the mo -\nment of inertia. The moment of inertia of a body characterizes the inertial \nproperties of a body during rotational motion around its axis, like a mass \nthat characterizes the inertial properties of a body during translational mo -\ntion. The moment of inertia of a body has many values, depending on the \naxis of rotation. The concept of the moment of inertia is widely used in solv -\ning many problems of mechanics and technology. In mechanics, axial and \ncentrifugal moments of inertia are distinguished. The moment of inertia of \nbodies of complex configuration is usually determined experimentally. So, \nfor example, two methods of experimental determination of the moment \nof inertia can be used: by analyzing the oscillations of a physical pendu -\nlum, of which the investigated body is a component, and by studying the \nrotational motion of this body. In mathematics, we also meet the problem \nof finding the moments of inertia in the study of mechanical applications of \ndouble, triple, curvilinear and surface integrals [3].\nOn the above-mentioned topics, trial lectures were developed and con -\nducted. Several articles have been published based on the materials of \nthese lectures. In addition, active work is being done on the development \nof practical lessons on the topics of the lectures used. Problems of physi -\ncal content are selected that can be solved in practical classes in higher \nmathematics.\nPractical training is one of the most important components of the edu -\ncational process in physics. They contribute to the introduction of students \nto independent work, teach to analyze the studied physical phenomena, to \nuse the theoretical knowledge gained in practice. If this is supported by a \n75\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsmathematical basis, then the result will be very good.\nThus, it is necessary to create a base of interdisciplinary problems \nused in disciplines adjacent to mathematics in higher education. Problems \nwith interdisciplinary content in didactics are usually understood as tasks \nwhose solution and analysis requires the attraction and use of knowledge \nin various subjects of the general technical and special cycle. This type \nalso includes tasks based on the material of one academic discipline, if \nthey are used for a specific didactic purpose in teaching another discipline. \nThe use of interdisciplinary problems in teaching physics and mathemat -\nics plays an essential role in the formation of students' abilities and skills \nin using the mathematical apparatus in practice and for studying other \ndisciplines. They allow concepts, laws and formulas previously studied in \nother disciplines to be organically incorporated into the system of students' \nknowledge and to develop their skills and abilities for further application of \nthis knowledge in order to deeply study subsequent disciplines. In addition, \nsolving problems, the content of which is taken from other curricula of other \ndisciplines, is one of the most effective methods that stimulate the activity \nof the cognitive process, allowing to control the thinking of students and \ncontribute to the development of interest in the discipline [4].\nThe effectiveness of the implementation of such a teaching method is \nchecked by creating various tests that include questions related to both \nphysics and mathematics. Testing can be carried out, for comparison, in \nthe group trained according to the new method and in the control group, \nwhich was trained according to the standard program. Based on the results \nof such testing, it will be possible to draw comprehensive conclusions.\nThe introduction of such an approach into the process of teaching math -\nematics and physics would increase the understanding of the material be -\ning studied by the trainees. Also, such an approach can provide additional \nknowledge that goes beyond the boundaries of the subject being studied, \nwhich in the future, undoubtedly, would make it possible to transfer the \ntraining of future specialists to a higher level.\nReferences\n1.

The appearance in society of a large number of children in a \ndifficult life situation, with a high degree of maladjustment in need of social \nrehabilitation and making unauthorized departures from a stationary insti -\ntution, posed a task for social specialists to develop forms and methods of \nwork to level the disadvantage of minors.\nThe complex work of all specialists of the inpatient institution is able to \nprevent unauthorized departures and bring up a harmoniously developed \npersonality. \nRelevance of the problem . According to various estimates, there are \nbetween 150000 and 4 million homeless and neglected children in Russia. \nThey often \"live\" under the same roof with their parents, but their ties with \nthe family are atrophied or destroyed. The parental family not only failed to \nfulfill its functions in relation to them, but also became a factor deforming \ntheir social and individual development - this is an acute problem in society. \nStatistics and practice show that adolescents leave different families \n- both dysfunctional and well-off. If in the first case it is clear why adoles -\ncents run away from home: they beat them, morally humiliate them, do not \nfeed their own alcoholic parents, from birth the children are left to them -\nselves and are accustomed to leading an uncontrolled lifestyle. Either in \nprosperous families, the situation is different: the parents declare that they \nhave to work hard to provide the child with prosperity and comfort, while \nthere is often no time at all for the spiritual upbringing of the child. When a \nchild begins to grow up, love on the part of adults must take on a different \nform. A small child needs good care, safety, control, but for a teenager, \nparental love is acceptance and support of him as a person, independent \nand individual, capable of taking responsibility for his life.\nKeywords : unauthorized cares, prevention of offenses, adaptation of \nminors, health promotion, assistance to pupils.DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.46.52.010\n78\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsThe currently existing measures to address the unauthorized depar -\nture of children are not effective enough. In this regard, it is necessary \nto develop and implement new forms and methods for the prevention of \nunauthorized departures.\nThe developed areas of work in the municipal government institution of \nsocial services \"Social and Rehabilitation Center for Minors \"Hope\" (here -\ninafter \u2013 MGISS SRC \"Hope\") with children in difficult life situations will \ncontribute to the absence of unauthorized leaving and increase their adap -\ntive capabilities, subject to the regularity of the work carried out, individual \nand personal approach, taking into account the psychophysiological state \nof the pupils. \nTo implement the set goals and objectives, a set of methods is used in \nthe work: analysis and generalization of scientific and methodological lit -\nerature, documentary materials, psycho-pedagogical testing, pedagogical \nobservation, questioning.\nThe work takes into account the conditions reflected in the holistic ped -\nagogical approach:\n1 Individual characteristics of children in a difficult life situation - age, \ngender, motor abilities, functional capabilities, mental state.\n2 Gradual and moderate intensity of work with pupils undergoing social \nrehabilitation at MGISS SRC \"Hope\".\n3 Systematic - the implementation of a complex of applied work within \nthe established system of work in the institution.\n4 Consistency - a step-by-step study of the main directions and princi -\nples, a sequential transition from simple to complex.\n5 The sequence of activities to achieve the optimal effect of increasing \nadaptive capabilities.\nPrevention of unauthorized departure of minors from an institu -\ntion with permanent residence, identification and elimination of the \ncauses and conditions that contribute to this - one of the priority ar -\neas of activity of all subjects of prevention of neglect and juvenile \ndelinquency.\nThe tasks of preventing unauthorized departures are: protection \nof the rights and legitimate interests of children, prevention of situa -\ntions that threaten the life and health of pupils; prevention of offens -\nes and antisocial actions both committed by minors and in relation \nto them; rehabilitation and provision of: pedagogical, social, medical \nassistance to pupils prone to unauthorized leaving.\nMGISS SRC \"Hope\" pays great attention to the issues of preventing \njuvenile delinquency and unauthorized leaving.\n79\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsAccording to our statistics, unauthorized care is influenced by age and \nseason. The most difficult period: spring and autumn. By age, adolescents \nfrom 10 to 15 years old are susceptible to flight. This is a difficult psycho -\nlogical period for many reasons.\nChildren who make unauthorized cares have learning problems, it is \ndifficult for them to build relationships with others, to comply with the re -\nquirements for adherence to food intake, preparation of lessons, sleep and \nrest. Much is explained by various psychophysical deviations in health and \nvarious kinds of addictions.\nPreventive work is aimed at protecting pupils from actions at the \ninitial stage of trouble, preventing the commission of an offense.\nAccording to our statistics, the following types of shoots are iden -\ntified:\n1. Escapes as a search for entertainment and pleasure;\n2. Escapes, as a reaction of protest to excessive demands (according \nto adolescents), not a desire to obey the daily routine;\n3. \"Specifically - pubertal escape\" due to age-related fantasy and day -\ndreaming.\nThe reasons for unauthorized departures are: \n- deficiency of the emotional-volitional sphere (extreme forms of ex -\npression of emotion, they hardly understand the feelings of another person \nand their own).\n- low communicative competence (difficult to negotiate, solving difficult \nlife situations).\n- lack of independent forms of behavior (the ability to independently \nmake decisions).\nAdolescents make unauthorized departures with the aim of at -\ntracting the attention of parents or their substitutes to their problems, \nlooking for an environment where they will be more successful - free \nto do what they want, entertainment and pleasure. The reaction of a \nteenager to a difficult age crisis and ignorance of his entire social \ncircle.\nOrganization of activities for the prevention of unauthorized de -\npartures in the conditions of MGISS SRC \"Hope\":\nPrimary, secondary and tertiary prevention:  \nWe have defined: primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.\n\"Primary prevention\" applies to interventions directed at all children liv -\ning in an institution. To solve the problems of primary prevention, a wide \nrange of education of children about risky behavior is considered.\n\"Secondary prevention\" refers to measures aimed at those who have \n80\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsnot yet committed unauthorized care, but are in a high-risk situation, or \nwho have committed unauthorized care at least once.\n\"Tertiary prevention\" is an intervention when a child has repeatedly left \nthe institution unauthorized, in which case the work is carried out to provide \nassistance and prevent the recurrence of unauthorized care in the future \n(the level of work with children who constantly make unauthorized cares). \nEach case of unauthorized care has its own specifics, therefore, each time \na separate individual program is created, developed by all specialists of \nthe institution after assessing the situation in which the child is.\nThe institution has a system for monitoring the effectiveness of preven -\ntive activities aimed at preventing unauthorized leaving of pupils, as well as \nthe effectiveness of rehabilitation work, the implementation of individual ac -\ntion plans with children of \"risk group\". The plan of coordinated interagency \ninteraction for the prevention of unauthorized departures and the search \nfor pupils, the algorithm and regulations for the actions of employees in the \nevent of unauthorized departures by minors and the procedure for taking \nmeasures to search for them. One of the priority areas of prevention is the \norganization of employment of pupils who are registered in the institution \n(\"Council for Prevention\"), in the JC and Wage, JAU DMIA. \nFor each fact of unauthorized departure of pupils from the institution, \nan official investigation is immediately carried out, managerial decisions \nare made to prevent such facts, including the application of disciplinary \nsanctions to the employees of the institution, who committed the facts of \nunauthorized leaving of pupils, as well as untimely informing about them.\nEmployees are regularly instructed on the procedure for actions in case \nof unauthorized leaving of pupils, measures are taken to increase the level \nof personal responsibility of each for preserving the life and health of pu -\npils, for organizing preventive measures to prevent this phenomenon, the \nimportance of measures to ensure constant and timely recording of the \nfacts of unauthorized leaving is emphasized. from the institution. According \nto the plan, training is carried out: educators, educational psychologists, \nsocial educators on issues of psychological and pedagogical support of \nchildren.\nWork on the prevention of unauthorized departures is based on \nthe principles:\n1. The employee takes all possible actions to ensure the safety of the \npupils, assessing the risks for each individually. \n2. Reducing the number of cases of unauthorized leaving. Missing mi -\nnors can find themselves in a risky situation, each case is very serious. \nDaily interaction is carried out for consistent and harmonious feedback \n81\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentswith the pupil, including on his return in order to reduce the risk of repeated \nleave.\n3. Preventing harm for a child and returning the child to safety as quick -\nly as possible by working on this task, developing partnerships with vari -\nous agencies and the local community, sharing information, and improving \ngovernance.\n4. Work on the prevention of unauthorized departures is carried out \nregularly and is reflected in the prevention plan (an integral part of the sur -\nvey upon the return of the child).\nThe procedure for responding to the unauthorized departure of the pu -\npil from the institution:\nIn case of unauthorized leaving, all employees immediately inform the \nadministration of the institution about the fact of the incident and take the \nnecessary measures to return the child to the institution. Upon receipt of \ninformation about the fact of the unauthorized departure of the pupil (s) \nfrom the institution, the administration immediately:\n- finds out the circumstances of the incident, including conducting an \nofficial investigation into this fact in the institution;\n- Immediately reports the incident to the internal affairs bodies of the \nmunicipality;\n- immediately sends information about children who have left the in -\nstitution without permission to the Department of Social Protection of the \nPopulation;\n- ensures the departure of employees at the place of the alleged stay of \nthe pupil, interacts with the internal affairs bodies at the place of the pos -\nsible location of the child;\n- records the information received in the register of cases of unauthor -\nized leaving of pupils from the institution.\nMethods and forms of preventive work. \nPreventive work is a complex, multifaceted and lengthy process. In \nactivities to prevent unauthorized departures, the emphasis is shifted to \nearly prevention (creating conditions that ensure the possibility of normal \ndevelopment of children, timely identification of crisis situations arising in \nchildren).\nThe technology of working with inmates who make unauthorized cares \nis based on a number of factors, among which the most important place \nis occupied by the relationship of the minor with the institution in which he \nlives. \nThe pedagogical staff of the institution is based on the experience of \nwell-known Soviet teachers: VP Kashchenko (the system of labor training \n82\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsand education + great attention to the mental development of children); A. \nS. Makarenko (development of the principles of self-government, discipline \nand the formation of public opinion as a leading regulator of interpersonal \nrelations, the development of traditions, the construction of the educational \nprocess based on the combination of training with productive labor); S. T. \nShatskiy (the idea of   the nationality of upbringing in combination with labor \ntraining); A. A. Katolikova (multidisciplinary agricultural labor at the heart of \nthe educational process, the system of labor, economic and environmental \neducation, upbringing and development of the child's personality).\nForms of psychoprophylactic work with children prone to unauthorized \nabandonment: organization of the social environment, information, active \nteaching of socially important skills, organization of activities that are al -\nternative to deviant behavior, promotion of a healthy lifestyle, activation of \npersonal resources, minimization of the negative consequences of unau -\nthorized departures, etc. \nBy the way of organizing work, we distinguish the following forms of \nsocial prevention : individual and group. \nIndividual work with pupils is based on the study of their individual \npsychological characteristics, character, and style of behavior. Individual \nconversations about the inadmissibility of committing illegal actions, re -\nsponsibility for offenses and crimes, the need to comply with the institu -\ntion's regime, and attend school classes.\nOne of the main mechanisms of individual work is the adult's dynamic \nobservation and control of the child's volitional behavior, which is recorded \nin the individual adaptation sheets for each of the pupils. The system of \nindividual work includes: daily monitoring of progress, school attendance, \ntimely action to eliminate gaps in knowledge, prevention of absenteeism \nfor unreasonable reasons. The initial stage of individual work establishes \ncontact and motivates the child to participate in the work. Minors agree to \ncommunicate when they are interested in the process itself, when they are \nperceived as a full participant in the interaction. The work is based on the \nprinciples of dialogical communication (partnership with pupils in order to \njointly study a specific situation and ways to resolve it). \nGroup work forms the skills of constructive interaction and adaptation \nin society (the main form of group preventive work is a training session). \nThe situation of influencing the personality for the purpose of self-knowl -\nedge and self-development, the acquisition of new skills. During the train -\ning sessions, the skills of assertive behavior are formed. \nA cycle of classes is carried out to prevent subsequent unauthorized \ndepartures. Effective methods for preventing unauthorized departures are:\n83\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsActive social training in socially important skills is implemented in \nthe form of group trainings in the form of trainings:\n- resistance (resistance) to negative social influences,\n- assertiveness or affective-value learning,\n- the formation of life skills (self-control, confident behavior, changes in \noneself and the surrounding situation, etc.).\nActivation of personal resources ensures the activity of the individ -\nual, his health and resistance to negative external influences: sports, their \ncreative self-expression, participation in communication groups and per -\nsonal growth, art therapy (use of art), bibliotherapy, drama therapy, music \ntherapy. The application of these methods has two mechanisms of psycho -\nlogical corrective action. The first is aimed at the influence of art through \nthe symbolic function of reconstructing a conflicting traumatic situation and \nfinding a way out through reconstructing the situation. The second is re -\nlated to the nature of the aesthetic reaction, which allows you to change \nthe reaction of experiencing negative affect in relation to the formation of a \npositive affect that brings satisfaction. In the work with pupils, game ther -\napy is actively used, supplemented by art-therapeutic methods: fairy tale \ntherapy, drawing, modeling, application, etc. \nT.I. Shulga believes that traumatic experiences not only give the child \nsuffering and pain, but also make him angry with the offender. The use of \ngames allows you to relieve the stress that a child has from the traumatic \nsituations he has experienced (but only for a certain time, before repeating \nthem).\nThe organization of the social environment  is based on the concept \nof the determining influence of the environment on the formation of devia -\ntions. By influencing social factors, it is possible to prevent undesirable \nbehavior of a person, the impact can be directed to society as a whole, \nfor example, through the creation of negative public opinion in relation to \nantisocial behavior. The object of work can also be a family, a social group \n(school, class) or a specific person.\nPrevention includes social advertising to form attitudes towards a \nhealthy lifestyle, sobriety. The mass media are of great importance: spe -\ncial programs, performances of youth idols, selected films - all this has a \nhigher quality level. Work with the youth subculture in the form of \u201cYouth \nagainst Drugs\u201d movements or actions with performances by well-known \nrock bands (held in socially significant places where young people spend \ntheir leisure time and communicate).\nInformation in the form of lectures, conversations, distribution of spe -\ncial literature or video and television films.The essence of the approach \n84\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsis to try to influence the cognitive processes of an individual in order to \nincrease his ability to make constructive decisions. It is important to use \ninformation supported by statistics (not use as intimidation). At the same \ntime, the negative consequences of drug use are listed or the dramatic \ndestinies of deviants, their personalities, and degradation are described.\nThe method increases knowledge, but has a bad effect on behavior \nchange (information does not reduce the level of deviations). In some \ncases, earlier acquaintance with deviations stimulates the strengthening \nof interests in them, and intimidation can cause cognitive-emotional dis -\nsonance, motivating to this type of behavior.\nInformation must be presented in a timely manner. Informing is carried \nout differentiated by age and sex, socio-economic characteristics. So, for \nexample, conversations on the prevention of drug addiction should be held \nno earlier than 14 years old, without the content of a detailed description of \ndrugs and the effects produced on the child. Conversations are aimed at \ndiscussing the consequences of such behavior and methods of abstaining \nfrom it, at developing an active personal position. \nIn order to prevent deviant behavior, psychological counseling and cri -\nsis assistance via the helpline are also used.\nThe organization of activities that are alternative to deviant behav -\nior is associated with the substitution effect of deviant behavior (addiction \nis an increase in self-esteem and integration into a reference group). Fos -\ntering sustainable interests and developing the ability to form in oneself \nthe ability to occupy oneself and work. If by adolescence positive needs \nare not formed, then the personality is vulnerable to negative needs and \noccupations. \nThe organization of a healthy lifestyle is based on the idea of per -\nsonal responsibility for health and harmony with the world around you and \nyour body, the ability to achieve an optimal state and successfully resist \nunfavorable environmental factors. A healthy style is nutrition, physical ac -\ntivity, adherence to work and rest, communication with nature, exclusion \nof excesses.\nHere we included a set of work that takes into account all of the above, \nas well as physical education with children with a high level of tension ac -\ncording to the existing methodology, which removes: loneliness, anxiety, \naggressiveness, aimed at the development of physical qualities, communi -\ncative attitudes of the child.\nIn addition, labor education is of paramount importance, starting with: \ncleaning your own bedside table, helping in the dining room (duty), put -\nting your clothes in order, participating in a volunteer cleanup, working on \n85\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsa personal plot at an institution (the ability to plant, water, weed, harvest, \nprepare a crop - it is not only additional knowledge, employment, but also \naccustoming to further adult independent life).\nMinimizing the negative consequences of deviant behavior is used in \ncases with children with already formed deviant behavior and is aimed at \npreventing relapses or their negative consequences.\nIn an interesting, work-filled, sports, active leisure activity, there is no \ntime and desire to dream of escapes and make them. And the use of an \nintegrated approach in solving the problem of unauthorized departures \nfrom an inpatient institution reduces in pupils: anxiety, aggressiveness, a \nstate of loneliness, improves health, increases communication attitudes, \nadaptive capabilities of the child and ultimately helps in the formation of a \nharmoniously developed personality. \nReferences\n1.

At present, parents do not pay enough attention to raising \ntheir children, since they do not see the value for themselves in such a \npastime. Self-realization is carried out in the professional sphere, using all \nthe creative potential. The task of educational institutions is to convince \nparents that creative self-realization is possible in joint activities with \nchildren. Moreover, such activities must necessarily be of interest to \nparents, therefore it is necessary to help parents find such activities.\nKeywords: creative self-realization, parents, upbringing . \nCurrently, more and more parents receive secondary and higher educa -\ntion, enterprises and organizations are constantly working on the personal \nand professional development of their employees, information platforms \noffer a wide variety of trainings, master classes, webinars, etc. All this, to \nvarying degrees, becomes an incentive for creative self-realization in the \nprofessional sphere: employees work hard and improve their professional -\nism, and, consequently, job satisfaction. This is certainly a very positive \nfact.\nHowever, almost all people are family members (large or small) and \ncarry out numerous responsibilities associated with this circumstance. One \nof those responsibilities is raising your children. Many researchers note the \nhigh employment of modern parents in production, concern with everyday \nproblems, reduced free time, reduced time for communication and joint \ncreative affairs with children [1; 3; 4].\nWe conducted a small study: we interviewed 156 parents under the age \nof 35 at one of the enterprises of the Krasnodar Territory. It turned out that \nwith the same employment (including overtime), the respondent parents \nspent with their children a different number of hours: from 1 to 20 hours per \nweek. At the same time, a direct relationship was established between the DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.12.40.011\n87\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsmotivation of parents to actively raise their children and finding time for this \nin their professional activity schedule. Thus, it can be argued that the dec -\nlaration of objective reasons in the form of \"high employment in production\" \nis often just an excuse for paying little attention to raising their children.\nBased on the results of the survey, the reasons for the lack of attention \nto children were established, while the parents named at least 2 reasons:\n- no pedagogical knowledge and skills - 76.8%;\n- there is no desire to waste their time - 47.3%;\n- there is no interest in classes with small children - 39.6%;\n- there is no understanding of the interests of children in accordance \nwith age - 41.7%.\nAs a result of additional questions, it turned out that most often there \nis no interest in joint activities with children, parents consider such activi -\nties in a certain sense a \"waste of time\", but at the same time they want to \n\"save their face\" and in the questionnaire they noted the lack of necessary \npedagogical knowledge and skills.\nWe noted above that the professional development of modern special -\nists is aimed at developing creativity, initiative and realizing their potential. \nThis is probably why the process of raising children does not fit into this \ntrend, in other words, some parents do not see an opportunity for self-re -\nalization and the use of their creative potential in the process of interaction \nwith children. Are there such opportunities?\nThe essence of \"creative self-realization\" can be viewed with the help of \ntwo concepts \"creativity\" and \"self-realization\".\nThe phenomenon of \"creativity\" interested many scientists, each of \nwhom singled out those features that he considered the most important:\n- the main characteristic of a person (V.V.Bailuk);\n- activities to create new values   (A.V. Petrovsky, M.G. Yaroshevsky);\n- a way of positive self-realization (L.V. Vedernikova)\n- the ability to find new solutions to problems (N. Rogers).\nThis list could be continued, since apart from the increased attention \nto the problem of creativity, there is still no common understanding of this \nphenomenon among scientists. We are closest to the position of A. Ma -\nteiko, according to which \u201ccreativity is the creation of new combinations \nbased on the reorganization of the existing experience\u201d [2].\nThe concept of \u201cSelf-realization\u201d is interpreted as the process of dis -\nclosing and using the existing potential that is significant for the individual. \nIn this case, \"creative self-realization\" is a continuous, personally signifi -\ncant process of disclosing and realizing a person's creative potential. Quite \na lot of researchers have studied the problem of self-realization of teachers \n88\nProcess Management and Scientific Developments(R.M. Asadullin, N.M. Borytko, N.K. Sergeev, etc.). At the same time, there \nare practically no works devoted to the creative self-realization of parents \nin pedagogical activities aimed at their children. Numerous existing works \non interaction with families in a preschool educational institution solve this \nproblem through the fulfillment of tasks given \"at home\" by parents and \nchildren. Unfortunately, in most cases, parents are not interested in such \nwork, and if there are many such tasks, then irritability appears: they do not \nlike the teachers, do not like the kindergarten, school.\nThe business has found a solution to this problem - any crafts are made \nto order, which must be handed over to an educational institution. The task \nis completed. All got good marks.\nThis is because parents do not see their own value in completing such \n\"tasks\", they are not interested in them. We emphasize that joint activities \nwith children should be of interest to parents, in which case they can cap -\ntivate her and the child. Only then will pedagogical creativity appear and \nself-realization of parents will occur.\nIn our opinion, parents need to show examples for joint creativity with \nchildren:\n- come up with a fairy tale with the child (or a continuation of an already \nknown one);\n- to create a home puppet theater;\n- write poems or a song together;\n- draw greeting cards to friends, etc.\nThe list is endless. The most important thing is to help parents find things \nthat will be of interest to them and the child. Such work should be carried \nout purposefully and systematically: starting from the period of waiting for \nthe child and until the child finishes school. Obviously, until now there is \nno educational organization that would carry out such work throughout the \nentire period of childhood. Therefore, we propose to distribute this function \namong several organizations involved in preschool and school education. \nIt would be useful to have centralized management on the part of the dis -\ntrict administration of education as a coordinator of work with parents and \na guarantor of its continuity.\nThe manifestation of the pedagogical creativity of parents is due to the \nstructural components of any activity: planning, organization, coordination, \nmotivation and control. In the process of self-realization, two processes are \ncarried out simultaneously: self-knowledge and creative self-development.\nTherefore, we propose to work with parents to discover the possibilities \nof creative self-realization in the process of raising their children in several \nstages:\n89\nProcess Management and Scientific Developments1) determining the personal meanings of parents regarding the upbring -\ning of their children, in other words, identifying those value orientations that \nare basic attitudes for parents;\n2) actualization of existing and obtaining new pedagogical knowledge; \nstructuring the accumulated social and pedagogical experience; improving \ncommunication skills;\n3) promoting the manifestation of the creative activity of parents;\n4) parents' independent development of upbringing strategies;\n5) determination of the direction of creative self-realization (types of \ncreative activity). \nIt should be noted that creativity, shown in communication and interac -\ntion with children, influences both the personal and professional growth of \nthe parents' personality. Answering the child to numerous \"why?\" they are \noften forced to turn to reference literature, in addition, their explanations \nmust correspond to the age characteristics of children, be understandable \nto them. This circumstance requires parents to be able to simplify infor -\nmation, explain it in an accessible language. We agree that these are the \nnecessary qualities in professional activity.\nA separate topic is classes with children after school or kindergarten. \nThe easiest way to solve the problem is to find several sections and after \nclass send the child to them. But this may not always be relevant. In some \ncases, parents, satisfying the interests of their children, master new as -\npects of science and technology for themselves: chemical experiments, \nunconventional methods of multiplication, the influence of stars on hu -\nmans, etc. In such joint hobbies, the personal growth of parents, enrich -\nment with new knowledge, and broadening of their horizons take place.\nIn the process of upbringing, one of the main motives for the creative \nself-realization of parents is the desire to convey the maximum of life \nmeanings and values   to their child; help him reach greater heights than \nthey reached themselves.\nSystematic, purposeful work to create opportunities for creative self-\nrealization of parents in educational activities will allow: a) to increase the \npedagogical culture of parents; b) to strengthen the cooperation between \nparents and an educational institution; c) improve parent-child relations; d) \nto increase the intensity of the development of children.\n90\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsReferences\n1.

The formation of tolerance among young people is the \nmost important aspect of the upbringing and socialization of this social \ngroup. There are many ways to build a tolerant attitude, including social \nadvertising, which can be an effective tool for building tolerance towards \npeople with disabilities.  \nKeywords: youth, tolerance, people with disabilities, social advertising\nMankind at all times treated with pity those who had mental and physi -\ncal disabilities in health. The World Health Organization has released data \naccording to which the number of people with disabilities (PWD) is steadily \ngrowing every year. In many countries, such people are not considered \nequal healthy, full-fledged members of society. Hence the following prob -\nlem arises - people with disabilities are alienated from society, withdrawn \ninto themselves. Today the mass media are actively drawing public atten -\ntion to this problem, showing the life of people with disabilities, their dif -\nficulties and achievements. But the attitude towards disabled people in \nour society still remains ambiguous. In this regard, there have been many \nstudies related to the analysis of tolerance for people with PWD. Tolerance \ntowards people with disabilities, first of all, implies respect for them as indi -\nviduals with the same rights as healthy people, as well as in providing them \nwith the necessary assistance.\nThe problem of the formation of tolerance comes to the fore due to the \nfact that every year the number of people with disabilities is steadily grow -\ning, and not only in Russia, but also in the world. People with disabilities \nare not perceived as equal in society, this social group is discriminated \nagainst on the basis of physical, mental or mental development and health.\nG.G. Zack and D.Ya. Zach considers several factors that contribute \nto the formation of tolerance among young people with disabilities. The DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.77.50.012\n92\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsauthors believe that \"education for tolerance should be aimed at coun -\nteracting influences that cause feelings of fear and alienation in relation \nto others. It should contribute to the formation of young people\u2019s skills of \nindependent thinking, critical thinking and the development of judgments \nbased on moral values\" [1].\nOne of the factors that influences the formation of a tolerant attitude \ntowards people with disabilities is the adoption of programs and projects \nat the state level. So, in August 2001. By a decree of the Government of \nthe Russian Federation, the federal target program \u201cFormation of attitudes \nof tolerant consciousness and prevention of extremism in Russian society \n(2001-2005)\u201d was approved [1]. In addition, various programs are being \nadopted at the global level, for example, the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities at the UN General Assembly. These documents \ncreate a legal basis for the education of tolerance in society. Today in our \ncountry there is a state target program \"Accessible Environment\".\nAnother way of building tolerance for people with PWD is the practice \nof inclusive education, i.e. joint education of disabled children and healthy \nchildren. This practice should form the skills of the second to communicate \nwith people with disabilities, their acceptance, responsibility towards them. \nIt is also possible to allocate optional hours in educational institutions with -\nin certain disciplines, for example, psychology, sociology, pedagogy.\nOne of the most effective methods for the formation of tolerance is the \nmethod of psychodrama. \"Psychodrama is viewed as a socio-psychologi -\ncal theater, which trains the ability to feel the situation in a team, evaluate \nand change the state of a person, the ability to get in touch with a person \nwho is different from oneself. It is effective for adolescents, since in the \ngame they reproduce the image of the other, return to their role, strengthen \nand concretize some of the characteristics of the other, try to show indi -\nvidual differences and \"play\" conflict situations. Students can subsequently \nbe included in educational activities to work with various groups of people \nin the framework of educational and industrial practices\"[1].\nAnother factor that can contribute to the formation of tolerance towards \npeople with disabilities is the activities of the media. As noted by K.A. Pop -\nova: \"The mass media have a significant impact on the formation of public \nopinion about people with disabilities. People with disabilities are almost \nalways presented as either unprotected, socially vulnerable and depend -\nent, or they are overly heroized, which, paradoxically, makes people with \ndisabilities perceived as unconditionally defective\"[2].\nSeparately, it should be noted social advertising as a special type of \nmass communication. \"In modern Russian society, social advertising has \n93\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsbecome an independent form of communication, it is gaining more and \nmore value and demand. At the same time, its main task is not only to draw \npublic attention to social problems, but also to call for their solution and of -\nfer possible actions for this\"[3].\nAs G. Nikolayshvili writes in the book \"Social advertising: theory and \npractice\", \"social advertising is a type of communication focused on draw -\ning attention to the most pressing problems of society and its moral values, \nfocused on actualizing the problems of society. Its purpose is to humanize \nsociety and form its moral values. The mission of social advertising is to \nchange the behavioral model of society\"[4].\nSocial advertising appeared in the United States in 1906, and only 88 \nyears later in Russia. Conventionally, the history of Russian social adver -\ntising can be divided into two periods: Soviet and modern. Soviet-style \nadvertising glorified communist ideals, and the main problems in it were \nissues of war, promoting the ideas of communism, a healthy lifestyle, help -\ning the hungry and the sick, and combating dissent. \"Sometimes PSAs \nhave been used in songs or movies. The famous song \"May there always \nbe sunshine!\" can be classified as a type of social advertising. Soviet films \n\"Height\", \"Girls\" advertised new professions, the way of life of an ordinary \nSoviet person, his character and basic values\"[5]. Soviet-era advertising \nwas monotonous and highly politicized. As for social advertising of the \nmodern period, it has both creative and technical diversity. Today, topi -\ncal issues raised in social advertising are the issues of a healthy lifestyle, \nthe fight against HIV and AIDS, environmental problems, ethnic tolerance, \nroad safety, etc.\nA feature of social advertising that distinguishes it from commercial \nadvertising is that social advertising is aimed at everyone and everyone, \nregardless of which social group the person belongs to. The main ways of \nexposure to social advertising are:\n1. Appeal to certain emotions. The idea, laid down by the authors of \nadvertising, can only reach people when it evokes any emotions. Emotions \nare the motivations for action. Therefore, it is very important to emotionally \nload the advertising message, accompanying it with bright and expres -\nsive pictures. You can appeal to both positive and negative emotions of \na person. Positive emotions include friendship, love, pride, patriotism; to \nnegative ones - fear, suffering, horror, anxiety.\n2. The destruction of some behavioral stereotypes and the creation \nof others. For example, the destruction of the stereotype that a high speed \nof a car gives a feeling of flight and freedom, with the advertising slogan \n\"Exceeding the speed, you do not gain freedom, but lose it\" [6].\n94\nProcess Management and Scientific Developments3. Presentation of an alternative. The essence of the method is to \nshow not the dark side of vices (for example, alcoholism, drug addiction), \nbut its alternative, i.e. happy life.\n4. Specifying the problem. Social advertising reveals the whole es -\nsence of the problem, or its separate part, and the more specific the prob -\nlem, the more effective the advertising will be. An example is road safety \npublic service advertisements that focus specifically on speeding.\n5. Appeal to authority. For example, billboards in the city of Volgo -\ngrad, calling for the birth of a third child, who will certainly be talented: \nThey were born third... Anton Pavlovich Chekhov/(1860-1904)/great Rus -\nsian writer; Charles de Gaulle/(1890-1970)/the first president of France \n(phrases are located to the right of the portraits of famous people).\n6. Appeal to patriotic feelings. \"I was born in the Trans-Urals, I was \nbaptized in the Trans-Urals! It came in handy in the Trans-Urals! (billboard, \ntext to the left of the image of the baby's baptism)\". Awakening patriotic \nfeelings, such a social advertisement calls not to leave, to stay in the na -\ntive land, which allows solving one of the main problems of the region - the \noutflow of the population\"[6].\n7. Use of statistics data. This method emphasizes the urgency of the \nsocial problem.\n8. Using a gradation of facts. The essence of the method is to pre -\nsent a sequence of facts more fully and vividly conveying the idea of social \nadvertising.\n9. Create a complete picture with one detail. For example, a poster \nwith a picture of a ball rolling onto the road creates a sense of danger at \nthe level of intuition and predictability of further events: now a child will run \nafter him and find himself on the road in a dangerous situation [6].\n10. Using a hidden impetus for action. The peculiarity of this method \nis that some fact from reality is given, which requires an unambiguous un -\nderstanding and decision-making.\n11. The use of certain linguistic means, such as the use of construc -\ntions with \"no\" and negations (for example, say NO to drugs!), The use of \nmetaphors, the use of an impersonal \"we\" (for example, we will make the \nworld cleaner), playing with word-formation features (\"Precinct from the \nword \"Participation\" (pavement sign). \"The word precinct is formed from \nthe word \"site\" and cannot be motivated by the word \"participation\", how -\never, in the context of social advertising, the words are presented as one \nroot in order to increase the confidence of residents in the precinct police -\nmen\" [6]) proverbs, sayings, aphorisms.\nAmong other things, we will name a number of factors that contributed \n95\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsto the formation of social advertising as a new view of society's problems:\n1. The increased need of the state for effective social management. \nSocial advertising is a kind of \"litmus test\" that shows acute social prob -\nlems of society, thereby drawing attention to them. In addition, the main \nmission of social advertising is to change behavior towards socially ap -\nproved and to establish traditional values in society.\n2. Development of democratic institutions and the formation of non-\ngovernmental and non-profit organizations.\n3. Business social responsibility. Business structures, being subjects \nof social advertising, are forced to minimize the harm they inflict on society \nwith their commercial activities in order to long-term existence.\nSocial advertising serves a number of functions, such as:\n1. Communication function, consisting in the fact that a connection is \nformed between the advertiser and the audience, due to which there is a \nmore complete understanding of the problem and, accordingly, the most \neffective work on it. Through social advertising, you can keep in touch with \ncitizens, which benefits the state.\n2. The information function is that social advertising draws attention to \nthe problems of society, creates excitement around them and offers solu -\ntions.\n3. The motivational - incentive function is that competent social adver -\ntising should induce a person to certain actions, socially approved behav -\nior.\nAn important characteristic of social advertising is its effectiveness. It \nincludes a number of criteria:\n1. Concentration on one idea - there should be only one socially ori -\nented message in the advertisement.\n2. The integrity of the target audience - social advertising does not dif -\nferentiate society by groups and classes, but addresses everyone at once.\n3. The ability to attract and hold attention for the time it takes to memo -\nrize.\n4. Accessibility for perception by the target audience - social advertis -\ning should be understandable to everyone and contain images that have a \nhigh social impact.\n5. Memorability - advertising should be quickly and easily remembered, \nbe bright and have an unusual plot.\n6. Persuasiveness - it is necessary for the target audience to have con -\nfidence in the source of information and in the advertising message.\n7. Motivating ability is the ability to change a person's behavior.\nToday, social advertising is not only one of the mass media, but also \n96\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsa cultural phenomenon, the popularity and significance of which is only \ngrowing. This is evidenced by many social advertising festivals both in \nRussia and abroad. An important feature of social advertising is that it car -\nries a value, spiritual component. Advertising of this type contributes to the \ndevelopment of such qualities in people as compassion, understanding, \nhelping those who need it, etc. And all this leads to an increase in the spir -\nituality of society.\nRussian legislation contains laws that control social advertising activi -\nties. First of all, this is the Federal Law of 13.03.2006 \u2116 38-FZ (as amend -\ned on 01.05.2019) \"On Advertising\", namely Article 10 \"Social Advertising\". \nIn the Republic of Bashkortostan until 2000, the law of the Republic of \nBashkortostan dated February 26, 1997 \u2116 81-z \"On Advertising\" (Bulletin \nof the State Assembly, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers of the \nRepublic of Bashkortostan, 1997, \u2116 9 (63), Art. 544)\"was in force, but this \nlaw was declared invalid, and at present the main law controlling this activ -\nity in the republic is the Federal Law \"On Advertising\".\nIn our republic there are organizations and persons carrying out this ac -\ntivity. The most widespread social advertisement of the city of Ufa is \"City \nwithout drugs\". Also, \"the use of social motives in advertising, and some -\ntimes social advertising with the indication of trade marks and brands, is \ncurrently practiced in Ufa by the companies PC \"Vsya Ufa\"and the retail \nchain \"Pyaterochka\", CJSC insurance group \"Uralsib\", IA \"Bashinform\", \netc.\" [7]. \nThus, social advertising is one of the effective tools for shaping not only \npublic opinion, but also the value and moral attitudes of people, being not \nonly a means of mass communication, but also a cultural phenomenon. \nSocial advertising today is a tool for socially responsible business. Social \nadvertising maintains a link between the state and society, i.e. the society \ngets the impression that the state is taking part in solving acute socially \nsignificant problems, which are affected by this type of advertising.\nIn conclusion, it should be noted that the problem of disabled people \nin our society exists. People with disabilities are isolated from society, not \nonly because of intolerant attitudes, but also because in our state there are \nno conditions for full-fledged life of disabled people. People with disabilities \nencounter obstacles everywhere, for example, there are no conditions for \nthe movement of wheelchair users, there are no special signs for the visu -\nally impaired, there are almost no sign language interpreters for the deaf \nand dumb, etc. All this leads to the fact that people with disabilities with -\ndraw into themselves and lead an isolated lifestyle. For those who are able \nand willing to work, there are also a number of obstacles: not all employ -\n97\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsers want to hire a disabled person, since this is fraught with a number of \ndifficulties. It is also believed that disabled people are difficult people with \nwhom not everyone can find a common language, but in reality this is not \nentirely true. People with PWD are in many ways more capable, stronger \nthan healthy people. In many ways, examples of strength of mind, will and \ndesire to live show us exactly those who have deviations in physical or \nmental health. A striking example of this is Nick Vuychich - a man who was \nborn without arms and legs, but who became famous all over the world \nthanks to his oratorical talent and desire for life. Vuychich fully showed the \nworld that disability is not the end of life, that a disabled person is the same \nperson and citizen, that people with PWD can live a full life.\nReferences\n1.

CLIL - content and language integrated learning is an ap -\nproach that promotes the learning of curricular content in tandem with \nany foreign language ( the English Language in this study). Implementing \nCLIL in primary school has always been a challenge because of obstacles \nteachers might find using CLIL. Using CLIL in your classes has the dual \npurpose of  serving as a proper language practice and, as primary students \ngrow, apprising the teacher of what students have learned. My experience \nof implementing CLIL methodology in Primary school indicates  that it is a \ngood way of encouraging children to come out of their shells. \nKeywords: CLIL, Primary school, integrated learning, support stu -\ndents, Weather Triangle\nIn Russia as well as in certain European countries primary education \nrefers to learning situations and class teaching where one teacher teaches \nall subjects to the whole class or group of children aged from 7 up to 10-11. \nHowever, teaching English here has always been a little different. Chil -\ndren learn the rules of the English Language, its grammar, vocabulary, \nspelling, study the topics related to the units from Student's Book and do \nlistening comprehension activities. Today, we are all aware of Content and \nLanguage Integrated Learning (CLIL). Integrated learning means that the \nclass is aimed to achieve both the knowledge of the subject matter and the \ntarget language. It also means that teachers need to teach both at once. \nIn fact, CLIL \u201cplaced both language and non-language content in a form \nof continuum, without implying preference for one or the other\u201d (Marsh, \n2002: 58). When it comes to integrated teaching we must be aware of \nthe fact that students (in our case primary students) have not yet gained \nsatisfactory language skills to understand the contents of education which \nmeans that all new terms and new content must be based on the skills and \nlanguge already known and acquired by children aged 9-10 .  The integra -DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.97.74.013\n99\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentstion of usual curricular subject areas into English lessons can increase \nthe interest of primary students in content themes. CLIL, the integrated \nlearning of English in this case, can even help to  avoid excessive  school \ntimetable. It involves children in cross-curricular learning sequences and \nleads  to purposeful  and meaningful learning experiences. \nThough primary English education is almost everywhere compulsory \nand given a high priority in Russia, challenges still exist. One of the chal -\nlenges in CLIL implementation is the lack of knowledge, and / or meth -\nodology in using CLIL approach in primary school. Teachers sometimes \nsee themselves as language teachers only and therefore, CLIL subject is \ntaught through a lot of unnecessary translation. I believe, if concerns are \nraised while planning CLIL lessons certain aims have to be established \n(scaffolding is of great help here both for teachers and students) and teach -\ners are usually eager to come up with ideas for CLIL activities to avoid too \nmuch translation. Teachers notice that  bringing content into the language \nlessons and using different topics from the content curriculum leads to far \nmore varied activity of primary students. In other words, we enrich cross-\ncurricular opportunities and start using more supporting resources. \nAnother challenge is the idea that in addition to being a language \nteacher, you need to be an expert in other subject matters. For example, \nsome teachers still believe that teaching mathematics you have to have \na university degree in mathematics, or in order to employ CLIL in classes \nwhere students study science you need to go back to university to revise \nphysics and chemistry. As soon as teachers realise that their major is -\nsue is giving comprehensible inputs to students, that obstacle vanishes. It \nmight be difficult to teach like that, especially at the beginning, but it makes \nstudents concentrate more and use the English language for a purpose, \nwhich means both strong and weak primary students can benefit.\nThe aim of this current study is to describe my approach to teaching the \ntopic Seasons and Weather to primary students. The age of my students \nis 9-10 years, they all are from Grades 3 and 4 and started learning Eng -\nlish from Grade 1. They have three classes of English per week and one \nclass of CLIL as required in their curriculum. Those two grades are chosen \nbecause students already have sufficient background to follow CLIL Sci -\nence classes and CLIL Science ideas and themes can be closely linked \nwith the aims and objectives of their English classes (we study living and \nnon-living things around, analyse the ways of caring for pets, study the \nimportance of plants, explore different ways of caring for our bodies). Sea -\nsons and Weather is the topic studied in current textbooks where lessons \nare designed in the same format for students of different levels. As a rule, \n100\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsstudents learn the 12 months of the year, they know the four seasons ans \ntypical weather for each season. When we talk about the weather primary \nstudents can say that the weather is sunny or windy, warm or cold, snowy \nor rainy. More than that, primary students as well as secondary students \nusually say that Seasons and Weather topic seems to be rather boring. I \ndecided to change that matter and make the topic enjoyable for my stu -\ndents.\nPrimary students love drawing painting and working with pictures thus, \nmy first step  was to ask them to draw the Sun, a snowflake, a raindrop, a \ncloud and ice.  I explained that if we take the noun CLOUD and add suffix \nY to it, we get the adjective: CLOUD + Y = CLOUDY. My class loved mak -\ning adjectives and soon we had their pictures and words below SUN + Y = \nSUN NY, SNOW + Y = SNOWY, ICE + Y = IC Y. Repeating words or phras -\nes gives primary students a nice chance for auditory practice and when we \nrepeat crucial phrases, we are actually supporting students in getting the \ndefinition of the words and their usage right. The page from our Student's \nBook helps implement the words, the symbols and new terminology.\nIn Grade 3 primary students study Degrees of Comparison of Adjec -\ntives. My next step  was comparing the weather today and the weather \nyesterday. The students saw the questions on the board and I read them \nout, too. Is it COLDER today than it was yesterday? Were the raindrops \nyesterday WARMER than today? Is the night SHORTER or LONGER than \nthe day? All students' answers prepare them for making a nice weather \nreport, that is why I usually repeat questions and we compare different \nopinions.  \nStep three  was about the temperature. Here we use the Celsius tem -\n101\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsperature scale, where water freezes at 0\u00b0C and boils at 100\u00b0C. I explained \nto my students what the words ABOVE and BELOW meant and they all \npractised saying different temperatures I showed to them on the World \nWeather Information Service site ( https://worldweather.wmo.int/en/home.\nhtml ). We didn't forget to compare different temperatures; in fact thinking \nabout how to bring the content to each student\u2019s skill level I was aimed to \nbuild in my primary students a stronger understanding of the issues we \nwere covering. \nOur next thing that led my students to detailed description of the weath -\ner, step four  was observing the weather conditions that day. We were \nlooking at the trees and the sky and the yard out of the window and I \nproceeded with the following questions: Do you think you will need an um -\nbrella today? Will it rain? Will the weather be rainy? Are the leaves shak -\ning? Is it windy? Is the wind stronger today than yesterday? Does it look \nlike stormy weather? Can you see the objects in the street clearly? Is it \nfoggy now? Was it foggy in the morning? My students were answering the \nquestions and I implemented the usage of at least three Grammar Tenses \n\u2013 Future Simple, Present Continuous, Past Simple, my primary students \nused modal verb CAN in their answers and we repeated and revised the \nthings I described in my step one (FOG + Y = FOG GY).\nStep five  was the final one, when I suggested my primary students \ndrawing a nice triangle and making their own weather forecast (or weather \ndescription) for today. I showed that the most significant information should \nbe up - the season, the month and the night / day temperature. Then, going \ndown inside the triangle, we started putting the adjectives or verbs to make \nthe weather observation for the day. Every line written in the triangle was \nfollowed and supported with my questions and even class discussions. \nHowever, for primary students who found it too difficult to write the words, \nit was possible to draw a raindrop / the sun / clouds/ an umbrella / leaves \nof the trees. We got that Weather Triangle (see: Picture).\nAfter making the nice Weather Triangle all primary students in my class \nwere ready to give quite a sufficient talk on the weather that day, com -\nparing the night and day temperatures, differences between three spring \nmonths and covering each \u201cline\u201d in our Weather Triangle. The story could \neven last 3 or 3,5 minutes and did not seem to be boring or complicated for \nthem, on the contrary everybody wanted  to give a more detailed weather \nforecast and explain why they thought the weather was cloudy or it would \nrain soon. The hearts on the board were the signs whether the child liked \nthe weather or not. \n102\nProcess Management and Scientific Developments\nReferences\nMarsh, D. (2002).

PUSHKIN\nAkhmadova Tamusa Khamidovna\nLecturer \nThe Chechen State University\nAbstract.  The article reflects the features of Pushkin's worldview and \nartistic method in the novel \"Eugene Onegin\", and also poses the central \nproblems of his entire work. The author reveals his inner world, expresses \nhis attitude towards all the heroes, in many respects in his opinion coincides \nin Eugene Onegin - a man of the Pushkin circle. Deep lyricism permeates \nthe novel, one of the main characters of which is the author himself. There \nis much in common in Onegin's character, in his \"blues\", which Pushkin \nhimself once experienced, so he writes about himself and his hero. He \ncreated the image of a \"hero of the time\" with his spiritual quest. In all his \nactivities, the poet expressed the most advanced ideas and trends of the \nera - the ideas of civil freedom and high humanism. \nKeywords: poet A.S. Pushkin, spiritual world, the novel \"Eugene \nOnegin\"\nNone of the writers before A.S. Pushkin did not reflect in his work, which \nhas become an encyclopedia of Russian life, a true artistic chronicle of the \nera, so fully and clearly Russian reality, as the great national poet did. In \nPushkin's novel \"Eugene Onegin\", the past and the present are intertwined \nin a complex unity. This is a work of exceptional significance, the only one \nof its kind in Russian and world literature.\nThe ingenious innovation of Pushkin, who laid the foundation for the \ntradition of the Russian socio-psychological novel, consisted in the fact \nthat he transferred the main attention from external events, from intrigue to \nthe development of human characters, to the depiction of the complexity of \nhuman relations, the disclosure of the spiritual world of heroes.\n\"Eugene Onegin\" was started by the poet in a period of deep mental \nand creative crisis, when not only the strengths, but also the weaknesses \nof the modern progressive noble intelligentsia became clear to him and \nromantic heroes and their ideas were decisively re-evaluated. The novel, DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.61.27.014\n104\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthe plot of which is based on a love conflict, became simultaneously, ac -\ncording to Belinsky, a real \"encyclopedia of Russian life\" [1, p. 222], not \nonly and not so much in the breadth of the depiction of various everyday \nphenomena, but in the depth of expression of the problems of the era, \nfeatures human personality - the hero of the time, the son of the century.\nPushkin A.S. shows how the environment, society, conditions of up -\nbringing determine the peculiarities of the views, feelings, behavior of his \ncharacters, which change from chapter to chapter, in accordance with the \nchanges taking place in the life around them. At the end of the novel, the \ncharacters turn out to be very different from those at the beginning. Each \nof them had their own emotional trials and shocks, too much has changed \nin the life of the whole society.\nThe novel most fully expressed the features of Pushkin's worldview and \nartistic method, and also posed the central problems of all of his work. This \nis a series of moral and philosophical problems: discussions about life and \nhappiness, about the meaning of being, about honor and duty, about free -\ndom of conscience. In addition, there are aesthetic problems in the novel. \nThis is the role of poetry in life, about which Lensky spoke: the relation -\nship of friendship between the author and the hero, freedom of creativity \nand adherence to literary traditions. So the range of problems in this small \npiece is quite wide. \nIn Onegin's character, along with noble honor and intelligence, traits of \nindividualism, proud contempt for people are clearly revealed - a product \nof time, a disease of the century. Onegin's individualistic self-awareness \nis a complex phenomenon. On the one hand, it is the result of heightened \nwork of thought, dissatisfaction of others, consciousness of personal dig -\nnity - in a word, the lot of those who \"lived and thought\" (\"Who lived and \nthought, he cannot but despise people in his soul\") [5, p.713]. On the other \nhand, it contains an egoistic principle, vain self-admiration, indifference to \nthe fate of ordinary people - everything that is condemned as alien to the \npeople's consciousness. Tatiana is free from these features, since they are \nnot inherent in the Russian national, folk character. In Onegin, however, \nthey are largely superficial - a consequence of secular education, isola -\ntion from popular culture, the influence of the ideas of Western European \nromanticism.\nPushkin A.S. believed that he very successfully showed in \"Eugene \nOnegin\" the character of the hero, for whom the main reason for disap -\npointment is satiety, the absent-minded social life of a young Petersburg \nrake. Onegin was seized by the \"Russian blues\" [1, p. 221], \"early feelings \nin him cooled down,\" he cooled to \"life completely\" [5, p. 711], because he \n105\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentswas moving in the \"light\" betrayed by idleness\"  satiated with \"everyday \npleasures\" [7, p.55]. \nOnegin is not an imitation, but a historically faithful hero of the Pushkin \ngeneration, and the \"Russian blues\" [5, p. 711] is not a fashion, but a phe -\nnomenon caused by the property of Russian life itself, generated by the \n\"malice of blind fortune\" [5, p. 713 ], the blows of fate experienced by the \nbest people. Pushkin captured in the person of the hero exactly the Rus -\nsian blues - that which was generated by the very Russian reality and was \ntypical for the then thinking intelligentsia [1, p. 221].\nThe exceptional position of the novel in the work and biography of \nPushkin was pointed out in his time by Belinsky, who wrote that \"Onegin\" \nwas Pushkin's most sincere work, the most beloved child of his fantasy. \nThere are not too many works in which the personality of the poet would \nbe reflected with such fullness, light and clear, as the personality of Push -\nkin was reflected in \"Onegin\". In him all his life, soul, his love; here are his \nfeelings, concepts, ideals\"[3, p. 495]. The novel is distinguished by the \nconstant open presence of the author. Pushkin is interested in the image of \nOnegin with his dissatisfaction, with the life that many people of the world \nare happy with.\nThe novel is a lyric-epic work. Here the author reveals his inner world, \nexpresses his attitude towards all the heroes, in many respects in his opin -\nion coincides with Eugene Onegin. Deep lyricism permeates the novel, \none of the main characters of which is the author himself. From chapter \nto chapter, the poet's inner world, his views on life, art are revealed, and \nthe further, the closer the image of the poet becomes to the reader. It is \nnoteworthy that Pushkin compares his poetic muse with Tatyana, who is \nbrought to a social event. Like Tatiana, the poet's muse is deeply rooted in \nnational life, she is infinitely alien to the secular rabble. \nGukovsky G.A. called the author's image the central image, he is also \ncarried through the entire novel, and he also unites all of its text [2, p. 19]. \nThe deep vitality, historical typicality of the hero of the novel is clearly con -\nfirmed by the nature of his \"relationship\" with the \"author\", i.e. by Pushkin \nhimself [6, p.128].\nOnegin has a lot of autobiographical information. Of course, Pushkin \nis not Onegin, and the poet considered it necessary to specifically warn \nagainst the naive identification of the literary hero with the author, which is \ncommon in the artistic system of romanticism with his subjectivism. Push -\nkin is a realist, he separated the hero from himself, he looks at him from \nthe side, examines him. \nI'm always glad to notice the difference \n106\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsBetween Onegin and me, \nSo that a mocking reader\nOr some publisher\nOf intricate slander\nComparing my features here, \nI did not repeat afterwards shamelessly, \nThat I painted my own portrait [5, p.716].\nAnd yet, in Onegin, the \"hero of the time\" [1, p. 222], there is a lot of \nPushkin - to the extent that the poet himself was the spokesman for his \ngeneration. Onegin is a man of the Pushkin circle. He, as it was said, is a \n\"good friend\" of the poet, his inseparable \"strange companion\" [5, p.817]. \nThere is a lot in common in Onegin's character, in his \"blues\", which Push -\nkin himself once experienced, so he writes about himself and his hero: \nI made friends with him at that time. \nI liked his features. \nUnwitting devotion to dreams \nInimitable oddity \nAnd a harsh, chilled mind. \nI was embittered, he is morose: \nWe both knew the game of passion ; \nWeighed down the life of both of us: \nIn both our hearts, the heat died away; \nBoth were awaited by the malice of Blind Fortune and the people \nAt the very morning of our days [5, p. 712-713].\nSo, both were disappointed in the secular vanity, both were tormented \nby life, both experienced the play of passions, both are dissatisfied and \nembittered, both experienced the blows of fate, \"blind fortune\" [5, p. 713]. \nTogether with the \"author\" Onegin visited the banks of the Neva, listen -\ning to \"the horn and the daring song\" [5, p.714] of rowers. The thought of \nfreedom, of a different life also overwhelms both of them. In this respect, \nit is extremely characteristic that, when talking about the night walks over \nthe Neva River together with the hero, Pushkin resorts to comparing their \nlife with a prison in which convicts languish: \"When the forest is green \nfrom prison/A sleepy convict is transferred/So we were carried away by a \ndream/To the beginning of a young life\" [5, p.714].\nIn the novel, Pushkin shows Onegin's duel with the young poet Lensky. \n\"Friends spread to the extreme track,/And each took his own pistol\" [5, \np.779]. It seems that Pushkin, as it were, told about himself, having fore -\nseen his fate. Onegin, himself deeply suffering, makes others suffer. Be -\nfore us appears the image of a bright, extraordinary person in his own way, \n107\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsa noble intellectual, disillusioned with a secular society with its emptiness \nand vulgarity, looking for a high goal and meaning of life and at the same \ntime carrying the features of the environment that gave birth to it. \nThe very biography of Onegin - one of the representatives of an empty \nsecular society endowed by the author with all his vices, but then opposed \nto him - reflected the process of stratification of the nobility, characteristic \nof an entire generation, from among which his best part stood out. The \ndifficulty of Onegin lies precisely in the fact that, as noted in the literature, \nhe could organically combine features and characteristics characteristic \nof different, albeit internally uniform, strata of the progressive noble intel -\nligentsia of the 1920s [6, p.125]. \nEugene Onegin is an image deeply typical for Russia of Pushkin's time \n(\"a good fellow, like you and me, like the whole world\") [5, p.803]. The \nvery biography of Onegin - one of the representatives of an empty secular \nsociety endowed by the author with all his vices, but then opposed to him \n- reflected the process of stratification of the nobility, characteristic of an \nentire generation, from among which his best part stood out. Not all the \nnoble youth of St. Petersburg in the XIX century could afford to lead a free \nlifestyle, but only a few young people from among the rich and noble fami -\nlies. In this artificial world, the most natural human feelings were distorted, \neven the feeling of love turned into \"the science of tender passion\" [5, p. \n703], into light secular flirting, into a game.\nFrom the very beginning, in the characterization of Onegin, the possibil -\nity of spiritual evolution is outlined. Even when, out of habit and tradition, \nhe still continues to lead a scattered social life, mentally he still does not \nfeel happy (\"But was my Eugene happy?\") [5, p.700]. What satisfies me -\ndiocre, vulgar people can no longer satisfy him, a person who is tormented \nby \"spiritual emptiness\", lack of purpose and meaning in life.  \nThe novel shows how the gap between Onegin and his environment \nis gradually becoming more and more acute. Simultaneously with the ag -\ngravation of Onegin's conflict with the surrounding reality, the inner contra -\ndictoriness of the hero himself, his deep duality, appears more and more \nsharply. Having broken with the life of a secular society, having become \ndisillusioned with it, Onegin, at the same time, for a long time retains the \nhabits, customs, moral norms of a secular person - everything that has tak -\nen root thanks to upbringing. Torn away from the light, it turns out to be no \nless distant from the people's soil, the people's element. He has no sense \nof unity, merging with the life of the people, moral support. This is precisely \nwhat explains the complexity, contradictions of the Onegin character, of its \nentire psychological makeup. \n108\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsMost of all, Onegin himself suffers deeply from loneliness, mental dis -\ncord, who is in a state of constant dissatisfaction with others and himself, a \nsearch for a goal and meaning of existence, a worthy cause in life and, at \nthe same time, ambiguity of prospects, ambiguity of aspirations, isolation \nfrom people's life - all this generates terrible loneliness, mental disorder, \nrestlessness, anger. That is why Onegin, according to the well-known defi -\nnition of Belinsky, is not just an egoist, but a \"suffering egoist\", \"an unwilling \negoist\" [3].\nOnegin's superiority over those \"who did not indulge in strange dreams\", \n\"who did not shy away from the secular rabble,\" for whom life is \"a long \nline of dinners from them\" [5, p.804], is obvious. Against the background of \nvulgar, stupid, insignificant \"creatures\" who live an insufficient life, the hero \nof Pushkin's novel stands out sharply with his restless mind, anxious heart, \nand high spiritual demands. This is his \"inimitable strangeness\" [5, p. 712], \nwhich is taken under protection in the novel. Pushkin directly confesses \nhis love for the hero: \"... I sincerely love my hero\" [5, p. 783]. To Onegin's \nill-wishers, Pushkin answered clearly and unequivocally: \"Why is it so un -\nfavorable/do you speak of him?\" [5, p.803].\nBut the feelings of personal sympathy and, moreover, the love that the \nauthor feels for the hero of the novel Onegin, do not prevent him from ap -\nproaching the latter research, analytically, to see in him, a contemporary, \nnot only dignity, but also weakness, to show something and another - the \nresult of the corresponding impact of the environment, historically estab -\nlished conditions. The history of relations with Tatyana Larina also serves \nthis task of comprehensive disclosure of the hero. Thus, we can see On -\negin in three stages of evolution, when he is carried away by his secular \nlife, when he is disappointed in it, and when he leaves it.\nComparison of Onegin with Lensky helps to more sharply expose the \nduality of Onegin, who, although he broke with the world, is still guided by \nthe norms of a secular society, secular morality. So, when the inevitability \nof a duel becomes clear, it turns out that he \"alone with his soul was dis -\nsatisfied with himself.\" Summoning himself to a \"secret trial\", he \"accused \nhimself of many things\" [5, p.774], he felt in his soul that he was wrong, \nthat he should have made peace with Lensky. And yet, for Onegin, the \nmain thing is also the \"public opinion\" of the world, a conventional code of \nsecular honor, which he generally despises, however, at the very first real \ntest it turns out to be his slave \"[1, p.220].\nThe murder of Lensky makes a strong impression on Onegin - from \nnow on he is relentlessly pursued by the image of a slain young man. \nIt especially exacerbated Onegin's dissatisfaction with himself. Eugene is \n109\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsabsolutely free from the traditions of his family, there is no patriarchy in his \nupbringing, he has an absolutely European noble Petersburg upbringing. \nPerhaps this upbringing was alien to him, perhaps in the village he wanted \nto find what is called Russian roots. For only two days he was delighted \nwith the primordial Russian traditions. After two days, he tries to introduce \ntransformations into his household, then begins to avoid neighbors. And \nso Onegin meets the Larins' family. Together with Pushkin, he sneers at \nall family members, constantly mocks them, analyzes Olga, an empty and \nbeautiful girl, scoffs even at the treats that were provided to him in this \nmodest family. Of course, Onegin did not appreciate the joys of provincial \nlife. After Onegin himself killed Lensky in a duel, he leaves his village shel -\nter without regret.\nThe main problem of the work - the problem of the hero of the given \ntime correlates with the problem of the relationship between a person and \na crowd. A person cannot be free from society, but when society ceases to \ndevelop it, when society is in stagnation, then the hero, Eugene Onegin in \nthis case and Lensky as well, seeks to move away from this society and \nseek some kind of meaning in life. Pushkin also raises the problem of the \nRussian national character, which, of course, is comprehended in the im -\nage of Tatiana. Onegin and Lensky are young people who have been torn \naway by life from their national roots: they no longer like French and Ger -\nman, but they have no cultural roots of their own.\nEugene Onegin is a portrait of a whole generation, therefore it is tragic, \nbecause the fate that Russia experienced in the era of stagnation after \nthe war of 1812 was in itself timeless, stagnant. Happiness according to \n\"Onegin\" is something that cannot be built on the misfortune and dishonor \nof another person. F.M. Dostoevsky believed that a person cannot under -\nstand what happiness is if he does not have a concept of truth and duty. \nOnegin should be considered not only as a psychological individuality, \nbut also as a historically specific type, the formation of which was greatly \ninfluenced by the culture of Western European romanticism; it is on this \nbasis that the closeness between Onegin and Lensky arises [1, p.220].\nWe can say that in the novel, those destructive forces that controlled \nthe destinies of the heroes turned out to be much stronger than the happy \nexternal conditions of life. Pushkin, with all his sympathy for his heroes, \ncondemns them: Onegin - for his individualism, long-term \"indifference\" \nto life, for the absence of \"work\", \"purpose\", inspired by the idea of public \ngood; Lensky - for his abstract daydreaming, ignorance of real life.\nThus, Pushkin, condemning his heroes, showed that the social world of \nthese heroes crippled the positive features of their worldview and it should \n110\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsbe replaced by another social system, and there is no place in this world \nfor \"superfluous people\", \"clever uselessness\" [4, p.9].\nPushkin's novel teaches us to better understand life surrounding reality, \nmakes us think deeply about it, to hate its vices. In this sense, he became \nthe greatest \"act of consciousness\" for Russian society, showing that evil is \nhidden not in man, but in society. Pushkin managed to penetrate so deeply \ninto the meaning of the phenomena of the life around him, because he \nhimself stood at the forefront and the fate of his native country, its present \nand future were infinitely dear to him.\nReferences\n1.

TOLSTOY \"DEMOTED\"\nAkhmadova Tamusa Khamidovna\nLecturer\nThe Chechen State University\nAbstract. The idea of   the story dates back to the period of Tolstoy's \nstay in the North Caucasus. Stasyulevich personally told Tolstoy \"the story \nof his misfortune\", for violation of military discipline he was demoted to the \nranks. In the Caucasus, in the position of being exiled as a soldier, Guskov \ncontinued to remain an aristocrat, \"crooked, obliquely and immorally\" look -\ning at his surroundings. For Guskov, heroism is, first of all, external bril -\nliance, glory, general admiration and posture. In his diary, Tolstoy pointed \nout that the reasons that develop vanity are \"inaction, luxury, lack of care \nand deprivation.\" \nKeywords: humiliation of a person, L.N. Tolstoy, Caucasian War, story \n\"Demoted\"\nThe impression and moments experienced by L.N. Tolstoy in the Cau -\ncasus, found their reflection in his military stories: \"Demoted\", \"Raid\", \"Cos -\nsacks\". The last story of L.N. Tolstoy about the \"Caucasian war\" \"Demoted\" \nappeared in 1856. The title \u201cFrom Caucasian Memories. \u201cDemoted\u201d for \ncensorship reasons replaced another name - \u201cMeeting in a detachment \nwith a Moscow acquaintance. From the Caucasian notes of Prince Nekh -\nlyudov. \" By this time, Tolstoy had parted ways with Sovremennik. The \nstory was published by Druzhinin in The Library for Reading (book X11). \nHowever, even with the liberals, Tolstoy was not on the way, and therefore \nclearly outlined differences with them.\nIt is interesting to note that the \"hero\" of his story, Guskov, who was \ndemoted, or rather, exiled to the Caucasus as a private, is a kind of liberal.\nThe idea of   the story dates back to the period of Tolstoy's stay in the \nNorth Caucasus. On October 16, 1853, he wrote in his diary that the so-\ncalled decent people who put themselves very high in their own opinion \nsoon leave their sphere and enter a sphere in which the conditional virtues \nof decency are not valued, fall much lower than dishonest people who not DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.97.67.015\n112\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsbeing proud of anything, they try to acquire good [1]. \nSuch reflections of Tolstoy were led by observations of some Caucasian \ncolleagues - exiled or demoted nobles. One of them - A.M. Stasyulevich \npersonally told Tolstoy \"the story of his misfortune\", for violation of military \ndiscipline he was demoted to the ranks.\nBy vocation of Tolstoy A.M. Stasyulevich only partly served as a proto -\ntype for Guskov. \"However, it\u2019s not really him,\" Tolstoy once said. \"I also \nconnected Kashkin, who was suing Dostoevsky\" [4, p.61].\nKashkin N.S. (1829-1914) led one of the Petrashevsky circles, wrote a \nnumber of revolutionary works, waged a struggle against the idealism of \nHegel and Kant from the standpoint of militant atheism and utopian social -\nism. Kashkin returned from his Caucasian exile in 1858, he was allowed \nto settle in Kaluga, where he became one of the organizers and leaders \nof the circle, which included the Decembrists G.S. Batenkov, E.O. Obolen -\nsky, P.N. Svistunov, N.S. Kashkin. Soon N.A. Serno-Solovievich, the future \nprominent figure of the revolutionary democracy of the 60s. \nAfter N.A. Serno-Solovievich between him and N.S. A friendly corre -\nspondence was established by the Kashkins. On August 18, 1859, N.A. \nSerno-Solovievich wrote to N.S. Kashkin: \"The time spent in Kaluga will \nnot be blotted out of my heart, for the sake of a warm, sincere circle of peo -\nple with whom I became akin in feelings and convictions and in which you \noccupied one of the first places\" [6, p.27-28]. As you can see, N.S. Kashkin \ndid not step down, did not retreat, but continued his social activities after \nexile, which cannot be said about Guskov.\nTolstoy's attempt to portray Petrashevist Kashkin in Guskov was un -\nsuccessful. If we did not know the above statement of the author, then it \nis unlikely that we would have recognized in Guskov N. S. Kashkin. E.N. \nKupreyanova writes: \"In the image of Guskov, Tolstoy, as it were, dissoci -\nates himself from both liberals and democrats, and seeks to show that both \nare \"not right\". From this point of view, he portrays Guskov in the form of a \npoliticking aristocrat and phrase-monger who turned out to be completely \nunable to endure the test sent to him by fate, in fact to prove loyalty to his \nconvictions [3, p.91].\nOne cannot agree with the opinion that Guskov had revolutionary con -\nvictions. True, Guskov says: \"I took everything bad to my heart, dishonesty, \ninjustice, vice were disgusting to me, and I directly spoke my opinion, and \nspoke carelessly, too ardently and boldly\" [5]. \nHowever, he calls his own participation in the circle \"an unhappy, stupid \nstory.\" Under arrest, Guskov \"changed his mind a lot, a lot ... He began to \nlook at everything with different eyes.\" The confession is more than frank. \n113\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsAnd a little lower: \"I felt that I myself was guilty, careless, young, I ruined \nmy career and only thought about how to correct it again [7, p. 108-109]\". \nGuskov had no true revolutionary convictions; he was brought up in the \nspirit of comme il faut (the art of being worthy). The manuscript contains \nthe following description of his sister: \"In her was developed to the high -\nest degree that Russian, especially St. Petersburg aristocracy, expressed \nonly in servility to a certain world, through which they somehow crookedly, \nobliquely and immorally look at the world of God, and aristocracy, which \nno misfortunes, no influence can knock out of a person, if he has correct \nupbringing and, even worse, has been grafted into him with success in \nthe world.\" This characteristic is directly related to Guskov himself. Tolstoy \nthrough the mouth of the narrator says: \"...knowing the direction of my sis -\nter, I did not expect anything good from the young Guskov\" [7, p.102]. And \nso it happened in practice. In the Caucasus, in the position of being exiled \nas a soldier, Guskov continued to be an aristocrat, \"crooked, obliquely and \nimmorally\" [5] looked at his surroundings. In his opinion, the cadets are \n\"the most depraved class of people in Russia\", the soldiers are \"some kind \nof beasts, in which there is nothing human,\" and military officers are \"pigs\" \n[3, p.92]\nGuskov believed that the war would add \"a cross, the rank of a non-\ncommissioned officer\" to his name, then \"the fine would be lifted,\" and \nhe would return to his environment \"with this charm of misfortune.\" In an \neffort to get into the active army, Guskov hoped for the patronage of his \nuncle and the support of Pavel Dmitrievich. Among the Caucasian officers, \nhe dreamed of taking one of the first places, but he had to gain authority. \nTolstoy shows Guskov to exile. In the St. Petersburg aristocratic society, \nhe was a successful young man. And although the narrator's keen gaze \nnoticed negative features in him, the general conclusion was in favor of \nGuskov, he was considered a really smart and pleasant person.\nWhen the conversation started about one common acquaintance who \ndistinguished himself in the war, Guskov expressed the opinion that \"cour -\nage\" is a necessary consequence of intelligence and a certain degree of \ndevelopment\"[7, p.103], that is, education.\nFurther events showed that Guskov was cruelly mistaken. What hap -\npened to him in the Caucasus? The hard life of a soldier has erased the \ngloss from him. While servants served him, he had a pleasant appearance, \n\"was unusually neat, elegantly dressed\" [7, p.103]. Now he was \"a small \nfigure with crooked legs and in an ugly hat with long white hair\" [7, p.1 13].\nTolstoy painstakingly draws out Guskov's portrait details: \"little red \nhands\", a thin, sinewy neck, which is tied with a green woolen scarf. \"The \n114\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentssheepskin coat was worn, short, with a sewn dog on the collar and on fake \npockets. The pantaloons were checkered, ash-colored, and boots with \nshort, unblacked soldier's bootlegs\" [7, p.97].\nGuskov does not consider himself a coward, although he is afraid to go \ninto a secret until he loses consciousness, and once he simply fled from \nthere, throwing down his weapon. For Guskov, heroism is, first of all, ex -\nternal brilliance, glory, general admiration and posture. \"Give your dream \na regiment, golden epaulettes, trumpeters, [7, c.116],\" he says. To fight \nalongside ordinary soldiers, to expose himself to mortal danger along with \nAntonov, Bondarenko is above the forces of Guskov, because he consid -\ners soldiers to be animals, and himself to be an exalted nature. Aristocratic \nindividualism, hostility towards ordinary people, the ideology of the serf-\nowner generates cowardice: \"And at the slightest danger, I suddenly invol -\nuntarily begin to adore this vile life and cherish it as something precious, \nand I cannot overcome myself\" [7, p.117].\nGuskov claims, and there is no reason not to believe him, that if he \nwere an officer, then \"in front of others,\" that is, in the presence of those \nwhom he considers people, he would also become brave because of his \npride. And in secret you have to go unwashed, in a sheepskin coat and \nsoldier's boots, lie all night in a ravine with \"some\" Antonov and wait for a \nshot that can kill. \"This is not courage - it's awful.\" Guskov, if we proceed \nfrom the classification of Tolstoy, is a representative of one of the types of \n\"physical courage\" inherent in aristocratic officers.\nTolstoy does not immediately pass the final verdict on Guskov. Looking \nat him, the narrator recalls that \"he himself was recently a cadet, an old ca -\ndet, unable to be an indifferent, helpful junior comrade and a cadet without \na fortune, therefore, knowing well all the moral severity of this situation for \n\"an elderly and proud person\" [7, p.97], the narrator seems to sympathize \nwith Guskov and seeks to understand the hero.\nGuskov seemed to the narrator \"a very intelligent and extremely proud \nperson\" [7, p.97], truly and deeply unhappy. Guskov reveals himself most of \nall in his own lengthy statements. Sometimes sincere notes break through \nin his stories, in moments he takes a sober glance at his behavior and then \npronounces himself a merciless sentence: \"Yes, I finally died! There is no \nenergy in me, no pride, nothing. There is not even nobility ... Yes, I am lost!\" \n[7, p.116] But even in such sincere words there is a grain of hypocrisy. Tell -\ning so much about yourself to a new person, exposing spiritual wounds.\nGuskov satisfied his own vanity, self-esteem, that he exposed himself. \nIn his \"diary of youth\" Tolstoy noted that aristocratic education instills cow -\nardice, vanity, thoughtlessness, weakness, and laziness. Tolstoy was sure \n115\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthat the problems of society are reflected in the life of the army. If society \ndegrades, then the army also degrades [2, p.17].\nAnd already in the Caucasus, Tolstoy characterized vanity as a moral \nillness like leprosy or a venereal disease. The vain one \"loves himself not \nas he is, but as he is shown to others\" [1].\nThat is why Guskov talked about himself so much that he seemed \ndifferent, he could not somehow show himself to be in the shadows, he \nlacked the character to be modest, so he drew attention to himself by the \nmessage that he was writing an order for an upcoming offensive. He was \nshy, afraid of ridicule, and still talked. No one asked Guskov to flunk, but \nhe \"hastily took a glass\" and carried it to the adjutant, stumbled and fell, \ncausing laughter from those present and irritation of the adjutant. On the \nface of Guskov, as the narrator noted, \"there was always one prevailing ex -\npression of fear and haste\" [7, p.97], that is, in the words of Tolstoy's diary, \ncowardice and thoughtlessness. One of such rash actions of Guskov was \nparticipation in the \"political case\". It is most likely to assume that vanity \nwas the driving lever in this case too.\nIn his diary, Tolstoy pointed out that the reasons that develop vanity are \n\"inaction, luxury, lack of worries and hardships\" [1]. It becomes clear that \nit was not the Caucasian exile that spoiled Guskov, but his comme il faut, \naristocratic upbringing. Having found himself in a difficult situation in the \nCaucasus, unaccustomed to labor, deprivation, independence, the aristo -\ncrat Guskov lost the ground with his feet. Among the military Caucasian \nofficers, \"the conditional virtues of decency are not valued,\" but true de -\ncency is highly valued. It was this change that contributed to the exposure \nof Guskov's inner world.\nAs was correctly noted in the literature, the image of Guskov is to a \ncertain extent related to the image of Count Turbin, the younger from the \nstory \"Two Hussars\", written in the same 1856.\nThe Caucasian story \"Demoted\" seems to suggest that true courage is \nactually acquired not by education, not by the fact that someone belongs to \nan aristocratic environment, but by labor education, but aristocratic educa -\ntion instills cowardice, vanity, laziness and other then obscene qualities. \nIn the story \"The Demoted\", behind Guskov there is a \"high\" society. \n\"I was disgusted,\" says the narrator, \"that, because it is true that I knew \nFrench, he assumed that I should have been outraged against the society \nof officers, which, on the contrary, having spent a long time in the Cauca -\nsus, I had time to fully appreciate and respect a thousand times more than \nthe society from which Mr. Guskov came out\"[7, p.109].\nA liberal phrase-monger, a politicking aristocrat did not find a place \n116\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsamong the soldiers, who naturally showed modest courage in the most \ndifficult conditions.\nThe story takes place in a military detachment on the slope of the \nKochkalykovsky ridge in Checheno-Ingushetia. \"Business was already \nover, they were cutting the clearing and every day they were expecting \nan order from the headquarters to retreat to the fortress\" [7, p.95]. It was \nthen that Guskov appeared. He crawled out into the white light in order to \ninstantly disappear at the first sounds of the enemy's core.\nIn the story Batman Nikita says with contempt: \u201cI saw them, nightingale, \nI\u2019m not afraid, but the guest who was here, the chikhir drank, as he heard, \nhe gave a quick stretch past our tent, rolled like a beast what a bent! \" [7, \np.118].\nTrue to yourself, Tolstoy turns to the opinion of ordinary people and thus \nclarifies the true essence of people and phenomena. \"... how a beast bent!\" \n[7, p.118] - in these words a merciless and just sentence.\nPainting the situation in which the detachment was, Tolstoy uses con -\ntrasting colors and creates a picture sharply outlined in the contours. \"The \nevening was clear, quiet and fresh\" [7, p. 95]. Everything around was illu -\nminated by the pink rays of the setting sun, \"on the black trampled ground \nthe tents were white, and behind the tents the bare trunks of the plane tree \nwere blackened\" [7, p.95], \"all sounds were heard especially morally, - and \nfar ahead along the plain they were clean, rare air\" [7, p.96].\nSome of the soldiers finished cutting the clearing, the other rested in \ntents, the officers started a children's game in the towns. It was then that \n\"a small man with beautiful legs\" appeared [7, p.96] and with senseless \nhasty movements of his hands... The night in the mountains is also beauti -\nful and impressive, but the unexpected meeting of the narrator with the \ndrunk Guskov, who came out of the tent, beat off any hunting to admire \nthe beauty of the landscape. The story ends with a short phrase: \"I did not \nanswer and silently got out onto the road\" [7, p.120].\nThe reader sees Guskov through the eyes of the narrator, who hardly \nspeaks about himself, but the sincere story about the meeting with the \ndemoted allows the narrator himself to be examined.\nThe narrator is an officer who has been serving in the Caucasus for \na long time, his own man in the detachment among ordinary officers, al -\nthough he himself came out in the detachment among ordinary officers, \nalthough he himself came out of an aristocratic environment. He is charac -\nterized by serious curiosity and observation. Ordinary soldiers come into \nhis field of vision, about whom he writes with warmth: \"More than once I \ndecreased my step, passing by a soldier's tent, in which a fire was shining, \n117\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsand listened either to the fairy tale told by the joker, or to the book read \nby the literate and listened to the whole squad, jammed in and around \nthe tent, interrupting the reader from time to time with various remarks, or \nsimply talking about the campaign, about the homeland, about the chiefs\" \n[7, p. 109].\nThe story we have considered completes a kind of trilogy about the \n\"Caucasian war\". As a result, it is indisputable that L.N. Tolstoy was an op -\nponent of the war in all its manifestations [2, p.17].\nReferences\n1. Autobiographical notes 1847, 1850, 1853 VIII.

The article is intended to study the current forms of fact-\nchecking in a linguistic aspect. The relevance is caused by the outbreak of \ncoronavirus infection, which gave impetus to a new stream of information \nnoise and the circulation of lies both in the media and on social networks. \nQuarantine measures have limited many areas of life, including journalism, \nand access to verified information is difficult.\nKeywords:  fact-checking, semantics, verification, factoid, fact, \ncoronavirus infection, fake. \nAgainst the background of mass hysteria of the population, a record \namount of disinformation has appeared on the Internet; both in domestic and \nforeign media space. For many readers, navigating the media environment is \nharder now than ever before, with some actively avoiding much of the news \nstream altogether. It is no secret that the media space has always circulated \nin conditions of manipulation and all sorts of lies, but the scale of this informa -\ntion pollution has turned into infodemia. \nCoronavirus infection and its spread (COVID-19) is the first pandemic in \nhistory to use technology and social media on a massive scale to keep peo -\nple safe, informed, productive and connected. At the same time, the technol -\nogy we rely on to stay connected and informed is fostering and reinforcing \nthe infodemia that continues to undermine the global response and threaten \nthe response to the pandemic. Infodemia is an overabundance of informa -\ntion both online and offline. The phenomenon includes various attempts to \nspread false information, undermine the credibility of the measures taken by \nhealth structures to combat the pandemic, and promote alternative control DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.53.91.016\n119\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsprograms1.\nAccording to N.B. Berdigulova, Fact checking is the verification of the \ninformation received in order to verify its reliability or falsity\"2. Fact, unlike \nopinion and subjective perception, must be provable and irrefutable in order \nto be called a fact. In the context of the circulation of information on COV -\nID-19, direct verification - the search for the truth on the basis of recognized \ninformation - remains little common among the reader. This gives rise to con -\nspiracy theories. \nLet's consider the main methods of the fact checker in manual mode - \nwithout the use of automatic databases and data journalist tools3. \nFirst of all, it is necessary to refer to the primary source of information - \nthis is the author of the original messages (newsmaker or directly the genera -\ntor of the statement or phenomenon, deed). In the absence of such an oppor -\ntunity, the fact checker is obliged to provide an analysis of the organization of \nthis information, looking back at how it was processed by different channels \nfrom the original source.\nSecondly, it is necessary to provide expert opinions and two-way cov -\nerage of the situation. A one-sided view of the phenomenon, as we noted \nabove, is unacceptable for objective journalism.\nThirdly, you need to pay attention to the details: factual errors, incorrect \nspellings of names, addresses and positions, insufficient reputation of the \nauthor/media/social media may indicate the spread of fake news.\nFinally, the fact checker should pay particular attention to the flashy, sen -\nsational headlines and information on social media. Recall: large platforms \nfor providing media and social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Insta -\ngram, etc.) provide their own algorithms to combat fakes and prevent their \nappearance. So, an effective campaign was launched by the Twitter short \nmessaging platform, due to the creation of a mechanism by the appearance \nof an abundant number of fakes on the topic of coronavirus and American \npolitics.

Dur -\ning this period, several interviews were published with the famous figure Da -\nvid Icke, who claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a new stage in the \nworld order. Consider the lexemes and syntactic units used in Hayk's rheto -\nric6. \"More and more people all over the world - it\u2019s increasing all the time in \ncountry after country after country - are realising that they\u2019re part of a scam. \nThey\u2019ve been had. And the scam is to transform human society using the \nexcuse of this fake virus\". \nIn this context, we see the use of the fake virus token. Indeed, the condi -\ntions of the coronavirus infodemic have transformed the media and even \nthe scientific landscape so that neologisms associated with coronavirus are \ncommon. The message generator is based on this, semantically combining \nthe words \"fake\" and \"virus\" - seemingly opposite in meaning. Fake is associ -\nated in the modern information field with something reliable: the reader gets \nsatisfaction when he learns about the refutation of what he did not believe \nin. The phrase \"more and more people\" refers the reader to an uncountable, \ncollective confirmation of his thesis. Of course, the following text does not \nprovide statistics: neither about who supports the thesis, nor about how many \nthere are.\nIn his opinion, in countries around the world, restrictions were imposed to \n\"destroy the global economy\" to ensure the destruction of local businesses, \nas well as so that governments can support citizens with guaranteed income.\nReuters immediately focuses on the characteristics of the author: it was \nrevealed that David Icke had already participated in conspiracy theories that \nwere refuted empirically or other scientific method7.\n4 Petrova, E.

The leading trend \nin infodemic, we note, is the reliance on influential medical structures and \ntheir research. Thus, WHO has confirmed the existence of the virus since \nthe moment of its fixation in China8. The editors also focus on their other \nfact checks: for example, on refuting the hypothesis that the Google search \nresource reports the non-existence of a virus9. Thus, the accumulated inves -\ntigations during the period of the pandemic allowed Reuters to more effec -\ntively respond to disinformation in statements on the Web and even in media \npublications. The argument confirms the hypothesis put forward, according \nto which the search and verification of fakes should be modernized taking \ninto account the huge size of the media field; the accumulated base creates \na foundation to simplify this process.\nLet's turn to another fake of global influence - hoaxes around 5G cell \ntowers. So, in the study, Reuters cites the following refutations: reminds the \nreader of what a virus is and how it is transmitted, focuses on 5g radio waves \nand the degrees of their influence (do not cause symptoms of the virus) and \ncites scientific research. Further, the authors of the fact-check provide con -\nfirmation of the thesis that a vaccine containing an RFID chip does not exist. \nFinally, Reuters summarizes the rationale with the argument that countries \nwithout 5G also get sick.\nThe hoax, according to this plan, has been consistently refuted. Verifi -\ncation consists in articulating the semantic parts of one, sometimes small, \nmessage. In this case, each component of the abstract message \"COVID-19 \nis caused by network towers in order to then chip the population under the \nguise of a vaccine\" is divided into micro-plots for subsequent analysis using \nverification technologies (including data analysis).\nIn April 2021, USA Today posted on its website a rebuttal to the hypothesis \nof users on social networks and some obscure social media that vaccination \nagainst the virus increases the number of miscarriages - allegedly by 366%10.\nFirst of all, the fact checkers turned to the commentators and authors \n8 Naming the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201319) and the virus that causes it // WHO : \n[Electronic resource] \u2013 URL: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel\u2013coronavi -\nrus\u20132019/technical\u2013guidance/naming\u2013the\u2013 coronavirus\u2013disease\u2013(covid\u20132019)\u2013and\u2013the\u2013vi -\nrus\u2013that\u2013causes\u2013it (appeal date: 10.06.2021)\n9 Fact check: Google search results are not evidence that the COVID\u201319 pandemic is a \nhoax  // Reuters : [Electronic resource] \u2013 URL: https://www.reuters.com/article/uk\u2013factcheck\u2013\ngoogle\u2013search\u2013covid\u201319\u2013 hoax/factcheckgoogle\u2013search\u2013results\u2013are\u2013not\u2013evidence\u2013that\u2013\nthecovid\u201319pandemic\u2013is\u2013a\u2013hoax\u2013idUSKBN25H20F\n10 Fauzia M.

Presumably, the semantics of such a message \ngrew out of the lack of data on the reaction of pregnant women and young \nmothers to vaccinations. Moreover, during the investigation, journalists be -\ncame aware that the first information with this news message appeared sev -\neral weeks before the actual first vaccination. USA Today reached out to the \nMHRA and jointly produced a statistical report where the arithmetic proved \nthe falsity of the statement11.\nA closely related fact-checking investigation is USA Today's denial of the \ndeath of a child from the Pfizer vaccine during a drug trial12. When contact -\ning the author of the application, it turned out that the news semantics of the \nmessage was formed on the VAERS (Vaccine Side Effects Reporting Sys -\ntem) records from the FDA, and the resource allows you to send an applica -\ntion to anyone. The author cited Natural News as a source, and fact check -\ners, in turn, turned to the Factcheck MediaBase resource. The resource was \nrecognized by them as pseudoscientific after a number of publications on \nconspiracy that were exposed13. Then the CDC was brought in, which per -\nformed arithmetic calculations: checking medical records and death certifi -\ncates using database tools14.\nLet us summarize the patterns in verification methods: in Western verifi -\ncation, using the examples of Reuters and USA Today, we find the frequent \nuse of various own or third-party databases. Thus, modern fact-checkers re -\nplenish the resource bases where publications are displayed, in particular, \nsocial media and narrow-profile ones (the \"pulp\" press also gets there). Thus, \nwhen the primary source of information is found on such a resource, it is \nchecked more thoroughly.

One of the main issues of personal and professional devel -\nopment of a modern person is the necessity to study psychological barri -\ners \u2013 those negative phenomena that have become widespread and af -\nfect individual and public consciousness: marginalism, procrastination and \nlearned helplessness. The purpose of the research is to study the psy -\nchological content of the selected phenomena, their interrelationships; to \ndevelop and implement the technology of actualizing personal resources \nto overcome psychological barriers in personal and professional develop -\nment of educational subjects. In line with the systematic personal devel -\nopment approach, based on the concept of professional development of \nan individual, a special methodological program has been developed and \na plan of theoretical and empirical research (stating and forming stages) \nhas been implemented. The study involved school and university teachers, \nschoolchildren and university students (n=738). The results of the study \nshows that teachers with low level of personal and professional develop -\nment are characterized by signs of marginal consciousness, procrastina -\ntion, due to the syndrome of learned helplessness formed in childhood and \nstudent life, as well as the position of a victim, transmitted and assigned DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.64.63.017\n125\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsby students. Personal helplessness is not formed among students if they \ndevelop in conditions of polysubject interaction, where the teacher is char -\nacterized by high level of professional development, meaningfulness of \nlife, humanistic nature values and the absence of an existential vacuum. \nThe developed and tested technology of actualizing personal resources \n(coping behavior, reflexive design and emotional involvement) proves its \neffectiveness by increasing the level of self-awareness and integral per -\nsonal characteristics among educational subjects, reducing the learned \nhelplessness, procrastination, and marginalism indicators, thereby ensur -\ning an increase in the level of their personal and professional development.\nKeywords:  the concept of educational subjects\u2019 personal-and-profes -\nsional development, psychological barriers and motivators of personal and \nprofessional development, learned helplessness, marginal consciousness, \nprocrastination, psychological technology of actualizing personal and pro -\nfessional resources among educational subjects.\nIntroduction\nThe modern epocch is characterized by great challenges and risks \ncaused by radical social, cultural and technological changes in society. \nThe challenges of the time require answers to a number of fundamental \nquestions: to what extent is a modern person capable or ready for change \nand able to go beyond traditions, identify new tasks and means of knowl -\nedge, but most importantly - what personal qualities can act as motivators, \ncatalysts for accepting challenges, and which, on the contrary, represent \ninternal barriers that block the potential for development?\nAll the above mentioned is particularly acute in connection with the ne -\ncessity to solve the problem of personal and professional development of \nschool, college and university educational subjects, responsible for ensur -\ning students\u2019 development, health and effective lifestyle.\nThe answers to these questions come from the solution of a number of \ninterrelated theoretical, experimental and practical questions. One of the \ncentral ones is the necessity to study psychological barriers \u2013  negative \nphenomena affecting individual and social consciousness. Our analysis of \npsychological barriers to educational subjects\u2019 personal and professional \ndevelopment (Mitina, Mitin, 2020;  Mitin, 2017, 2020) make it possible to \nidentify the main ones: marginal consciousness and self-consciousness, \nprocrastination, personal (learned) helplessness. There are different ap -\nproaches to studying these phenomena; most researchers study each of \nthese processes in isolation from each other.\nIt can be stated that none of the psychological, pedagogic, sociological \n126\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsand economic studies of a person\u2019s professional life studied the influence \nof a complex of negative phenomena on personal and professional devel -\nopment level. As a result, practical psychological work (trainings, semi -\nnars, coaching, etc.) turned out to be ineffective.\nPurpose and objectives of the study\nThe purpose of the research is theoretical and empirical studying the \npsychological content of the selected phenomena as well as their inter -\nrelationships; developing and implementing the technology of updating \nresources aimed at overcoming psychological barriers of educational sub -\njects\u2019 personal and professional development.\nLiterature review\nPsychological analysis of modern studies of marginalism (Druzhilov, \n2017; Yermolaeva, 2001; Kalashnikov, Minyurova, 2017; Spasennikov, \n2011) shows that the main sign of marginality concerning professional con -\nsciousness as well as self- consciousness is the inversion of values and \nmeanings, the desire to have benefits not by realizing their uniqueness \nas a person and a professional, but to receive them undeservedly in the \nshortest way.\nThe main feature of the marginality of individual professional con -\nsciousness is the gap between the concepts of \"I can\" and \"I have\", and \nthe corporate professional consciousness is the discrepancy between the \nconcepts of \"professional\" and \"position\", the gap between career growth \nand professional improvement. At the level of public consciousness, \nmarginalization manifests itself in the psychological readiness to accept \nlow-level professional services that do not meet social expectations. The \nchoice between the need for personal benefit and understanding the social \nharm caused is made by \"understatement\" or completely ignoring it by the \nsubject (Yermolaeva, 2001; Mitina, Mitin, 2020).\nThe question of professional marginalism in this context, is advisable to \nbe studied comprehensively together with the problem of procrastination, \nindicating a person's tendency to constantly postpone various cases \u201cfor \nlater\u201d (Druzhilov, 2017; Yermolaeva, 2001; Kalashnikov, Minyurova, 2017; \nKosheleva, 2017; Nekita A. G., Malenko, 2009; Cheremoshkina, 2015).\nProcrastination is a factor that stimulates distortions of self-determina -\ntion in the life, personal, social and professional fields concerning a mod -\nern person (Bolotova, Chevrenidi, 2017; Mokhova, Nevryuev, 2013;\u0410itken, \n1982; Lay, 1986; Solomon, Rothblum, 1984).\nThe analysis of scientific sources shows that the procrastination of an \nindividual acts as an indicator of self-determination process of an individu -\nal, significantly determining the main milestones of its progress to self-effi -\n127\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentscacy and, as a result, to meaningfulness and life satisfaction. (Vorob'eva, \nYakimanskaya, 2003; Gorbunova, 2010; Pichil, 2014; Chernysheva, 2016; \nBurka, Yuen, 1982; Ferrari, 1992).\nStudies show that the main psychological factor of a specialist\u2019s pro -\nfessional involution, marginalism and procrastination is the emergence \nand consolidation of various forms of personal helplessness in childhood, \nprimarily -the learned helplessness (Vedeneeva, Tsiring, 2011; Volkova, \n2014; Malkina-Pykh, 2010).\nAs a result of their research, M. Seligman and S. Mayer concluded that \nthe completely learned helplessness syndrome is formed by the age of \neight, and its essence is that a person does not believe in the effectiveness \nof his actions (Maier, Seligman, 1967).\nAt the same time, modern research proves that learned helplessness is \nformed not only in preschool, but also in later life and even in adulthood. It \nis facilitated by a high level of motivation to avoid various failures, as well \nas control over the action by the type of orientation to the condition (Bashi -\nrova, 2018; Vasilenko T. D., Khorunzhaya, 2021).\nMethodology \nThe theoretical and methodological basis of the research is represent -\ned by a systematic personality-developing approach (Mitina, 2014), quali -\ntatively expanding the object-subject field of research in different spaces \nof professional life of a person and makes it possible to conduct a mean -\ningful and experimental study of personal and professional development \nat different stages of ontogenesis and different stages and conditions of \nprofessional life, also allowing for a scientifically based forecast of profes -\nsional future of development. In line with this approach, the concept of pro -\nfessional development is developed, distinguishing two alternative models \n(strategies) of professional work : the model of professional development \nof an individual and adaptive functioning model. These models differ from \neach other in the professional self-awareness development level and inte -\ngral personal characteristics (orientation, competence, flexibility), as well \nas in the level of a reflexive resource performing a certain function in rela -\ntion to the resolution of intrapersonal contradictions (semantic, regulatory \nand pathogenic levels).\nThis research shows that the model of professional development char -\nacterizes the constructive path of a person in the profession, creation, \nbuilding up and updating their creative potential, while the adaptive func -\ntioning model defines the destructive path in the profession, stagnation \nand neuroticism, marginalism and procrastination, destruction, loss of the \ncreative potential and personal resources.\n128\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsBased on the provisions of the concept, we have developed a psycho -\nlogical technology for professional development which makes it possible to \ntransform adaptive behavior into behavior aimed at creative self-realization \nin the profession, updating the resource capabilities of an individual.\nFor determining the relationship among the indicators personal and \nprofessional development, learned helplessness, procrastination and mar -\nginal consciousness indicators, an empirical study (stating and forming ex -\nperiments) on samples of school and university teachers as well as school \nand university students (n=738) was conducted. The specially developed \nmethodological program included the following methods: the Self-Actualiz -\ning Test (SAT, adapted by L. L. Gozman and others), the method of study -\ning the value orientations of M. Rokeach, life-meaning orientations test by \nD. A. Leontieva, V. V. Boyko's method of diagnosing the level of emotional \nburnout, the STONE-P (\u201cSTOUN-P\u201d) attributive style questionnaire for ado -\nlescents, Phillips anxiety level (School Anxiety Scale), the questionnaire of \nthe optimistic-pessimistic explanation style  (T. O. Gordeeva, O. V. Krylova, \nmodification of the CASQ test by M. Seligman), the Garanyan modification \nof general procrastination scale by C.Lay. \"Report on a significant event for \nthe week\" by L. M. Mitina, as well as author's questionnaires, interviews \nand observations.\nResults and Discussion \nThe results of the ascertaining experiment make it possible to come to \nthe following conclusions:\n1. High level of personal and professional development was revealed in \na small number of the surveyed (21% of school teachers and 26 % of uni -\nversity teachers). The rest (79% and 74%, respectively) are characterized \nby an average and low level of personal and professional development as \nwell as adaptive functioning model.\n2. On all scales of the test of life-meaning orientations, groups of teach -\ners with high professional development level have the best results indicat -\ning high meaningfulness of life and the absence of an existential vacuum.\n3. There is an interrelationship between the place of basic values on the \nrank scale and a teacher\u2019s professional development level. The lower the \nprofessional development level of an individual is, the more significant the \npragmatic values and the lower the place of values having a humanistic \ncharacter are. On the contrary, for teachers with high level of professional \ndevelopment, spiritual and moral values (wisdom, spirituality, love for one's \nneighbor, the happiness among others, love for the Motherland, etc.) come \nto the fore.\n4. The majority (68 %) of the representatives of the adaptive functioning \n129\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsmodel is characterized by the signs of marginal professional conscious -\nness and procrastination, largely due to the learned helplessness syn -\ndrome formed in childhood as well as the role position of the victim, trans -\nmitted and assigned by students.\n5.  Learned helplessness is formed and consolidated in the process \nof long-term failures during school and university education, facilitated by \ndeviant forms of behavior among teachers due to emotional burnout and \nprofessional deformations of an individual.\n6. Personal helplessness of pessimistic students (37%) is represented \nby the isolation, anxiety, excitability and dependence on others; it is a pre -\nrequisite for the emergence of addictions, psychosomatic diseases, stress \nas well as forming marginal self-consciousness and procrastination.\n7. Personal helplessness is not formed if students develop under \nthe conditions of polysubject interaction \"child-adult\", \"teacher-student\", \n\"teacher-student\".\n8. Indicators of learned helplessness, procrastination and marginal con -\nsciousness increased dramatically in school and college students during \nthe lockdown and distance learning. This happened as a result of the fact \nthat having resources in the form of telephones and the Internet, school -\nchildren and students exchanged ready-made information and answers, \nwithout making much effort, but at the same time getting good grades; as \nfor primary schools, parents were the ones who studied, not children.\nThe results of the study confirm the necessity to prepare teachers with \nhigh level of personal and professional development, ready to create an \neducational and educational environment in which students are able to \ngain experience of independent activity, form active position concerning \nfinding the meaning of life as well as profession, overcoming the manifes -\ntations of learned helplessness, marginalism and procrastination.\nThe formative experiment was devoted developing and testing technol -\nogy for updating resources to overcome barriers to educational subjects\u2019 \npersonal and professional development. It consisted of two stages: stage \nI \u2013 integrating the technology in school, stage II - integrating in Higher edu -\ncation (Mitin, 2018; Mitina, Shchelina, 2018). It is based on the technology \nof constructive behavior change (Mitina, 2018), consisting of four behavior \nchange stages (preparation, awareness, re-evaluation, action), behavior \nchange processes (motivational (stage I), cognitive (stage II), affective \n(stage III), behavioral (stage IV)), as well as a set of influence methods \n(traditional and active). The modification of this technology consisted in a \ndifferent filling of the psychotechnical content of each stage.\nForms of implementing the technology of updating resources to over -\n130\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentscome barriers to personal and professional development can be repre -\nsented by scientific and practical seminars, training seminars or coaching \nworkshops.\nThe most effective organizational and psychological condition for im -\nproving students\u2019 personal and professional development process (stage \nI of the formative experiment) is the psychological technology integrated \ninto the educational space of the school, aimed at updating personal and \nprofessional resources of educational subjects, the stages of which are \ncorrelated with the periods of students' education at school and modi -\nfied in accordance with the specifics of age. As shown in our research, \nthe active forms of such development are the following: in primary school \n(stage I) a special experimental educational subject \"The world and me\", \nthe program \"House of Good Deeds - developing creative self-activity and \nindependence\"; in adolescence (stage II) special optional classes \" Who \nam I and who is next?\", \"Program for developing cognitive abilities\", \"Pro -\ngram for developing trust\"; at the pre-professional stage of training (grades \n8-9-stage III) - a two-year coaching workshop \"My professional intentions\", \n\" What is time management?\u00bb; during high school age (stage IV) - special \npsychological training seminars \"In search of your profession\", aimed at \ndeveloping school graduates\u2019 preparedness for choosing a profession con -\nsciously and independently.\nAs a result of implementing the personal and professional development \nprograms among primary school students and younger adolescents, such \na psychological neoplasm is formed as a predisposition, i.e., a tendency \nto something, to some types of amateur activity, the presence of individ -\nual psychological characteristics for the development of something. Older \nadolescents at the pre-professional stage of training form a professional \nintention \u2013 a complex personal education arising as a result of students' \nawareness of the need to perform certain actions in accordance with their \nown development program, aimed at choosing a strategy for professional \ndevelopment and a profile of training at school.\nDepending on the level of awareness of professional intentions among \nschool students (grades 10-11), special psychological work, aimed at form -\ning the preparedness for a conscious and independent choice of profes -\nsion is carried out, the new formation is subjectified, transforming into a \nsubjective ability of the student.\nWhile working with students (stage II of the formative experiment) , the \nfollowing stages of technology were correlated with the periods (courses) \nof training in a pedagogical university:\n- 1st course (preparation stage) \u2013 recruitment of participants in a group, \n131\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsfamiliarization with the following topics: \"Professionalism and career: what \nhelps and what hinders\", \"Marginalism\", \"Procrastination\", \"Learned help -\nlessness\"; watching films and videos on topics (short film \"Procrastina -\ntion\" by J. Kelly, videos \"I'm busy\" (Carmel Cathalian), \"How learned help -\nlessness works\" (A. Sharifov), \"S. Bankovskaya \u2013 Marginality Sociology\" \n(\u201cPostNauka\u201d (post-science)), their analysis and discussion. Identification \nof the types of participants and choosing means of influencing them. Type \nI -  not interested, does not believe in the necessity, impact and usefulness \nof these classes, and that these topics will not affect him; type II - begins to \nthink about problems, tries to remember similar situations in his life, tries to \nunderstand whether this knowledge will be useful to him in life and in what \nway, weighs all the \"pros\" and \"cons\" of changing his behavior, type III - is \nactive, interested, considers problems relevant, wants to master new skills.\n- 2nd course (awareness stage) - cooperative teaching methods \n(STAD, discussion, \u201cCoop-coop\u201d, Jigsaw), where students analyzed the \ntopics \"What can prevent me from working?\", \"Conflicts in professional \nactivity\", \"How to make friends with a student and a teacher?\"; a series of \nclasses \"Psychological design of professional tasks\", aimed at updating \nthe existing and mastering new experience in solving professional tasks, \nthe development of reflection as a means of correcting psychological barri -\ners that hinder their personal and professional development;\n- 3rd course (re-evaluation stage) \u2013 social and psychological training \nincluding elements of a business game, including exercises and games \naimed at developing resources to overcome the negative impact of psy -\nchological barriers to personal and professional development: constructive \nstrategies of coping behavior, reflexive design and emotional involvement;\n- 4th year (stage of action) - holding round tables together with teach -\ners, where discussing the problems of marginal consciousness, procrasti -\nnation and learned helplessness as well as ways to overcome them; teach -\ners were invited to share their personal experience concerning encoun -\ntering such problems and solving them with students; students, in their \nturn, to share with teachers their knowledge and skills acquired during \nparticipation in the program and in industrial practice; the students also \ndemonstrated their master classes on overcoming psychological barriers \nand developing resources to overcome them; at the end - the technology \nand the achieved results, the consolidation of new constructive ways to \novercome the psychological barriers that hinder personal and professional \ndevelopment, support and encourage students to further self-development \nand self-improvement in their future professional activities were assessed.\nConclusion \n132\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsThe results of theoretical and empirical research show that one of the \nmain tasks of modern education is the need to study, prevent and correct \na complex of psychological barriers (marginal consciousness, procrastina -\ntion, learned helplessness) that block the potential of school and university \neducational subjects\u2019 personal and professional development.\nAchieving a certain level of professional development is based on a \ncomplex combination of integral personality characteristics (focus, compe -\ntence, flexibility) and complex abilities (coping behavior, reflexive design, \nemotional involvement), where each element not only complements the \nother, but also has a synergistic effect.\nPrimary, secondary and senior school students\u2019 personal and profes -\nsional development programs were developed on the basis of psychologi -\ncal technology and implemented along a continuous educational trajectory. \nGradually, different types of students\u2019 creative activity (research, construc -\ntion, design, etc.) changed and became more complex.\nProjects and programs integrated into the educational (including ex -\ntracurricular) process of the university make it possible to reconsider the \nstrategic guidelines of professional training, making the development of \nsubjectivity (integral personal characteristics) the main goal, allowing stu -\ndents to make a conscious and independent choice of life strategy and \nprofessional path and constructively overcome the psychological barriers \nof education subject personal and professional development.\nAll this makes it possible to carry out a continuous process of self-pro -\njection of an individual and consistently move from one stage of psycho -\nlogical restructuring to another (self-determination, self-expression, self-\nrealization), effectively overcoming the psychological barriers that hinder \npersonal and professional development.\nThe effectiveness of personal resources (coping behavior, reflexive \ndesign, emotional involvement) actualizing technology is empirically con -\nfirmed by an increase in the level of self-awareness and integral character -\nistics of educational subjects, a decrease in the indicators of learned help -\nlessness, procrastination, and marginalism, thereby ensuring an increase \nin the level of their personal and professional development.\nReferences\n1. \u0410itken, M.

The article discusses such concepts as mobbing and bul -\nlying. What are the types and forms of psychological violence? How they \naffect the development of the organization and the personality of the em -\nployee. The article describes the domestic and foreign approach to the \nstudy of mobbing and bullying.\nKeywords:  mobbing, bullying, psychological terror, psychological vio -\nlence, hazing, gaslighting.\nThe concept of mobbing was introduced by Konrad Lorenz, who stud -\nied the social classes of animals. Mobbing is an attack by a pack of her -\nbivorous animals attacking a predator. If we take the social psychology of \na person, then mobbing was studied by Hanz Leyman. He gave the defini -\ntion of \"mobbing-psychological terror\" [7, p. 78].\nThe phenomenon of \"psychological terror\" is described in many West -\nern scientific works. In 1996, the British Institute investigated psychological \nterror in the office. In the West, the word \"bullying\"is used for this phenom -\nenon. According to statistics, every fourth employee has become a victim \nof terror [7, p. 35].\nMobbing is a situation in which there is one person or a whole team of \nthe company. They are constantly subjected to violence by management \nor colleagues [9, p. 14].\nThe situation of bullying (mobbing) has a very strong effect on the men -\ntal state of a person, as a result of which he may have somatic disorders.If DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.73.69.018\n136\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentspsychological terror has arisen, then a person will be subjected to this type \nof violence: this is a cruel form of treatment that is carried out by a group \nof employees [10, p.104].\nMobbing is an extremely serious problem for society.It includes claims \nagainst a person, a negative assessment of work, isolation of a person, \ngossip-rumors; discrimination, creation of uncomfortable conditions and \nplanned harassment; psychological harassment, dissemination of false in -\nformation, etc. [11, p. 14].\nPsychologists believe that mobbing and bullying are a reaction to any \nchanges. It occurs more often in stable collectives with old orders and \nout-of-agreement rules. This phenomenon is called haising - when there \nare informal rules in the group that cannot be violated or that can harm a \nperson's health and life(for example, hazing in the army). And at the slight -\nest threat to stability, terror arises. Not every conflict situation can be as -\nsociated with lobbying.\nThere is a version that psychological terror is a problem of people's \ncommunication. According to psychological studies, 50% of cases of psy -\nchological violence are vertical aggression, i.e. when the violence comes \nfrom the leadership.\nPsychologist Castelletti believes that heart problems and blood pres -\nsure are the most common consequences of mobbing and bullying. \nThoughts of suicide are also frequent.\nMobbing (bullying) - as a social phenomenon, suggests that the relation -\nship between the two parties is deteriorating and requires rapid improve -\nment. Scientists believe that mobbing should be considered both from the \npoint of view of medicine and from the point of view of psychology. And all \nof the above, we can conclude that mobbing ( bullying) is a psychological \nviolence that is repeated often, carried out by the management (bossing) \nor members of a group for one or more people.\nThe causes of mobbing are divided into psychological, social and or -\nganizational [1, p. 85].\nPsychologists also describe such cases when managers become \nvictims of mobbing. Such cases occur due to the fact that the man -\nager does not have sufficient competence in management, does \nnot have authority among employees, is inexperienced [2, p.142].  \nIt can be concluded that psychological terror is an inadequate way to re -\nmove a person, bypassing all the laws of labor law and the constitution. \nWith the help of terror, you can force a person to perform not his official \nduties. At many enterprises, there is no job description of employees, it is \nnot his duties that can be blamed on a new employee [3, p. 55].\n137\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsThere is one interesting point in the Russian literature related to mob -\nbing: this term is not considered anywhere, only in some scientific articles \nthat have a theoretical character and are not applicable in practice in any \nway. There is no official concept of mobbing in Russia. This phenomenon \nis not found even in the legal framework.Despite the fact that the Criminal \nCode of the Russian Federation provides for the article \"insult to the per -\nson\u201d and \"slander\".nevertheless, it is very difficult to prove the guilt of the \ninitiator of mobbing (bullying) under these articles [4, p. 46].\nThey started talking about mobbing in Russia quite recently. Although \nsome universities conducted research on this type of violence. It was even \nestablished that mobbing in our country is divided into vertical and hori -\nzontal. The first type is associated with the fact that the harassment comes \nfrom the authorities.And the third type of modding is when the harass -\nment comes from colleagues. Quite recently, a new type of mobbing was \nestablished - institutional. This type of violence is observed among the \nteaching staff of universities and it consists in the fact that the employee is \neliminated by an exorbitant amount of paperwork: reports, writing curricula, \ninternships during classes, etc. [5, p. 44].\nRussia has only recently begun to introduce medical services designed \nto resolve conflict situations. And they also began to introduce anti-bullying \nprograms in preschool educational institutions [6, p. 85].\nIn the West, the phenomenon of mobbing, as already mentioned above, \nhas been studied for a very long time. special institutes have been opened \nto study this phenomenon. On the legislative basis of many Western coun -\ntries, mobbing is considered a crime and is criminally punishable. For peo -\nple. those who have been subjected to mobbing, there are special psycho -\nlogical services or centers that provide the necessary psychological and \nsocial assistance [7, p. 62].\nThere is a strict division of mobbing in Western literature:\n1. Mobbing - regular psychological and physical violence against a per -\nson by a group of people. There are two types of mobbing:Open [8, p. 107].\nLatent-psychological violence occurs in a hidden form, a person is \"put \na stick in the wheels\" and that he left [1, p. 55].\n2. Bullying is psychological or physical violence against a person by \nanother person or several members of groups.\n3. Bossing - psychological violence on the part of the management.\nThe reason for mobbing in an organization or educational institution is \nindifference in the broadest sense of the word. If students really study and \nstrive to study, then they will never bully and humiliate anyone. They will \nsimply have no time. If people do not see a positive result in their studies, \n138\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthis can cause psychological violence[2, p. 98].\nMobbing is studied by various sciences, including psychology and man -\nagement.The main causes of psychological violence [3, p. 132]:\n- a tense situation at work;- the personnel policy is poorly developed;\n- envy from the defense of colleagues and the beginning, or vice versa;\n- a strong fear that a new person may take the place of the naalnik;\n- the desire of the head of someone to survive-the use of bossing;\n- crises both in the organization and throughout the country;\n- unhealthy competition among employees;\nPsychological violence as a means of reducing personnel. When a \nmanager uses violence, in this way he gets rid of a competitor, unneces -\nsary employees, and carefully circumvents the law [4, p.44].\nThe economic situation can affect the occurrence of psychological pres -\nsure if there is a crisis or unemployment in the country [5, p. 122].\nThe reasons related to the culture and society of the occurrence of psy -\nchological violence relate to [6, p. 46]:\n- vera;\n- your opinion about morality;\n- differences in culture and customs;\n- ethics.\nAnd if there are intra-organizational reasons for the occurrence of psy -\nchological violence, then these are [7, p. 111]:\n- production;\n- the team;\n- management, including personnel management.\nPsychological violence of employees is of a social nature[8, p. 66].\nThe reasons for the occurrence of psychological pressure are as fol -\nlows:\n- mobbing-managers ' goals regarding their employees;\n- mobbing-employees ' goals relative to each other;\n- mobbing-the goals of employees relative to managers.\nThere are several groups of employees who can cause psychological \nviolence, or become a victim of it. These are new employees, pre-retirees \nand elderly people. Or when employees apply for a managerial position \n[9, p. 44]. \nPersonal reasons include the following [10, p. 32]:\n- psychological reasons;\n- the presence of specific signs of the victim in the employee.\nPsychological reasons are justified by employees ' fears about their col -\nleagues or managers and can be divided into three subgroups [11, p. 45]:\n139\nProcess Management and Scientific Developments- potential fears of managers about their subordinates;\n- potential fears of employees regarding their colleagues;\n- potential fears of employees regarding their managers [12, p. 121].\nSummarizing all the above, we can safely say that such a severe form \nof psychological violence as mobbing and bullying are very dangerous not \nonly for a particular person, but also for the entire organization, which ( if \nthis violence occurs in it) will experience a reduction in personnel, a dete -\nrioration in production and the quality of work and, as a result, a drop in its \nstatus.\nReferences\n1.

The article presents the results of a theoretical analysis of \nthe problem of professional selection in an organization. The main compo -\nnents of the professional selection procedure are considered, and its tasks \nare listed. The importance of establishing specific features of the content of \nprofessional activity for the differentiation of leading professionally signifi -\ncant qualities is indicated. The types of professionally significant qualities \nare given as an integral part of the psychogram of the profession. The typi -\ncal conditions for conducting a psychodiagnostic research in the course of \nprofessional selection are indicated.\nKeywords : profession, professionally important qualities, professional \nactivity, professional selection, labor functions. \nAt the beginning of the XX century, as a result of the scientific and \ntechnological revolution and scientific and technological progress, the \nproblem of assessing workers and predicting their professional suitability \narose. Numerous studies of various types of professional activities have \nshown that individual, psychological, physiological characteristics, as well \nas formed professional readiness affect both labor productivity indicators \nand its safety (Koropets O.A., Plutova M.I., Shadrikov V.D.). At the same \ntime, a well-structured professional selection procedure makes it possible \nto determine the potential labor capabilities of a person [2]. \nDetermination of the full (partial) compliance of an applicant for a job \nposition as a guarantor of his further efficiency in labor was one of the first \nreasons for the emergence and development of a method of professional \nselection. The main tasks of the professional selection procedure accord -\ning to literary sources are: checking educational documents for compliance DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.62.96.019\n141\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentswith the profile; assessment of the psychological and physical health of the \ncandidate; assessment of the possibility of growth and training in related \nspecialties (getting a new profession); screening out applicants completely \ninappropriate for the desired position. Taken together, the listed conditions \nserve as the basis for drawing up criteria for the success of a future em -\nployee in professional activity, the basis for hiring and the economic stabil -\nity of the organization. \nIn the domestic psychological literature, scientists interpret the concept \nof professional selection as follows: \"...a set of measures aimed at en -\nsuring high-quality selection of the organization\u2019s personnel on the basis \nof assessing the compliance of the level of development of the neces -\nsary psychophysiological (individual) qualities and personality traits with \nthe requirements of a specific professional activity and contributing to the \nsuccessful mastering and subsequent effective implementation labor activ -\nity\"[3]. \nFrom the content of the concept of professional selection, it follows that \nan important condition for differentiating the criteria for a position is the \nneed to take into account the specific conditions of professional activity, its \nconditions, content and abilities of the candidate [1]. Special emphasis is \nplaced on the content of the profession's professiogram, its psychological \npart - the psychogram, which reflects the most significant qualities directly \nrelated to the success of the activity (physiological, individual psychologi -\ncal, etc.). The pattern of these indicators is called professionally important \nqualities. \nAccording to V.D. Shadrikov professionally important qualities are: \n\"qualities that affect the effectiveness of activities and the success of its \ndevelopment. On the other hand, PIQ can be viewed as individual psy -\nchological qualities and personality traits that determine the possibility of \nsuccessfully performing professional activities\"[6].\nTraditionally, in the structure of professionally important qualities, re -\nsearchers distinguish the following elements (Filatova O.V.): a set of gen -\neral, private, professional, private abilities; a set of peculiar social and psy -\nchological characteristics of a person (values, attitudes, interests, etc.); a \nsystem of knowledge and a set of necessary skills. Professionally impor -\ntant qualities act as prerequisites for professional activity and are improved \nin the course of activity [5]. \nIt should be noted that the concepts of \"professionally important quali -\nties\" and \"professional suitability\" are closely interrelated and complement \neach other. According to a number of scientists, professional suitability can \nbe regarded as \"...the correspondence of individual personality traits to the \n142\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsrequirements of the profession, the ability of an employee to effectively \ncarry out professional activities\" [4]. Special requirements for the profes -\nsional suitability and PIQ of workers are imposed during the course of pro -\nfessional activity in conditions of exposure to extreme factors. An example \nis service in various law enforcement agencies or types of activities with \nparticularly extreme working conditions (pilots, high-altitude assemblers, \noperators of complex technical systems, etc.). \nDetermination of the candidate's suitability for the position after pro -\ncessing the information of the documentary part is possible by conducting \na psychodiagnostic study. In accordance with the reference model, which \nreflects the maximum level of development of the necessary qualities, psy -\nchodiagnostic tools are formed.\nThe effectiveness and speed of the procedure for psychodiagnostic \nresearch, as well as cost-effectiveness, are due to the competence of a \npsychologist and psychological service. The cost-effectiveness of the pro -\ncedure involves taking into account the financial costs of conducting a psy -\nchodiagnostic examination by different methods. \nSo, A.G. Shmelev highlighted several typical conditions fulfilled by a \npsychologist diagnostician in the process of professional selection: \n1) the use of approved tests and methods that have been tested in \nterms of reliability and validity;\n2) take into account the adaptation of the test material to the require -\nments of a specific professional activity; \n3) the possibility of constructing a new test, when, with a certain list \nof professionally important qualities (PIQ), there is no procedure for their \nstudy and measurement [7]. \nSummarizing the above, the following should be noted:\n1. The implementation of all stages of professional selection is possible \nwhen conducting a comprehensive meaningful analysis of the professional \nactivity of a particular specialty, close attention to its psychological charac -\nteristics, main functions and operations. Based on the results, a set of spe -\ncific labor requirements for the psychological resources of the employee \nand individual components of his personality is determined. The revealed \nrange of requirements of the system of the considered professional activ -\nity to the personality of a professional allows us to formulate a normative \nmodel of a specialist.  \n2. One of the main types of activities of the psychological service of \na modern organization is professional psychological selection. Within the \nframework of this type of activity, the psychologist solves the following \ntasks: diagnoses the pattern of psychological qualities that should ensure \n143\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthe success of the educational and professional activities of the applicant; \nis responsible for providing departments of the organization with compe -\ntent personnel; control over the course of the adaptation process for new -\ncomers to the post (young specialists); applies prevention methods to level \nconflict and asocial forms of behavior; develops a set of measures aimed \nat preventing premature health loss associated with working conditions.  \nThus, there is a need to develop and improve the system of profession -\nal selection of personnel in modern organizations, since its main goal is to \ndetermine the suitability of an applicant for a job position as a guarantor of \nthe efficiency and productivity of his professional activity.\nReferences\n1.

In discussions about the subordination of the Bosporus \nPersians, new studies. V.P. Yaylenko with small additions repeated his \nversion of the campaign Ariaramnes and subordinate of Bosporus to the \nPersians under Darius I. J. Nileling suggested that chapter III, 97 Herodotus \nmight have in mind the possibility of submission of the Bosporus to the \nPersians until the time of writing his work. Both point of view supported \nby G.R. Tsetskhladze. In our opinion, all the arguments do not match the \ncontext of the chapter of Herodotus.\nKeywords:  Achaemenids, Ariaramnes, Bosporus, Darius I, Persia, \nPontus, Scythians.\nThe problem of the likelihood of submission of the Bosporus to the Per -\nsians has a long history. For the first time, an employee of the Museum of \nFine Arts V.K. Shileiko in the publication of the Persian chalcedony seal \nfrom the museum collection. In his opinion, the cylindrical seal of Artax -\nerxes I Dolgoruk (465/4-425 BC) published by him, dating today to the last \ndecades of the V century BC. [Dandamaev, 1976, P. 36; Nikulina, 1994, p. \n85], \"was\" a Persian regalia entrusted to the Cimmerian royal satrap who \nruled the Bosphorus\" [Shileiko, 1925, p. 18]. This is motivated by her place \nof discovery \" on the ancient Cimmerian coast \" (italics mine - EM).\nHowever, this opinion was not recognized and already T.V. Blavatsky, \nassessing the nature of the Bosporan-Persian relations during the reign of \nArtaxerxes I, noted that the discovery of cylinders with royal seals rather \nindicates that \"Persian diplomacy apparently took some steps to involve \nthe Bosporan tyrants in its orbit\" and that \"this cylinder could have been \nentrusted to the tsarist ambassador sent to the Bosporan ruler\" [Blavatsky, \n1959, p. 81-82]. The circumstances of the discovery of this cylinder (kept \nin the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts. Inventory \u2116 12v 254) and the \nsecond similar, also mentioned by V.K. Shileiko (kept in the Hermitage. DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.43.40.020\n145\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsInventory \u2116  19499 - purchased in Kerch) do not give full confidence that \nthey were found precisely in the Bosporus, and not brought to Kerch for \nsale from some other region. \nA thorough study of Achaemenid imports in the Northern Black Sea \nregion, including cylinder seals, allowed M.Yu. Traister to conclude that \nthis our cylinder-seal is the only one that \"is correctly considered as an of -\nficial seal that belonged to a high-ranking official\" [Traister, 2011, p. 117]. \nIn our case, it could be Artaxerxes I himself or his, as they would say now, \n\"extraordinary and plenipotentiary\" representative. An interesting remark \nby M.Yu. Treister, following immediately after his quote: \"whoever owned \nthe seals in question, there is practically no doubt that they \"traveled\" along \nwith their owners [Treister, 2011, p. 117]. Since there is no reason to speak \nof Artaxerxes himself traveling to the Bosporus, it is more logical to think \nthat such was his ambassador, who had very extensive powers, who died \nduring his visit and was buried with his regalia, among which was our cy -\nlindrical seal. As a consequence, the conclusion of T.V. Madame Blavatsky \nabout the significance of these seals seems to me much more convincing \nand probable. \nThe real discussion about the likelihood of the subordination of the Bos -\nporus to the Achaemenids began with an analysis by G.A. The purse of the \nexpression \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\" of Diodorus in his first message about the \nBosporus (XII, 31.1) and confirmation of the fact of the subordination of the \nBosporus to the Persians by other, mainly narrative sources. Proceeding \nfrom the fact that Diodorus under the term \"Asia\" usually means Persia, \nGennady Andreevich, with the help of a number of indirect arguments, \ncomes to the conclusion that the Cimmerian Bosporus was an integral part \nof the Achaemenid state [Koshelenko, 1999, p. 135, etc.]. \nThis version was actively supported by N.F. Fedoseev [Fedoseev, \n1997, p. 309-319.], Who previously expressed similar views, publishing a \nnumber of finds from the Bosporus [Fedoseev N.F., Golenko V.K., 1995, c/ \n51-52]. I have already had to consider the arguments given by the authors \nin favor of this version [Molev, 2001, p. 29-33; 2001a, p. 58-66; 2006, p. \n275-285; 2008, p. 110-115] and my conclusion was directly opposite to the \nconclusions of my colleagues.  Recently, however, a number of other works \nhave been published in which this topic is raised again and my conclu -\nsions are also questioned. Without setting myself the task of covering the \nwhole range of problems associated with the Bosporus-Persian relations, \nI will only consider the idea of the possibility of the Bosporus entering the \nPersian possessions.\nSo, in 2004 V.P. Yaylenko, considering the campaigns of Darius I in \n146\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentshis report on the \"Bosporus phenomenon\", came to the conclusion that \nhis first campaign against the Scythians was actually a campaign against \nthe Bosporus [Yaylenko, 2004, p. 55-60]. However, the arguments of V.P. \nYailenko in favor of his version is not at all as convincing as it seems to the \nauthor. And that's why. Referring to the Bekhistun inscription, where Darius \nwrites (I deliberately quote V.P. Yaylenko's translation) [Yaylenko, 2010, \np. nine],: \"Then with an army I went to the Scythians. Then - - the sharp \nones - - against, the sea I reached - - I crossed the whole - - smashed, took \nsome of them captive - - to me - - the leader, Skunkh his name, captured \nand brought to me. Then I appointed another leader as I wished. After that, \nthe country became mine \", the author notes that the key words here are\" \nScythians wearing pointed hats\", living overseas... mentioned among the \nCentral Asian tributaries and possessions of Persia. Therefore, this mes -\nsage cannot be directly correlated with the conquest of the Bosporus. On \nthe relief with prisoners on the Behistun inscription, the relief image of \nthe Scythian king in a pointed cap directly says \"sak\u0101\", which is also well \nknown to V.P. Yailenko [Yailenko, 2010b p. 11]. And the Persians, as you \nknow, called the Saks the Central Asian Scythians (Her., I, 201), who were \nreally subjugated by Darius, who paid him tribute and were part of the 15th \ndistrict of his possessions (Her., III, 93). Moreover, they participated in the \nBattle of Marathon (Her., VI, 113) and subsequent battles in Greece (Her., \nVIII, 113; IX, 31, 71). Consequently, the Greeks knew them well enough not \nto be confused with the Black Sea Scythians.\nRealizing this, the author cites as a parallel to the text of the Behistun \ninscription the message of Ctesias of Cnidus about the expedition of the \nsatrap of Cappadocia Ariaramnus against the Scythians. However, concur -\nrency is highly questionable here. First, in the inscription, Darius writes that \nhe subdued the Scythians, and with Ctesias, the result of his campaign \nwas the retreat of the Persian king. Secondly, in the message of Ctesias it \nis also about the Scythians and there is not a word about the Cimmerian \nBosporus. And, thirdly, from the description by Ctesias of the campaign of \nAriaramnus does not follow in any way that it was aimed at conquering or \nsuppressing the fallen province, which suggests V.P. Yaylenko. It was just \na raid, during which Ariaramnus \"took hostages - \u1f20\u03b9\u03c7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5\" and nothing \nmore (Ctes., F13, 20).\nS.A. Yatsenko suggests that the Scythians of Skifarb are the very saka \nparadraya that are depicted on the relief on the tomb of Darius I in Naqsh-i \nRustam and that were conquered by Ariaramn [Yatsenko, 2011, p. 11-112]. \nSo this argument confirms the information of narrative sources about the \ncampaign against the Scythians, but by no means against the Bosporians. \n147\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsMoreover, the monuments of the Scythians in the Bosporus of that time are \nrare [Yakovenko, 1985, p. 17]. An attempt by A.A. Maslennikov to substan -\ntiate the more or less permanent habitation of some group of Scythians \nby the fact of Ariaramn's campaign is very unlikely, and the author himself \nnotes that Ariaramn's campaign could have been directed to any point from \nthe Danube delta to the Cimmerian Bosporus [Maslennikov, 1999, p. 175-\n176].\nAnd further. Cappadocia was part of the third satrapy in Asia Minor, \nwhich in Persian sources was most often called \"Cappadocia\" [Briant, \n2002, p. 63-69]. The Persian satraps under Darius I, according to Herodo -\ntus (Her., III, 128), had only a detachment of bodyguards and did not have \ntheir own troops and, moreover, a fleet. Of course, the requirement for a \nclear separation of civil and military functions was not strictly observed \n[Dandamaev, Lukonin, 1980, p. 113] and the king could well have ordered \nthe satrap to go on a campaign and give him some part of his army for this \npurpose. But the Persians did not have their own fleet. On whose ships \nwas Ariaramnus supposed to make the voyage? The answer to this ques -\ntion lies in the name of the type of these ships. Ctesias calls them pente -\nconters (\u1f41 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2   \u03bb\u1ffd - he also went on 30 fifty-oar \nships. Ctes., F13.20). The Penteconters were the most common military \ntransport ship among the ancient Greeks, and the ships named by Ctesias \nmost likely belonged to the southern Pontic Greek cities that were part \nof the Darius empire. And the South Pontic Greeks knew exactly where \nScythia was and could not confuse it with the Bosporus. And even if Ariar -\namnus fought with the Crimean Scythians, which B.A. Rybakov [Rybakov, \n1979, p. 170] and today considers it probable V.N. Zinko [Zinko, 2013, p. \n191], it is still not the Bosporus. All this makes the version of V.P. Yaylenko \nis nothing more than an assumption, and not very convincing.\nAnd finally, another argument of the author - the Greek chronicle of \n15 AD. Tabula Capitolina (IG, XIV, 1297), where under 514 BC it is said \nthat \"Darius, having built a bridge, crossed the Cimmerian Bosporus.\" The \nauthor, referring to the fact that Herodotus says nothing about the stay of \nDarius on the Bosporus, considers it possible to combine this crossing with \nthe description of the campaign of Ariaramnus and attributes it to 519 BC. \nHowever, the replacement of both the participant of the events and the \ndates in the chronicle are unlikely. It seems more likely that the Cimmerian \nBosporus is simply confused with the Thracian Bosporus, through which \nDarius really crossed, but in 514 BC. [Zavoikin, 2015, p. 243]\nConsidering one of my main arguments in favor of the fact that the \nBosporus never belonged to Persia - the message of Herodotus (Herod., \n148\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsIII, 97), the Danish researcher Jens Nieling proposed a different under -\nstanding of it. Let us cite this message and immediately note that it follows \nimmediately after the enumeration of the satrapies (italics mine - E.M.) cre -\nated by Darius, which, in my opinion, is not at all accidental: \n\"These were the districts and the size of the taxes. Only one Persian \nland I did not mention among the lands levied with tribute, because the \nPersians live in a country free of taxes. But there are also nationalities that, \nhowever, do not pay tribute, but deliver gifts. These are Ethiopians... then \nthe inhabitants of the region near the sacred Nisa... even the Colchians \nand their neighbors  up to  the Caucasian ridge (until then the Persian state \nstretches, the regions to the north of the Caucasus are no longer subordi -\nnate to the Persians), impose taxes on themselves in the form of voluntary \ngifts\"(trans. G.A. Stratanovsky). The introductory phrase of Herodotus is \nespecially important for us: \"\u1f10\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f44\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03a0\u03ad\u03c1\u03c3\u1fc3\u03c3\u03b9 \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \n\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b2\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03b7\u03bd \u1f04\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u039a\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2  \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd \u1f40\u03c5\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\", \nin which the author,  judging by the context of the chapter , specifically \nemphasizes precisely the limit of the spread of the power of the Persians \nin the north. Until recently, no one argued with this understanding of this \nmessage of Herodotus. However, Jens Nieling notes that in this phrase \nof Herodotus the expression \"\u1f40\u03c5\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9\" - should be understood in a tem -\nporal sense and not from geographical or gradual aspects [Nieling, 2010, \np. 132]. And one could agree with this, if not a single \"but\". By itself, this \nexpression in an exact translation from the ancient Greek (and from its \nEnglish translation, which was used by J. Neeling1) means only \"nobody \nelse (still; even; already; more; and henceforth ever in the future; immedi -\nately after ; from time; even more)\". J. Niling chooses the translation \"no \none already\", from which for some reason he concludes that those living \nto the north of the Caucasus Mountains no longer obeyed the Persians \nat the time Herodotus wrote his work, i.e. during the time from 447 to 425 \nBC, which means that once, these peoples were subordinated to the Per -\nsians. And since this message about the Colchians is placed at the end of \nthe description of the satrapies created by Darius, the subjugation of the \npeoples north of the Caucasus, according to J. Niling, should have taken \nplace during the reign of this king. And then the author directly and without \nany argumentation suggests that \"perhaps already in the VI century BC \ntyrants, closely associated with Miletus and the Persian rulers of Anatolia, \nhad power in Panticapaeum\" [Nieling, 2010, p. 127]. \n1 Translation of the above message of Herodotus into English, which was used by J. \nNiling \u2013 \"For the Persian rule extends as far as these mountains, but those who dwell in the \nparts beyond Caucasus toward the North Wind regard the Persian no longer (Macaulay, \nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh3090.htm ).\n149\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsBut, firstly, Herodotus does not say anywhere about the time of submis -\nsion to one or another satrapy and the time from which and for what period \nthe peoples who did not enter the satrapy paid voluntary gifts. According \nto the context of his work, it is only obvious that this entire system existed \nprecisely at the time of his writing of his History. And specifically in our \ncase, the time factor here is emphasized not by the expression \"\u1f40\u03c5\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9\", \nbut by the verb \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9, standing in the present tense. \nSecondly, in chapter III, 97, as in the previous ones, Herodotus precisely \nlists the peoples who became part of the Persian state and who voluntarily \npaid her gifts. And in this case, according to the general context, \"\u1f40\u03c5\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9\" \ncan only mean the sequence and geographical location of such peoples. \nIt is no coincidence, apparently, our introductory phrase in brackets follows \nexactly the words \"\u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f10\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf \u1f10\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u1f74\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f41\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c1\u03c7\u03ad\u03b5\u03c2 \n\u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u039a\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f44\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2  \u2013 even the Colchians and their neighbors as far \nas the Caucasus Mountains impose taxes on themselves in the form of \nvoluntary gifts (translation by GA Stratanovsky)\". It directly says that we are \ntalking about the peoples living up to the Caucasus Mountains , and the \ntext in brackets further explains why we are talking about these peoples - \nbecause the degree of their dependence on the Persians was not so great \nand at the same time they clearly retained their political independence.In \nany case, all Georgian authors think that way. Specially considered this is -\nsue back in 1979, A.I. Boltunova believes that the Kolkhs were dependent \non the Persians, of course, but they still retained their statehood [Boltu -\nnova, 1979, p. 51-55]. \nThe latter circumstance is well confirmed by archaeological data testify -\ning to the Achaemenid presence in the Transcaucasus. Thus, there is an \nassumption that some architectural structures in southern Georgia (Gum -\nbati, Samadlo), Armenia (Beniamin, Erebuni) and Azerbaijan (Sary-Tepe, \nKarajamirli), built using adobe bricks, may be palaces (or at least, resi -\ndence) of the Iranian rulers of these regions [Knauss, 2001, p. 125-143]. \nMoreover, for their construction, according to the author, experts and arti -\nsans from Phrygia and Persia could have been invited. At the same time, \nthe author himself, Florian Knaus, notes that \"the region which the Rus -\nsians call Cis-Caucasia... all still belongind to Russia, have been beyond \nthe Persian sphere of influence in antiquity\" [Knauss, 2006, p. 79]. The \ntraces of finds of Achaemenid and their imitated local products in southern \nGeorgia, cited by him, are very few and they came here, in his opinion, as \nobjects of trade and diplomatic gifts - \"they may have found their way to \nGeorgia throught trade or as diplomatic gifts\" [Knauss, 2006, p. 86]. On \nthe territory of Colchis proper, except for the Vani region, there are none at \n150\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsall. It is curious that while agreeing with these assumptions, the Georgian \narchaeologist V. Licheli immediately notes that in the city he investigated \nin southeastern Georgia Atskuri \"despite the influence of Iran... local tradi -\ntions are firmly preserved in Atskuri\" [Licheli, 2015, p. 258]. \nEarlier, O.D. Lordkipanidze noted that culturally Colchis is divided into \ntwo parts: the coastal strip oriented towards the Greek centers, and the \ninner one, oriented to the East [Lordkipanidze, 2002, p. 206-209]. In the \nopinion of David Braund, archaeological material from excavations of Col -\nchis settlements and necropolises generally indicates that the subordina -\ntion of the Colchians to the Persians was purely nominal, and even that \nconcerned only the eastern part of Colchis [Braund, 1994, p. 122ff]. \nThus, even Colchis, we cannot reliably refer to the possessions of Per -\nsia. And therefore, J. Niling's understanding of the text of Herodotus is only \nhis interpretation of what Herodotus could understand in this case. And \nnothing more. \nJ. Niling's idea was also captured by G.R. Tsetskhladze, who connects \nthe destruction on the Bosporus in the last quarter of the VI century BC \nwith the coming to power of the Achaemenids and their intention to include \nthe Cimmerian Bosporus in their state. This, in his opinion, is evidenced by \nthe message of Ctesias of Cnidus about the conquests of King Nina of As -\nsyria, which, as we have already noted, he considers it possible to ascribe \nto Darius I, and the message of Herodotus (IV. 120-122) about the pas -\nsage of the Persians through the territories of Greek cities [Tsetskhladze, \n2014, p. 215-216,218]. However, neither Ctesias himself, nor Diodorus, \nwho retells his information, does not at all connect Nina's campaigns with \nDarius, and anything can be assumed. There is, for example, the assump -\ntion that part of the Persian army during the campaign of Darius moved \nthrough Georgia [Jacobs, 2000, p. 93-101], although there is no direct evi -\ndence in favor of this. \nIn addition, if we were to involve Ctesias's information as proof of his \nversion of the course of events, then it would be worth paying attention to \nthe fact that, according to his information, Darius went deep into Scythia \nnot by 30 like Herodotus, but by 15 days of travel. And for such a period of \ntime, he could not have reached not only the Bosporus, but even to Olbia. \nIn any case, according to E.V. Chernenko, who thoroughly studied Darius's \ncampaign, his route did not fit the Greek cities in any way [Chernenko, \n1984, p. 67] \nThus, new attempts to prove the subordination of the Bosporus to the \nPersian state cannot yet be considered successful. The arguments given \nby the authors are not compelling, and most importantly, direct and accu -\n151\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsrate evidence in favor of their version. But one cannot but agree with the \nopinion of Yu.A. Vinogradov, that \"the greatest monarchy of Asia could not \nbut influence the historical development of both Scythia and the Bosporus \n(and other Greek states of the region!) By the mere fact of its existence. \nThe Spartokids, who created the territorial state, seem to have tried to \ncopy the Persian state in some way, to use some elements of its vast \nexperience in the field of state structure\" [Vinogradov, 2014, p. 521].  And \nthe new dating of the Persian cylinder-seal of Artaxerxes I suggests that \nnot only the Bosporan rulers could not ignore the powerful Persian state \nin their political activities, but also the Persian rulers, especially interested \nin expanding the circle of their supporters after the defeat of Xerxes in \nGreece, could not help but try to establish good relations with the growing \nBosporus state. N.F. is now inclined to this point of view. Fedoseev [Fedo -\nseev, 2014, p. 154-158]. \nIn conclusion, I would like to note that considering the Bosporus-Per -\nsian relations in a broader sense, A.A.

The main directions of the journal's ac -\ntivity are shown, French writers, whose work was presented on its pages, \nare revealed. The ideological component of the Franco-Soviet dialogue, \nwhich was conducted by the editorial staff of the journal, is demonstrated.\nKeywords:  Franco-Soviet Cultural Dialogue, International Literature \nmagazine, International Association of Revolutionary Writers.\n In the 1930s, there was an increase in Franco-Soviet literary contacts. \nThe rapprochement was mutual and was largely based on the ideas of \nanti-fascism. For their part, the Soviet cultural authorities were interested \nin the most significant writers in the West expressing a favorable position \ntowards the USSR in their works and public speeches. The Franco-Soviet \nrapprochement in the field of culture was maintained in the USSR in vari -\nous ways: from the publication of huge editions of works by foreign authors \nto the demonstration of the \"illusory\" reality created thanks to the activities \nof AUSCRA (All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Abroad) during \nthe travels of French writers across the Soviet country. Great attention was \npaid to the press, which became the conductors of Soviet cultural policy \nand had to maintain a dialogue with French authors. The Soviet magazine \nInternational Literature played an important role in fulfilling these tasks.\nThe journal was published in the USSR from 1933 to 1943 in several \nlanguages, including French. Its predecessors were the journals Vestnik \n1 The study was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (project \n\u2116 20-78-10014 \"From Consent to the Pact: Franco-Russian/Franco-Soviet relations in the \nperiod 1890-1930s.\")DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.30.80.021\n155\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsForeign Literature and Literature of the World Revolution. Until 1939, the \njournal was headed by the Soviet literary critic Sergei Sergeevich Dinam -\nov. The editors of the French edition were Paul Vaillant-Couturier and E.D. \nStasov. The French were represented on the international editorial board \nby Romain Rolland and Henri Barbusse. \nIn the \"International Literature\" published works of art by contemporary \nforeign authors, as well as critical articles about the work of foreign writers. \nAt the same time, despite the political preferences of the magazine to print \nmainly the texts of left-wing writers of the West and anti-fascist writers, \"the \nmagazine managed to acquaint the Russian reader with many outstand -\ning works of modern Western literature, and in first-class translations\" [3, \np. 314]. Indicative in this sense is the publication in the International Lit -\nerature of the novel by Drieu la Rochelle in 1935, whose political position \nwas condemned, and the literary talent and artistic value of his works were \nhighly appreciated by the editors.\nAs for French authors, the leader in the number of publications in the \n\"International Literature\" until 1936 was Andr\u00e9 Gide. In addition to his \nworks of fiction, the magazine published theoretical articles about his \nwork, published speeches by Andre Gide (including a speech at the Inter -\nnational Congress of Writers in Defense of Culture in 1935 in Paris), and \nan autobiography of the writer. Such attention to the person of A. Gide is \nexplained by careful preparation for the writer's visit to the USSR in 1936. \nHowever, such a powerful treatment of the author did not give its results, \nthe book \"Return from the USSR\" [4], written as a result of the trip, con -\ntaining criticism of Soviet reality, was a blow to Soviet literary and party \ncircles. After this work of A. Zhide and his name is not mentioned on the \npages of the journal \"International Literature\". In addition to A. Gide in the \n1930s, such French authors as Henri de Montherlant, Jean-Richard Block, \nAndr\u00e9 Malraux, Romain Rolland, Jean Gionot, Charles Wildrac are most \noften published. In the mid-1930s, the magazine pays special attention to \nthe personality and work of Henri Barbusse. The interest in the writer on \nthe part of the editorial staff of the magazine is explained by the following \nevents: firstly, the publication of the book by Henri Barbusse \"Stalin - the \nman through whom the new world is revealed\" [2], and secondly, the death \nof the writer in the USSR in 1935. Barbusse's book was given special im -\nportance, it is known that many eminent Soviet writers were ready to write \na biography of Stalin. However, \u201cStalin believed, and not without reason, \nthat it would be much better if his biography was written by one of the pop -\nular European writers\u201d [5, p. 100], which met the objectives of the Soviet \ncultural policy of creating a benevolent image of the USSR by authorita -\n156\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentstive Western intellectuals. Accordingly, the magazine reacted to this most \nimportant event by acquainting the reader with the work of A. Barbusse.\nCritical articles on the work of foreign authors occupied a significant \nplace on the pages of the journal, as a rule, they accompanied the pub -\nlication of the work itself. In the 1930s, International Literature published \narticles by such Soviet critics as I. Anisimov, E. Galperina, J. Fried, B. Pe -\nsis, V. Dmitrevsky, and also published critical articles by French writers - L. \nAragon, P. Nizan, L. Mussinac, J. Giono, P. Gzell, J. Cassu.\nThe magazine also introduced its readers to the creative and personal \ndestiny of the authors. So, in 1935-1936 the editorial board of International \nLiterature published biographies of French writers R. Rolland, A. Gide, J. \nGionot, L. Durten, V. Marguerite, as well as obituaries in memory of Eu -\ngene Dhaby, A. Barbusse. Despite the varied manner in which these bi -\nographies and autobiographies were written, in general, they reflected the \nsocial origin of the writer, his career, the writer's worldview, and the political \nand social significance of their work. \nThe journal also worked out theoretical questions in the field of litera -\nture, in particular, gave an analysis of French and Soviet literature, showed \nthe state of modern literature in France, the specific features of Soviet \nliterature as reflected by French authors. A fundamentally important point \nin the literary problems of the 1930s was the question of understanding \nthe role of the revolutionary writer. In connection with this aspect, Soviet \nspecialists attached particular importance to the work of the so-called \"pro -\ngressive authors\" [1, p. 147-151], on the other hand, the editorial board of -\nten criticized the political position of some writers, for example, the French \nsurrealists [10, p. 152-156]. \nThe ideological and political aspect of the Franco-Soviet dialogue was \nreflected in the pages of the International Literature magazine with reports \non the activities of the International Association of Revolutionary Writers \n(IARW) and its sections. In 1932, the AEAR (Association of Revolutionary \nWriters and Artists) was created - the French section of the IARW. AEAR \nactivities, political views of its leaders were devoted to separate notes in \nthe magazine, as well as chronicles, messages. In accordance with the \ntasks set by the party leaders, the magazine published favorable reviews \nof French writers about their visit to the USSR, showing their admiration for \nthe deep economic and social transformations in the country of socialism \n[6, p. 124-125]. The most important international events dedicated to cul -\ntural issues were reflected in special issues of the magazine. On the pages \nof \"International Literature\" were shown the events associated with the \nFirst Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934, as well as the International Con -\n157\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsgress of Writers in Defense of Culture in 1935. In particular, the speeches \nof delegates loyal to the USSR, the program, decisions of these forums \nwere published.\nOne of the forms of maintaining the Franco-Soviet cultural dialogue was \nthe correspondence of the editorial staff with foreign writers. \"Internation -\nal Literature\" was in constant regular correspondence with Jean Freville, \nRen\u00e9 Bleck, Georges Friedman, J. Cassou. The current correspondence \nwith L. Durten and A. Amber has been preserved. The Soviet side showed \ninterest in communicating with Romain Rolland, but the correspondence \nwith him was unequal: the editorial staff besieged the writer with letters to \nwhich he responded extremely reluctantly, referring to workload and health \nproblems [8. l. 12].\nCorrespondence with French authors concerned mainly their creative \nplans, the publication of novelties in French literature, current affairs of \nthe publication of works in \"International Literature\". Another interesting \nform of Franco-Soviet dialogue that the magazine carried out was the ex -\nchange of contemporary French and Soviet literature, sending books from \nthe USSR and receiving publications from France. A study of the corre -\nspondence of the editorial board with foreign authors shows that in the 2nd \nhalf. In the 1930s, she was interested in the works of Gabriel Odisio, Henri \nde Montherlant, Eugene Le Roy, Luc Durten, Georges Duhamel, Georges \nBernanos, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac. It is also known that the editorial board re -\nceived the authors' books, marked with literary prizes in 1938 [9, p. 36]. \nIn addition, the editors carried out ideological work with foreign writers. \nIn particular, it stimulated the preparation of articles by them on the occa -\nsion of a particular anniversary date in the USSR [8, p. 5-5a; 8, l. 7], the \ncreation of notes on the successes of the USSR in the socio-economic and \ncultural sphere, the compilation of a dossier on the political predilections of \ncolleagues - French writers [7, p. 5].\nThus, in the 1930s, the journal International Literature played an im -\nportant role in maintaining the Franco-Soviet cultural dialogue. In addition \nto publishing works by French authors, critical articles of a literary nature, \nacquaintance of Soviet readers with the biographies of French writers, the \nmagazine conducted ideological work with French authors, corresponding \nto the tasks of Soviet cultural policy. \nReferences\n1.Anisimov I.

The article is devoted to the urgent problem of rehabilitation \nand adaptation of people with disabilities to society. The functions of the \ntheater are considered as the most effective contributing to the socialization \nof people with mental disabilities, mental disorders, intellectual disabilities. \nThe work experience of various practical inclusions, \"special theater\", \npsychotherapeutic one proves that full-fledged creative activity in a \ntheatrical collective, trainings from the arsenal of expressive means of \nperforming arts, an individual teaching method, and integration contribute \nto a more successful involvement of people with disabilities into society.\nKeywords : theater, socialization, society, inclusion, integration, \n\"Special theater\", psychotherapeutic theater.\nThe Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees every person, \nregardless of social, national, religious affiliation, physical development, \nequal rights in the introduction to cultural values.\nThe state constantly takes care of people with disabilities, elderly peo -\nple, people with disabilities in physical and intellectual development: it pro -\nvides pensions, free medical care, and provides various benefits - that is, \nit provides social support. But this is not enough. It is important that people \nwith developmental disabilities feel like full-fledged members of society, \nlearn to live independently in society. Theater is an effective means of in -\nvolving people with disabilities into society.\nAs one of the most ancient forms of art, theater is unique in its nature, \nin its power of influence not only on the mind, but above all on human \nemotions.DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.78.41.022\n160\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsIn modern Russia, theater plays an important role in the formation and \ndevelopment of a person's moral potential, in the realization of everyone's \ncreative abilities, and contributes to an increase in the quality of the social \nand cultural environment.\nOne of the most important functions of the theater is the function of so -\ncialization. Actors and spectators are organically involved in the proposed \ncircumstances and relationships of the stage characters, they assimilate \ncertain social values   much more effectively and efficiently due to emotional \nperception. \"At the same time, the art of theater expands the boundaries \nof real life experience, gives a person the opportunity to live many different \nlives in the imagination. Spectators and performers learn models of social \nor cultural action, which embody the types of consciousness and behavior \nthat society would like to make normative\" [ 5, p. 55].\nExternal images of social relations or cultural norms pass into the inner \nintellectual and spiritual world of a person.\nOf great importance for socialization are children's theater groups, de -\nsigned to \"form value attitudes and behavioral models from a very young \nage\" [5, p. 56]. \nThe theater contributes to the socio-cultural self-realization of the indi -\nvidual, the development of individual creative abilities and talents, helps the \nindividual in his spiritual self-determination, the growth of self-awareness, \nand the assertion of his unique individuality. The most important social \nfunction of the theater is cognitive. Plunging into the magical world of the \ntheater, the world of stage images, through the actions of which he learns \nto distinguish between good and evil, a person learns the world around \nhim, absorbs the spiritual and life experience of generations. Thanks to the \neducational function, the theater forms the guidelines and goals of eve -\nryday behavior in the surrounding reality, its ideological and moral laws. \nSign or semiotic function helps to master and understand the system of \nsymbols and stage techniques used in stage performances, especially the \nexpressive means of stage art. The communicative function of the theater \ncontributes to the exchange of feelings and emotions in the process of cre -\nating a performance, working on a role, establishing live contact between \nperformers and spectators. A person with disabilities is more in need of \npositive emotions, and this is helped by the compensatory function of the \ntheater, which contributes to the satisfaction of the need for creativity, in an \ninteresting way of spending leisure time. And, finally, the play function is \none of the main features of theatrical art, which is inherent to one degree \nor another in every person.\nAs soon as he begins to realize the world around him, the child plays \n161\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentswith objects, animating them, improvising, creating his own world with fan -\ntasy and imagination, thereby fulfilling a person's need for self-realization \nand creativity from childhood.\nThe centuries-old history of the theater proves that theater is a living \nart, unique, which will always be important and relevant to society. The \ntheater \"is responsible for meeting certain social needs, for the socializa -\ntion of the individual, for the formation of ethical and aesthetic ideas and \nnorms, for the creation of conditions for the development of society and \nman\" [5, p. 50]. \nSocial responsibility is a characteristic feature of modern theater. These \nare those inclusive theater practices that are today used to \"form cohesion \nin society and exercise the rights of access to cultural values and participa -\ntion in the cultural life of those social groups that, due to their disabilities, \nare deprived of these rights\" [5, p. 65]. \nThe formation of means, forms that provide access to theatrical art for \npeople with disabilities, poorly adapting to the life around them, is one of \nthe main tasks of modern society.\nTheatrical art has a specific feature - people communicate with each \nother in the process of preparing a performance and showing it to the view -\ner. Today the theater is already becoming a form of social work, providing \nnew means for the social rehabilitation of people with disabilities. \nDespite significant obstacles, these people dream of participating in the \ncultural life of the country. And to help them is the task not only of social \nworkers, but also of creative creative directors, teachers, psychologists. \nThis work requires the creation of certain conditions \"to achieve equal op -\nportunities for all, regardless of gender, age, social status, education, eth -\nnicity, etc., in order to ensure full and active participation in all spheres of \nlife\" [6, p. 74]. And the main thing here, on the one hand, is the adaptation \nof the social environment to the individual capabilities and needs of a per -\nson with disabilities. On the other hand, there is the integration of people \nwith disabilities into society and adaptation to it. People with disabilities \nactively participate in inclusive practices and create their own \"Special \nTheater\", where they gain experience of successful interaction. The objec -\ntives of the inclusive theater: \"the development of the personality of the \nparticipants in the process of creative activity, improving the quality of life \nof people with disabilities through theatrical art, promoting the formation of \na positive image of a person with disabilities in culture\" [6, p. 76].\nIn recent years, integrative teams have appeared, in which not only \npeople with disabilities, but also ordinary people participate. As a result \nof joint activities, team members acquire a more successful experience of \n162\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsinclusive interaction. \"Each meeting of the \"Special Theater\" is an opportu -\nnity for all participants (including the director himself) to make a discovery \nin themselves and in the other (how to \"feel\" and live the possibilities and \nlimitations of the other as their own collision), as well as to find and agree \non the means expressing their experience in the conditions of developing \ninteraction\" [6, p. 79]. The \"Special Theater\" opens up wide opportunities \nfor preparing society for social inclusion. On the one hand, theatrical activ -\nity is able to provide conditions for the creative self-realization of people \nwith different abilities and needs through the disclosure of their abilities in \nthe field of theatrical art. On the other hand, theatrical activity creates con -\nditions for the formation of reverse inclusion, that is, it helps to form not only \nthe participants, but also the audience a special social position\"[6]. The \npopularity of the Special Theater is growing every year. The state supports \nthe initiative of those non-profit organizations that are trying to solve the \nproblem of social adaptation and rehabilitation of people with disabilities, \nusing the potential of the theater. So in 1988, a GITIS graduate, director \nand teacher Boris Yukhananov created the Individual Directing Workshop \n(MIR). The main theatrical project of the Workshop for 11 years was \"The \nGarden\" - a unique project, an experiment to create a theatrical produc -\ntion self-developing in time [8]. According to the director, the participants \nin \"Garden\" \"tried to get into the situation of composing a myth and at the \nsame time become its participants. The purpose of the experiment was \nto see how this created myth will be reflected in the personal evolution of \nthe participants in the performance and at the same time in the art that is \non the path of the created myth\"[7]. The basis was the staging of the play \nby A.P. Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\". The myth of the garden began \nto emerge during the reading of the play. The theme of the performance \nis about happiness and its acquisition and the impossibility of losing it. In \ntotal, seven variations of The Garden were created, and in each case it \nwas a new birth of the play and the myth of the garden. In the 90s, Boris \nYukhananov carried out a socio-cultural project in collaboration with people \nwith Down syndrome. The project was called Downs Commenting on the \nWorld. In the process of implementing this project, Downs became garden \ncreatures in one of the productions of The Garden, heroes or co-authors of \nthe videos \"Uncontrollable for Nobody,\" \"Yes, Downs, or Walking after the \nGolden Birds\". The project was aimed at social adaptation of people with \ncongenital developmental disorders and education of tolerance to them. \nBoris Yukhananov's experiment was a laboratory work and did not lead to \nthe creation of the \"Special Theater\".\nIn 1999, the \"Simple-hearted\" theater was created as a charitable pro -\n163\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsject and a community of parents of children with Down syndrome. The \nmost famous performance of the theater \"Captain Kopeikin\" based on \nGogol, directed by Igor Neupokoev, a graduate of VGIK. The leader taught \nhis actors with a special structure of the larynx and other physiological \ncharacteristics to speak expressively, clearly and competently on stage. \nThe performance was very simple in form, but it created a special theatrical \naesthetics imbued with the Gogol spirit.\nTheater \"Simple-minded\" became a laureate of many European and \nAll-Russian festivals of \"special theaters\". He was awarded the Crystal \nSprout Theater Prize and the Support to Russian Theater Initiatives Prize \nof the Council of the President of Russia for Culture and Arts. Some former \ntheater actors act in films, participate in performances of the Gogol Center, \nin the studio of Dmitry Brusnikin. \nInclusive practices that have been successfully developing in recent \nyears in Russia have also demanded a scientific approach to the problem \nof rehabilitation and socialization of people with disabilities.\nIn Moscow, the Center for Social and Creative Rehabilitation \"Circle\" \nhas been established at the Strogino Central Children's House. Artistic di -\nrector of the theater studio, clinical psychologist N.T. Popova considers \nthe main task \"to create psychological stability for everyone. An obligatory \ntoolkit is work with the deep subconsciousness\"[3]. The main pedagogical \nprinciple is an individual approach to each team member. And taking into \naccount its peculiarities, the search for specific means of theatrical expres -\nsion - gesture, rhythm, sound, smell, touch - in order to develop the ac -\ntor's own technique. In each performance, it was important to convey your \npain, your problem and get rid of it with the help of plastic expressiveness, \nbody language. In the process of work, one realizes that nothing can be \nexpressed with the body without internal motivation. \nOne of the early performances of \"Circle\", \"Do Flies Have Individuality\", \nhelped a 19-year-old autistic guy to free himself to some extent from an \ninferiority complex. The question \"What am I doing wrong?\" Constantly re -\npeated by him, played up by each participant in the performance in his own \nway, led the guy to understand what was preventing him from freeing him -\nself from his own \"cap\" in order to release the caught \"fly\" from under it [3].\nIn the theater \"Circle II\" under the direction of Andrei Afonin, the em -\nphasis is on the development and disclosure of human individuality in the \nprocess of creative activity aimed at creating a performance. Theater A.B. \nAfonina helps to develop social interaction skills. This is a social theater \nthat uses the possibilities of art therapy [2]. The play \"Distant Proximity\", \ncreated in collaboration with German colleague Gerd Hartmann, received \n164\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsthe national \"Golden Mask\" award in 2012 and 2015. The theater is con -\nstantly working with artists to master the basics of acting, with parents, \nspectators, using the method of acting. In one of his interviews A. Afonin \nemphasized that he does not use the word \"disabled\". He treats people \nwith disabilities as equal to himself. The purpose of inclusion is to include \na person in society, to teach people to live independently. In the process \nof creating a performance, people with mental disabilities are transformed, \nacquire their \"I\", their attitude. Through creativity, special actors can de -\nclare deeper meanings. \"We do not sympathize with a person with Down \nsyndrome, but we build partnerships with him, he gives us something im -\nportant to understand both in medicine and in pedagogy,\" said the famous \ndirector. \"We are trying to create a new model of society, where there is \na place for people with special needs.\" Today in Russia there are about a \nhundred collectives using the theater as a means of socialization and re -\nhabilitation of people with disabilities. In the context of an ever-increasing \nhumanization of society, the \"Special Theater\" is of interest. It is attended \nnot only by people with disabilities, but also by employees, professional \nactors. An example of a successful solution to the problem of socialization \nof people with disabilities can be the experience of the psychotherapeutic \n\"special theater\" \"We\" in Tambov, which uses the brigade method of work \n[1]. The theater was opened on the basis of the psychosocial rehabilitation \ndepartment of the Tambov Regional Psychiatric Hospital in 1998, becom -\ning a member of the Russian-Canadian project \"Public Rehabilitation in \nPsychiatry\" along with five regions of Russia. Colleagues from Canada \nhighly appreciated the experience of Tambov specialists, who were the first \nin the region to open the \"Special Theater\". In the first play, \"The Island in \nHalf\", the actors were the staff of the department and four patients who \nplayed the roles of stones. Then the performance of moral and aesthetic \norientation \"Be good, be good\" was born, where employees and patients \nalso took part. This work experience has shown good results: some pa -\ntients who were inpatient treatment in a closed ward for a long time were \nable to return to normal life. \"This healing creative inspiration pulls out, res -\ncues even from severe, persistent anxious depressions, from the feelings \nof meaninglessness of existence with pain for no one needlessness\" [4].\nThe psychotherapeutic theater \"We\" received a new stage of devel -\nopment thanks to the support of the Tambov regional branch of the All-\nRussian public organization of disabled people \"New Opportunities\" in the \nimplementation of the \"Theater Teaches\" project with the support of the \nPresidential Grants Fund. The aim is the rehabilitation of disabled peo -\nple with mental disabilities. Today, the theater's repertoire already includes \n165\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsseveral performances: \"Fly-Tsokotukha\", \"Kaleidoscope of Desires\", \"Time \nof Faith, Hope and Love\", \"ABC Fairy\", \"Wind Rose\", \"Crystal Heart\" and \nothers, as well as participation in festivals, numerous concerts, creative \nmeetings. Now the theater has more than 30 participants, most of whom \nare teenagers. These are difficult, special artists suffering from various \nmental illnesses. It is very difficult to combine artistic results and reha -\nbilitation, but it is possible thanks to consistent systematic practical work: \ntrainings, special exercises, individual lessons. All attention is directed to \nthe person, everything is built around him and for him. The director's vi -\nsion and plot must develop and support the psychological, emotional and \ncultural needs of all participants in the performance. The scenario basis \nfor such a performance is unique. Each lesson in the theater \"We\" begins \nwith a traditional circle, which gives a sense of unity. After a short introduc -\ntory speech by the leader, each participant expresses his opinion about \nthe upcoming production, talks about his desires, what role he would like \nto play, what idea to convey, what to tell the viewer about. The director, \ntaking into account all these wishes, makes adjustments to the script and \nfinalizes it. This is how the play \"The Rose of the Winds\" was born quite \nrecently, based on the texts of V. Shakespeare and G.Kh. Andersen. Such \na technique of joint creativity makes all the participants in the performance \naware that their opinion also matters, because it is very important for these \nteenagers to be heard. As a rule, here the actors do not play a learned role, \nbut themselves and about themselves, about their feelings. They live on \nstage what they experience in real life, or what they wanted to experience. \nThus, in the aforementioned play \"Roses of the Winds\", almost all the girls \nplay the role of princesses. The director left them their own names, which \nallows them to identify with beautiful fairy-tale characters. This gives them \nthe opportunity to experience, and not play minutes of happiness from the \nrealization of their attractiveness and experience those feelings and emo -\ntions that they are deprived of in everyday life. It is believed that people \nwith mental disabilities are not very expressive, and this is largely true. \nTherefore, much attention is paid here to practical exercises that stimulate \nspeech and thinking activity and the removal of clamps. The expediency \nof exercises based on movement methods, breathing exercises, exercises \nfor the tongue and muscles of the jaw, theatrical studies and games, exer -\ncises aimed at developing sensory coordination are very high. Such exer -\ncises help special adolescents not only get stronger physically, overcome \ntheir fears, but also learn to manage their emotions. Numerous studies \nsuggest that emotions and mood even affect the immune system, reduc -\ning or increasing resistance to disease. In practical classes in the theater, \n166\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsstudents work with their body and psyche, learn open communication and \nexpressive behavior. A whole team of professionals works in this project. \nTwo social psychologists conduct social and domestic trainings aimed at \ndeveloping everyday skills and mastering financial literacy. Stage speech \nand acting classes are taught by a professional drama theater actress, \nwho is also a teacher of special disciplines at the university. The director, \nwho also has an education in the field of clinical psychology, in addition to \nrehearsals of performances, conducts communication trainings in order \nto provide a new universal way of conveying information and organizing \nleisure.\nThe task of the theater is to teach special teenagers to be open, to help \nthem not only self-actualize in creativity, which is undoubtedly important, \nbut also to understand that they can also give something to this world. \nFeeling useful to society is an opportunity to live a conscious life.\nClasses in the psychotherapeutic theater \"We\" helped many special \nadolescents successfully go through the process of socialization: to enroll \nin the technical school of industrial technologies and the Diversified Col -\nlege. I.T. Karasev, as well as find a job.\nSpecial people are also worried about eternal questions: about the \nmeaning of life, about good and evil, and about their place in this world. \nPsychotherapeutic theater has a positive emotional impact, activates cog -\nnitive processes, and helps the psychological adaptation of adolescents \nwith disabilities in society.\nFor the interdisciplinary study of the rehabilitation and adaptation of \npeople with mental disabilities or mental disabilities, intellectual disabilities \nto society, the festival \"Protheatr\", which has existed for twenty years under \nthe leadership of Natalia Popova, is of particular importance. \nEvery three years, \"Special Theaters\" bring their performances to Mos -\ncow Russian and foreign guests. The festival not only contributes to the \nexpansion of the social and cultural space of the \"Special Theater\", but \nis a base for seminars, scientific conferences, exchange of experience. \nThe festival is attended by psychologists, art historians, theater experts, \nphilosophers, directors. The international focus of the festival contributes \nto the discussion of many issues of inclusive practices and a scientific ap -\nproach to their solution.\nA positive development in recent years is the participation of profes -\nsional theaters and professional actors in such projects. For example, \nin 2014, Yevgeny Mironov, artistic director of the Theater of Nations, to -\ngether with the Sovremennik theater, created a play for deaf-blind people \n\"Touched\" with the involvement of famous actors: Chulpan Khamatova, \n167\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsEvgeny Tsyganov, Anatoly Bely, Yegor Beroev and others. At each show of \nthe performance, two artists sat on both sides of the stage. They spoke for \nthe heroes, communicated with them, became, as it were, eyes, ears, and \nvoices of the participants. \"The Touched\" is a play about human closeness, \nabout attention to special people, about the opportunity to find common \nground with them, to make friends. \nIt is gratifying that foreign partners also take part in many projects for \nthe rehabilitation of people with disabilities.\nThus, the study showed the versatility of the use of performing arts, \ntheater in socialization, rehabilitation and adaptation to the society of peo -\nple with disabilities. Study, popularization, support of all initiatives in this \ndirection from the state, society, caring people will help to effectively and \nsuccessfully solve this problem. \nSocialization of people with disabilities is a two-way process. The so -\nciety shows a genuine interest in the problems of people with disabilities, \nand they try to become full-fledged members of the human community. As \nyou can see, the \"Special Theater\" does not set the ultimate goal of achiev -\ning a high artistic result. Here the main goal is to reveal the individual \ncharacteristics of people, to teach them to communicate, interact, believe \nin themselves, in their capabilities, using the entire arsenal of expressive \nmeans of performing arts accumulated over many years: trainings by Jerzy \nGrotowski, M. Chekhov, oriental practices in rhythmic education, energy, \nrelease from muscle clamps, relying on the game essence of the theater, \nits emotional impact on a person. \nBut this requires personnel appropriate to the task, with specific pro -\nfessional knowledge in the field of directing, acting, theatrical pedagogy \nand good psychologists with flexible creative thinking, enthusiasts. Work -\ning with people with disabilities is difficult, it requires patience, endurance, \nkindness and love to solve an important mission - to return people with \ndisabilities to a full life so that they can enjoy all the rights defined by the \nConstitution of the Russian Federation.\nReferences\n1.

Afghanistan is the important geopolitical point in South \nAsia, the struggle for dominance in which has been going on for over a \ncentury.  Western-style democratic transformations and radical Islamic \nfundamentalism, two opposites that destroy the comfort and peace of \ncivilians.  The social system\u2019s transformation is inevitable; Afghanistan has \nchosen the first and through ensuring gender equality, embark on the path \nof democratic reforms.\n Keywords : political process, political crisis, gender equality, democratic \ntransformations\n  \nDespite the current crisis and the international image of the country, \nengulfed in internal conflicts, deep corruption and deep-rooted social \nconservatism, the last hundred years of Afghanistan's history contain \nperiods of stability, peaceful ethnic coexistence, and moderate Islamic \nfundamentalism.  The stages of positive development can be determined \nby the actions taken during these periods aimed at resolving gender \nconflicts.  The participation of women, in various types of political processes, \npresupposes some kind of professional activity in the structure of the public \nadministration system or the presence of an effect of direct influence on the \nactions of the country's leadership through the implementation of various \npublic initiatives [1].\n Liberated from religious prejudices in the second half of the last century, \nduring the presence of the Taliban, from 1996 to 2001, Afghan women were \nin a position of severe distance from all spheres of public life, including DOI 10.34660/INF.2021.82.38.023\n170\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentspolitical.  The Taliban, relying on radical Islamic views, deprived women of \ntheir basic civil rights, including the right to education, the right to mobility, \nnot to mention active and passive suffrage.  Women were forbidden to visit \npublic places unaccompanied by older male relatives and outside family \nand household events.  Requirements to cover themselves from head to \ntoe seemed the most harmless; women were not allowed to seek treatment \nfrom a doctor of the opposite sex.  Cases of violation by women of these \nrequirements irreversibly led to harsh punishments by the religious police \nof the Taliban, most often women were killed at the hands of executioners.  \nAfter the process of ousting the Taliban movement from the territory of \nAfghanistan began in October 2001, the Bonn Conference, held under the \nauspices of the UN, laid the foundation for the democratization of social \nand political processes in the country.  It was agreed to create an interim \nadministration, which was supposed to ensure the presidential elections.  \nAccording to the Bonn Agreement, the interim government of Afghanistan \nwas to adopt a democratic constitution within two years.  The Bonn \nAgreement provided for the creation in the country of conditions under \nwhich women, along with men, were given the opportunity to participate \nin public life and enjoy their political rights.  The atmosphere of fear and \nlawlessness had to disappear into oblivion.  Former US President Mr. \nBush noted that the Taliban used violence and fear to deny Afghan women \naccess to education, health care, mobility and the right to vote, our coalition \nliberated Afghanistan and restored basic human rights and freedoms for \nAfghan women. [2]  In 2012, with the creation of the Interim Government, \nthe Ministry of Women's Affairs was created to address the myriad gender \ngaps that women face.  Devotion to serving women is considered the \nfirst achievement of women since the Taliban, and the participation of \n114 women out of 504 delegates in the Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly), \nwhich was convened to consider a proposal for a new constitution by \nthe interim government in December 2003, is seen as the beginning of \nwomen's participation in decision-making.  The constitutional foundations \nof modern Afghanistan provide equal rights to men and women, article 22 \nof the constitution states: \u201cAny discrimination and privileges between the \ncitizens of Afghanistan are prohibited.  Afghan citizens - be they men or \nwomen - have equal rights and obligations before the law. \u201d[3]  Of particular \ninterest are Articles 43 and 44, of the Constitution guaranteeing the right \nof women to education, while Article 48 codifies their right to work.  As part \nof the implementation of the legal framework, an independent commission \nwas established in 2011 to oversee the observance of the Constitution \nwithin the framework of labor law.  In addition, article 7 of the Constitution \n171\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsemphasizes the need to comply with the Charter of the United Nations, \ninterstate agreements, as well as international treaties to which Afghanistan \nhas acceded and plans to ratify.\n Another step taken by the Afghan government to promote women's \nrights was President Karzai's 2009 law on the elimination of violence \nagainst women.  The law criminalizes more than 22 types of various \nforms of violence against women, such as rape, domestic violence, \nforced marriage, and marriage with minors.  The creation of a democratic \nsystem in accordance with the new constitution of Afghanistan and the \ninternational community's support for women's rights have opened up \nopportunities for women in public administration, now they work as civil \nservants in the government, as legislators in parliament, as ministers, \nofficials in the economic and social spheres [4] Habiba Sorabi was the first \nwoman to be appointed governor in 2005, in 2009 a woman was elected \nmayor;  similarly, three ministries were headed by women.  Of the 2,500 \nwho came together at the Loya Jirga (Grand Gathering) to negotiate a \nBilateral Security Agreement with the United States in November this year, \n400 were women.  The fact of women's participation is very indicative \nin assessing the quality of socio-political processes in the country, but, \nunfortunately, their number in the public sector is very small, with the \nexception of the parliament.  Elections are the main process of forming \nrepresentative bodies of power, given the past historical stage of excluding \nwomen from the political sphere, a system of quotas was provided for in \nthe electoral law of Afghanistan.  According to the proposed proportion, \n27% of the seats in the lower house of parliament and one fifth of the total \nnumber of seats in the provincial assemblies are reserved for women.  The \nstate electoral law stipulates that 16 percent of the seats in the Meshrano \nJirga (upper house of parliament) must be held by women, a third of the \nupper house of parliament is elected by the president, and the president is \nrequired to elect half of them from among women. [5]  The 2004 presidential \nelections in Afghanistan marked an important historical milestone for the \ncountry.  For the first time, citizens felt a sincere desire to go to the polling \nstation in order to directly vote for their president.  The turnout is in the \nmillions, of which about 40% are women.\n Despite some notable advances made by women in the political arena, \nthere are problems that prevent women from participating in political life.  \nThere is no proper level of security, cultural  barriers; financial problems \nare not completely overcome. [6]   Poor security is considered one of the \nmost pressing problems in Afghanistan, from which women are severely \naffected.  The Taliban, which are vehemently opposed to the emergence \n172\nProcess Management and Scientific Developmentsof women in the social and political sphere, are targeting high-ranking \nwomen politicians.  In less than ten years, two heads of the women's affairs \ndepartment were physically   eliminated; they were killed one after another, \nthe Taliban kidnap women parliamentarians, ambush the cars of women \nsenators.  Not only politicians are dying, but members of their families, \nclose people, so the daughter, a senior officer of the Afghan police, died.  \nAccording to a UN report, in 2012, 300 women and girls were killed and \n560 injured, an increase of 20% over the previous year.  According to \nthe international organization, the number of victims among women and \nchildren increased by 38 percent in the first half of 2013 compared to \nthe same period in 2012.  Insecurity of life affects the electoral activity of \nwomen in elections.  The findings of the National Democratic Institute show \nthat all women politicians faced threats.  However, it is not only the Taliban \nwho threaten  women; they face harassment from their male opponents \nand society, including tearing up campaign posters, verbal abuse and even \nphysical violence.  Cultural barriers continue to limit women's participation \nin the political process, for example, when a woman wants to run for \ngovernment office, it is important that she obtains the consent of her family \nand village elders.\n Raikhana Azad stresses that the significant increase in the number of \ngirls attending school, the presence of women in legislation and the cabinet, \nand the reduction in the death rate of women during childbirth are the main \nachievements that women have made over the past decade.  It should be \nnoted that the women of Afghanistan have made significant progress in \nprotecting their rights.  Since the countries of the world community have \nstepped up in the processes of stabilization of the political and legal system \nof Afghanistan, progress has been obvious, especially in equality and \nprotection of the rights of citizens regardless of gender.  It is too early to \nspeak of a complete victory in this area, as women continue to suffer from \nwidespread violence and are victims of the informal justice system in rural \nareas, although it has been  repealed by state law.  Moreover, a patriarchal \nsociety does not allow women to fully exercise their political rights, and, \nin addition, women lack the tools such as education and financial self-\nsufficiency to successfully participate in the political process.  Since the \nattitude of society towards women has not changed, the progress they \nhave achieved remains fragile [7], but its presence allows us to positively \nassess the results of the reforms begun.\n173\nProcess Management and Scientific DevelopmentsReferences\n1.

We\nexamined features of 40 videos that ranked the highest in YouTube\u2019s search engine over the course of\nfour weeks after the publication of the report. Additionally, this study examines the shifting visibility of the\nvideos, the nature of the channels that published them and the way in which they articulated the issue of\nclimate change. We fo und that media activity around SR15 was animated by a mix of professional and\nuser-led channels, with the former enjoying higher and more stable visibility in YouTube ranking. We\nidentified four main recurrent themes: disaster and impacts, policy options and solutions, political and\nideological struggles around climate change and contested science. The discussion of policy options and\nsolutions was particularly prominent. Critiques of the SR15 report took different forms: as well as denialist\nvideos which downplayed the severity of climate change, there were also several clips which criticized the\nreport for underestimating the extent of warming or overestimating the feas ibility of proposed policies.\nContents\nIntroduction\nResearch approach and method\nThe IPCC c ommunication strategy and SR15\nFeatures of top ranking videos\nVisibility of top ranking videos\nSalient themes in top ranked videos\nConclusion\n \n \nIntroduction\nWhile print and broadcast media are classic objects of study in environmental research (see Downs, 1972;\nBoyce and Lewis, 2009; Boykoff, 2011; Painter, 2013), in the last few years Web sites and online\nplatforms have come to occupy an increasingly important role in environmental, and particularly climate\ncommunication (for reviews of the large body of work on these topics see, e.g., Pear ce, et al., 2018;\nSch\u00e4fer, 2012; Sch\u00e4fer and Schlichting, 2014). If media represent \u201cimportant arenas and important\nagents in the production, reproduction, and transformation of the meanings\u201d of environmental issues [1],\nsocial media offer both new channels to communicate about climate change (Pear ce, et al., 2015) and\nnew sites for social research (Marres, 2017; Rogers, 2013; Ruppert, et al., 2013; Spartz, et al., 2017).\nStudies of climate communication on social media, however, have so far focused almost exclusively on\nTwitter (because of the eas e to obtain and analyze its records) and neglected other popular platforms\n(Pear ce, et al., 2018). YouTube in particular appears as an understudied platform despite not only its\npopularity [2] but also the fact that even the platform itself has recently expressed concerns about the\nincreasing activities of climate deniers (Hirji, 2018; see also Oreskes and Conway, 2010; Uscinski, et al.,\n2017).\nThe handful of studies that have examined climate debates on YouTube have focused on the politicization\nof climate science especially around controversial issues, such as Climategate (Sh apiro and Park, 2015;\nPorter and Hellsten, 2014) or in association with conspiracy theories such as those related to \u201cChemtrails\u201d\n(Allgaier, 2016) and \u201cFlat Earth\u201d (Pao lillo, 2018). These studies have generally focused on the most\nviewed videos and their comments (Porter and Hellsten, 2014; Shapiro and Park, 2018) as well as on\nsearch results (Allgaier, 2016). Previous work found that YouTube was useful in informing the public about\nclimate change, but also cautioned against the tendency of the platform to increase polarization. As noted\nby Allgaier [3], \u201cpeople and groups who oppose mainstream scientific positions already gained a strong\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 2 / 20foothold on such channels and know very well how to use them to their advantage\u201d. These articles called\nfor further research into how climate change is represented in YouTube\u2019s videos but also into the ways the\nplatform shapes the issue through its technical affordances (Davis and Chouinard, 2016), including its\nsearch engine (Porter and Hellsten, 2014).\nIn this article, we investigate the articulation of climate change on YouTube focusing on the activity\nspurred by the publication of the IPCC Sp ecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR15) [4]. The\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) i s a key actor in climate debates and an authoritative\nvoice on climate science. Its publications represent major \u201cfocusing events\u201d in the climate debate\n(Newman, 2017) and SR15 was a keenly awaited report. Requested in 2015 in the Paris Agreement and\nstrongly advocated by small island states for whom climate change poses an existential threat (Ourbak\nand Magnan, 2018), the report was issued on 8 October 2018, following a two-year writing process. For\nthe first time, this process involved all three IPCC Wo rking Groups (WG I on the physical basis; WG II on\nimpacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and WG III on mitigation). SR15 was meant to reopen the\ndiscussion about the 2\u00b0C target, by discussing the effec ts that could be avoided by preventing a warming\nbeyond 1.5\u00b0C.\nIn line with the tendencies observed above, research on the IPCC an d social media has so far mainly\nfocused on Twitter, examining the users, media sources and frames that have animated discussions about\nIPCC r eports, and in particular its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) released in 2014 (O\u2019Neill, et al., 2015;\nNewman, 2017; Pear ce, et al., 2014; Holmberg and Hellsten, 2016). O\u2019Neill, et al. (2015) for instance,\nfound that WG I findings were more prominently discussed on Twitter than those from the two other WGs\n(a tendency also found in print and broadcast media by Kunelius and Yagodin, 2017). Newman (2017)\nshowed that both elite (mainstream media sources) and non-elite actors (independent bloggers,\nconcerned citizens and activists) were particularly active following the release of the WG  I report. He also\nnoted that the most frequently discussed sources came from mainstream media, thus challenging the\ncommon assumption that the advent of social media platforms has limited the influence of traditional\nmedia. Finally, Yagodin, et al. (2017) highlighted the communication tactics increasingly used by the IPCC\nto attract and shape media attention (e.g., press releases and tweets). Their findings called for attention\nto an increasing media presence of scientific institutions (see Lew enstein, 1995; Peters, et al., 2008).\nIn this article, we approached the study of climate change on YouTube with the following questions in\nmind: How did the release of SR15 play out on YouTube? How was the debate influenced by the\ncommunication practices of the IPCC? Which actors and themes were most salient in this space? And\nfinally, were positions that challenge the report prominently featured at the top of the search result\nrankings?\nIn this article we pursued a quali-quantitative approach (Latour, et al., 2012; Ven turini, et al., 2015), in\ncontrast to previous studies, which focused either on statistical analysis of metadata and textual features\nof large datasets (of tweets in particular) or on a dissection of a sample of online content. Through a\ncombination of digital methods (Rogers, 2013) and close and distant readings (Moretti, 2013) of 40 videos\nthat occupied the highest positions in YouTube\u2019s search ranking over more than four weeks, we sought\ninsights on the state of the climate debate on a relatively understudied platform.\nAfter presenting our overall approach and the research protocol we used in this study, we describe the\ncommunication strategy of the IPCC in general and in the specific context of the launch of its SR15. The\ncore of the article is dedicated to the analysis of the highest ranked videos in YouTube\u2019s search engine,\nboth in terms of their individual features and of their relative visibility. Finally, we explore the thematic\nframings present in our corpus and describe in detail the four most prevalent ones.\n \nResea rch approach and method\nRather than focusing on a specific aspect of the SR15 online discussion, our aim was to provide a broader\naccount of the activities that the report prompted on YouTube. Instead of focusing exclusively on the\ncontent made available by the platform, its attention cycles, the actors intervening in the conversation or\nthe capacity of the IPCC t o shape online discussions, we tried to consider all of these aspects together in\norder to provide a m ore holistic picture of how climate change was articulated through YouTube\u2019s platform\nor device culture (Pear ce, et al., 2018; Wel tevrede and Borra, 2016). We ap plied digital methods that\nallowed us to attend to how issues were shaped by the technical and economic features of online\nplatforms as well as by the practices and cultures of those communities that populated them (Langlois and\nElmer, 2013; Marres, 2017, 2015; Marres and Moats, 2015; Pear ce, et al., 2018).\nIn this article, we approached YouTube starting with its search engine (Rieder, et al., 2018). Wh ile much\nresearch exists on YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm (e.g., Matamoros-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2017; Burgess and\nMatamoros-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2016; Airoldi, et al., 2016), less attention has been dedicated to its search\nalgorithm, which is generally used simply as a tool to sample videos on a given topic (e.g., Ache and\nWallace, 2008; Basch, et al., 2015; Keelan, et al., 2007; Murugiah, et al., 2011). In this article, besides\nusing YouTube\u2019s search engine to identify top-ranked videos about SR15, we also explored the hierarchy\nof visibility produced by this ranking and we investigated its temporal fluctuations through exploratory\nvisual techniques (Moats and Borra, 2018; Mauri and Ciuccarelli, 2016; Niederer, 2018).\nIn what follows, we focused in particular on the top results returned by the query [IPCC r eport 2018] with\nYouTube\u2019s default settings. The choice of research query was crucial, as in any digital methods project\n(Rogers, 2017). Since social actors often use different words in order to demarcate their position in public\ndebates, choosing one keyword instead of another can privilege one position over others. In our case, a\nquery using the full report title and even its short version (i.e., [Special Report on Global Warming of\n1.5\u00b0C]) r eturned highly specialized clips and favored certain professionalized and institutional expert\ncultures over broader societal engagement with the report. The report acronym, SR15, on the other hand,\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 3 / 20was underspecified and prompted results about the SR15 rifle series. We t hus agreed on the query [IPCC\nreport 2018], which offered a convenient middle ground and was often suggested by Google Web  Sear ch\nas a \u201crelated\u201d query for a number of terms associated with the report (thus suggesting its frequent use).\nAs we were less interested in tracing the immediate reactions generated by the report than in providing\nan overview of media activities after it reached relative stability, we started our data collection 10 days\nafter the release of the report and continued it for four consecutive weeks, from 18 October to 18\nNovember 2018 [5]. To examine fluctuations in ranking of videos over time, we collected the daily ranking\nof each video as well as various metadata (publication date, views count, number of comments,\nassociated channels, etc.). Wh ere available, transcripts of the videos were also collected.\nData was harvested through the \u201cSear ch: list\u201d endpoint of the YouTube API  which \u201creturns a collection of\nsearch results that match the query parameters specified in the API  request\u201d [6]. More specifically, we\nused the \u201cVideo List\u201d module from a set of scripts that queried YouTube\u2019s API using its default settings,\nwith the region code set to \u201cUS\u201d an d the results ranked by relevance (Rieder, 2015). By avoiding the\npersonalisation and localisation encountered in the user interface, this approach offered a baseline\nappraisal of video ranking (Rieder, et al., 2018). Wh ile we captured the first 100 results for each day, in\nthis article we limited our analysis to a subset of the top 20 daily search results over the study period,\nresulting in a corpus of 40 unique videos.\nYouTube is often presented as a space where professional video producers sit alongside amateur video\ncreators, such as home video makers and vloggers. In reality boundaries between professional and\namateur practices are blurred as video contributors span \u201ca range of professional, semi-professional,\namateur, and pro-amateur participants\u201d [7]. With this challenge in mind, we attempted to understand the\ntypes of actors that performed best in the ranking and thus were more influential in articulating the issue\nof climate change on YouTube. Following Burgess and Green (2009), we examined whether a channel\nappeared to be institutional (i.e., associated with established or emerging actors of the media industry, or\nwith institutions and companies from other domains) or whether it appeared to be user-led (i.e.,\nassociated with individual content producers that span the whole professional-amateur spectrum,\nincluding, semi-professional, pro-amateur, such as citizen journalists, lay experts, journalists and\nscientists). We al so treated as user-led those channels that offered no explicit description but appeared to\nbe set up by non-professional users, in the sense that they did not present an institutional affiliation or\nmarkers of professional content production.\nBesides the level of professionalization, we also identified 13 clips containing some criticism of the report.\nMost of these videos did not reject the whole report, but rather challenged some of its conclusions (e.g.,\nthe underestimation of climate-related risks or the proposed solutions). Only four videos in our corpus\ntake overtly denialist positions refusing the existence of climate change or its anthropogenic causes.\nFinally, we examined how climate change was thematically articulated on YouTube by considering titles,\ncontent and transcripts [8] to identify their most salient framings, i.e., storylines \u201ccommunicating why an\nissue might be a problem, who or what might be responsible for it, and what should be done about it\u201d [9].\nBecause we worked with videos (and not just with textual documents encountered when studying public\ndiscussions on Twitter or in the blogosphere), we incorporated multimodal analysis (Jewitt, 2009; Kress\nand van Leeu wen, 2001). In accordance with this approach, we considered YouTube videos as layered\nmultimodal constructions combining written and spoken language, static and moving images, diagrams\nand other resources.\nWe identified our thematic framings inductively through an examination of videos in our corpus but also\ntook guidance from a list of frames developed by O\u2019Neill, et al. (2015) in a study of the IPCC Fifth\nAssessment Report, as well as from the IPCC\u2019s  own communication strategy (see the next section). Given\ntheir different genres, lengths and degrees of narrative complexity, videos elicited one or multiple\nthematic readings. We fo cused our analysis on the most recurring framings: Disaster and impacts (DI),\nPolicy options and solutions (POS), Po litical and ideological struggle (PIS) an d Contested science (CS)\n(Table 1).\n \nTable 1: Main features of the four most salient thematic framings in\nour corpus, building on O\u2019Neill, et al.

It was established in 1988 under the auspice of the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) an d the World Meteorological Organization (WM O) to\nprovide assessment reports on the current state of knowledge on climate change and its potential\nenvironmental and socio-economic impacts. It is composed of three Wo rking Groups which work under the\nsupervision of the IPCC B ureau. The WG s conduct their activities thanks to the input of thousands of\nvolunteer experts. The IPCC, as  an intergovernmental organization, is open to governments that are\nmembers of the United Nations (U.N.) or WMO.\nIPCC as sessment reports feed into the negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC). SR15 was intended as a key scientific input to the 24th Conference of the\nParties (COP24) organized in December 2018 in Katowice, Poland. It was expected to provide inputs to\nthe Talanoa Dialogue, a p latform launched in 2018 to evaluate countries\u2019 steps towards avoiding\ndangerous climate change.\nWhile originally a small and rather informal organization, the IPCC h as progressively become more and\nmore institutionalized and has increasingly adapted to an age of online communication and social media\n(Hickman, 2015). Outreach activities took center stage during the Third Assessment Report (AR3) in 2001\nbut remained confined to the maintenance of the official Web site, the organization of workshops and the\nattendance of UNFCCC m eetings. At the time, the IPCC p referred to avoid responding to online and off-\nline criticism and misinformation campaigns (De Pryck, 2018). The IPCC c ommunication strategy has been\nthoroughly revised after the 2009 controversies (Climategate and the errors found in AR4) as a response\nto the poor management of these disputes (InterAcademy Council (IAC), 2 010; Beck, 2012). It has since\npursued a careful management of the information that was displayed about its work, seeking to project an\nimage of scientific objectivity and maintain (at least formally) a strict separation between science and\npolitics (De Pryck, 2018). Since 2009, the organization has established a closer relationship with the\nmedia, in particular through the hiring of Jonathan Lynn, the IPCC\u2019s  senior communication specialist (and\nformer Reuters reporter). The organization has thus sought to gain greater influence on the coverage of\nits activities by media and has also become active on all major online platforms. Its YouTube channel was\ncreated in February 2011.\nThe IPCC is most visible around the release of its reports. To benefit from such visibility, it carefully\norchestrates the launch of its reports. Regarding the release of SR15, the Sec retariat issued a press\nrelease and organized a press conference. The communication focused on the dissemination of the main\nfindings of the report and remained discreet about the negotiations that led to them. The press release of\nSR15 (\u201cSummary for Policymakers of IPCC Sp ecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C ap proved by\ngovernments\u201d) is a four-page document, which brings together excerpts from the \u201capproved\u201d language\ncontained in the Summary for Policymakers (SPM  \u2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),\n2018a) of the report and statements by IPCC B ureau officials. The document opens by stating that\n\u201climiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all\naspects of society. [...] Wi th clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to\n1.5\u00b0C compared to 2\u00b0C could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society\n[...]\u201d [10]. It then describes the context through which the report was produced and offers a few  key\nfigures: the report has been written by 91 authors and contains 6,000 scientific references. The document\nacknowledges that the planet is already seeing the consequences of 1\u00b0C warming. It then underlines a\nnumber of effec ts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C (regarding sea level rise, ice\ncover in the Arctic Ocean and coral reefs). A k ey statement [11] is that \u201cglobal net human-caused\nemissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030,\nreaching \u2018net zero\u2019 around 2050\u201d. Overall, the report remains positive about limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C,\nwhich \u201cis possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented\nchanges\u201d.\nThe press conference was live-streamed on YouTube on 8 October 2018 from the IPCC\u2019s  official channel\n(video number 24). The IPCC c hair, Hoesung Lee, i ntroduced the report by stating that \u201cthis is one of the\nmost important reports ever produced by the IPCC an d surely the most keenly awaited\u201d. Key findings\nfrom the report (mainly from the SPM ) were presented by the co-chairs, following a narrative similar to\nthe one from the press release (from the state of warming to impacts and policies): WG  I co-chair Panmao\nZhai noted that \u201cat the current rate, global temperature is likely to reach 1.5\u00b0C between 2030 and 2052\u201d;\nWG II co-chair Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner presented the benefits of remaining below 1.5\u00b0C (few er floods, heat,\nrainfall, etc.), noting that \u201cevery bit of extra warming makes a difference\u201d; finally, WG III co-chair James\nSkea discussed the emission reduction technologies (including CDR), investments and behavioral changes\nneeded to remain below 1.5\u00b0C.\nStatements from the press release and press conferences were widely cited and discussed on YouTube\nand in other media, illustrating the influence of IPCC\u2019s  communication in framing media coverage. For\ninstance, the statement that the IPCC r eviewed more than 6,000 scientific references was often used to\nhighlight the rigor of the report\u2019s conclusions. The major impacts on sea level rise, coral reefs and the\nprospect of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer were also widely discussed. Only few videos (mostly\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 6 / 20by amateur channels) went beyond the official press materials to discuss statements from the report\nitself.\nYet, as the next sections illustrate, the IPCC p ress release and press conferences were not the only\nreference materials used in YouTube videos. A widely cited phrase (possibly the most widely shared) was\nlinked to an article published by the Guardian following the release of SR15 (Wat ts, 2018), claiming that\nhumanity had only 12 years to act on climate change. This headline was linked to two statements on the\nprobability of reaching 1.5\u00b0C between 2030 and 2052 and on the need to reduce emissions by 45 percent\nby 2030.\n \nFeatures of top ranking videos\nIn this section we begin to examine the 40 videos that featured in the top 20 results for the query [IPCC\nreport 2018] describing their location, category, duration, format and authorship.\nLocation. All but three of the 40 videos are in English and more than a third of them have been published\nby channels based in the United States (U.S) (1 6 videos), not surprisingly given our English language\nquery and that location is set by default to this region. Other countries that appear in our listing are:\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) (5), India (4), Can ada (3), Australia (1), Greenland (2), Sw eden (1) and Qatar (1).\nSeven videos were issued by channels that do not specify their location.\nCategory. The majority of the videos (33 out of 40) were dedicated specifically to the SR15 report,\nseeking to engage viewers in a debate about its implications for the climate debate. The seven remaining\nclips did not primarily address this report, but rather were focused on the IPCC o r climate change more\ngenerally. According to YouTube\u2019s classification, more than half of the videos (23 out of 40) belonged to\nthe category \u201cnews and politics\u201d. Other prominent categories were \u201cscience and technology\u201d (6), but also\n\u201cpeople & blogs\u201d (5) and \u201ceducation\u201d (4). The top result in the first days of our study period (number 4 in\nFigure 1 below), for instance, was an education clip about the IPCC an d its reports from an Indian Web\nsite providing preparation for civil service exams.\nDuration. Among the top results, we found productions of different lengths and nature. Contributions\nranged from short clips of less than five minutes (12 videos) to videos lasting more than half an hour (six\nvideos). Wh ile traditional media seemed to prefer short or medium durations, amateur and digital native\nvideos were often more extensive \u2014 the longest video in our list was a 54-minute report from the alt-right\nclimate skeptical channel Red Ice TV, taken down by YouTube on 17 October 2019 [12] (number 9),\nfollowed by another Indian educational video (number 40 \u2014 51 minutes) and a long amateur interview of\na former environmental scientist and known catastrophist, Guy R. McPherson (number 37 \u2014 48 minutes).\nFormat. As for the video format, little less than half of the contributions (18) accorded with the classic\ntelevision format of an anchor in discussion with one or more reporters or interviewees, while the other\nhalf (19) were simpler videos with a single narrative voice (the remaining clips are the IPCC press\nconference and two collages of existing video footage). The distinction between these two formats\noverlaps largely with that between channel types, feat uring an even distribution of professionalized\nchannels (associated with media industry, scientific institutions, popular science producers or advocacy\norganizations) and less professionalized or amateur content creators (from scientists, to \u201cpreppers,\u201d to\nvideo creators). Not surprisingly, professional news productions tended to rely on the anchor-based\nformat, while most user-generated contributions were single-voice videos. The separation between the\ntwo types of videos however, was far from clear cut, as amateur channels often employed content from\nprofessional news in their production and sometimes simply re-posted professional news content.\nAuthorship. Having a closer look at professional news producers, the channels in our list spanned from\nestablished news brands associated with traditional media organizations (such as CNN and the BBC), to\nsmall and medium sized news producers such as digitally native news brands (e.g., The Young Turks),\nindependent producers and nonprofits (e.g., Democracy Now), and alternative news producers (e.g., Red\nIce TV). The variation was even larger amongst user-led channels, which ranged from semi-professional\ninitiatives, which published videos regularly, featured a good quality of sound and video recording,\nemployed post-production editing and displayed a consistent format (e.g., ClimateAdam) to less curated\nclips featuring a mere voice recorded over a static image (e.g., Going South).\n \nVisibility of top ranking videos\nShifting from the feat ures of single videos to the dynamic ranking produced by the platform\u2019s search\nengine, Figure 1 provides an overview of the \u2018video space\u2019 generated on YouTube by the publication of\nSR15.

This pattern confirms Rieder, et al.\u2019s (2018) suggestion that\nYouTube\u2019s visibility cycle is characterized by higher levels of variation in times of increased attention (in\nour case, around the release of the report). A couple of weeks after the release of SR15, the upper half of\nthe ranking seemed to become relatively stable and in the final two weeks of the study only two new\nvideos entered the rankings.\nThere are asymmetries between actor types and opinions when it comes to their position in the search\nresults. Considering the color of lines in Figure 1, the top of the ranking appears to be dominated by\nprofessional and supportive sources (i.e., the light brown lines representing scientific institutions, news\nchannels, digital media producers and online education channels which endorse the report), with few user-\nled channels (i.e., the blue lines) and few videos expressing critical views (i.e., the darker lines) making it\nto the top positions. The only video containing skeptical views (number 30) that featured stably in the top\n10 of our corpus was an interview with the director of Power the Future, a fossil fuel advocacy\norganization, produced by the American right-wing television channel One America News Network [13].\nVideos from professional channels enjoyed more views, with an average number of views seven times\nhigher than amateur channels (167,435 against 1,169,449, see also Figure 5 below). For example, one of\nthe videos that enjoyed the highest stability in the top positions (stably occupying the first position from\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 9 / 2027 October on) was a video released by a YouTube popular science channel called Second Thought (with\naround 100,000 views when it entered the ranking and over 270,000 at the end of the study period). The\n10-minute-long video (number 26) started with ascertaining the authority of the IPCC (\u201cw hen the IPCC\nissues a report, the world knows that it is the real deal\u201d) and then moved to explaining the findings of the\nreport in greater detail drawing on the press release and the SPM .\nIn our case study, professional channels such as those of media and scientific institutions seemed to\nbenefit from higher visibility (especially if one considers that less professionalized video production relied\non these sources as well). Exceptions were videos number 17 and 18 (by the channels Going South and\nKristie Lu Stout), which reached the third position in the first week of our study and video number 28 by\nDave Borlace of the channel Just Have a T hink that reached the same position at the end of our period.\nThese three videos were very different, the first (number 17) was a video by a user from Greenland who\ncriticizes the IPCC fo r underestimating climate risks, the second was a mere republishing of a CN N\nprogram, while the last discussed various graphs contained in the SPM , but then moved to challenge its\noptimistic conclusions (\u201cthe reality is that the IPCC as piration [...] i s extremely unlikely to be achieved\u201d).\nThe IPCC Pr ess Conference (green line in Figure 1, number 24) was live-streamed on YouTube on 8\nOctober and its position in the search results ranking varies over our study period from position 17 on 21\nOctober, to the first place on 23 October. By the end of our study period the video had accumulated\n12,170 views, becoming the 17th most viewed video in our corpus.\nAs YouTube itself indicates, top ranked videos are not necessarily the most viewed ones. A video with less\nthan 100 views made it to the top 20 results (number 20). The video (by the Climate Deception Network,\nfeaturing Paul Beckworth) provided a preliminary analysis of some possible problems in SR15 and accused\nthe IPCC o f underestimating global warming by taking as a baseline for comparison the average\ntemperature of the second half of the nineteenth century (and not of the eighteenth century as previously\ndone). The video with the highest view count in our corpus (close to half a million) never made it over the\nsixteenth position in the ranking. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the video was not\nspecifically dedicated to the subject of our query. The clip by the news and opinion Web site Vox (number\n21) was a presentation of the U.S. position in climate change negotiations and it did not mention the IPCC\nreport specifically in its title or description. SR15 appeared only briefly towards the end of the clip.\n \nSalient themes in  top ranked videos\nThe videos varied in their length and complexity, from news reports that typically followed a three-frame\nnarrative format (presenting the current state of warming, climate impacts and solutions) and were based\nmainly on IPCC m aterial, to more complex commentaries which covered multiple themes and drew from\nmultiple sources.\n \n \nFigure 2: Network representation of relations between themes and videos. Themes are sized by the\nsum of views collected by the videos that feature them in our corpus and videos by the number of\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 10 / 20 y p y\nviews they obtain during our study period.\nNote: Lar ger version of Figure 2 available here.\n \nIn Figure 2, we display a bipartite network of the 40 videos of our corpus in connection to the themes that\nfeature in their narratives. Nodes representing the videos are colored according to whether they are\nissued by a professional (brown) or an amateur (blue) channel and their color is darker if they express\ncritical views towards the report either because they find it either too or not sufficiently alarmist (denialist\nvideos are marked with a red border). The size of the circles representing the videos is proportional to the\nnumber of views they collected during the period of this study. The size of the circles representing the\nthemes is proportional to the sum of views collected by the videos that feature eac h theme. The number\nof videos that feature eac h theme is indicated in the table under the caption. The network is spatialized\nusing a force directed algorithm that brings closer the nodes that are more directly or indirectly connected\n(Jacomy, et al., 2014).\nOverall, climate change was presented in videos through a catastrophic lens (Disaster and Impact \u2014 27\nvideos) requiring urgent and unprecedented actions (Policy Options and Solutions \u2014 29 videos). The\ncontestation of scientific evidence (Co ntested Science \u2014 13 videos) and the politicization of debates\n(Political and Ideological Struggle \u2014 17 videos) were also often discussed. The theme Settled Science (SS\n\u2014 12 videos), which underlined the scientific consensus about climate change, was also very present in\nour corpus. It was presented in the section dedicated to the IPCC c ommunication strategy.\nFigure 2 also reveals that, not surprisingly, \u201cPolitical and Ideological Struggles\u201d and \u201cContested Science\u201d\nfeatured more prominently in videos featuring critical views and particularly in those by amateur channels\n(hence the proximity of the relative nodes in the network). Examining the figure, it is also possible to see\nthat not all the videos marked as critical (darker nodes) were connected to the Contested Science theme.\nTwo videos in particular criticize the IPCC r eport for political reasons: number 23 claimed that climate\npolicies were in fact an excuse for global wealth redistribution and number 32 denounced the human-\ncentric vision of the climate debate (as opposed to a deep ecology approach).\nDisaster and Impacts (DI)\nDisaster and Impacts (DI) appeared in 27 videos of our corpus and seemed to be particularly popular in\nprofessional videos (16 out of 21) as compared to half of amateur clips (11 out of 19). The conclusions of\nSR15 are presented as a dire warning with impacts of climate change leading to potentially disastrous\nconsequences on people and ecosystems. A distinctive storyline emerged concerning the effec ts that could\nbe avoided by remaining within a 1.5\u00b0C of warming, in particular those impacts highlighted in the IPCC\npress release (on sea level rise, Arctic ice cover and coral reefs), but also increased droughts, floods and\nhurricanes. Some of the most prominent images included images of melting ice, floods and forest fires.\nWhen humans were involved, vulnerable communities and migrations were depicted.\nFigure 3 is a montage of images extracted from the videos of the Disaster and Impacts (DI) theme.\nImages have then been cropped using as borders a Voronoi diagram built on top of the network of videos\nand themes. Examining the pictures, clusters emerged and have been annotated to better illustrate\ndifferent typologies of images.\n \n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 1 1 / 20\n \nFigure 3: Montage of images related to disaster and impacts (DI) grouped by theme. The position\nof image clusters is based on co-occurrence in our corpus of videos.\nNote: Lar ger version of Figure 3 available here.\n \nTo substantiate this theme a w ide range of sources were mobilized, including IPCC p ress materials, but\nalso the report and its Summary for Policymakers (SPM ). Commentaries by influential media sources were\nalso discussed, from the Guardian (\u201cWe h ave 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, warns UN\u201d)\nand the New York Times (\u201cMajor Climate Report Describes a Strong Risk of Crisis as Early as 2040\u201d). A\nrecurrent translation of the conclusions of the report was that humanity has only 12 years to avoid\ncatastrophic climate change, referring to the aforementioned story published in the Guardian (Wat ts,\n2018).\nThis theme was especially prominent in the titles of the videos, which lured viewers\u2019 attention drawing on\na sense of alarm (e.g., \u201cNew climate change report issues stark warning\u201d, \u201cWh y we\u2019re heading for a\n\u2018climate catastrophe\u2019 \u2014 BBC Newsnight\u201d, \u201cWh y a Half Degree Rise in Global Temperature Would Be\nCatastrophic\u201d) and impending emergency (\u201cUN: Earth has 12 years to avert climate change catastrophe\u201d,\n\u201cMichael Mann: We Ar e Even Closer To Climate Disaster Than IPCC Pr edicts\u201d, \u201cLan dmark UN climate\nreport warns time quickly running out | Al Jazeera English\u201d) [14]. The language was affec tive and\nalarmist: the report offered \u201ca dire warning\u201d (video number 36), delivering \u201cmore bad news\u201d (number 36),\nand describing the potential \u201cirreversible damage to the planet\u201d (number 36), as \u201ctruly biblical\u201d (number\n26) and as \u201cvery scary stuff\u201d (number 26). Apocalyptic statements were also recurrent: \u201cthe date of\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 12 / 20complete destruction appears to be getting closer and closer\u201d (number 2), \u201cthe inevitable collapse of\nhuman civilization\u201d (number 32).\nFear-inducing representations of climate change such as the ones gathered under this theme are common\nin climate change communication, yet scholars have questioned their capability to engage the public\n(O\u2019Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009) and encouraged a shift towards more positive conceptions of action\n(Marshall, 2014; Nordhaus and Schellenberger, 2007).\nPolicy Options and Solutions (POS)\nWhile impacts have always been a common theme in the climate debate, mitigation and adaptation\noptions have been less prominently discussed in both traditional and new media. The closest frame\nidentified in previous studies revolved around the economic opportunities created by climate change (see\nNisbet, 2009; O\u2019Neill, et al., 2015; Shapiro and Park, 2015). The prevalence of discussions of Policy\nOptions and Solutions (POS) in our corpus was thus a novelty. Present in 29 videos, it was the most\nfrequent among the themes we surveyed in all types of media production but particularly in professional\nvideos, where it appeared in 17 clips out of 20.\nFollowing the completion of the Paris Agreement in 2015, this shift saw discussions of solutions\nincreasingly replacing debates about the reality and severity of climate change (De Pryck and Wanneau,\n2017). The fact that SR15 brought together for the first time the three IPCC Wo rking Groups, allowing the\ndiscussion, in a single document, of both the physical and political dimensions of climate change, may\nhave facilitated the prominence of this theme.\n \n \nFigure 4: Bipartite network graph of videos and mentioned actions and solutions. Solutions are\nsized by the number of videos that mention them and videos by their view count.\nNote: Lar ger version of Figure 4 available here.\n \nFigure 4 above represents a network of the most salient terms connected to policy options and solutions\nemployed in our corpus. Mitigation measures feature more prominently than adaptation ones and were\nwidely discussed both from the perspective of energy transition and of life-style changes. A highly cited\nstatement from SR15 [15] is that emissions need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 by 2030 reaching\nnet zero by 2050. Policy options to achieve such goal include a variety of mechanisms for cutting carbon\nemissions, such as carbon pricing, the shift to renewable energy and techniques of carbon dioxide removal\n(CDR), such as carbon capture and storage and afforestation. While most videos followed the language of\nthe report closely, the recourse to certain measures was also challenged (particularly carbon dioxide\nremoval and carbon pricing). For instance, the user-led channel CanadaPoli (number 35) used the release\nof the report as an occasion to challenge the introduction of a carbon tax in Canada and to question the\nscientific evidence underpinning the reality of climate change (by references to denialist sources).\nThe construction of this theme most commonly relied on the report, its authors and other communication\nmaterials (e.g., press release, statements and graphs, clips of IPCC o fficials making statements in the\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 13 / 20press conference). Other sources included news articles, interviews with experts, advocacy organizations\nand campaigners, politicians, and tweets from various sources. Many videos went beyond IPCC p ress\nmaterial to discuss individual and collective changes, including reduction in water consumption, adoption\nof plant-based diets and use of public transportation and electric vehicles. In user-led content productions,\ncalls for action in the face of a perceived indifference by policymakers were particularly salient. Suggested\nactions included activism, voting for candidates that favor climate action and putting pressure on\ngovernments to adopt more climate-friendly policies. As noted by David Doel (number 29), \u201csmart politics\nand activism is how we can actually collectively address the climate crisis\u201d.\nPolitical and Ideological Struggle (PIS)\nPresent in 17 videos in both professionalized and user-led content, this theme may co-occur with the\nframing of climate change as contested (see next section). Political or ideological debates over climate\nchange were discussed in reference to particular national contexts. For example, the video that was by far\nthe most viewed in our corpus (number 21) was a clip by Vox reviewing the ambivalent position of the\nU.S. on climate change over the past 12 years, ending with the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris\nAgreement. Several videos discussed this decision, President Trump\u2019s position on climate change and the\nrole of the fossil fuel industry in sustaining climate denial. Other recent political events that signaled\npossible internal struggles over climate policy included the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil as well as\npolitical interference in Australia and Saudi Arabia in favor of CO2 intensive industries. This theme\ngenerally followed presentations of the report\u2019s findings, as a discussion of political challenges to tackling\nclimate change and the limits of individual action. For instance, the educational channel Second Thought\n(number 26) argued that \u201cthat truth of the matter is that we are largely at the mercy of world\ngovernments. [...] Ev en if every single individual did their part, it is still a tiny step in the right direction\u201d.\nAnother way in which this theme materialized in our corpus was through conspiratorial narratives, staging\na conflict between the ideals of democracy and individual freedom, and the U.N. (including the IPCC). T he\nlatter were depicted as totalitarian, socialist or communist organizations plotting against democratic\nideals. In a video with a substantial number of views and conspiratorial tones (number 23), Mark Steyn\nportrayed climate policies as a threat to democracy and exposed the supposed ideological motives behind\nthe IPCC (an d in particular WG III former co-chair, Ottmar Edenhofer), namely the global redistribution of\nwealth. A similar narrative was developed in an alt-right channel video (number 9) which stages U.N.\nenvironmental work as a threat to individual freedom and a pretext to controlling society. Finally, the\nvideo by the pro-Trump channel One America News Network (number 30) was centered around a conflict\nopposing U.S. en ergy industry to its competitors abroad as well as to the \u201ccollectivist worldview\u201d\nincarnated by the U.N. and the IPCC.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, another conspiratorial narrative in our corpus presented the IPCC\nreport as a manifestation of human-centrism: an effort to save the human world in its current\nindustrialized form as opposed to saving the biosphere, in reference to the \u201cdeep ecology movement and\nphilosophy\u201d (number 32). The latter was positioned in response to what is termed \u201cshallow ecology\u201d and\ncalled for climate policy to be guided by \u201cprinciples of diversity, complexity, autonomy, decentralization,\nsymbiosis, egalitarianism, and classlessness\u201d [16].\nThis theme was often not explicitly sourced or referenced, and it cannot easily be traced back to specific\nsources. Rather, sources mentioned in the two previous themes were generally challenged in this theme.\nContested Scien ce (CS)\nFinally, the theme Contested Science (CS) w as present in 13 videos (seven by amateur channels and six\nby professional channels). Climate expertise was discussed from a variety of perspectives, including\nclimate denialists denouncing alleged manipulations in data but also scientists criticizing the report for\nunderestimating climatic impacts and the consequences of particular policies.\nContestation in this framing rarely addressed the anthropogenic nature of global warming or its threats.\nOnly three videos assumed this minority position (videos number 9, 30 and 35). The narrating voices in\nthese videos relied on well-known arguments portraying climate science as fraudulent or erroneous (in\nreference to Climategate, the Hockey Stick controversy and ClimateGate 2.0). In their view, climate\nscience should not be trusted and should not serve as a basis to justify increased climate action. In the\ncontext of the release of SR15, they emphasized that scientists have been predicting disastrous impacts\nfor many years (as suggested by the title of video number 9: \u201cNew IPCC R eport: Catastrophic Global\nWarming, We O nly Have 12 Years (Again!)\u201d). To construct this narrative the videos relied on a number of\ndifferent sources, from representatives of pro-energy groups, to videos featuring known climate deniers\nsuch as Anthony Watts and Richard Lindzen as well as posts from climate skeptical blogs such as\nwattsupwiththat.com and joannenova.com.au.\nAll other videos featuring this theme presented subtler or more interesting critiques. For example, several\ninterviewees challenged the report for underestimating the amount of warming that the planet has already\nexperienced (videos number 6, 14 and 20) by, e.g., omitting some climate feed back mechanisms and the\nrole of methane (videos number 15 and 38). As the debate about solutions took center stage, many\ncommentators also questioned the feas ibility of the transition that awaits society (\u201cwhen it comes to what\nwe have to do about it, [...] [t he IPCC] r uns scared of being really honest\u201d, video number 15) and, in\nparticular, of the desirability and feasibility of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as one of the most prominent\ntechnologies discussed in the report (\u201cResearch into developing it has been riddled with controversy, [...].\nThe bottom line is that we are basing our collective future safety on this planet on pure science fiction\u201d,\nvideo number 38).\n \n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 14 / 20\n \nFigure 5: Rank flow chart of top 20 daily results over the studied period. The size of the flows is\nproportional to the number of views collected by each video during the period of our study. Clips\nthat challenge the IPCC o r its report are highlighted with darker colors (dark brown for professional\nvideo and dark blue for amateur videos).\nNote: Lar ger version of Figure 5 available here.\n \nThe number of videos expressing perspectives that question or challenge aspects of the report remained\nstable over the period of this study, ranging between four and six days. Few videos made it to the top of\nthe ranking and did not trigger high numbers of views. A notable exception in terms of ranking was the\nvideo produced by One America News Network (number 30), released on 19 October, which challenged\nthe validity of the report and the financial interests of the IPCC. I t entered the ranking on 30 October and\nmaintained a stable presence at the top of the list until the end of our study period, although its view\ncount remained low (2.602 on 18 November 2018). The video challenging the scientific evidence of the\nreport with the highest number of views in our corpus (more than 19.000) was the video by alt-right\nchannel Red Ice TV (number 9).\n \nConclusion\nThis article contributes to the understanding of the role of social media in the climate debate by examining\nhow the IPCC Sp ecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR15) was covered in YouTube videos. Our\narticle makes a number of contributions.\nFirst, while research into climate change and social media has so far been biased towards Twitter and\nlimited to textual content, in this study we employed multimodal analysis, visual and quali-quantitative\nmethods to examine media activity associated with the SR15 report on YouTube. Sec ondly, analysis of the\ncontent of the videos was complemented with an analysis of the channels that populate the top of the\nranking and their fluctuating visibility in YouTube\u2019s search engine rankings. Thirdly, we provided a detailed\ndescription of the communication strategy of the IPCC an d explored how it is reverberated (or challenged)\nin our corpus.\nIn agreement with previous research on climate debate and social media, our investigation of YouTube\u2019s\nmost visible videos revealed an extremely heterogeneous landscape composed of clips which differ widely\nin format, length and quality, ranging from well-curated collages of video footage and expert interviews by\nprofessional content producers, to videos shot with simple webcams or phone cameras. The producers of\nthese videos were equally diverse, ranging from traditional media companies (such as CNN and BCC) an d\nscientific institutions (such as IPCC an d the Australian Academy of Science), to digitally native producers\n(such as Seeker and Second Thought) and amateur vloggers (such as Jamarl Thomas and Just Have a\nThink).\n31/01/2020 Bounegru\nhttps://\ufb01rstmonday .or g/ojs/index.php/fm/rt/printerFriendly/101 12/8332 15 / 20This does not mean a complete parity between professional and amateur channels. Professional channels\nwere more stable and present in the highest positions in search ranking (especially after the media\nactivity prompted by the SR15 release had cooled down and search ranking stabilized) and tended to\nattract more views. They were also referenced as authoritative sources by less professionalized content\nproducers. The IPCC itself, thanks to a carefully orchestrated communication strategy, succeeded in\ngaining high visibility on YouTube (both in terms of ranking and number of views) and in setting the tone\nfor discussion. On the other hand, the most original and in-depth engagements with the report were often\nfound in productions on amateur channels, which took more time to develop an analysis of SR15, often\ndeparting significantly from the official line established by the IPCC. I nterestingly, we did not find any clips\nby established environmental NGOs in the top positions of YouTube\u2019s search ranking (unlike debates\nprompted by previous IPCC r eports on Twitter, where they featured prominently).\nAlongside the usual framing of climate change as a disastrous phenomenon, our analysis of the 2018 IPCC\nSpecial Report pointed to the emergence of a lively discussion about political and technical solutions as\nwell as about ideological struggles, to a much larger extent than observed in previous studies. In spite of\nYouTube\u2019s efforts to curb misinformation, a few  denialist videos still appeared. Interestingly, however,\nthey were less visible than the opinions of experts who criticized the report for underestimating climate\neffects and for overestimating the efficacy of some proposed solutions (CDR in particular).\nFuture investigations could extend the thematic analysis and the question of visibility (in terms of views\nand search ranking) to investigate other features through which the platform organizes content, such as\nvideo and channel recommendations, as well as the way in which YouTube videos circulate and are\nembedded in other online spaces.\nFinally and perhaps most importantly, the particular prominence of climate solutions and actions detected\nin our corpus demands further study. While the solutionist discourse observed in our corpus is still closely\ndependent on scientific notions conveyed by the IPCC r eport, following Jasanoff\u2019s (2010) sensibility\ntowards \u201cembedded experience\u201d, we encourage exploration of the role of social platforms in mediating the\narticulation of more participatory responses and possible solutions, as well as being mindful of the\nalgorithmic mediation and economic logics of these platforms and devices. \n \nAbout the authors\nLiliana Bounegru is Lecturer in Digital Methods at King\u2019s College London.

The participants were 30 undergraduate students enrolled in a course called \u201cNumbers and Social Justice.\u201d The study used argument analysis (Toulmin, 2003) and ethnographic methodology to examine students\u2019 written work in a naturalistic setting. Course lessons and assignments used open-ended tasks focused on socio-political issues using real data from newspapers, media outlets, or social media (Engledowl & Weiland, 2021; Weiland, 2019). Recordings of class meetings (on zoom) and students\u2019 written work were used to explore the following questions: 1) How did students respond in writing to a news article with statistical claims, data, and visual representations of data? 2) What arguments did students write? When students made arguments, what types of arguments did they make? 3) What statistical literacy practices did students use? 3a) Did these change over time and with the opportunity to revise for four focal students? Analysis of students\u2019 essays provided evidence that asset-based instruction centered on statistical practices can support students from non-STEM majors in learning to critically analyze data-based claims. Both the course design and analysis used an asset perspective of students, a perspective that is important for documenting the strengths of learners from non-dominant communities. Analysis documented students from non-STEM majors using data in arguments, \n ix participating in statistical literacy practices, and generating and refining their written arguments about data in a news article. The study shows that students who previously felt marginalized from mathematics learned to use statistical practices through instruction that used social justice topics, focused on goals, and provided opportunities to write and revise. Analysis uncovered the need for students to notice goals, highlighted how goals are central for revising arguments, and organized lists of statistics skills into clusters based on inferred goals for students' statistical literacy practices. The study has implications for supporting students in learning to construct stronger arguments about data. In particular, the study shows that writing and revising can provide opportunities for students to slow down, help teachers to notice students\u2019 strengths and offer feedback focused on goals, and may support students in improving their arguments.  \n x Acknowledgments & Dedication  When I was an undergrad, I read an essay that I\u2019ve never forgotten. The author wrote, \u201cThe [person] who makes a vow makes an appointment with [them]self at some distant time and place. The danger of it is that [them]self should not keep the appointment,\u201d (Chesterton, 2015, p.16). There are many people who have helped me keep this rash vow of completing a PhD, and to them I owe much gratitude.  Thank you, Dr. Moschkovich, for your unwavering commitment to seeing the strengths in students, including the one who insisted on debating every point. Thank you for making me keep writing and rewriting, thinking and rethinking.  Thank you, Sal and Brittany, for leading the way and proving it\u2019s possible. And thank you to all my fellow PhD students who inspired me and encouraged me to keep going. Thank you to my committee, Dr. Judy Scott, Dr. Katie Makar, and Dr. Dave Wagner, for your thoughtful feedback. Your ideas are all here in the final version. Thank you for making it better.  Thank you, Dr. Andrea Steiner, for creating Numbers and Social Justice, for uncovering the hidden curriculum of academia, and for so much more.  To the Ladies Brain Trust, you have sustained me over the years. Thank you for knowing and loving me, for inspiring me, and for sharing your lives with me. Thank you for teaching me how to teach for justice. And thank you for wine and olives! \n xi To Tom, Goldberry, Joey, and Lev Vygotsky, you didn\u2019t really help me write this, but you insisted on regular walks on the beach and for that I am grateful.  And to the original Lev, thanks for seeing the potential in your students and showing generations of teachers how to do the same.  There are no words that will do justice to the gratitude I have for Jim and Debbie. You loved me before I took my first breath and never stopped. I will never stop trying to be worthy of the gifts you have given me.  This work is dedicated to Val\u00e9ria, who is smarter, stronger, prettier, cooler, wiser, and funnier than me. No hay palabras para expresar mi amor. Thank you for defending me against the monsters in and out of my head, for listening and talking and learning together, for hikes and paddles and drives, for making a family together, and for reminding me it\u2019s not a competition.         \n 1 Chapter 1: Statement of the Problem Contemporary life is marked by an abundance of statistical information. The COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing occurrence of climate catastrophes reminds us that people must critically examine statistical information to assess risk and make decisions that impact them, their communities, and the planet. News media, advertising, and social media companies make use of data in increasingly sophisticated \u2013 and sometimes unscrupulous \u2013 ways to persuade their audiences (Engledowl & Weiland, 2021; Shaughnessy, 2007). Moreover, government policies are debated using data, with both sides presenting evidence to support their position. It is therefore a democratic imperative for people to understand and interrogate these data, how they are represented, and the conclusions that are inferred from them. Indeed, Cobb (1999) cautioned that a lack of conceptual understanding in statistics may result in \u201cde facto disenfranchisement\u201d (p. 38). One needs at least some familiarity with the rules of a system to participate in it, and numerical evidence can be intimidating and mystifying to the uninitiated.  It is perhaps unsurprising that many students accept statistical claims presented in text without critical analysis (Watson & Moritz, 1997). The absence of norms for critiquing statistical claims and, perhaps, the knowledge to do so has unpropitious implications for society. This has critical significance for marginalized communities and their allies for whom statistical literacy is one tool to combat and correct systemic injustice. All this creates a pressing need for students to develop \n 2 statistical literacy, not just use statistical formulas and vocabulary, but understand the concepts and larger social context that give statistics meaning. Even before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, before people across the globe were inundated with daily updates to data and graphs, the interpretation of which seemed to have life-or-death consequences (Watson & Callingham, 2020), statistics educators and researchers were predicting a future in which every person would need statistical literacy (Gal, 2003; Wallman, 1993). Historically, statistics curricula have focused on descriptive statistics and the precise execution of procedures, and that has contributed to a lack of conceptual understanding and inferential reasoning amongst students (Cobb, 2007; Harradine, Batanero, & Rossman, 2011). Despite increased attention to statistical literacy in the research literature and in various national curricula (e.g., The Common Core State Standards and the California Mathematics Framework in the US, Ethiopia\u2019s move to incorporate statistics in K\u201312 classrooms, and Australia\u2019s 2013 national curriculum) there continues to be great variation in how statistical literacy is taught in schools (ProCivicStat Partners, 2018; Zieffler, Garfield, & Fry, 2018).  Research literature provides descriptions of statistical literacy with lists of knowledge, skills, and dispositions that students need to make sense of and critique data in our world (e.g., Gal, 2002; Ridgway et al., 2018). While it is useful to identify these concepts and skills, there is a danger that these lists may be used in classrooms in disconnected ways that leave students with the impression that statistics is merely a set of procedures they don\u2019t really understand (Bakker & Derry, 2011). There is also \n 3 a danger that researchers and educators reduce statistical literacy to procedural fluency or basic skills (Gal, 2018). There is a need to describe what statistical literacy looks like in action. In this dissertation, I propose mathematical practices1 as a sociocultural framework for conceptualizing statistical literacy. This framework considers not only students\u2019 use of strategies and concepts, but their goals in doing so. Conceptualizing statistical literacy as practices can help organize the lists of knowledge, skills, and dispositions in the research literature into clusters of practices based on the goals of students\u2019 activity. By focusing on students\u2019 goals, we can highlight that statistical literacy is more than a collection of skills and concepts. A focus on goals also emphasizes that it is the using of these skills and concepts in service of particular goals that is most important for the literate use of these skills and concepts.   Dissertation Overview  This dissertation describes how students from non-STEM majors enrolled in an undergraduate course on statistical reasoning used statistical literacy practices to make sense of and critique news articles containing data, data visualizations, and data-based claims. The study connected two areas of research: mathematical practices and statistical literacy. First, the research on mathematical practices illuminates how goals, mathematical concepts, and strategies are intertwined when using mathematical practices. This view does not seek to separate out or reify these various aspects, rather  1 The phrase mathematical practices as used here does not refer to the Common Core State Standards in the United States. Mathematical practices documented in research are broader, more specific, and more connected to concepts than those standards. \n 4 it emphasizes how they are interconnected and situated in particular contexts. Second, the research on statistical literacy offers a comprehensive summary of the plethora of facts, skills, and dispositions that a statistically literate person commands.   I conducted the study in this particular course because the students enrolled did not have strong backgrounds in mathematics or statistics. This required that instruction focus on meaning\u2013making (as opposed to memorization of facts or procedures). I had been the Teaching Assistant for the course for six years, and the instructor and I had collaborated in that time to design lessons that promoted student participation, discussion, and a focus on the goals of using statistical literacy practices.   The study focused on the students\u2019 three written essays that they completed throughout the course. For the first essay, they selected a news article and analyzed the data presented. They received written feedback from me and either revised that first essay or selected a new article and wrote a second essay. For the third and final essay the students were all presented with the same article to respond to. The study was guided by the following research questions:  1. How did students respond in writing to a news article with statistical claims, data, and visual representations of data?  2. What arguments did students write? When students made arguments, what types of arguments did they make? 3. What statistical literacy practices did students use?  \n 5 a. Did these change over time and with the opportunity to revise for four focal students?  In the chapters that follow, I elaborate a conceptual framework (Chapter 2), describe the method for analysis (Chapter 3), provide an ethnographic description of the course (Chapter 4), present findings (Chapters 5 and 6), and discuss these findings and their implications. In Chapter 2, I describe mathematical practices and statistical literacy, arguing for viewing statistical literacy through the lens of mathematical practices. In Chapter 3, I describe the setting and participants and methods of data collection and analysis. In Chapter 4, I describe the course in detail, elaborating on lessons and assignments. In Chapter 5, I share findings in response to all but the final research question (3a). In that chapter I document how students responded to the news articles, what concepts, strategies, and goals they used, and the types of arguments they crafted. I also describe how they used two statistical literacy practices: Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality. In Chapter 6, I show how feedback and the opportunity for revision impacted students\u2019 arguments and their use of statistical literacy practices. Finally, in Chapter 7, I provide a summary of these findings, and consider contributions and implications for research and teaching.      \n 6 Chapter 2: Conceptual Framing and Summary of the Literature  This study is grounded in sociocultural views of learning and engages bodies of literature on two topics: mathematical practices and statistical literacy. In this chapter, I summarize the theories and findings from these bodies of research to frame the study and provide a rationale for the methodological choices discussed in Chapter 3 and the course design described in Chapter 4. I argue that viewing statistical literacy through the lens of mathematical practices provides an important perspective on the teaching and learning of statistical literacy that centers students\u2019 strengths.  The research on mathematical practices and statistical literacy are related in important ways. Research on mathematical practices provides a theoretical framework to explore and describe statistical literacy as socially situated, goal oriented, and mutually constructed (Moschkovich, 2013). From this view, everyday knowledge and language are seen as tools for developing conceptual understanding and using mathematical practices. Research on statistical literacy was born out of observations that data had begun to appear in people\u2019s everyday lives. There was a need for people to \u201cunderstand and critically evaluate statistical results that permeate our daily lives,\u201d (Wallman, 1993, p. 1). Both fields point to the need to examine people\u2019s use of mathematical concepts, strategies, and practices to make sense of and make decisions about mathematics in our everyday lives. Furthermore, framing statistical literacy as mathematical practices has important implications for equity because this view highlights the varied ways people can and do participate in \n 7 practices rather than describing hierarchies or lists of competencies that can result in atomistic or deficit-oriented instruction.  Theoretical Framing for the Study This study is grounded in a sociocultural view of learning (Vygotsky, 1986) which assumes that mathematical concepts are learned within a social context (Forman, 1996). Mathematical learning is situated in the sociohistorical and cultural settings in which it occurs. Students and teachers each bring perspectives, prior knowledge, and learned norms, and these evolve in each particular classroom, between each particular teacher and group of students. Drawing on this sociocultural frame, I use a definition of learning as participation in a community of practice (Forman, 1996; Lave & Wenger,1991). Teachers communicate the norms, values, practices, and content of the discipline to the students who engage in meaningful participation in these practices.  Mathematical Practices  Mathematical practices are \u201cthe taken-as-shared ways of reasoning, arguing, and symbolizing established while discussing particular mathematical ideas,\u201d (Cobb, 1999, p. 9). One might think of mathematical practices as the socio-cultural practices people learn to use that involve mathematical thinking and reasoning or the ways people interact with quantities, data, or mathematical representations. They are how \u201cwe\u201d\u2014 people who have learned to use mathematics \u2014 use mathematical concepts to make sense of and impact our worlds. Consistent with a sociocultural perspective, these practices originate in social interaction. Humans use tools (e.g., mathematical \n 8 concepts, language, procedures) in a variety of practices to solve problems in their environment (Vygotsky, 1986). Practices \u201care first constructed interpersonally and then appropriated to become part of the repertoire of practices that an individual will use,\u201d (Moschkovich, 2013, p. 264-265).  There is no monolithic set of mathematical practices; indeed, mathematical practices are specific to both the sociohistorical context in which they occur and to particular mathematical ideas (Cobb, 1999; Moschkovich, 2013). Following a Vygotskian view, I assume goals are central to mathematical practices. Based on these data, I analyze practices as including goals, mathematical concepts, and strategies. Mathematical practices include a goal (Why am I doing this?), strategies (How can I do it?), and canonical ideas (What mathematical concepts are important to use?).  Simply reminding students to use a mathematical practice or describing it to them is not sufficient social interaction for learning how to participate in a mathematical practice. Mathematical practices require students to be active in participating, perhaps at times as legitimate peripheral participants (Lave & Wenger,1991), in joint activity with shared goals and focus of attention (Moschkovich, 2013). Through these interactions, participants develop shared meanings for language, artifacts, tools, and concepts, and move toward increasingly competent participation in mathematical practices. Viewing statistical literacy as a set of practices has important implications for equity in the classroom. Moschkovich (2013) cautions against dichotomizing \n 9 everyday practices and classroom mathematical practices. Because classrooms are places where multiple practices meet, everyday practices can be viewed \u201cas resources to build on in order to engage students in the formal mathematical practices taught in classrooms,\u201d (Moschkovich, 2013, p. 269). Indeed, viewing mathematics this way rejects the false dichotomy of everyday and academic language and practices and moves beyond the expert-novice binary. Students can use all their resources (e.g., linguistic, experiential, material) in service of solving problems, making meaning, and questioning data.  Consistent with the sociocultural view, I used an ethnographic stance in the design of this dissertation (Moschkovich & Brenner, 2000); the research was conducted in a naturalistic setting and meanings were assumed to be socially constructed in context and negotiated between multiple points of view. I adopted a strengths-based approach (Huitzilopochtli, et al, 2021) in which I sought to notice and document the strengths students brought to the classroom and recognize statistical literacy practices in what students said and wrote. This contrasts with a deficit perspective that, \u201csuggests that one\u2019s own way of speaking or thinking is superior,\u201d (Wagner et al., 2015, p. 247). This dissertation is not concerned with prescribed trajectories of learning or hierarchies of competence. Instead, this study documents the ways students appropriated practices introduced in class and used these to make sense of and critique real-world data, data visualizations, and data-based claims in news articles.  \n 10 Conceptualizing Statistical Literacy as Practices  In this section I describe how conceptualizing statistical literacy as mathematical practices is beneficial for researchers and educators. Instead of attempting to describe or teach a comprehensive list of all the facts, skills, beliefs that work together in intricate ways in the mind of a hypothetical, statistically literate person, focusing on mathematical practices centers the sociohistorical context (of both the student and the data) and the goals, concepts, and strategies in use. Indeed Gal (2002) comes close to describing statistical literacy as practices when he writes about \u201cgoal-oriented behavior\u201d and the \u201cbroad clusters\u201d of ideas that comprise statistical literacy.  Along these lines, statistical literacy may be understood by some to denote a minimal (perhaps formal) knowledge of basic statistical concepts and procedures. Yet increasingly, the term literacy, when used as a part of the description of people\u2019s capacity for goal-oriented behavior in a specific domain, suggests a broad cluster not only of factual knowledge and certain formal and informal skills, but also of desired beliefs, habits of mind, or attitudes, as well as general awareness and a critical perspective. (p. 2)  Statistical literacy practices can be thought of as the use of mathematical and statistics concepts and strategies in service of a goal. This focus on mathematical practices has important implications for equity and high-quality statistical literacy instruction.   One benefit of this approach is that mathematical and statistics concepts are best learned with meaning by using them for authentic purposes. Like mathematics education in general, statistics education has traditionally focused on facts, skills, and procedures in isolation. Bakker and Derry (2011) argued that textbooks generally present topics separately as if to create a \u201ctoolkit\u201d of statistical tools (e.g., means, box \n 11 plots, t-tests). This resulted in inert knowledge. Inert knowledge refers to the fact that students are often taught in such a way that they can perform a procedure (e.g., calculating the mean) but they do not use that knowledge to solve problems. Furthermore, this style of instruction is especially prevalent in classrooms with students from minoritized communities (NASEM, 2018). Such instruction reifies what counts as statistics and who is capable of doing statistics (Martin, 2009). Success in such courses becomes about obedience to procedures instead of using concepts to make sense of or affect one\u2019s world. By focusing on mathematical practices, concepts and skills are framed as a part of a repertoire of practices. Learning in a community of practice is goal-oriented by nature \u2014 learners are participating in the service of some purpose that the community shares. This is consistent with a strengths-based view of students; each is positioned as a legitimate peripheral participant with knowledge, skills, and beliefs that can be leveraged for participation.  A Note about Context             By context, statistics education researchers are generally referring to the particular problem situation being studied, what Pfannkuch (2011) calls the data-context. For example, imagine a teacher gives their students a data table displaying heights for a sample of 25 individuals. Without knowledge of the data-context, the numbers have little significance and not much can be inferred from them. Whether the data were drawn from a population of middle school students or professional basketball players makes a difference to the conclusions students might draw. Or \n 12 consider a more complex example of data representing catalyzing reasons for homelessness. Perhaps knowing that people without shelter are hard to find and survey might make one cautious about the generalizability of conclusions considering possible bias in a sample. Data from people living in homeless shelters might differ from those of people sleeping in parks in systematic and meaningful ways. This knowledge of the situation from which the data come is what statistics education researchers mean by context. Conceptions of context as the problem situation may be limited in scope when compared to that suggested by other mathematics education researchers (e.g., Forman, 1996; Lampert & Cobb, 2003; Moschkovich, 2002). Moschkovich and Brenner (2000) draw on Lave to describe the learning context as situated in a broader social and cultural milieu. They describe it as the relationship between the setting and the participants\u2019 various interpretations of the setting.  \u201cLearning, thinking, and knowing are relations among people engaged in, with, and arising from the socially and culturally structured world,\u201d (Lave, 1991, p. 67, author\u2019s emphasis). Pfannkuch (2011) references the learning-experience-context, which includes the historical and social contexts of students, yet primarily refers to their prior learning experiences and interactions with the teacher. This study builds on other studies in statistics education (Weiland, 2017; Zapata-Cardona, 2018) by embracing a broad conception of context in which students are assumed to be critical actors whose development and use of statistical literacy is informed by, and informs, the larger world. \n 13 Statistical Literacy  In this section, I review definitions of statistical literacy and its core components. I define statistical literacy as how people make sense of and critically analyze data, data visualizations, and data-based claims encountered in everyday life (Gal, 2002; ProCivicStat Partners, 2018; Watson & Callingham, 2003; Weiland, 2017). I then describe research that has sought to describe statistical literacy. I conclude by reviewing pedagogical recommendations for promoting statistical literacy.  With some exceptions (e.g., Ben-Zvi & Garfield, 2004; Weiland, 2017) statistical literacy has been conceived of from a receptive, rather than productive, perspective. That is to say, statistical literacy concerns reading, interpreting, and critically questioning data, data visualizations, and data-based claims authored by others. From this perspective, statistical literacy is not so much concerned with the production of statistical questions, the design of studies, nor the collection, analysis, and presentation of data (Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999). That is not to suggest that these are not important aspects of statistical thinking and reasoning that may inform one\u2019s statistical literacy, only that statistical literacy largely focuses on the receptive, not productive, aspects of using statistics. Indeed, the reading of others\u2019 statistical investigations differs from empirical investigation of data in important ways (Gal, 2002). For example, \u201cmessages aimed at citizens may be shaped by political, commercial, or other agendas,\u201d (Gal, 2002, p. 15), and unpacking these messages may require an understanding of the relevant statistical concepts, the underlying \n 14 social context, and the bias of the author(s). Statistical literacy does not require expert-level knowledge of statistics; rather it requires enough understanding of statistical ideas and practices to be able to use them in reasoning critically about claims, predictions, and social policies.  Furthermore, many more people receive data-based messages than create them. Thus, I primarily adopt Gal\u2019s (2002) definition of statistical literacy as the ability to interpret and critically evaluate data, data visualizations, and data-based claims and the ability to communicate one\u2019s reactions, reasoning, or concerns about these. Though Gal (2002) uses the term \u201cabilities,\u201d he emphasizes that \u201cstatistical literacy should be regarded as a set of capacities that can exist to different degrees within the same individual, depending on the contexts where it is invoked or applied,\u201d (Gal, 2002, p. 15). This is an essential aspect of my conceptualization of statistical literacy and later in this chapter I elaborate why I frame statistical literacy not as practices rather than abilities. The research literature has conceptualized statistical literacy as what people need to know and believe given observations that statistics permeate modern life and people must be able to interpret and critically evaluate these. Most discussions of statistical literacy, including this dissertation, begin with a statement about the ubiquity of data in everyday life. Official statistics are produced by public institutions, interest groups, and university researchers, but these are disseminated to the public via a variety of channels including news articles, podcasts, social media posts, and television, each of which may present only aspects of the original studies that promote their point of view (ProCivicStat Partners, 2018). The interpretative \n 15 demands of the variety of data-based messages has not been fully cataloged, but some research points to the prevalence of quantities expressed as percentages in popular adult texts (Joram, Resnick & Gabriele, 1995) and the need for proportional reasoning, the diverse and sometimes interactive visual representations that have become commonplace (ProCivicStat Partners, 2018), the sudden appearance of uncertainty in predictions that accompanied COVID-19 reporting (Gal & Geiger, 2022; Watson & Callingham, 2020), and the prevalence of malicious actors who seek to spread misinformation (Weiland, 2019).   Gal (2002) described statistical literacy as  an action-oriented set of interrelated knowledge bases and skills, one which people will actually use in everyday contexts, [which] must consider people's inclination to apply a critical stance and the motivations, beliefs, and attitudes that affect or support statistically literate behavior. (p. 23)   This model of statistical literacy (see Figure 1) is therefore composed of what Gal described as \u201cknowledge elements\u201d and \u201cdispositional elements\u201d which are mutually supportive, dynamic, and context dependent.  Literacy refers to one\u2019s ability to decipher the complex prose that often accompanies data-based claims. Statistical knowledge is characterized by five elements: knowing why data are needed and produced, a familiarity with vocabulary and concepts related to descriptive statistics, a familiarity with vocabulary and concepts related to visual displays of data, an understanding of probability, and knowing how statistical inferences are made. Gal highlights proportional reasoning as a particularly important aspect of the mathematical knowledge base. Finally, context \n 16 knowledge refers to the details of data collection and how various methods influence validity. These knowledge bases combined with a belief that statistics can provide valuable insights about the world and a critical stance comprise Gal\u2019s (2002) model of statistical literacy.   Figure 1 Gal\u2019s (2002) Model of Statistical Literacy \n Building on this work, Ridgway, Nicholson, Gal, and Ridgway (2018) outlined eleven facets of statistical literacy for civic engagement: 1) An analysis of the social impact of evidence-based policies needs to accompany statistical analyses. 2) Evidence must be critically evaluated to identify possible biases. 3) People need to have a positive disposition towards \u201cfact-checking\u201d rather than adopting an attitude of \u201cstatistics is all lies\u201d or, conversely, \u201cthe experts know what\u2019s true\u201d. 4) The role of probability and conditional probability in assessing risk must be understood. 5) An understanding of the strengths and limits of various models and 6) methodologies is also essential. 7) People need some understanding of how official statistics (e.g., the unemployment rate) are calculated. 8) Basic contextual facts, such as reasonable estimates of population sizes, are necessary for making decisions based on data. 9) \n\n 17 Basic information and computing technology skills are also needed to manipulate the large amounts of unstructured data that are increasingly available. 10) Basic quantitative skills (e.g., number sense, fractions/percents, ratios) are essential for making sense of published data. And 11) people need to have the literacy skills to unpack statistical messages communicated in text. The breadth of these facets suggests a need for integrated instruction based on real-world statistics in settings that are known to students. Weiland (2017) built on the work of the scholars above to describe critical statistical literacy as \u201creading\u201d and \u201cwriting the world\u201d (Freire, 1970; Gutstein, 2006) with statistics. Unlike most models of statistical literacy, he considers both the production and interpretation of data. He proposes eight elements: four related to reading the world with statistics and four related to writing the world. This study focuses on the reading aspects of his framework because the students in this course were asked to respond to data, visual representations of data, and statistical claims presented to them, rather than conducting their own statistical analyses.  The first of these critical statistical literacy elements is \u201cmaking sense of language and statistical symbol systems and critiquing statistical information and data-based arguments encountered in diverse contexts to gain an awareness of sociopolitical issues in society,\u201d (Weiland, 2017, p. 41). This first element encompasses much of what other scholars (Budgett & Pfannkuch, 2010; Gal, 2002; Ridgway, Nicholson, Gal, & Ridgway, 2018; Watson 2003) have described as statistical literacy. This includes general literacy skills, knowledge of statistical terms \n 18 and concepts, quantitative reasoning (especially proportional reasoning), context knowledge, and critical thinking. This component also includes beliefs and attitudes such as a questioning disposition and the belief that statistics are useful, and one can understand them.  The second component is \u201cidentifying and interrogating social structures which shape and are reinforced by the data-based arguments being considered,\u201d (Weiland, 2017, p. 41). This is related to an expanded view of context which highlights how knowledge is situated and produced (and re-produced) by persons engaged in activity in a community of practice that is itself situated in larger societal structures. The third component further complicates the role of context in critical statistical literacy; it is considering \u201cone\u2019s social location, subjectivity, political context, and having a sociohistorical and political knowledge of self and understanding how it influences one\u2019s interpretation of information,\u201d (Weiland, 2017, p. 41). When framed as a practice, this means that students might reference their own positionality when writing and talking about statistics.  Finally, critically statistically literate actors \u201cevaluate the source, collection, and reporting of statistical information and how they are influenced and shaped by the author\u2019s social position and sociopolitical and historical lens,\u201d (Weiland, 2017, p. 41). Gal (2002) also touches on this idea when discussing literacy in general, as do Joram, Resnick, & Gabriele (1995) in their investigation of the kinds of numbers that appear in magazines and other everyday texts. Readers of statistics in the world must make sense of statistical information presented alongside modifying words (e.g., a \n 19 \u201cshocking\u201d 50% increase). Weiland (2017) extends these considerations to include the need to consider the author\u2019s positionality when making sense of statistical information. Overall, this body of research takes as its starting point the landscape of data, visual representations of data, and data-based claims in the media and describes what people need to know, do, think, and believe in order to make sense of and critically analyze these messages. This study builds on these definitions and descriptions, focusing on goals and framing student activity as practices.  Pedagogical recommendations  In this section I describe the recommendations from the literature for promoting statistical literacy in the classroom. Overall, recommendations are aligned with a mathematical practices framing. For example, instructors are encouraged to use real (and not merely realistic) data (Ben-Zvi & Garfield, 2004; California Mathematics Framework, 2023), especially that data which is based on social examples (Engledowl & Weiland, 2021; ProCivicStat Partners, 2018; Watson & Callingham, 2020; Weiland, 2019;). Active learning is recommended (Ben-Zvi & Garfield, 2004), and instructors should provide alternative assessment methods in order to better understand and document student learning. The use of discussions around investigations into real-world social phenomena helps instructors avoid atomistic teaching (Bakker & Derry, 2011). Because instruction is based on real social data, teachers should be prepared to facilitate educational discussions around controversial topics. \u201cTeachers need to be mindful of the experiences of their students \n 20 because some contexts have painful connotations for some students. Context is not value-free and teachers must recognise this fact and be aware of the range of opinions that may emerge,\u201d (Watson & Callingham, 2020, p. 20). Essentially, these recommendations urge instructors to make the teaching of statistical literacy meaningful by engaging students in making sense of the world through data. In Chapter 4, I describe how we used these recommendations in the design of the course.   \n 21 Chapter 3: Methodology The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore students\u2019 use of statistical literacy practices in an undergraduate course that focused on statistical literacy and social justice. As described in Chapter 2, statistical literacy has been theorized as what everyday people need to know, think, and believe in order to critically examine the plethora of data and data-based arguments that permeate nearly every aspect of modern life (Budgett & Pfannkuch, 2010; Gal, 2002; Ridgway, Nicholson, Gal, & Ridgway, 2018; Watson 2003; Weiland, 2017). This study built on that work to document how undergraduate students from non-STEM majors wrote about data, visual representations of data, and statistical claims in news articles. The research questions that guided this study are:  1. How did students respond in writing to a news article with statistical claims, data, and visual representations of data?  2. What arguments did students write? When students made arguments, what types of arguments did they make? 3. What statistical literacy practices did students use?  a. Did these change over time and with the opportunity to revise for 4 focal students? Study Design I adopted a naturalistic methodology and an ethnographic stance (Moschkovich, 2019; Moschkovich & Brenner, 2000) in the design of the study. A naturalistic methodology is not a collection of investigative or analytic techniques, \n 22 rather it is defined by a theoretical stance and a set of principles. Theoretically, the study is informed by a sociocultural view of learning (Vygotsky, 1986) which assumes that mathematics is learned within a social context (Forman, 1996). The first principle in a naturalistic methodology is to consider multiple viewpoints. Rather than thinking of learners as novices in pursuit of expert knowledge or focusing on misconceptions, this research design allows for more than one way to practice statistical literacy. Furthermore, this principle demands that the perspective of the researcher is made explicit. My experiences as the Teaching Assistant for the course informed my analysis of students\u2019 writing. The second principle in a naturalistic methodology is to study learning in context. Context refers to more than just the setting of the study; it is both the setting and how people make sense of that setting in varying ways. These principles go hand in hand; if meaning is negotiated between multiple points of view, it is valuable to conduct research in a setting in which that negotiation authentically occurs\u2014such as a classroom.  An ethnographic stance, being grounded in sociocultural theory, is consistent with a strengths-based approach (Huitzilopochtli, et al, 2021). In this study, I do not assume that there is a one correct way to demonstrate statistical literacy. Instead, I sought to notice and document the mathematical concepts and strategies that students used and recognize statistical literacy practices in what students said and wrote, even when these occurred in ways that I did not expect. This contrasts with a deficit perspective that, \u201csuggests that one\u2019s own way of speaking or thinking is superior,\u201d (Wagner et al., 2015, p. 247).  \n 23 Setting and participants The study was set in an undergraduate elective course called \u201cNumbers and Social Justice\u201d which was housed in the Community Studies department of a California public university. Community Studies was an interdisciplinary major in which students focused on either health or economic justice. The major included a service-learning component that culminated in a thesis based on students\u2019 engagement with community-based, non-governmental organizations. Numbers and Social Justice was designed to meet the need for students to make sense of, communicate, and critique data related to their area of focus. At the time of the study, I was working as the Teaching Assistant for the course, a position I had held for seven previous iterations of the course over six years. A full description of the course can be found in Chapter 4. Briefly, the course covered topics such as estimating, counts and rates, calculating a rate of change, reading tables and graphs, survey design, sampling techniques, operationalization of variables, measures of central tendency, and heuristics.  The thirty participants in the study were students enrolled in the course in the Spring of 2021. Over 90% identified as women or non-binary people, over two-thirds were not white, and half were multilingual. The majority were majoring in the Humanities and Arts. Most had not taken a math or statistics class since high school, and of those few who had attempted college-level statistics, all but one had dropped, withdrawn, or failed the course. There were more first-year students in the course than had been the case in the past, though students from all years were represented. \n 24 These and other demographics are described in Table 1. The categories for racial/ethnic identity are those defined by the university and are similar to those found throughout social science research literature. I report them here not to reify race but to place this work in conversation with others that document how Black and Latinx students have historically been marginalized and neglected in mathematics classrooms (e.g., Martin, 2013; Shah, 2017). Nearly half of the students in the course belong to these groups,  Table 1 Characteristics of the Students According to a Demographic Questionnaire (n=27) \n \n\n 25 Data Collection To explore the question of how students wrote and talked about data, representations, and statistical claims, I collected four types of data: ethnographic notes, video recordings of 20 synchronous sessions, and 30 students\u2019 written work on three assignments (see Appendices 2 and 3 for prompts). During each synchronous class meeting led by the instructor, I took ethnographic field notes guided by several broad questions: How are students participating in the synchronous sessions? What are they saying (or typing in the chat)? Who is speaking and who is not speaking? How are students talking and writing (in the chat) about the presented data and visualizations? After the class meetings I used these notes to write more formal fieldnotes. I also video recorded each of the 20 synchronous whole-class meetings and saved the chat from these sessions. Finally, I collected students\u2019 written work from the class. This written work is the focus of analysis for this dissertation.2 The students had three major writing assignments called \u201cNumbers in the News.\u201d For the first assignment, students found a news article about a social justice topic they cared about and analyzed the author\u2019s use of data and visual representations of data. They received feedback on this essay (described in more detail in Chapter 4) and, for the second assignment, either revised their first essay or  2  I also video recorded three interviews conducted via zoom at the conclusion of the course with pairs of students. I solicited volunteers for these interviews by first emailing the entire class and then following up with ten students. I chose these ten because, based on my ethnographic memos, they had participated in class and demonstrated varying degrees of understanding of the course content. The six students who volunteered for the interviews were all included in that smaller list. In these interviews, I presented the pairs with various graphs published in the New York Times and asked them to discuss what they noticed and wondered (using a typical routine from mathematics education). Analysis of these interviews is not the subject of this dissertation, but these six students formed the sample for analysis of students\u2019 writing in Chapter 6. \n 26 chose a new article to analyze. For the third assignment, students were given a Brookings Institute article on housing inequality to read and analyze. Students were given the same prompt (see Appendices 2 and 3) for all three essay assignments. The prompt contained six questions designed to guide the students through writing their essays. These questions asked students to 1) Identify and assess the credibility of the source; 2) Explain the social justice issue and the author(s)\u2019 point of view; 3) Describe the quantitative information presented; 4) Critically analyze the role and quality of the quantitative information; 5) Identify and explore questions that arose; and 6) Conclude by describing the value of carefully assessing quantitative information. Five additional questions (see Figure 2) were included to remind students of ideas we had discussed in class. These questions were ones that we asked repeatedly throughout the course and were presented as heuristics that the students could use to make sense of and critically analyze data and data-based claims in the media.  Figure 2 Questions We Tried to Ask Regularly in Class Discussions and in Assignments  I chose to analyze the final essay first (see Chapter 5) because all students responded to the same article, which enabled a more streamlined analysis. I also chose to analyze the final essays because they were assigned at the end of the course \n\n 27 and therefore might represent more of the students\u2019 learning. In this assignment, students were asked to respond to the article, \u201cInequalities in housing hardship declined because everybody is now worse off,\u201d by Yung Chun and Michal Grinstein-Weiss, which was published by the Brookings Institution on April 30, 2021. The article described the results of a year-long survey by the Social Policy Institute at Washington University in St. Louis exploring housing-related hardships experienced by Americans during the first year of the pandemic. The thesis was that inequality in experienced hardship, measured by eviction/foreclosure risk, rent/mortgage delinquency, and utility bill payment delay, had decreased because White, non-Hispanic respondents\u2019 hardship had increased. The article used five figures and accompanying text to present the findings from four surveys administered between May 2020 and March 2021.  The article provided a variety of opportunities for students to engage in statistical literacy practices. Firstly, the students could investigate the Brookings Institute, a Washington, DC-based public policy and research organization whose work is considered factual and somewhat left-leaning (mediabiasfactcheck.com) and the authors who are a data analyst and nonresident senior fellow with the organization. The students could also investigate the study design. If they followed several links embedded in the article, they could access a description of the sampling and survey-administration methods and an overview of the categories of the 200 questions in the survey. These links provide opportunities for students to fact-check the article somewhat, though access to the survey results themselves require the \n 28 completion of a request form that is described as taking 4 weeks to complete. The article described the results of a series of surveys of three groups of Americans (White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic, and Hispanic) in percentages in text (e.g., \u201cInstead, white respondents are increasingly experiencing housing instability. For instance, between August and November, the eviction/foreclosure risks for Black and Hispanic respondents decreased by less than 10 percent (from an eviction rate of 8.8 percent to 7.9 percent for Black respondents and from 7.4 percent to 7.5 percent for Hispanic respondents).\u201d) and in figures (see Figures 3, 4, and 5 below). Figure 3 Brookings Institute Figure 1. Eviction/Foreclosure Risk \n These visual representations provided opportunities for students to make sense of and critique textual and visual displays of data. For example, during the course the instructor had taught the students to beware of a truncated y-axis in a bar graph because it exaggerates differences. The article used two bar graphs with truncated y-axes (see below) to describe some survey respondents as \u201clong haulers\u201d\u2014 respondents who reported housing hardship over multiple survey periods. Finally, the \n\n 29 article provided opportunities for students to consider the social impact of the data reported as it refers to unequal experiences of Americans.  Figure 4 Brookings Institute Figure 4. Housing \u201cLong-Haulers\u201d \n Figure 5 Brookings Institute Figure 5. Housing \u201cLong-Haulers\u201d by Race/Ethnicity \n Data Analysis In the initial round of analysis, I read through the essays looking for ideas or methods of critique that appeared more than once. I was using the lens of the course instructor, looking for writing that was related to the concepts and procedures we had \n\n 30 taught in class (e.g., sampling methods, calculating a rate of change3). I was also using the lens of the research literature which offers lists of knowledge and beliefs that comprise statistical literacy (see Chapter 2). For example, I noticed that many students were writing about the survey\u2019s sampling methods. Understanding the strengths and limitations of various methodologies, such as sampling methods and surveys, is one proposed component of statistical literacy (Ridgway et al., 2018). Therefore, \u201cSurvey Sample\u201d became an initial category I used for analysis. I looked for other categories identified in the literature, asking \u201cDid the students write about graphs?\u201d and \u201cDid they use arithmetic to make sense of the article?\u201d The questions I asked were informed by both the affordances of the article (described above), the task, and the concepts and strategies we had taught in the course.  Table 2 Initial Categories of Analysis Students wrote about\u2026  Number of Students (n=30) Graphs 73% Identity and Credibility/Bias of the Source 77% Survey Sample 53% Using Arithmetic 63%  The other initial categories (see Table 2) I identified were writing about the graphs, writing about using arithmetic calculations, and writing about the authors\u2019 credibility or bias. These categories summarize my initial observations of what the  3 \u201cRate of change\u201d is the language we used in class to describe how to find the relative, or percent, difference between two quantities. How we taught this procedure is described in more detail in Chapter 4. \n 31 students wrote about in their essays. Every student\u2019s essay is represented in Table 2, and no student wrote about every category listed.   For the next step in the initial analysis, I used Toulmin\u2019s argument framework to look for students\u2019 arguments within those categories, asking \u201cWhat claims were students making about the article?\u201d I started with looking at students\u2019 writing about data quality and sampling techniques and found clear arguments. I drew diagrams summarizing the parts of the students\u2019 arguments based on the Toulmin diagrams in G\u00f3mez-Blancarte and Tob\u00edas-Lara (2018) (see Figure 6). Each argument in the students\u2019 essays contained a claim, data, and a warrant. Some contained a qualifier. I identified claims as either the thesis statement of the overall essay or the thesis of a subsection of the essay. Data referred to information in the news article or from a secondary source the student selected. The warrants consisted of concepts and calculations that formed the inferential connection between data and claim. Qualifiers appeared in some students\u2019 writing in the form of conditional statements in reference to the claim (e.g., the claim might be true). I did not quote students directly but instead summarized the students\u2019 writing when I made these diagrams. I did this for two reasons: first, their writing was often lengthy, and I wanted to have clearer prose in the diagrams, and second, warrants are often implied (Toulmin, 2003), so it made sense to paraphrase these. I also used my ethnographic memos about the course and the students when interpreting their writing.  \n 32 Figure 6 General Toulmin Model from G\u00f3mez-Blancarte and Tob\u00edas-Lara (2018) \n The following is an example of how I analyzed a student's argument. The student was writing about the sampling method, one of the first topics I identified as a focus for students. Here is an excerpt from one student\u2019s essay:  I have no idea if the sampling was a convenience sample or a simple random sampling. If it was a convenience sample, the statistical data would be biased because it systematically favors particular outcomes. The statistics present could be valid but because it is being obscured and inaccessible, I would not use this article as the information is unsubstantiated \u2026 all samples should be able to represent the population. \u2026 In order to determine if this article is representative of the White, non-Hispanic or Black, non-Hispanic folks' housing struggles during COVID in the United States, we must know what sampling method was used for this survey. (Student\u2019s Essay #3)  I first identified and paraphrased the student\u2019s claim. Where the student wrote, \u201cThe statistics present could be valid but because it is being obscured and inaccessible, I would not use this article as the information is unsubstantiated,\u201d I annotated the essay with a paraphrase, \u201cthe results might not be valid.\u201d This became the student\u2019s claim in the argument. Then, working backwards from the claim, I identified the data (in this \n\n 33 case the lack of information about the sampling method. Then I looked for the student\u2019s reason why \u2014 the warrant for their argument. The warrant came before the claim in this argument, convenience sampling would lead to biased outcomes. The argument is diagrammed below (Figure 7). Note that this argument contained a claim with a qualifier: \u201cThe statistics present could be valid,\u201d (my emphasis).  Figure 7 Toulmin Model of Nikki\u2019s Argument \n  Using the Toulmin method for analysis has strengths and weaknesses. This tool was initially valuable as a means of data reduction. I had tens of thousands of student-written words to analyze and looking for arguments helped focus my attention. Creating argument diagrams also allowed me to compare students\u2019 writing in a systematic way both between different students (e.g., these students have the same claim but use different warrants) and between different essays written by the same student (e.g., this student revised their claim). The benefits of using Toulmin for systematic comparisons have been documented by others (e.g., Groth & Follmer, 2021). The Toulmin diagrams also helped me to determine the possible goals guiding their use of concepts and strategies. In the example above, I inferred that the student was using their knowledge of sampling techniques to critique the quality of the data presented. Finally, though some (e.g., Cramer & Kempen, 2022) see it as a weakness \n\n 34 of the method, the Toulmin diagrams have no space to indicate the correctness of the reasoning. I view this as a strength for this study as I am documenting students\u2019 emerging uses of statistical literacy practices. I do not ignore when students are incorrect in their understanding, but it is not the focus of the analysis. There are also well-documented challenges to using this method that I also encountered. One such challenge is determining the appropriate grain size (Groth & Follmer, 2021) for arguments. Should the argument represent the thrust of the entire essay or focus on a smaller point within it? Also, the Toulmin method focuses on the structure of an argument, but it does not capture rhetorical moves such as tone and word choice. The students\u2019 essays were rich and complex pieces of writing. They were also a very specific genre \u2014 a class assignment. This is, in part, why I do not rely on Toulmin alone in my analysis but also include my ethnographic observations, recordings of class meetings, and written copies of the feedback I gave students on their essays.  Because most of the students who wrote about the survey sampling methods did so in a way that was critical of the article, I started by limiting my search for arguments related to the other categories (using arithmetic, making sense of graphs) that were similarly critical of the article. When I looked at excerpts of student writing that used arithmetic or discussed the graphs, I saw fewer arguments that criticized the article. Some essays seemed to have no argument at all.  Then, realizing that I had overly limited my analysis by focusing on excerpts rather than the complete essay and on critiques rather than arguments, I returned to reread each student\u2019s essay in its entirety in search of any argument, not only \n 35 critiques. \u201cWhat is this essay arguing?\u201d was the question in my mind as I began each essay. After reading, I recorded a few phrases capturing the student\u2019s argument as a claim/s and warrant/s. It was then that I realized that every essay did, in fact, contain an overall argument. The warrants for the arguments sometimes appeared in a different section of the essay from the claim. The variation in argument, discussed in detail in Chapter 5, seemed to be related to how a student viewed the task and how they interpreted the article and which parts of the article they focused on. While my initial observations about which topics the students were writing about most often were accurate, I had to look at the overall essay to make sense of these in relation to the arguments in their essays. The next step in my analysis was to describe the statistical literacy practices that students used in their essays. Consistent with the ethnographic stance that I adopted, I assumed that statistical literacy practices are not a unitary category but are instead varied, situated, and co-created in social settings and in response to tasks and goals (Moschkovich, 2019; Moschkovich & Brenner, 2000). I used my knowledge of the students and the course activities, as well as the research literature on statistical literacy, to identify the statistical literacy practices students were \u201cgrappling with, even when [those] may not be immediately evident,\u201d (Moschkovich, 2019, p. 70). Through iterative analytical memos, I grouped students\u2019 writing according to the goal (usually inferred by me and not explicitly stated by students), the mathematical concepts they used, and the strategies they employed. To clarify how these goals, concepts, and strategies coalesced to be a practice, I created idealized models of the \n 36 two statistical literacy practices that emerged through analysis. These models (Figures 8 and 9) were provided a conceptual framework to describe students\u2019 writing. This method of analysis is consistent with a strengths-based perspective (Huitzilopochtli et al., 2021) that helps us understand \u201clearners in their own terms and [highlight] the potential in what they know, rather than only comparing their knowledge to that of an expert\u201d (Moschkovich & Brenner, 2000, p. 461).  Figure 8 Idealized Statistical Literacy Practice: Reading the Data \n  Reading the Data was the foremost practice that we taught in class. Because so many of our students over the years have said that they \u201cskip\u201d the numbers, tables, and graphs and only read the prose in articles, much of our instruction in class focused on helping students learn to slow down and read the data presented. Some goals of the practice of Reading the Data are to make sense of the data presented and to make inferences and draw conclusions from that data. To do this, one might use \n\n 37 mathematical concepts such as equivalent quantities, proportional reasoning and relative thinking, and scaling.  Figure 9 Idealized Statistical Literacy Practice: Critiquing the Data Quality \n The second statistical literacy practice that I described is Critiquing the Data Quality. The goals of this practice can include evaluating the trustworthiness and generalizability of the data. To do this, one might use mathematical concepts such as equivalent quantities and proportional reasoning as well as statistics concepts like statistical bias and sampling and sampling bias. The strategies we taught students to use when Critiquing the Data Quality include comparing values absolutely and relatively, fact-checking and looking at other sources, and following hyperlinks to investigate the source of the data or data-based claim.   Analysis of the students\u2019 arguments enabled me to identify these two statistical literacy practices that students used: Reading the Data and Critiquing the \n\n 38 Data Quality. Student writing that was about the Survey Sample and Identity and Credibility/Bias of the Source showed evidence of students engaging in the statistical literacy practice of Critiquing the Data Quality while the student writing that was about graphs illustrated students Reading the Data. Students who used arithmetic in their writing used both practices. Importantly, it was only after analyzing the students\u2019 writing in its totality and with an open mind towards any argument that I was able to notice all the ways that students were engaging in these statistical literacy practices. This is an important methodological issue and one that has implications for teaching as well.  To explore the final part of the third research question, What statistical literacy practices did students use when analyzing self-selected articles? Did these change over time and with the opportunity to revise for four focal students?, I selected a subset of the students and analyzed the first and second essays they wrote in the class. As a reminder, the students were asked to select and analyze a news article that contained data, data visualizations, or data-based claims. They received written feedback from me in the role of Teaching Assistant and were encouraged to schedule one-on-one writing conferences with me to discuss their work. While every student received written feedback, only a few opted to have a meeting. The second essay was positioned as a revision of the first, though students were allowed to choose a novel news article and write a new essay if they desired.  \n 39 The focal students were selected based on the original study design which included pair interviews.4 At the end of the course, I invited all the students to participate in one-hour pair interviews in which they would discuss graphs selected from popular news sites such as The New York Times. I sent additional invitations to ten students who I selected because they had participated in class meetings and represented both the demographics (see Table 3) and the range of academic performance in the class. The six students who volunteered were students who received the second invitation. Of these, four wrote their two essays about the same article; in other words, their second essay was a revision of the first. These four students were the focus of analysis for Chapter 6.  Table 3 Focal Students with Demographic Information  \n  I repeated the Toulmin analysis that I used for the students\u2019 final (third) essays for each of the students\u2019 two essays. In order to determine how feedback and the opportunity for revision may have impacted the students\u2019 writing and use of statistical literacy practices, I compared the students\u2019 arguments between their first and second  4 These interviews are not analyzed in this dissertation.

I also used the comments and feedback I had given students to inform my understanding of what changed between the two essays.   In the next chapter, I provide a thick description of the course, the activities and assignments, and my role as Teaching Assistant. This lengthy explanation of the course is necessary to understand the context in which students were writing. These details also inform my analysis.    \n 41 Chapter 4: Description of the Course In this chapter I provide a detailed description of the setting of this study\u2014a university course called Numbers and Social Justice. Because mathematical practices are developed through social interactions around joint activity (Moschkovich, 2013), it is necessary to describe the setting in which students learned to use these practices. Furthermore, analysis of the students\u2019 written work requires a consideration not just of the affordances of the task (see Chapter 3) but the history of the lessons taught, activities explored, tasks assigned, and language used. This description is based on my field notes, ethnographic memos, recordings of class meetings on zoom, and documents and student work stored in the university\u2019s course management system, Canvas. I begin by describing the course generally and my role in designing it. I then introduce the students and provide a vignette of the first day of class. In the next section I describe the structure of course meetings and assignments and provide an overview of the concepts and practices that were the focus of each week. Next, I describe in more detail some of the concepts we taught and provide examples from class discussions and activities. Finally, I describe my role as the Teaching Assistant (TA) and researcher.  This study was set in an undergraduate elective course at a California public university, titled \u201cNumbers and Social Justice,\u201d which satisfied the university\u2019s general education requirement for Statistical Reasoning. The course was advertised as especially appropriate for Humanities and Arts students who had struggled with mathematics and statistics courses in the past. Housed in the Community Studies \n 42 department, the course was designed to support students in analyzing and communicating data related to equity in social arenas such as education, public health, housing, and criminal justice. Though the course was required for Community Studies majors, students from any major field of study were welcome. Historically, students from minoritized racial and ethnic, cultural, and linguistic communities, as well as students with non-dominant gender and sexual identities had made up most of our students. For many students, the last mathematics course they passed was in high school, they may have attempted and failed statistics courses in other departments, and this was the final course needed to graduate.  I was the Teaching Assistant for the course, and, at the time of the study, I had held that position for seven previous iterations of the course. The instructor and I had worked closely for six years refining the course to provide opportunities for students to develop statistical literacy. We recognized that this course could be a gatekeeper; it fulfilled a graduation requirement that many of our students struggled to meet. In our discussions around developing the course over the years, we sought to address the questions \u201cWhat mathematics? For whom? And for what purposes?\u201d (Martin, Gholson, & Leonard, 2010). What did our students need to learn to be able to make sense of and critique data-based claims in the media? How could we make the learning relevant to students who have been historically marginalized in STEM courses? Despite reform efforts in the past decades that have sought to teach statistics in more holistic ways, university statistics courses still typically focus on procedures and skills, and they leave students with the impression that statistics is essentially a \n 43 collection of ultimately forgettable tools and techniques (Ben-Zvi & Garfield, 2004). Teaching statistics this way has especially negative impacts on students from marginalized identities (Martin, 2013) who have experienced neglect or trauma in mathematics courses that position them as outsiders.  We designed the course to focus on social justice because it was a topic that interested our students and because statistical literacy requires a sense of agency and the conviction that one has a legitimate right to question authoritative sources, even if one is not an expert (Gal, 2002). Our students were typically very practiced in writing and speaking critically about politics, sociohistorical contexts, and issues of social justice, but they \u201cfell apart\u201d when confronted with numerical data. For example, in a pilot study that I conducted in 2020 with members of the course that year, the majority of students surveyed said that they skipped any tables or graphs and relied entirely on the prose to interpret and critique an author\u2019s claims. In facilitating discussions in class, we sought to notice and leverage students\u2019 strengths (Huitzilopochtli, et al, 2021) to engage in statistical reasoning about questions that are critical to social justice. For example, students were assigned readings that considered theoretical ideas (e.g., Constructing Normalcy by Lennard J. Davis) related to statistical concepts because the majority arrived in class well-practiced in reading and discussing complex texts. All the tasks we created (both in-class and assignments) were about sociopolitical issues, used real data and visualizations, came from major newspapers, media outlets, and social media as recommended by research on statistical literacy education (e.g., Engledowl & Weiland, 2021; ProCivicStat \n 44 Partners, 2018; Weiland, 2019), and invited students to make sense of and critically analyze data, visualizations, and data-based claims. It was critical to us that the students had real-world, consequential examples for every concept. The Course at the Time of the Study I collected data during the Spring 2021 school term during the COVID-19 pandemic. The course, which lasted ten weeks, was entirely remote and included both asynchronous and synchronous elements. Forty-seven students participated in the course, and 30 of them consented to participate in the study. Most students were familiar with the remote learning systems because California had mandated emergency remote instruction in March 2020 and that order was still in effect a year later. However, at this point in the pandemic, many undergraduate students were struggling with stress, social isolation, and depression, as well as insufficient access to the internet and internet-enabled devices. The majority of students did not turn their cameras on during the zoom sessions, citing zoom fatigue and internet limitations as their reasons. Indeed, participation in discussions was more challenging than it had been in past iterations of the course. Especially during the latter half of the course, it was not uncommon for the instructor to ask a question and be met with a prolonged silence from the students. The phenomenon of student disengagement in learning during the pandemic has been documented (e.g., Chakraborty et al., 2020; Durak & Cankaya, 2020). The stressors of balancing school, work, and family were only exacerbated by the pandemic, and the students commented on feeling apathetic, frustrated, stressed and overtired.  \n 45 Despite many challenges, the start of the term still contained some of that excited, first-day-of-school energy that was familiar from previous, in-person, classes. On the first day of class, we invited the students to participate in an icebreaker activity. They were directed to a google form with the questions, \u201cWhat have been your experiences in past math and statistics courses? What are your feelings about math and statistics?\u201d They were given a few minutes to think and write a response that would be shared anonymously with the class. Then we randomized the responses, and the students took turns reading each response aloud.  The instructor and I had started the course with this activity for six years, though we of course modified it for remote instruction. The responses were expectedly heartbreaking. The overwhelming majority of students described math courses in negative terms. Overwhelming. Frustrating. Alienating. Boring. Traumatizing. Nerve-wracking. Several described avoiding math out of fear of humiliation and failure. Others emphasized the importance of the teacher. \u201cWhen I have good teachers, I enjoy the course and learning.\u201d \u201cI used to have a teacher that would laugh at the questions I asked and not help me.\u201d One student wrote about feeling alienated in a prior statistics class when they objected to the professor\u2019s use of the gender binary (\u201cWomen are shorter than men.\u201d). They wrote that the professor brushed aside the comment and the other students, described as cisgender men, seemed annoyed and one said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a humanities class.\u201d These are examples of how mathematics courses can be spaces that alienate students from underrepresented groups (Moore, 2021). That so many of the students had negative feelings towards \n 46 mathematics courses wasn\u2019t at all surprising considering who our students were. Like other years, the students represented communities that have historically been marginalized, oppressed, and excluded in mathematics courses (see Table 3 in Chapter 3).  After reading each response, the students moved into break-out rooms to discuss the activity. When they returned, the instructor asked them to share what they had discussed. Several groups reported that they had talked about the idea of the \u201cmath person.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re not one, teachers don\u2019t care about you.\u201d The idea of feeling too uncomfortable to ask a question came up, and one student commented that the icebreaker activity had created a good environment. \u201cI just feel like I\u2019m not alone. It\u2019s less isolating.\u201d In the chat window a student typed, \u201cThis class has good vibes.\u201d  When a student mentioned the idea of learned helplessness, the instructor interrupted, leaning into the camera. \u201cMake no mistake, that is no accident. Mathematics education is part of a larger social project.\u201d She went on to briefly discuss Sputnik, neoliberalism, and racism. She explained that the students had been kept from mathematics, not that they were incapable of mathematics. She reassured them that we (she and I) were there to support them, no question was too elementary, and they had a right to learn. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m just going to say it. Fuck those people who made math not for me.\u201d There were nods and smiles from the few faces we could see and approving comments in the chat. The discussion, and the first class meeting, ended with a student commenting that math can be fun if you know what you\u2019re doing. \n 47 In that first class meeting, we did not teach any content or even review the syllabus. Our focus was on creating community and laying the groundwork to earn our students\u2019 trust. That we had seen and heard positive and hopeful comments was encouraging. Course Structure  The course was structured as follows. The students were required to attend three synchronous sessions per week via zoom. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we met for 90-minute, whole-class sessions led by the instructor. These generally consisted of lectures, whole-class discussions, and small group discussions in break-out rooms. These class meetings were recorded and available to the students via the campus learning management system. On Wednesdays, they attended one of two one-hour smaller-group \u201csections\u201d which were facilitated by me as the Teaching Assistant.  The students were responsible for asynchronous participation as well. This looked like course readings, videos, and TikToks. The TikToks were particularly powerful tools for creating an inclusive space. We primarily used the work of OnlineKyne, a Canadian drag queen and mathematics communicator who charmingly explains statistical concepts like sampling and operationalization of variables using real-life, often social justice-oriented, examples. A student commented at one point in the course that they especially appreciated these because it was the first time they had seen queer people represented in mathematics and it made them feel like they might have a place in mathematics too.   \n 48 Table 4 Timeline of Course Concepts and Assignments Week Big Ideas Assignments Due 1 Statistics are numbers with a context.

Numbers in the News Essay #3  The students had seven major assignments over the course of the term: four homework assignments that consisted of problem-solving exercises based on real-world data and data-based messages (see example questions from homework assignments in Appendix 1), a rough draft and final version of an essay in which they chose a news article about a social justice topic and analyzed the author\u2019s use of data \n 49 (see Appendix 2), and a final exam in which they analyzed a Brookings Institute article on housing inequality (see Appendix 3). They also had weekly quizzes on the readings.  Between the first and second Numbers in the News essays, the students received written feedback from me (see Figure 10) via the online instructional management system and had the option to schedule a meeting with me or the instructor to talk through their analysis. Each student\u2019s feedback was specific to the article that they chose, but, in general, my comments included reminders to put numbers in context by asking the questions we taught in class (\u201cIs that a lot?\u201d  Figure 10 Example of Comments on a Student\u2019s Rough Draft \n \u201cCompared to what?\u201d), encouragements to question the data and claims in the article, and feedback about the accuracy of their understanding of statistics concepts such as proportionality and representativeness. I was looking for students to engage with the data and data-based claims using the practices we were teaching in class. \n\n 50 Examples of Concepts and Practices  The course was originally conceived by the instructor when they noticed that their students in other courses would cite data in their work without seeming to consider what those data meant. An example of this, and one that appeared in the students\u2019 homework assignments, follows. The question read: Last year one of my students in a different course reported on a California state policy by noting, \u201cSeventeen counties have implemented the law.\u201d My question to you: So what? Rewrite this statement to make it more memorable and legible to the reader. In order to accomplish this, you\u2019ll want to look up some information that\u2019s not in my student\u2019s statement, and you\u2019ll also have to do a little bit of rough math, so show your work and cite your source/s.  This task required students to consider the relevant denominator, in this case 17 out of 58 total counties, or about a third. Considering the meaning of reported numbers was a major theme of the course and we returned to it repeatedly. For example, in the second class meeting, the instructor shared that over 552,000 people in the U.S. had died of COVID. \u201cIs that a lot?\u201d they asked. The students then debated the question by anchoring 552,000 to other numbers they knew (e.g., it\u2019s three times the number of people who live in the community surrounding the university), by critiquing the accuracy of the number (e.g., \u201cHow do we know we\u2019ve correctly counted every COVID death?\u201d), and by comparing the number to other causes of death. In this class meeting we introduced a series of questions to ask when one sees a number reported in the news: Is that a lot? Compared to what? So what? These questions encouraged students to think critically about reported data rather than just citing it in their own \n 51 work. These three questions were repeated to students in class discussions, in their homework assignments, and in my written feedback to their essays.    Another topic in the class was called \u201crough math\u201d or \u201cback-of-the-envelope math\u201d by the instructor. She asked students to round numbers in order to estimate percentages. For example, the students were presented with the race/ethnicity demographics of the university (given in counts). Out of 17,517 total students, 752 identify as African American. This is unwieldy if one wants the exact percentage, but the instructor required students to estimate by rounding to easier numbers. In this example, 17,517 became 17,500, and 752 became 750. 750/17,500 can be reduced by 25/25 giving 30/700. This can be reduced further (30/700) / (7/7), which results in a little more than 4%.  We taught the students to consider common factors when rounding to do rough math. In all course assignments, students were required to use \u201crough math\u201d rather than calculators to estimate quantities. Some struggled with the imprecise nature of an estimate. This is understandable \u2013 mathematics for them may have been all about getting a precise answer. But our goal was to help students to engage intellectually with reported numbers. We did not want them to be bogged down with procedures and calculations. Instead, we endeavored to convince them that \u201ca little more than 4%\u201d is not only precise enough for our purposes (e.g., making sense of demographic data), but it is also more meaningful and easier to understand than 752 out of 17,517. \n 52  Another topic we discussed in class was the difference between a count and a rate, or absolute and relative quantities. This concept was introduced within a real-world context in response to which the instructor facilitated a classroom discussion. In the second class meeting, the instructor presented the students with the number 552,000 and said to the students, \u201cThis is the number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the United States. My question for you is, is that a lot?\u201d This question sparked a heated discussion. Some students said yes, because the deaths were preventable or because the U.S. had more deaths compared to other nations. Other students said the number seemed small when compared to the total population of the country. Figure 11 shows the instructor\u2019s slides where she took notes on the students\u2019 comments during the discussion. The phrases in quotation marks are the words of students. The blue boxes were added to the slide after the class meeting by the instructor in order to highlight the ideas she had added during the discussion.  Throughout the discussion, the instructor and I highlighted important course concepts that would come up later in the term by marking concepts when they arose and introducing vocabulary. For example, when a student said that the number was a lot because even one human life is meaningful, we introduced the concept of a count, or absolute, quantity (in contrast to a rate). The instructor emphasized during the discussion that when considering social justice, it was important to remember the human lives represented by the numbers. When a student compared the 552,000 figure to the population of the United States, the instructor introduced the concept of proportion and rate. She then demonstrated how to use \u201crough math\u201d to estimate the \n 53 proportion of the U.S. population that had died. She rounded the number of deaths to 500,000 and the U.S. population to 300,000,000 and simplified that 1/600. At that point, a student made a comment that became a theme in the course: Shaun said, \u201cThis makes me think that the way you present a number changes the way you think about it.\u201d  Figure 11 Course Slide Summarizing the Classroom Discussion on COVID-19 Deaths \n Several students commented that 1 in 600 seemed larger than 552,000 and the instructor then verbally stressed two important course concepts. First, she said that counts are valuable because they make us pause and consider every individual life, but rates are important because they put the count in context. \u201cEvery time you see a number,\u201d she told the class, \u201cAsk yourself, Is that a lot? Compared to what? The \n\n 54 \u2018compared to what\u2019 part is the denominator.\u201d She then encouraged the class to compare 1 in 600 and 552,000 to similar quantities that were familiar. Students shared that their high school graduating class had 600 people, so 1 in 600 could be thought of as one person in every graduating class. Others mentioned movie theaters and college dormitories as familiar spaces of about 600 people. When asked to think about the 552,000 number, the students compared it to the size of California cities. Sacramento, the state capital, has about 500,000 people. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing a whole city,\u201d the instructor said.   In concluding this lesson, the instructor told the students, \u201cA number in isolation is meaningless.\u201d She highlighted the ways that the class had collaboratively made sense of the 552,000 number by simplifying it to make it more legible and memorable and comparing the value to the relevant context.   In the third week of the course, we introduced the students to the \u201crate of change\u201d formula. \u201cSocial justice is about change,\u201d the instructor told the class, \u201cand we need to be able to calculate how big or small the change is relative to something else \u2014 either a previous time or a comparison group.\u201d Figure 12 shows the slide she used to teach this. To find the relative change (or rate of change), she asked them to find the absolute difference between two values and divide that difference by the \u201cbaseline\u201d value. The baseline value was described as the \u201creference point\u201d and students were encouraged to decide for themselves what the relevant reference point would be.  \n 55 Figure 12 Slide Showing the \u201cRate of Change\u201d Formula \n  We also spent considerable time (more than 20% of the course) engaged in activities such as small-group and whole-class discussions and homework assignments that centered on the concept of operationalization. In the course, we taught students that \u201coperationalization\u201d means to take an idea and define it in a way that one can measure it. We presented several real-world examples to model this, and the students also worked in groups to operationalize the concept of college readiness. The students read and discussed news articles on counting COVID deaths, measuring racial discrimination, and San Francisco\u2019s attempts to distribute social services. In the example of San Francisco, the students learned that the city was using \u201ccalls for service\u201d as a metric for which neighborhoods needed social services. This metric proved to be an invalid measure for need. Instead, more calls came from \n\n 56 neighborhoods in which residents felt more empowered to call the city for help, not from neighborhoods that had the greatest need. Residents in neighborhoods with many problems didn\u2019t call, perhaps because they assumed the city already knew about the problems or because they didn\u2019t not feel safe or empowered to report problems to the government. Throughout our lessons on operationalization, we encouraged students to consider the following two questions: What does this measure highlight? What does it obscure? We told the students that all measures will obscure some things and highlight others and that the students\u2019 task was to take these into consideration when making sense of data and data-based claims in the media.   Other important concepts in the class were sampling techniques, survey design and implementation, heuristics, graphs and figures, and measures of central tendency. For all these concepts, we used real world data as illustrations, using examples that were related to social justice issues. For example, we used an article about how the average hourly wage spiked in the months immediately following the start of the pandemic to illustrate the sensitivity of means. The average hourly wage had gone up because most low-wage hourly workers (in restaurants and other service industry jobs) had simply lost their jobs and were no longer included in the data. Instead, only the higher-wage hourly workers (those who were more likely to continue their jobs in a remote context) were considered in the new average.   In general, the students provided feedback in casual before- or after-class conversations that they were enjoying the content of the course, but they were struggling to keep up with the workload. In fact, halfway through the term, the \n 57 instructor and I received an email from a student who had conducted a survey with their classmates regarding the workload. Their email advocating for a decrease in the amount of coursework included the response rate to their survey (over 50%) and summary statistics: \u2022 75% of students are spending at least 5-12 hours a week (outside of our 4 hours instruction) working on assignments  \u2022 93% of students feel their workload for this class is noticeably higher than that of their other courses  \u2022 72% of students are working at least 1 job this quarter, an additional 19% are spending at least 10 hours per week committed to clubs or child care  \u2022 84% of students feel the workload in CMMU 30 is inhibiting their ability to keep up in their other classes  \u2022 90% of students feel that the workload in CMMU 30 is negatively impacting their work-life balance and/or mental health  \u2022 100% of students feel it would be useful to them if homework assignments were shorter \u2022 82% of students feel it would be helpful to them if we had longer to complete the homework assignments  \u2022 50% of students enjoy CMMU 30 overall, but 90% said they would enjoy it more if the workload was lightened   The instructor responded by sharing the university\u2019s hourly expectation (15 hours per week), but they also eliminated the weekly quizzes and worked to shorten the homework assignments. This incident is notable for two reasons. First, the very existence of this email suggested that we had created a classroom environment in which students felt empowered to advocate for themselves. The instructor\u2019s response was a compromise and honored the students\u2019 request. Second, this email suggested that the students were using what they were learning about surveys in class to make a data-based argument.  \n 58 Discussion Sections with the TA  The students and I met once a week in smaller (half the class) groups and without the instructor in \u201cdiscussion sections\u201d.  I organized these discussion section meetings using routines. We started with a Number Talk (Parrish, 2010), beginning with students mentally solving problems like 25 x 14 and progressing up to 128 x 1.5. The students started with two to three minutes of silent thinking while the problem was shared on their screen. Then they went into a break-out room with another student to share their solution strategy. When they returned to the larger group, students volunteered to explain their solutions while I recorded their thinking on the virtual whiteboard using symbolic notation. During this sharing of explanations, I would ask questions like, \u201cHow did you know you could do that?\u201d and \u201cDoes that always work with any numbers?\u201d to encourage them to expand their explanations. Though it was unfamiliar at first, they quickly learned the routine and got used to my questioning. Some began providing more elaborated explanations without probing questions.  These Number Talks had three purposes. First, they served to \u201cwarm up\u201d for working with numbers. Second, they gave students the opportunity to be successful at math, setting a positive affective environment at the start of class. Third, they gave me the opportunity to reinforce the message that there are many ways to manipulate numbers and more than one solution pathway. This is essential because many students are taught math in a way that rewards fast and flawless mimicry of procedures, and, since so many of my students had had negative experiences in \n 59 mathematics courses, it was essential that I created a norm that valued diverse thinking.   For example, every time I have presented 25 x 14 to a class, someone will always talk about how they thought of money and used quarters (twenty-five cents) to solve the problem. This is almost always shared in a somewhat embarrassed tone, as if this way of thinking isn\u2019t real math or is just less sophisticated. I take that moment to highlight the ways that thinking of numbers in different situations (e.g., 25 could be conceptualized as twenty-five cents or \u00bc or 10 + 10 + 5) is valuable when working with numbers and that everyday knowledge is an asset.   Following the Number Talks in each discussion section meeting, I facilitated an activity focused on a mathematical idea or procedure such as measures of central tendency, estimating percentages, or reading figures. Each Wednesday discussion section meeting ended with time for students to ask questions about assignments or concepts discussed in the whole-class sessions. Conclusion  In seeking to document students\u2019 use of statistical literacy practices, it is necessary to consider the context in which they were learning these practices. This chapter provided a thick description of the course from my perspective as the TA and researcher which will inform the analysis in the following chapters.   \n 60 Chapter 5: Statistical Literacy Practices in Students\u2019 Essays In this chapter, I describe the analysis of the students\u2019 final essays, all of which were written in response to an article on housing inequality in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic by The Brookings Institution. I used multiple analytic tools (described in detail in Chapter 3: Methodology) and a strengths-based perspective to address the following Research Questions. 1. How did students respond in writing to a news article with statistical claims, data, and visual representations of data?  2. What arguments did students write? When students made arguments, what types of arguments did they make? 3. What statistical literacy practices did students use?   This chapter is organized into five sections. In the first, I provide a brief review of the data and the method of analysis. In the second section, I describe how students\u2019 writing about the Brookings Institution article reflected the concepts taught in the course, the questions posed in the assignment (see Appendix 3), and the features of the article. In the third section, I provide an analysis of the students\u2019 arguments and describe how the students primarily wrote arguments about the validity or persuasiveness of the claims in the article. I provide evidence that the overwhelming majority of the students wrote arguments that agreed with the claims presented in the article. In the fourth section, I describe how students used two statistical literacy practices: Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality in their analyses of the article. I provide examples of how students used various concepts and \n 61 strategies to achieve various goals (e.g., using estimation to compare data quantities, using knowledge of statistical bias to critique the representativeness of a sample). Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the findings.  Data and Analysis As described in Chapter 4, the students had three major writing assignments called \u201cNumbers in the News.\u201d For the first assignment, students found a news article about a social justice topic they cared about and analyzed the author\u2019s use of data and visualizations. They received feedback on this essay and, for the second assignment, revised their first essay. For the third assignment, which was presented as a take-home final, students were given a Brookings Institution article on housing inequality to read and analyze. This final assignment is the focus of the analysis in this chapter.  As a reminder, the article (see Appendix 4), \u201cInequalities in housing hardship declined because everybody is now worse off,\u201d by Yung Chun and Michal Grinstein-Weiss, described the results of a year-long survey by the Social Policy Institution at Washington University in St. Louis exploring housing-related hardships experienced by Americans during the first year of the pandemic. The article contained two main claims: 1) inequality in experienced hardship, measured by eviction/foreclosure risk, rent/mortgage delinquency, and utility bill payment delay, has decreased because White, non-Hispanic respondents\u2019 hardship has increased; and 2) Black families are most likely to experience longer-lasting hardship. The article used five graphs and accompanying text to present the findings from four surveys administered between May 2020 and March 2021.    \n 62  The analyses presented in this chapter have two foci: first, I examine students\u2019 writing in their final essays to characterize the ways they responded to the article and what types of arguments they made; then, I examine how their written responses demonstrated the use of statistical literacy practices described in the research literature (Gal, 2002; Gal & Geiger, 2022; Ridgway et al., 2018; Weiland, 2017). I use Toulmin\u2019s (2003) method, as described in Chapter 3, to identify and describe students\u2019 arguments. Consistent with a sociocultural framework, these analyses began with consideration of the affordances of the assignment and the Brookings Institution article as well as the context of the course itself. For example, the article contained five graphs that students could make sense of and critique and the assignment encouraged them to do just that. Throughout the course, we examined various types of graphs and practiced making sense of and critiquing them (see Chapter 4 for a detailed description of the course).  I adopt a strengths-based approach (Huitzilopochtli, et al, 2021) by emphasizing what the students did as opposed to making conjectures about what they could or could not do. While some researchers describe statistical literacy in hierarchical or developmental tiers (e.g., Watson, 1997; Watson & Callingham, 2020), I align with Gal\u2019s (2002) conceptualization of statistical literacy as existing \u201cto different degrees within the same individual, depending on the contexts where it is invoked or applied,\u201d (Gal, 2002, p. 15). This is consistent with an ethnographic stance (Moschkovich, 2019; Moschkovich & Brenner, 2000) in which \u201cmathematical activity\u201d is not a unitary category but is manifested in different ways in different settings. \u2026 mathematical activity is not \n 63 always immediately evident to the participants or the analyst but, instead, is uncovered during analysis. Using this perspective focuses data analysis on uncovering the mathematical structure in what participants are actually doing and saying \u2026 students\u2019 mathematical activity in the classroom is seen not as a deviant or novice version of academic/school mathematical practices but instead as a particular case of students\u2019 everyday activity, where participants use social and cognitive resources to make sense of situations. (Moschkovich, 2019, p. 70)  These theoretical considerations informed the first, very broad, research question: How did students respond in writing to a news article with statistical claims, data, and visual representations of data? What did they write about? Did they critique the statistical claims they encountered in the article? If so, how? Did students use concepts and strategies taught in class such as biases, fact-checking, knowledge of history, current events, validity, generalizability, algorithmic procedures, etc.? By starting with this broad question, I met students where they were at and allowed their choices about what was important to write about to guide my analysis.  Students\u2019 Responses to the Brookings Article  To investigate the first research question, I read through each essay and created descriptive categories that summarized the general topic of a particular section or paragraph. Though each student was responding to the same prompt and the same article, the task was open-ended enough that there was some variety in what students chose to write about. That said, the topics students chose to write about were necessarily constrained by the task and the topics discussed in the course. In this section, I describe the different ways students responded to the Brookings Institution \n 64 article in their essays. Table 5 summarizes the topics that students wrote about in their essays.  Table 5 Summary of Topics Students Wrote About in Their Essays Topic  Percent of students (n=30) Identifying the authors and considering potential bias  77% Writing about the sampling method of the surveys 53% Critiquing the authors\u2019 use of only three racial/ethnic categories 17% Writing about the graphs 70%  Twenty-three students wrote about the authors or the Brookings Institution as a source. This was specifically listed as something they should do in the assignment description. For most students, they identified the source and the authors. About half the students (n=14) wrote more about the source. For example,5 Candace went to both the Brookings\u2019 Institution website and a media analysis website that was recommended by the instructor to describe the source and possible bias.  The article entitled, \u201cInequalities in housing hardship declined because everyone is now worse off\u201d was published on April 30th, 2021 by Brookings Institution. On the About Us section of the Brookings website it claims to source from over 300 experts in government and academia. Using mediabiasfactcheck.com I found that the institution was rated as highly factual with a left-center bias. (Candace\u2019s essay)   5 In all the excerpts of student writing I have added bolded text to direct the reader\u2019s attention to the most salient parts of the excerpts.  \n 65 Other students researched both the Brookings Institution and the authors of the article. For example, Talia wrote: On the first examination I did a quick search into the background of Brookings, and of the authors. Brookings is a well established non profit organization that values independent, pragmatic research (Brookings, 2016). They have been around since 1916 and have advised the government during instrumental times such as World War II (Brookings, 2016). One of the authors Yung Chun is a data analyst for the Social Policy Institution at Washington University in St.Louis, while Michal Grinstein-Weis is a nonresident senior fellow in Global Economy and Development at Brookings. She is also a Professor and the director of the Social Policy Institution at Washington University. The fact that the authors are academic researchers at a well established university provides a lot of credibility to their work. (Talia\u2019s essay)  Researchers have argued that statistically literate people must possess a healthy skepticism for statistical claims, walking a fine line between a belief that statistics are all lies or all true. Considering the source of the statistical results is an important practice (Gal, 2002; Weiland, 2017) that supports this. For example, some students noted the lack of information about the sample and assumed a strong study design anyway. \u201cSince this information is not readily available to the reader, I will assume for the purposes of my analysis that the survey methods were reliable, and the responses are a valid measure of the overall experience within the country.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cthe fact that the authors are academic researchers at a well-established university provides a lot of credibility to their work.\u201d These statements suggest that the students were considering the limitations of various study designs while simultaneously making assumptions based on their knowledge of and beliefs about \n 66 the credibility of the source. All of the students who wrote about the source of the article described it as reliable in some way.  Over half of the students (n=16) wrote about the surveys reported in the article and the sampling method used by the researchers. A large portion of the course, four out of ten weeks of instruction, focused on survey design and sampling methods, so students had experience critiquing sampling methods. Most students (n=14) wrote a critique about the lack of information about how the sample was chosen. For example, in this excerpt from Nikki\u2019s essay, she critiqued the article for a lack of transparency regarding the sampling method: I have no idea if the sampling was a convenience sample or a simple random sampling. If it was a convenience sample, the statistical data would be biased because it systematically favors particular outcomes. The statistics present could be valid but because it is being obscured and inaccessible. I would not use this article as the information is unsubstantiated. (Nikki\u2019s essay)  Some of the students who wrote about the survey sample focused on it not representing all American ethnicities. One-sixth (n=5) of the students wrote about the authors\u2019 inclusion of only three demographic groups in the article (Black, Hispanic, and White Americans). Most wrote briefly about this, but one student (Tina) made it a focus of her essay. Another very concerning aspect of the author\u2019s approach to this analysis is their sole focus on black vs. hispanic vs. white communities, as if other communities don\u2019t experience housing hardship [inequality] or even exist at all \u2026 how has the way they\u2019ve [the authors] defined their communities possibly crafted an incomplete narrative? What about asians, pacific islanders, indigenous people, etc.? (Tina\u2019s essay)  \n 67 The final topic that appeared repeatedly in the essays was students writing about the graphs in the article. Over two-thirds of the students (n=21) wrote about the graphs in some way. These were usually a main focus of the students\u2019 essays, which is unsurprising since analyzing visual representations of data was another major component of the course and students were specifically asked to write about these in the assignment description. The various ways they wrote about these graphs is described in detail later in this chapter in the section on Reading the Data.   Overall, the ways that students wrote about the Brookings Institution article reflected the concepts that we taught in the course, the questions posed in the assignment (see Appendix 3), and the features of the article. This corroborates prior research that describes how students\u2019 work is constrained by the task and its setting (a university course on statistical literacy in this case). In particular, students wrote about the source, the survey methods, and the visual representations of data. In the next section I describe the arguments students wrote in their essays.  Students\u2019 Arguments  What arguments did students write? When students made arguments, what types of arguments did they make? To answer the second research question, I created Toulmin diagrams from the students\u2019 writing (see Chapter 3 for a detailed description). Most students\u2019 essays centered around an argument that one or both claims in the article were true and supported by the survey data. One argued that the operationalization of race and ethnicity in the study which only reported on Black, White, and Latinx Americans and ignored other identities was problematic. Table 6 \n 68 summarizes the arguments in the students\u2019 essays. Though the arguments did not all use the same words, the Toulmin analysis revealed that almost all the arguments were about agreeing or disagreeing with the authors\u2019 main claims. I provide three illustrations of students\u2019 arguments and how I used Toulmin to diagram them below. Table 6 Students\u2019 Arguments in Response to the Brookings Institution Article Argument Percent of students (n=30) Claim #1 is true and supported by the data in the article: Housing inequality has decreased because everyone is worse off. 77% Claim #2 is true and supported by the data in the article: People of color are more likely to have experienced prolonged housing hardship. 77% The article understates the hardships experienced by people of color. 20%  The first example of arguments in the students\u2019 essays focuses on the first claim of the article: that inequality is decreasing because of increasing hardships suffered by White Americans. Celeste argued that this claim is true, despite their initial incredulity. Their argument appeared early in their essay: It is difficult to understand how white people are beginning to see similar repercussions from the pandemic as POC, considering most of the time white people have the profound privilege of never having to know what these major repercussions look like. Yet the numbers and data presented in the article makes the notion much clearer and easier to acknowledge. (Celeste\u2019s essay)  \n 69 The warrant for their claim appeared later in the essay, when they used what in the class we called the \u201crate of change formula\u201d (see Chapter 4 for a description of how we taught this in the class) to compare data presented in the article (see Figure 13). Figure 2 displays that in November, there were reduced inequality gaps in delayed payment of rent/mortgage and utility bills \u201cmainly due to the delayed peak of white respondents.\u201d On the scale, we can see the number of Black respondents, from May 2020 to March 2021, going from about 13 percent to 11 percent making a decrease by about 15 percent. Hispanic respondents in the same time stays the same at the beginning and the end with spikes in between time, and finally, we see white respondents go from about 7 percent to 9 percent making this an about 28 percent increase. (Celeste\u2019s essay)  This is an example of a student \u201creading between\u201d (Curcio, 1981, 1987, 1989; Friel, Curcio & Bright, 2001) the graph and using arithmetic calculations (specifically the rate of change formula) to further interpret and highlight the most salient point \u2013 that the data is convincing at showing increased hardships for White Americans. The student\u2019s description of the relative change (bolded in the excerpt above) is evidence of their use of the rate of change calculation. The absolute difference between 13% and 11% is two percentage points, and two percentage points divided by the original 13% yields a 15% decrease. The absolute difference between seven and nine percent is also two percentage points, but two percentage points divided by seven percent yields a 28% increase. These calculations provide the warrant for their claim that decreasing inequality is indeed due to the dramatic increase in hardships faced by White Americans. The diagram of Celeste\u2019s argument can be seen in Figure 14.  \n 70 Figure 13 Brookings Institution Figure 2. Rent/Mortgage Delinquency \n Figure 14 Toulmin Diagram of Celeste\u2019s Argument \n In this second example, a student interpreted the thesis of the article in an unexpected way. Deborah wrote, \u201cThe authors explain how Black and Hispanic communities have been faced with this inequality for too long.\u201d This is slightly different from my interpretation of the article\u2019s second claim that Black and Hispanic families were more likely to face housing hardships for consecutive months, yet it essentially demonstrates agreement with the authors\u2019 second claim that Black and Hispanic Americans experienced prolonged housing hardships. Throughout their \n\n 71 essay, Deborah wrote about the main aspects of the article (the survey, the figures on housing hardship, and the figures on long-term housing hardship) with this focus. For example, in analyzing the figures on housing hardship, they used arithmetic calculations to make sense of the figures and to support their claim.  Below is an excerpt from their essay and the figure (Figure 15) they referenced.  According to figure 1, White respondents totaled 6.6% of eviction/foreclosure in November 2020, that is an increase of 1.6 percentage points since August of 2020 (5%). In this same time frame, Black and Hispanic respondents decreased, Black respondents going down approximately 1 percentage point (8%) and Hispanics going down 0.1 percentage points (7.4). This trend continued throughout the rent/mortgage and utility delayed payment due to the sudden peak of White respondents. This data proves that minorities, especially within the Black community, are facing housing hardships more than any other, that even when their statistics improve and White respondents' statistics decline, Black respondents still suffer at higher rates. This says a lot and proves the author\u2019s point fully. (Deborah\u2019s essay)  Figure 15 Brookings Institution Figure 1. Eviction/Foreclosure Risk \n \n\n 72 Deborah\u2019s argument is diagrammed below (Figure 16). Their claim that Black and Hispanic communities have suffered \u201cfor too long\u201d comes from the data in the figure on foreclosure/eviction risk. The warrant for this claim is the arithmetic calculations that Deborah uses to show that Black and Hispanic respondents\u2019 percentages were always higher. By \u201creading between\u201d (Curcio, 1981, 1987, 1989; Friel, Curcio & Bright, 2001) the data in the graph, Deborah found the absolute change in the rates between time periods for all groups by using subtraction and then described how the values for Black Americans were always higher than the other groups (again, using absolute comparisons). These comparisons are the warrant for their claim that Black and Hispanic families suffer more housing hardships than White families.  Figure 16 Toulmin Model of Deborah\u2019s Argument \n  The third example of a student's argument focuses on the sampling method used for the surveys. Nikki\u2019s argument is that the survey data might not be valid because there is not enough information on the sampling method. I have no idea if the sampling was a convenience sample or a simple random sampling. If it was a convenience sample, the statistical data would be biased because it systematically favors particular outcomes. The statistics present could be valid but because it is being obscured and inaccessible, I would not use this article as the information is unsubstantiated \u2026 all samples should be able to represent the population. \u2026 In order to determine if this article is \n\n 73 representative of the White, non-Hispanic or Black, non-Hispanic folks' housing struggles during COVID in the United States, we must know what sampling method was used for this survey. (Nikki\u2019s essay)  Nikki\u2019s argument is diagrammed below (Figure 17). Her argument contained a claim with a qualifier: \u201cThe statistics present could be valid,\u201d (my emphasis). Nikki\u2019s explanation that convenience sampling would lead to biased outcomes is the warrant for their argument.  Figure 17 Toulmin Model of Nikki\u2019s Argument \n  Overall, the students wrote arguments about the validity or persuasiveness of the claims in the article. The overwhelming majority of the students wrote arguments that agreed with the claims presented in the article. This could be because they found the source to be reliable, so they described why its claims were correct. It could be because they agreed with the article, or perhaps they thought that I, as the assignment assessor, would agree with the article and so they tried to write \u201cto\u201d their audience.  It could be because university students have a norm around researching a topic that is biased towards agreeing with the source rather than being critical of it. (Watson and Moritz, 1997).    \n\n 74 Students\u2019 Use of Statistical Literacy Practices To answer the third research question (What statistical literacy practices did students use?) I used iterative analytical memos to group students\u2019 writing according to the inferred goal, the mathematical concepts they used, and the strategies they employed. To clarify how these goals, concepts, and strategies coalesced to be a practice, I created idealized models of the two statistical literacy practices that emerged through analysis (see Figures 8 and 9). I documented students using two statistical literacy practices in writing their responses to the Brookings Institution article. These practices were Reading the Data and Critiquing Data Quality. Table 7 summarizes the students\u2019 use of these practices.  Table 7 Students\u2019 Use of Statistical Literacy Practices Statistical Literacy Practices    (Strategies and Concepts Used) Percent of Students (n=30) Reading the Data 70%    Describing data in graphs 23%    Using equivalence  47%    Critiquing visual manipulations of graphs 27%    Critiquing the type of graph used 7%    Comparing the data 23% Critiquing Data Quality 57%    Critiquing the sampling method 40%    Critiquing the use of only three racial/ethnic groups 17%  \n 75 Almost three-quarters of the students used the practice Reading the Data by describing the graphs, using equivalence to describe the data, comparing the data in the graphs, critiquing visual manipulations, and/or critiquing the type of graph used. Over half of the students used the statistical literacy practice Critiquing Data Quality by critiquing the lack of information on the sampling method or critiquing the use of only three racial/ethnic categories in the article\u2019s analysis. In the sections that follow, I illustrate the varied ways students used these practices to write arguments in response to the article.  Statistical Literacy Practice #1: Reading the Data   Students used the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data for goals such as: to make sense of the visual representations of data in the article, to critique these visual representations, and to compare the data within the graphs. Nearly three-quarters of the students (21 out of 30) used this practice. The article focused on claims supported by the evidence in five graphs, and the students\u2019 assignment explicitly asked that they write about the figures. As a reminder, the article contained three line graphs and two bar graphs displaying rates of housing hardship over time for three demographic groups. These graphs provided opportunities for students to read, interpret, and critique the authors\u2019 presentation of data. Throughout the course, we had explicitly taught students how to read graphs and some common ways that graphs can be manipulated to convey a particular message (e.g., truncated axes, stretching or shrinking intervals). Overall, students used the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data by describing the data, using the concept of equivalence to \n 76 make sense of percentages, comparing values, and critiquing both the choice of figure and manipulation of an axis.  Nearly a quarter of the students described the graphs and the data represented in the graphs. For example, Deborah, who was convinced by the authors\u2019 arguments, wrote many sentences like the one below (Figure 18 shows the line graph they referenced).  In Figure 2, rent/mortgage delinquency, the line graph shows that in August of 2020, 15% Black respondents were affected by this, as well as 13% of Hispanics and 9% of White respondents. (Deborah\u2019s essay)  Figure 18 Brookings Institution Figure 2. Rent/Mortgage Delinquency \n This student was engaging in the practice of Reading the Data by reading data from the graph and translating from the visual representation to numbers and words. They were reading the graph (Curcio, 1981, 1987, 1989; Friel, Curcio & Bright, 2001). \n\n 77 This is significant considering many students reported in my pilot study reported that they usually skipped visual representations and relied entirely on the text.   Half of students both described the visual representations of data and wrote some sort of commentary alongside these descriptions. In these sections of commentary, there was evidence of students using the practice of Reading the Data beyond reading the graph and extracting data.   For example, some students used the concept of equivalence and the strategy of estimating to reframe the data in the graphs to make sense of it. In the following excerpt, Jazmine wrote about the first set of bars in the following bar graph (Figure 19). The article also reports that 61% of respondents experienced long-haul (over the course of three months) housing hardship during the pandemic, amounting to 200,080,000 people; 69% of Black respondents, 62% of Latinos, and 58% of Whites experienced long-hauling. This means that almost two-thirds of the country, at some point during the pandemic, felt that their housing situation was in danger. (Jazmine\u2019s essay)  Figure 19 Brookings Institution Figure 5. Housing \u201cLong-Haulers\u201d by Race/Ethnicity \n \n\n 78 In this excerpt, Jazmine compared the reported percentages to the population of the United States and converted the data from percentages (as displayed on the graph) to fractions (two-thirds). This is evidence that they were engaging in the practice of Reading the Data by connecting the displayed data to both counts of people and a benchmark fraction. Jazmine demonstrated how to use two representations of the same quantity to make sense of data in a graph. Jazmine converted the 61% figure reported in the article to 200,080,000 Americans by finding 61% of the total U.S. population (approximately 320,000,000 people). They also wrote that this quantity is \u201calmost two-thirds of the country.\u201d Reframing reported quantities to simplify them or to make them more legible or meaningful and translating between counts and rates were both ideas that were emphasized in the course (see Chapter 4 for a detailed description). Jasmine\u2019s use of estimating and equivalence here is an example of how a student reframed data to emphasize and communicate information in graphs.   Students also used proportional reasoning to Read the Data. Faith, for example, did not accept the authors\u2019 claims. In their essay, Faith described the data in the Eviction/foreclosure risk figure (Figure 20) and went on to calculate relative changes in risk, (a calculation we had taught the students to do in class), to make sense of the data presented in the figure and to critique the authors\u2019 claim.  \n 79 Figure 20 Brookings Institution Figure 1: Eviction/Foreclosure Risk \n Faith began by summarizing the authors\u2019 claim that, between August and November, eviction risks decreased for Black and Hispanic respondents and increased for White respondents. They then compared the changing risks for the other months displayed and compared the relative change from one survey period to the next for different groups.  \u2026 inspecting Figure 1, we see that this is the only period with such a trend. \u2026 in the most recent period from November 2020 to March 2021, Black, non-Hispanic eviction/foreclosure risk decreased from approx. 7.9% to 6.8%, while white eviction/foreclosure risk decreased from approx. 6.6% to approx. 4.6%. So white eviction/foreclosure risk decreased by approx. (6.6 - 4.8)/6.6 % or roughly 30%, while Black non-Hispanic eviction/foreclosure risk decreased only by approx. (7.9-6.8)/7.9 % or approx 15%. So in the most recent period the percentage wise decrease was twice as big for white respondents as for Black non-Hispanic respondents. (Faith\u2019s essay)  This example illustrates how a student effectively calculated the relative change in eviction risk over time to make sense of data in a visual representation. The \n\n 80 arithmetic calculations that Faith used are evidence that they read and interpreted the data presented in the graph beyond what was written in the article. They read the graph to extract the percentages and then used the rate of change formula taught in class to compare these rates across time periods and between demographic groups. This is evidence of Reading the Data because they wrote about their interpretations of the data presented in the graph. These interpretations served as the warrant for their claim (see Figure 21) that the authors \u201ccherry-picked their data to support their claim.\u201d This is further described in the next section of their essay in which Faith continued to investigate the data in this figure, finding the relative change in eviction risk over the entire pandemic as well as the most recent period reported. They then asserted their claim that the authors\u2019 conclusion was incorrect.  So, in fact, during the entire period, there was both absolutely and percentage-wise a much larger increase in eviction/foreclosure risk for Black, non-Hispanic than for white people. This shows that one of the major conclusions of the article is not correct. The data do not support a conclusion that housing hardship inequalities have decreased. \u2026[the authors] have effectively cherry-picked a particular period that supports the thesis that inequalities have decreased due to increased white housing insecurity, even though this trend is not supported by the numbers. (Faith\u2019s essay)  In the preceding excerpts, Faith engaged in the practice of Reading the Data by reading graphs and investigating relationships between data points beyond what was presented in the text of the article.  \n 81 Figure 21 Toulmin Diagram of Faith\u2019s Argument \n  Almost every student in the study engaged in the practice of Reading the Data in some way. Some did so by using strategies such as reporting the data and describing the visuals, while others used mathematical concepts such as estimation, equivalence, and proportional reasoning (via the \u201crate of change\u201d calculation) to make sense of the figures in the article, essentially \u201creading between\u201d the data. In the following sections, I highlight two goals beyond making sense of the data that were evident in students\u2019 writing: using Reading the Data to critique visual representations and to compare data.   Critiquing Visual Representations. One goal of Reading the Data is to critique how a visual representation was manipulated. During the class, we had presented examples of manipulating graphs through truncated y-axes, and four students wrote about this type of manipulation in response to the bar graphs in the article (Figures 22 and 23). Those bar graphs are not egregious examples of truncated y-axes; the authors likely chose to display the data this way to save space and improve readability. Nonetheless, truncated y-axes can impact one\u2019s understanding of the data displayed and some students\u2019 writing focused on those axes.  \n\n 82 Figure 22 Brookings Institution Figure 4. Housing \u201cLong-Haulers\u201d \n Figure 23 Brookings Institution Figure 5. Housing \u201cLong-Haulers\u201d by Race/Ethnicity \n Essentially, the shortened y-axes create an exaggerated impression of difference between the various bars. For example, in Figure 22 \u201cBrookings Institution Figure 4. Housing \u2018long-haulers\u2019 after housing hardship experience, over time,\u201d the November \n\n 83 2020 bar appears to be twice as tall as the August 2020 bar though the actual relative increase in \u201clong-haulers\u201d from August to November was closer to 14%. In Figure 23 \u201cBrookings Institution Figure 5. Housing \u2018long-haulers\u2019 by race/ethnicity,\u201d the exaggerated difference between the White, Non-Hispanic and Black, Non-Hispanic bars in August 2020 makes the closing gap (in November and March) more dramatic.   Talia\u2019s essay was an example of a student using a claim about the visual representation as the warrant for their claim that the article was misleading.  One thing I find problematic with the Figure 4 and 5 bar graphs are the fact that they have a truncated y-axis\u2026Doing this is misleading and skews the data, by making the bar graphs on the chart appear larger than they may actually be. (Talia\u2019s essay)  Talia did not go on to explain their rationale further, and it is unclear exactly what they meant by \u201clarger than they may actually be.\u201d Nonetheless, Talia\u2019s essay shows a student making sense of bar graphs by using concepts about graphs to critique a truncated axis.  Nikki, who largely agreed with the authors\u2019 claims, wrote about the same feature of the visual representation, but did so with more explanation.  Figure 5 also starts at 40%; in August of 2020 on the graph, 47% of White non Hispanics housing long haulers experienced hardship, while 72% who experienced hardship were Black, non-Hispanic. If the graph started at 0% and not 40%, it would still portray a huge gap (47% vs. 72%) but not as gigantic as it is presented currently. This may not be a bad thing, as sometimes graphs are constructed in a way that highlights problems authors are emphasizing to get across to readers. (Nikki\u2019s essay)  \n 84 This excerpt is an example of one student critiquing a visual representation and providing a warrant for that critique. Nikki\u2019s argument (see Figure 24) focused on the spaces between the bars, exactly the aspect of the figure that is manipulated with a truncated y-axis. Her analysis that this manipulation may serve to \u201chighlight problems authors are emphasizing,\u201d is the warrant for her claim that the article is correct that Black and Hispanic respondents experienced long-term housing hardships at a greater rate than White respondents. This is evidence of the statistical concept transnumeration (Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999) because Nikki is describing how a particular representation of data communicates a particular story. She provided a further warrant in their next sentence where she used an arithmetic calculation to make sense of the authors\u2019 emphasized point.  The description for Figure 5 in the article states \u201c In August, Black respondents were 1.5 times more likely than white respondents to keep experiencing housing hardships for two consecutive survey periods\u201d which reflects the 47% for Whites, non hispanic vs. 72% Blacks, non hispanic. (Nikki\u2019s essay)  Nikki checked the authors\u2019 claim of \u201c1.5 times more likely\u201d against the data provided in the graph. While she did not describe her calculations, her use of the word \u201creflects\u201d suggests an equivalency: 1.5 times more is the same as 72% compared to 47%.  \n 85 Figure 24 Toulmin Diagram of Nikki\u2019s Argument \n  This example shows a student engaging in the practice of Reading the Data by using the concept transnumeration to describe the truncated y-axis and consider how it might have been used intentionally by the authors to emphasize their point. This example shows evidence of Nikki reading between the data because she compared data points and reading beyond the data because she was writing about the authors\u2019 purpose in presenting the data in a particular way.   Two students, who both wrote essays in which they ultimately agreed with the authors\u2019 claims, noted that the use of a bar graph for Brookings Institutions\u2019 Figures 4 and 5 was not ideal. Stella\u2019s critique was straightforward and brief.  The choice of figure\u2026is confusing, considering that figure 4 demonstrates data over time, it seems it would be easier to read this data as a line graph rather than a bar graph. (Stella\u2019s essay)  The other student, Ana, elaborated on why they found this figure problematic.  (Ana) Just by looking at the graph, it shows a category for \u201cAll\u201d on the x-axis that is supposed to show the data over time. It doesn\u2019t seem right on the graph since it\u2019s supposed to show change over time. A line graph would\u2019ve better suited this \u201cchange over time\u201d information for that is what they\u2019re used for. Bar graphs are better for categorical data, which the \u201cAll\u201d fits within.  \n\n 86 In these excerpts, both Ana and Stella engaged in the practice of Reading the Data by using their knowledge of graphs and transnumeration to critique the visual representations in the article as not being the best representation of the data. Ana\u2019s explanation illustrates how a student elaborated on their reasoning to create a warrant for their claim that a bar graph was the wrong type of graph to use to display this data (see Figure 25).  Figure 25 Toulmin Diagram of Ana\u2019s and Stella\u2019s Arguments \n  Overall, these examples show the various ways students engaged in the statistical literacy practice of Reading the Data to critique visual representations of data by describing the data, reframing the data to make sense of percentages, using arithmetic calculations to create warrants for their claims, and using transnumeration (Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999) to critique either the choice of representation or the manipulation of an axis. Comparing the Data. Another goal of Reading the Data is to compare reported data within an article or to compare reported data to data from another source. Students used the strategy of performing arithmetic calculations in a variety of ways (adding, subtracting, converting between fractions, decimals, and \n\n 87 percentages, and calculating relative change) and to compare data reported in the article.  For example, Alex calculated the relative change in the percentage of respondents experiencing eviction and foreclosure risk (see Figure 27 for calculations) as a warrant for their critical argument that the article obscured the plight of people of color in the United States (the Toulmin diagram of their argument is in Figure 28).  I input the peaks of the Figure 1 (eviction / foreclosure risk) numbers and the March 2021 numbers into the percent change equation, doing so for the Black and white populations. As demonstrated in my calculations, while the white population experienced a 33.3% change from their peak eviction / foreclosure risk to their most recent number, the Black population only experienced a 22.2% change. By doing simple math, it can be found that while the white population has been \u201cworse off\u201d due to the pandemic, their situation still improved faster than their counterparts. As such, the claim that \u201cInequalities in housing hardship declined because everybody is now worse off\u201d holds up, but still obscures a hard truth: that between these populations, one will always have it worse. (Alex\u2019s essay)  \n 88 Figure 26 Brookings Institution Figure 1. Eviction/Foreclosure Risk \n What this student called the \u201cpercent change equation\u201d is what we called \u201cthe rate of change formula\u201d in the class when teaching about the differences between absolute and relative change.6 Their work is shown in Figure 27. Essentially, they estimated the peak eviction rate (see Figure 26) for black and white respondents (9% and 7% respectively) and compared those to the most recent percentages reported. The student\u2019s rounding of 2/7 to 2/6 also reflects something taught in the class. We encouraged students to estimate quantities by rounding to \u201cfriendly numbers\u201d \u2013 nearby benchmark fractions, powers of ten, and numbers that share common factors.  \n 6 See Chapter 4 for a detailed description. \n\n 89 Figure 27 Alex\u2019s Calculations of the Relative Change in Eviction Risk for Black and White Respondents \n These calculations, which involved first extracting the data in the line graph, provided the warrant (see Figure 28) to Alex\u2019s argument that the article overemphasized the hardships of White respondents while obscuring the continued plight of Black Americans. Alex used the practice Reading the Data for the purpose of comparing data by using arithmetic strategies and the concept of relative and absolute thinking.  Figure 28 Toulmin Diagram of Alex\u2019s Argument \n Of the seven students who calculated relative changes in housing hardship indicators, all of them did so to highlight the disparities of Black and Hispanic respondents, and six of them used these calculations as warrants in their arguments that the article was \u201cmisleading\u201d or overstated the hardships of White Americans. \n\n 90 Students used the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data for goals such as: to make sense of the visual representations of data in the article, to critique these visual representations, and to compare the data within the graphs. Their use of this practice appeared most commonly in the warrants of their arguments. The students used concepts about graphs, proportional reasoning, and percents, and they used strategies such as estimating and performing arithmetic procedures such as the rate of change calculation.  Statistical Literacy Practice #2: Critiquing Data Quality The second statistical literacy practice that students used in their essays was Critiquing Data Quality. This is different from Reading the Data because it is not about making sense of and critiquing how the data is presented but instead about assessing the trustworthiness, reliability, and/or generalizability of the data itself. Over half of the students wrote about the quality of the data that the article cites. These students engaged in the statistical literacy practice Critiquing Data Quality by writing arguments about the representativeness of the sample. These arguments were supported by warrants about sampling techniques, representativeness, and the social institutions that shape, and are shaped by, data. Regardless of whether they ultimately argued that the data was sufficiently reliable, below I show several examples of how they all engaged in the statistical literacy practice of Critiquing Data Quality.  The article does not say much about the survey; one must click on a hyperlink to read a previous article that describes the survey as being distributed to \u201cnationally representative\u201d samples of over 5000 people. Some students described clicking on \n 91 this link, but only one mentioned the claim that the sample represented the U.S. population. About a third of students wrote about the lack of information in the article about the survey and sampling method. These arguments about the lack of information are summarized in Figure 29. These students argued that the results of the survey were or might be biased. The data for this claim was the lack of information in the article regarding the sampling method and the various warrants were all versions of a statistical concept that was taught in class: in order to be generalizable, sample populations must be representative of the study population.  Figure 29 Toulmin Diagram of the Common Argument Regarding Information About the Sample \n About half the students used their analysis of the survey\u2019s validity to argue that the article was an unreliable source of information. For example, Nikki\u2019s essay generally argued that the authors\u2019 description of the sample was not convincing. After reading how this survey was conducted, I have no idea if the sampling was a convenience sample or a simple random sampling. If it was a convenience sample, the statistical data would be biased because it systematically favors particular outcomes. The statistics present could be valid but because it is being obscured and inaccessible, I would not use this article as the information is unsubstantiated \u2026 All samples represent the population. \u2026 In order to determine if this article is representative of the White, non-Hispanic or Black, non-\n\n 92 Hispanic folks' housing struggles during COVID in the United States, we must know what sampling method was used for this survey. (Nikki\u2019s essay).   In this excerpt, Nikki engaged in the statistical literacy practice Critiquing Data Quality by questioning the representativeness of the sample. She was using concepts we discussed in class \u2013 particularly various methods of sample selection to critique the quality of the data.    When the students\u2019 argument was to agree with the authors\u2019 claims, about a third of the students described their critique of the data quality as an \u201carea for improvement,\u201d or their \u201cone concern.\u201d For example, Jazmine spent considerable time using arithmetic calculations to Read the Data to make sense of the percentages reported in the article by comparing these to U.S. population demographics. At the very end of their essay, they Critiqued the Data Quality by writing briefly about the survey and sampling method,  The data fits the reporter\u2019s story very well \u2026 There may have been sampling bias, depending on how the surveys were conducted, rendering my personal calculations based on the U.S. population inaccurate; perhaps more information on the surveying process would boost this data\u2019s reliability. (Jazmine\u2019s essay)  This argument and the ten others that were similar are evidence that students engaged in the statistical literacy practice Critiquing Data Quality by using the concept of statistical sampling to assess the quality of the survey results. In these cases, the students did not assume the researchers used valid sampling methods, they wanted to see the data and sampling method themselves. This suggests that while students generally wrote arguments agreeing with the authors\u2019 claims, they did not do so \n 93 uncritically (Watson & Moritz, 1997). For some students, the strong reputations of the authors and the source led them to assume the data was of sufficient quality. Two students\u2019 essays referenced a version of the same argument diagrammed in Figure 29 referring to the lack of information about the survey sample, but these two students went on to write that \u201cthe credibility of both Washington University and Brookings Institution\u201d meant they ultimately accepted the researchers\u2019 methods for producing a valid survey of a representative sample.   Five students critiqued the data quality by writing about representativeness in other ways than making an argument about the sampling methods. These students argued with the use of only three categories (Black, Hispanic, and White) to describe race and ethnicity in the US. Of these five, four wrote that they found the authors\u2019 claims convincing insofar as they applied to the groups described, but that one cannot extrapolate to the U.S. population as a whole. In general, their arguments fit the pattern diagrammed in Figure 30. They claimed that the survey was limited in its generalizability. The warrant for this claim was that there are other groups in the United States population that do not identify with these three categories. Because people who identify with other racial and ethnic were not included, the Brookings Institution article authors\u2019 claim that \u201ceveryone\u201d is worse off cannot be entirely accurate. \n 94 Figure 30 Toulmin Diagram of the General Argument Regarding Race/Ethnicity in the Article \n A typical example of this critique is Tami\u2019s essay, which largely argued that the authors\u2019 claims were well-supported by the data, they wrote: Something notably missing from this article and survey is data surrounding the housing hardships of races/ethnicities besides White, Black, and Hispanic. Though the survey claims to have gathered about 5,000 nationally representative samples, the survey \u2026 does not take into account other groups like AAPI and Native Americans (Chun et al., 2020). (Tami\u2019s essay)  The fifth student who critiqued data quality using this aspect of data quality made it a major focus of their overall argument that the data presented is unreliable. Tina wrote, \u201cit can\u2019t be reliable because it obscures the story of this issue by excluding entire ethnic communities.\u201d For this student, the exclusion of these communities represented a confounding factor in the authors\u2019 overall argument. In fact, Tina went on to argue that by limiting their analysis to these three ethnic communities, the authors were contributing to racist narratives in U.S. society. They wrote: With my background in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, I would go as far as to additionally say that this focus on black and hispanic populations compared to whites perpetuates the black-white racial binary, alienation/illegality of hispanics, and even the model minority myth (by not including Asians in the narrative about housing inequity, it makes it seem as if they don\u2019t have any issues and furthers this racist notion of Asians being \u201cthe good minority\u201d).\u201d (Tina\u2019s essay) \n\n 95  This student was not only Critiquing the Data Quality by considering the generalizability and reliability of the sample, she was also \u201cidentifying and interrogating social structures which shape and are reinforced by the data-based arguments being considered,\u201d (Weiland, 2017, p.41). She used a strategy of considering underlying social systems that inform and are informed by the data; this strategy was taught in class with two guiding questions (What\u2019s highlighted? What\u2019s obscured?) that students had the opportunity to practice throughout the term in whole-class discussions, group work, and on homework assignments.  These analyses illustrate students using the statistical literacy practice of Critiquing the Data Quality. Students\u2019 use of this practice was evident in the arguments they made about the representativeness of the sample. They supported these arguments with warrants using concepts about sampling and representativeness and using strategies for thinking about the social institutions that shape, and are shaped by, data. Regardless of whether students ultimately argued that the data was sufficiently valid, these students were all engaging in the statistical literacy practice Critiquing the Data Quality.  Discussion   This chapter explored three research questions through the analysis of students\u2019 written responses to a statistical literacy task.  1. How did students respond in writing to a news article with statistical claims, data, and visual representations of data?  \n 96 2. What arguments did students write? When students made arguments, what types of arguments did they make? 3. What statistical literacy practices did students use?  The analysis related to Research Questions #1 and #2 revealed two findings about the students\u2019 writing. First, students overwhelmingly wrote arguments that supported the claims of the article, and very few wrote arguments opposing the article\u2019s claims. Second, these arguments were constrained by both the article and the concepts we had taught in the course. These two findings are not surprising if we assume the socially-situated nature of thinking, learning, and argumentation. The ways that students responded to the task were, of course, constrained by the task and the article, as well as by the concepts, strategies, and practices that were taught in the course. There are norms around university coursework; students are expected to demonstrate what they\u2019ve learned and use the strategies, concepts, and practices taught in a course. The same assignment given to students in a completely different course on statistical literacy might yield some of the same results (e.g., students would write about the graphs because they are present in the article, they would use concepts about sampling).  That students overwhelmingly wrote arguments that agreed with the authors\u2019 claims might also be a result of the socially-situated nature of thinking, learning, and argumentation. \u201cLearning, thinking, and knowing are relations among people engaged in, with, and arising from the socially and culturally structured world,\u201d (Lave, 1991, p. 67, author\u2019s emphasis). For example, the students may have agreed with the claims \n 97 because they believed that the Brookings Institution is a trustworthy source, yet the notion of trustworthiness was constructed both in this course and in other everyday and academic settings. This corroborates prior research; most of students\u2019 experiences with data-based research is not focused on critiquing (Watson & Moritz, 1997) but rather on interpreting and communicating claims that are presumed to be correct. Students may not feel they have the agency or knowledge to critique \u201creputable\u201d sources. The Brookings Institution article was selected by the instructor and took a stance that was oriented towards equity; the students may have written that they agreed with the article because of their assumptions about expectations in the course. After all, the course is called Numbers and Social Justice, and all instruction adopted an equity-oriented point of view. Students may have felt they had to agree with the claims in the article.  These findings serve as a reminder for both teachers and researchers: what students show us they can do is not the same as what they are actually capable of. The absence of arguments that disagreed with the authors\u2019 claims cannot be construed as an inability on the part of students to write such an argument. Rather, it should be seen as a byproduct of both the task and the setting as well as the socio-culturally constructed practices in this classroom. If we want to see how students would write a disagreeing argument, we would need to explicitly ask them to do so. The third research question sought to describe statistical literacy practices in use. Because practices are, by definition, used in service of a goal, I needed to infer the purpose behind the students\u2019 use of strategies and concepts from the course. The \n 98 use of the Toulmin (2003) method enabled me to infer students\u2019 goals based on the claims they made. Through an iterative process I defined two statistical literacy practices, Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality, used by students and articulated a framework for statistical literacy in action. This framework proposes three elements of statistical literacy practices: a goal, the strategies used to achieve a goal, and the relevant mathematical and statistical concepts. However, the two particular statistical literacy practices that I described in this chapter are not a comprehensive list. They are the practices that the students in this study used in response to this task and at the end of this particular course.  The first statistical literacy practice I documented is Reading the Data. Nearly three-quarters of the study participants used this practice, in contrast to my 2020 pilot study data that found most students reported skipping graphs and relying on the prose to describe the important information. Curcio\u2019s (1981) framework of reading, reading between, and reading beyond the data in the graph is still valuable after over 40 years because Reading the Data entails reading, reading between, and reading beyond what is presented. The research literature has a variety of names for this practice (e.g., quantitative reasoning, numeracy, the \u201cquantitative core\u201d (Gal, Nicholson, & Ridgway; 2022)), yet Curcio\u2019s (1981) language most accurately describes what students did when they crafted arguments in response to reported data. The students in this study read, read between and read beyond the reported data. For example, when students calculated the relative change between two time periods, they were reading between the data. When they did so they used important mathematical \n 99 concepts like proportional reasoning and absolute and relative quantities, concepts that are essential for civic statistical literacy (Gal, 2002).   When students \u201cCritiqued the Data Quality\" they attended to \u201cdifferent types of data collection and measurement errors, technical problems, or other methodological issues that affect the credibility or validity of the data,\u201d (Gal & Geiger, 2022, p. 15). This has been described as critical thinking or having a positive disposition towards fact checking (e.g., Gal, 2002; Gal, Nicholson, & Ridgway, 2022; Ridgway et al., 2018). Yet these descriptions do not adequately describe the practice documented in this study. Many of the students showed a \u201cpositive disposition\u201d (Ridgway et al., 2018) to fact-checking by following hyperlinks to learn about the survey methodology. Yet all but two of the students failed to note that the sample was described as \u201cnationally representative\u201d in the linked documentation. This phrase is often used in descriptions of the sample populations of polls and surveys, and it means that the sample was selected using best practices such as random sampling and is sufficiently large. That so many students presumably read this description of the survey sample and continued to critique the study for being unclear about its sampling method suggests that students either do not have an understanding of this phrase or they did not believe it. The act of following the hyperlink is notable in that it shows the positive disposition that Gal and others describe, but fact-checking doesn\u2019t necessarily help students to Critique the Data Quality. Students must decide what to do with the information they find on the linked page or the fact-checking website. Therefore, I view this not so much as a disposition but as a socially \n 100 constructed practice. A positive disposition suggests a willingness to follow links and check facts, but it doesn\u2019t reflect how students will think about the information they find. A practices perspective emphasizes the goals of fact checking (to assess the quality of the data and claims) and the strategies and concepts one employs in the use of the practice.  Students used the statistical literacy practices in a variety of ways by making use of different concepts and strategies to fulfill various goals. For example, two students who both used the practice Critiquing the Data Quality did so to craft different arguments (e.g., questioning the sampling method and critiquing the exclusion of certain ethnic groups from the reported results). The three elements of statistical literacy practices defined in this dissertation (goals, strategies, and concepts) are sometimes specific to the particular practice and sometimes more general. For example, the strategy investigating the source and fact-checking information is specific to the statistical literacy practice Critiquing the Data Quality while using arithmetic calculations to read and read between data could be a useful strategy for either practice. Given a different social setting and a different task, one might see these practices used with different strategies, concepts, and goals to those described in this chapter. In the next chapter, I test this framework of statistical literacy practices using students\u2019 essays that were written in response to different, self-selected news articles. This second analysis contributes to the trustworthiness of the description of the practices in this chapter because it describes how students used the same practices in a slightly different assignment.   \n 101 Chapter 6: Analysis of Four Focal Students\u2019 Essays and Revisions In the previous chapter I documented two statistical literacy practices, Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality, that students used in response to an assigned article. In this chapter, I document how four focal students used these two practices in essays they wrote in response to self-selected articles. These \u201cNumbers in the News\u201d essays were assigned as a \u201crough draft\u201d (Essay #1 in week 2) and \u201cfinal version\u201d (Essay #2 in week 7) at the beginning and middle of the course. I analyzed students\u2019 writing using Toulmin\u2019s method to identify and describe their arguments and then documented the ways they used the statistical literacy practices by identifying concepts, strategies, and goals in their writing. I then describe how students\u2019 arguments changed with the opportunity for feedback and revision between Essay #1 and Essay #2. These analyses address Research Question 3: What statistical literacy practices did students use? and RQ3a: Did these practices change over time and with feedback and the opportunity to revise for four focal students?   In my role as the TA, I noticed several students struggled with Essay #1. These essays were due after only two weeks of instruction, and students were still grappling with what it meant to make sense of reported data and data-based claims and how exactly to respond to the prompts in the assignment. During weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6, they had many opportunities to practice making sense of reported data and to learn statistical literacy practices and various concepts and strategies in class7. As the TA, I provided written feedback to Essay #1. Through analysis, I discovered that my  7See Chapter 4 for a description of the course. \n 102 feedback focused primarily on directing students to consider their goal in using statistical literacy practices (e.g., Why compare these data points?) or encouraging them to use the strategies we taught in class to make sense of the data in the articles. As described in Chapter Four, historically, many of the students at the start of the course admitted to \u201cskipping the numbers\u201d when reading articles that contained data. My comments were meant to encourage the students to not only read and report the numbers, but to \u201cread between\u201d them (a la Curcio, 1981, 1987, 1989; Friel, Curcio & Bright, 2001) by comparing values and to \u201cread beyond\u201d them by questioning their source, what they highlight, and what they obscure.  The analysis of the students\u2019 revised essays (Essay #2) described in this chapter suggests that this feedback and the opportunity for revision may have provided opportunities for students to revisit or expand upon their initial attempts to use statistical literacy practices to make arguments in response to the data, visual representations of data, and data-based claims in news articles. This chapter is organized into six sections: in the first section, I briefly summarize the data and method for analysis; in the following four sections, I describe the analysis for each of the four focal students\u2019 Essay #1 and Essay #2. In the final section, I summarize the findings and briefly discuss implications for research and practice.  Methodology The analysis described in this chapter has two goals: to describe how students used the statistical literacy practices documented in Chapter Five in response to self-selected news articles, and to describe how their use of these practices changed, if at \n 103 all, with opportunities for feedback and revision. To answer these questions, I used the two essays from each of four focal students as well as my written comments in response to their first essays and ethnographic memos about class sessions and meetings with students.  Unlike the third essay, which was the focus for the analysis in Chapter 5 and in which all the students responded to the same article, for the first and second essays students were asked to find an article that was related to a social justice issue that they cared about and that also contained data, visual representations of data, and/or data-based claims. The first essay, the \u201crough draft,\u201d was due after only two weeks of instruction, and the \u201cfinal\u201d version, the second essay, was due after week seven.8 Not all students used the same article for the first and second essays. Some chose a different article because their first selection did not provide enough opportunities to respond to the prompts in the assignment (see Appendix 2); for example, the article might have contained only one number (e.g., a percentage of people who replied yes to a survey question) or no quantitative information at all. In my role as TA, I wrote comments on all the students\u2019 first essays, and, in these cases, I suggested those students choose a different article. All four focal students revised their original Essay #1 using the same article. My written comments9 informed my analysis of the students\u2019 essays; for example, I used these comments to infer the arithmetic calculations behind some of  8 There were ten weeks of instruction. 9 Described in more detail in Chapter 4. \n 104 the students\u2019 writing. If a student wrote about the relative difference between two data points in Essay # 2, but did not show any calculations, I inferred that they used the \u201crate of change\u201d calculation discussed in class because I had written a comment suggesting they do just that. Of the four students highlighted in this chapter, two, Rocio and Nikki, requested individual writing conferences with me in addition to my written comments on Essay #1. My notes and recollections of these meetings further informed my analysis of their writing.  The criteria for focal student selection was described in Chapter 3. Briefly, the focal students were selected based on the original study design which included pair interviews.10 Of the six students who participated in the interviews, two students chose not to revise Essay #1 and instead wrote a new essay about a different self-selected article. These students are excluded from this analysis because Essays #1 and #2 were very different, in part because the news articles they referenced offered different opportunities to use statistical literacy practices.  I read each students\u2019 Essay #1 and the article they chose at the same time, moving back and forth between them as the writing prompted me to revisit sections of the articles. I then constructed argument diagrams using the same method I used in Chapter Five. I repeated this for Essay #2 for each student. I used these diagrams to identify the concepts and strategies students used in their warrants and the goals I could infer from their claims. I then compared each students\u2019 essays by documenting changes in their arguments. These changes provide evidence that the opportunity to  10 These interviews are not analyzed in this dissertation. They will be analyzed in the future.  \n 105 revise after receiving feedback may have helped students learn to use the statistical literacy practices Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality.   Analysis of Focal Students\u2019 Essays In the following sections I present the analysis for each of the four focal students\u2019 two essays. I show how their revised essays contain elaborated warrants, stronger and clearer arguments, and multiple uses of the statistical literacy practices. Table 8 shows a summary of how the students\u2019 essays changed.  Table 8 Summary of Focal Students\u2019 Essays  Essay #1 (week 2) \u201cRough Draft\u201d Feedback type Essay #2 (week 7) \u201cFinal Version\u201d Julia No argument Written comments Contained an argument using Reading the Data in the warrant Nikki Contained an augment using Critiquing the Data Quality in the warrant Written comments and one-on-one conference over Zoom Revised warrant using Critiquing the Data Quality in the warrant Shaun Contained an argument using Reading the Data Written comments Revised warrant using Reading the Data  Rocio Contained an argument using Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality Written comments and one-on-one conference over Zoom Revised claim and warrant using Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality  One student\u2019s Essay #1 contained no argument or use of statistical literacy practices; their revised essay contained an argument in which they used Reading the Data. Two students revised their warrants between Essay #1 and Essay #2; one used Reading the Data and the other used Critiquing the Data Quality. One student revised \n 106 their entire argument, using both Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality in their warrant. Focus Student #1: From No Argument to Reading the Data to Make Claims In this first example, I show how one student revised their essay to include an argument. The student\u2019s first draft was mostly a summary of the information in their chosen article. After receiving feedback, the student wrote an argument and used the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data in her warrant. This example provides evidence that feedback and the opportunity for revision can support students in using statistical literacy practices and in analyzing data and data-based claims in news media. At the time of the study, Julia was a third-year Community Studies major. She is a Latina woman and a multilingual learner (Spanish and English). Julia transferred to the university from a two-year community college where she had successfully completed a statistics course. She regularly attended office hours to request help with the mathematics we were teaching. For the \u201cNumbers in the News\u201d assignment, Julia chose an article from The Atlantic, an American news magazine, titled, \u201cDisease Has Never Been Just Disease for Native Americans,\u201d (see Appendix 4). The article presented data in text on COVID cases and deaths in the Navajo Nation, an indigenous community living in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, and did not provide any visual representations of data. It included historical information about disease in indigenous American communities and argued that disproportionate adverse outcomes have long been the norm for this group. \n 107  In her first essay, Julia reported the data from the article; she did not write an argument or analyze the author\u2019s claims, and she wrote in several places that she did not understand what she was reporting. For example, in the following excerpt Julia referenced a section of the article that cited the mortality rate in the Navajo community. The article states, \u201cas of April 23, 1,360 infections and 52 deaths had been reported among the Navajo Reservation\u2019s 170,000 people, a mortality rate of 30 per 100,000.\u201d The source of the information is the Navajo Department of Health website. I found it confusing where they had the mortality rate 30 per 100,000. (Julia: Essay #1)  This excerpt is representative of her first essay. She quoted the article and identified the source of the data, then she commented that she \u201cfound it [the mortality rate] confusing.\u201d Immediately following this excerpt, Julia quoted the only other numbers in the article: death rates from the 1918-19 pandemic. These data were presented in a completely different part of the article. Again, she reported the data but did not comment on it in any way. It may be that she was addressing the aspects of the task (e.g., \u201cDescribe the quantitative information presented in the article,\u201d) without really writing (or perhaps thinking) about what the data mean and why the author included them. After only two weeks of instruction, Julia\u2019s first essay did not show any use of the strategies and practices we had begun to teach. Instead, her essay described the quantitative information in the article by quoting the article.  In my feedback to this first essay, I wrote comments such as \u201cI think you missed some opportunities to meaningfully engage with the numbers,\u201d and, next to \n 108 the excerpt above, \u201cA missed opportunity for some rough math!\u201d By \u201crough\u201d math, I was referring to the methods of estimating quantities using quick and simple arithmetic that we had practiced with the students in class. This feedback was related to the strategies and goals for the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data. My written comments encouraged her to look again at the numbers and to do some arithmetic (a strategy) to understand their meaning (a goal). Figure 31 Toulmin Diagram of Julia\u2019s Argument in Her Revised Essay \n  In her revised essay, Julia revisited the reported mortality rate that she had found confusing. Furthermore, she wrote an argument in which she interpreted the mortality rate. Though there were errors in her reasoning about it, her description of the mortality rate, quoted below, served as a warrant for her argument (see Figure 31) that the Navajo community \u201cfaces a continued lack of resources of support,\u201d (Julia\u2019s Essay #2).  Looking at the mortality rate that was mentioned in the article it stated that the Navajo reservation has a mortality rate of 30 of 100,000. That means that out of 100,000 people only 30 survive in the Navajo reservation. I wasn\u2019t sure about this but I did the math and understood that what the author did was divide the 52 deaths over the 170,000 population and then he multiplied by 100,000 to get the 30 people. I think it was important to also bring up the math that \n\n 109 was used later on to calculate the mortality rate because it just shows how many people survive and that number is very small compared to the people that were living prior to the mortality rate. (Julia\u2019s Essay #2)  In this excerpt, Julia described her new understanding of the mortality rate that was based on the arithmetic calculations she performed. The mortality rate is an example of a social indicator, a single number that is composed of various quantifiable factors that describes a phenomenon of interest (Gal, 2019), in this instance, the number of people who died divided by the relevant population. Julia correctly described the division, \u201cwhat the author did was divide the 52 deaths over the 170,000 population,\u201d but misstated the indicator as representing the rate of survivors, rather than deaths. This is evidence of a student Reading the Data to make sense of reported quantities by using arithmetic to interpret a rate, essentially \u201creading\u201d the numbers with improved, though not perfect, meaning for the indicator.  Julia\u2019s essays illustrate how one student used the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data and refined her meaning of a social indicator (the mortality rate). In her first essay, she only reported the data that she didn\u2019t understand. This is consistent with my experiences with the course over the years as well as my pilot study which found that students do not come to the class with a practice of Reading the Data. This also corroborates research that has found students do not have a norm of critically assessing data (Watson & Moritz, 1997). After feedback, in her revised essay, she used arithmetic calculations to make sense of a rate, and she used those as the warrant in a new argument. By using the strategy of performing arithmetic calculations (called \u201crough math\u201d in the course, Julia was reading between the data presented in \n 110 the article. Furthermore, her warrant is evidence of her developing understanding of proportional reasoning (Lamon, 1993) because she is making sense of a commonly used rate.  Focus Student #2: Critiquing the Data Quality to Revise a Warrant  In this second example I show that a student revised her initial essay to strengthen the warrant for her argument. The student used the statistical literacy practice Critiquing the Data Quality in both essays, but with feedback and the opportunity for revision, the student used the practice differently and to achieve different goals: to assess the trustworthiness of a source and to assess the accuracy of the reported data. Nikki is a Latina woman and a multilingual (Spanish and English) learner. At the time of the study, she was a third year Community Studies major. Throughout the course, the instructor and I shared with one another our appreciation of Nikki\u2019s thoughtful contributions to class discussions and her critical thinking around social justice issues. She was a student who often articulated the social systems and structures that formed the social context for the data under discussion. A transfer student, Nikki had taken and passed a statistics course at a two-year Community College. Nikki\u2019s essays were written in response to an article she chose from the Center for American Progress (a left-leaning public policy research and advocacy organization) titled \u201cLatinos Face Disproportionate Health and Economic Impacts From COVID-19\u201d (see Appendix). The article contains data in text and in graphs and argues for government intervention via a relief bill to offset the disparate impacts \n 111 faced by Latinx people. Her argument (see Figure 32) was the same in both essays: That the claims in this article are correct because the sources seem unbiased.  Figure 32 Toulmin Diagram of Nikki\u2019s Argument in Essays #1 and #2 \n The data for this claim were the cited sources of the data, and the warrant was that those sources, the U.S. Department of Labor for example, are neutral and reliable. This aspect of Nikki\u2019s essay did not change between the first draft and final version. However, in her second, revised, essay, Nikki further Critiqued the Data Quality by checking the data source cited in the article to fact check a claim. This was likely in response to my comments on her first essay and the writing conference in which we discussed her essay.   In her first essay, Nikki had largely reported the data from the article. In response to one sentence where she had written, \u201cWomen accounted for 100 percent of U.S. job losses in December, with Hispanic or Latina women alone accounting for 45 percent of that job loss,\u201d I wrote, \u201cI think you should interrogate this stat. You just drop it here, but you don\u2019t talk about it or analyze it.\u201d In our conference over Zoom, she admitted that she found the idea that women made up all the job losses in December to be surprising and improbable. Though she had determined that the \n\n 112 sources were reliable, she found the reported data itself to be questionable. In our conversation together I suggested an alternative goal: that of assessing the accuracy of the reported data. Together we decided that she might investigate the cited sources, which she had claimed were reliable, to further make sense of this statement. In the second, revised essay, Nikki used the statistical literacy practice Critiquing the Data Quality to grapple with the article\u2019s claim.  [The authors] state, \u201cWomen accounted for 100 percent of U.S. job losses in December\u2026\u201d This statistic particularly stood out to me as being a little extreme. Upon examination of the citation used from the U.S. Department of Labor, the only table that provided such information was Table B: \u2026 Below the \u201cWomen\u201d column, the unemployment rate is -0.1 in December compared to all the other categories of gender and ethnicity which were 0. This statement was likely derived from this table. (Nikki\u2019s Essay #2)  In this excerpt, Nikki went beyond assessing the data in the article based on its source and actually looked at the source material to try to understand where the 100% came from. This illustrates the statistical literacy practice Critiquing the Data Quality: Nikki did not accept a confusing piece of data at face value, despite her assessment that the source of the data was \u201crelatively neutral,\u201d but instead checked the source itself to assess the veracity of a reported statistic. She had to search through tables of Labor Department data to find the entry that pertained to the 100% figure mentioned in the article. Nikki did not write about the meaning of the 100% figure except to mention once again that it was \u201cconfusing.\u201d She did determine that because she found where the statement \u201clikely derived\u201d from, this reinforced her argument that the claims in the article are true because the sources are neutral and reliable. This is a \n 113 stronger warrant to Nikki\u2019s argument that the claims in the article are true because she used the strategy of checking the reported data at the source to determine the article\u2019s accuracy.    To summarize, analysis of Nikki\u2019s writing revealed that she engaged in the statistical literacy practice of Critiquing the Data Quality in two different ways and for slightly different goals. In her first essay, she crafted an argument in which she supported her claim that the article\u2019s claims were accurate based on an assessment of the source of the data. Assessing the source is a goal of this statistical literacy practice, and Nikki used her knowledge of government institutions to make a determination. She revised her warrant in Essay #2 when she fact-checked a reported statistic against the cited data source. This strategy supported a slightly different goal of this statistical literacy practice: that of assessing the accuracy of the reported data. Nikki\u2019s essays illustrate two strategies of this statistical literacy practice: assessing the source and fact-checking the reported data (Ridgway et al., 2018).  Focus Student 3: Revising a Warrant by Reading the Data  In the next example, I show how one student used the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data to critique a news article\u2019s claims. With the opportunity for feedback and revision, the student strengthened their warrants with more precise mathematical language and relevant arithmetic calculations. This example provides evidence that strong initial essays can still be strengthened and clarified through the process of feedback and revision.  \n 114 Shaun is a mixed-race, Black and white, man who, at the time of the study, was a first-year Film major. He had attempted a college-level statistics class earlier in his first year of college, but he had dropped it because he believed he wouldn\u2019t pass. Shaun\u2019s participation in class was notable because he was the only student who never turned his camera on but who spoke and wrote actively in the chat throughout the course. At the beginning of the course, Shaun made statements such as, \u201cthe statistics should speak for themselves,\u201d and, by the end of the course, he was a leader in discussions about how statistics influence and are influenced by societal values, methods of data collection, and the way a value is presented (e.g., as a count or a rate).   For his essays, Shaun selected a New York Times article titled \u201cFive Facts About Gun Violence\u201d (see Appendix 4) that had a clear message advocating for stricter gun laws in the United States. The article contained data presented in both text and graphs. In both his first draft (Essay #1) and the revised version (Essay #2), Shaun\u2019s main argument was that the author\u2019s data did not convince him that restricting access to guns would solve the problem of violence in America. He focused on a particular visual representation in the article (Figure 33) that showed a correlation between the rates of gun deaths and civilian-held guns.  \n 115 Figure 33 New York Times Figure: \u201cGun Deaths and Gun Ownership by Population\u201d \n  In the figure, the United States is a dramatic outlier in comparison to the other nations. Shaun critiqued this visual representation for oversimplifying the reality of gun deaths. This graph in particular may have some issues; only gun deaths are considered, not all violence-related deaths, so of course there will be more gun deaths when more guns are available. (Shaun\u2019s Essay #1)  In this excerpt, Shaun was reading beyond the data in the graph as he questioned whether the visual representation was adequate evidence to support the article\u2019s claim. He correctly interpreted the correlational message in the graph, that higher numbers of gun deaths correlated with gun ownership, and then questioned the \n\n 116 appropriateness of the representation as evidence for the need for stricter gun control policies. His use of the phrase \u201cof course\u201d emphasizes his idea that the graph is overly simplistic; gun deaths can only happen if guns are present, but the graph does not prove that the presence of guns causes an increase in gun deaths. Shaun\u2019s argument is that the article should provide comparative nation-level data on all \u201cviolence-related deaths\u201d in order to better compare nations\u2019 gun deaths. His argument shows evidence of relative thinking (Lamon, 1993) because he referenced the proportional relationship between gun ownership and gun deaths and the statistical concept of association versus causation. This student used the practice Reading the Data in a warrant for his argument (see Figure 34 for the diagram of the argument).   Since \u201conly gun deaths are considered\u201d (Essay #1), Shaun cited data from Wikipedia on \u201cintentional death\u201d rates (homicides, suicides) for the countries in the graph and cited the U.S. and Italy\u2019s rates specifically.  America\u2019s rate of \u201cintentional death\u201d (homicide, suicide) per 100,000 people per year is listed far above some of the other countries in that New York Times graph. 16.8 for every 100,000 people in America per year versus, say, Italy with 7.2 per 100,000. For America, that\u2019s a low estimate of over 50,000 intentional deaths per year. A high estimate might be over 60,000, or even higher given how many deaths go unreported. (Shaun\u2019s Essay #1 cont.)  In this excerpt, Shaun found data to test his hypothesis that the correlational message in the New York Times graph might change if all intentional deaths, not just those caused by guns, were considered. He cited rates per 100,000 people for the U.S. and Italy, and then provided estimates for the count of people per year in the U.S. who die \n 117 from intentional causes. Shaun\u2019s mathematical \u201cwork\u201d was not included in his essay, so it is impossible to say with certainty how he calculated those counts. However, converting between rates and counts was both explicitly taught and modeled throughout the course as a way to Read the Data to make sense of quantitative information.11 Using \u201crough math\u201d to make these comparisons was also modeled and practiced at nearly every class meeting and was included on homework assignments. I can only conjecture as to how he might have arrived at 50,000 to 60,000 as his estimate. If I were to solve the problem, I might use 320 million as an estimate for the U.S. population, and then, taking orders of magnitude into account, multiply 16 x 3,200. This type of strategy was regularly practiced through Number Talks during Discussion Sections, and many students became adept at performing such calculations mentally.12 Shaun\u2019s use of the word \u201cestimate\u201d in his essay, along with providing a range for the true count, suggests he may have used rough math to come to these numbers.  These calculations were the warrant for his claim that the author\u2019s data does not support the argument that restricting guns will ultimately solve America\u2019s violence problem. So it is therefore true that not only are there more gun deaths in America but there are also simply more deaths, and limiting access to guns \u2026 only alleviates the problem and does not solve it. The real problem is that the government does not provide for its citizens, and thus people are subjected to poor mental health and  11 See Chapter 4 for a full description. 12 If I were solving this, I would begin by removing the two zeroes and saving them for the final product. Then, I would convert 16 x 32 to 8 x 64. I would then use partial products to find (8 x 60) + (8 x 4). This gives me 51,200. \n 118 an inability to provide for themselves or their families, turning to crime to get by. (Shaun\u2019s Essay #1)  Shaun\u2019s argument is diagrammed below (see Figure 34). His use of the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data is evident in the warrant for his claim. Using the data provided in the article, Shaun read beyond the graph to critique the correlational argument presented by the article. He then cited Wikipedia as further evidence to support his critique of the visual representation as insufficient evidence to claim that restricting access to guns will solve America\u2019s violence problem because America has more intentional deaths than other countries. Implicit in his argument is the concept of confounding or lurking variables (Moore, 1998; Schield, 2009); he suggested that there may be other causes for the high rate of gun deaths in the U.S. beyond the presence of guns.  Figure 34 Toulmin Diagram of Shaun\u2019s Argument \n As the TA, I provided feedback on Shaun\u2019s first essay. In addition to many positive comments, I suggested that he revise his analysis to better support his argument. The addition of the counts of U.S. deaths did not necessarily support Shaun\u2019s argument well. It was possible that it was only included because the assignment required that students \u201cdo something\u201d with the numbers they encountered to demonstrate their learning in the class. My feedback suggested that he might \n\n 119 compare the rates of intentional deaths between nations. This relates to one of the strategies for the practice Reading the Data: comparing values to make sense of and critique data-based claims. In response to his claim that reducing access to guns will only alleviate, and not solve, the violence problem, I commented, \u201cHow much? What percent of those deaths in the U.S. involve guns? Can you make an educated prediction based on the data you have?\u201d These comments were meant to highlight the reasons why a person might use arithmetic calculations to read the data; in other words, they highlighted a goal of this practice. Shaun\u2019s first essay showed evidence of arithmetic calculations; it did not contain evidence that these calculations were used to make sense of or critique statistical claims. Thus, a student used a strategy (doing calculations with the data) taught in class without a goal related to statistical literacy practices.  In the revised version of this essay (Essay #2), Shaun further developed the warrant for his argument. He began by articulating why the New York Times figure is flawed. The graph seems like a bad representation of the extent of violence in these countries. Gun deaths will most likely always be proportional to the amount of guns available. (Shaun\u2019s Essay #2)  This is a more precise statement than the one in Shaun\u2019s first draft because it used the concept of proportionality explicitly rather than inferentially. His warrant was strengthened by this revision because the backing is more clear and referenced a canonical mathematical concept. He went on to describe his Wikipedia research, but in the revised essay, Shaun not only reported the estimates of the counts of intentional \n 120 deaths per year, but also described the proportion of all intentional deaths that are caused by guns in the US.   America\u2019s rate of \u2018intentional death\u2019 (homicide, suicide) per 100,000 per year is listed far above some of the other countries on the graph. 16.8 for every 100,000 people in America per year versus, say, Italy with 7.2 per 100,000. That\u2019s an estimate of around 50,000 to 60,000 intentional deaths in America per year, with gun deaths comprising about 70% to 80%. (Shuan\u2019s Essay #2, excerpt 2)  Again, Shaun\u2019s mathematical \u201cwork\u201d is not included in his essay, but he may have used \u201crough math\u201d to estimate what percentage of all intentional deaths involved a gun, presumably by referencing the number on the New York Times figure. It is not clear if Shaun used the estimated counts to calculate the 70\u201380%, or if he used the reported rates. The Wikipedia data of 16.8 per 100,000 could be compared to the New York Times\u2019 rate of around 120 per million.13 If Shaun used the counts, he might have estimated the count of gun deaths in the U.S. and compared that to their estimate of 50,000 to 60,000.14 Again, Shaun\u2019s use of the word \u201cestimate\u201d and the range (70\u201380%) he provided suggests he may have been using the practices modeled in class. Regardless, Shaun\u2019s essay shows evidence of relative, not absolute, thinking (Lamon, 1993), as he compared two associated sets to determine the percentage of gun-related intentional deaths. These calculations served as a stronger warrant than those in  13 Divide 120 per million by 10/10, then estimate 12/16.  14 There are about 320 million people in the U.S., so 320 times 120 will give the count. Then estimate 38,400/50,000.  \n 121 Shaun\u2019s first essay because they explicitly connected back to the gun data and argument presented in the article.  Shaun concluded Essay #2 with a reiteration of his claim that the article\u2019s argument that gun control will solve America\u2019s violence problem is flawed.  Gun control, however, does not seem like a comprehensive strategy. Further research that breaks down by the cause, frequency, general region, etc. would lead us closer to the source of the problem\u2026 The problem is too often simplified with basic, easily understandable, sensationalized statistics\u2026The way we frame a problem influences where we go to find its solutions. (Shaun\u2019s Essay #2)  This argument illustrates Shaun\u2019s use of the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data. He read beyond the graph to critique it for implying a, possibly spurious, correlation and used arithmetic calculations and data from a secondary source to conclude that the claims in the article were not entirely supported by the data presented. With the opportunity for feedback and revision between the first and second essay, Shaun elaborated on his warrant using more relevant arithmetic calculations that better supported his claim because they connected directly to the data in the article. Focus Student 4: Revising an Argument with Statistical Literacy Practices  This fourth, and final, example shows how a student\u2019s claim and warrant changed after receiving feedback. In the first essay, the student used Critiquing the Data Quality and Reading the Data as the warrant for their claim that the author\u2019s position was correct, though their warrant did not actually support this claim. After receiving feedback from me in my role as the TA that was focused on the student\u2019s \n 122 goals in using statistical literacy practices, the student revised both their claim and warrant to make a stronger and clearer argument. This example illustrates how feedback and revision supported one student in creating arguments and using statistical literacy practices for new goals.   At the time of the study, Rocio was a second-year Film major. She is a Latina woman and a multilingual learner who speaks Spanish and English. Rocio was an enthusiastic participant in class meetings, always kept her camera on, and both spoke and wrote comments in the chat. Rocio had not taken any college-level statistics or mathematics courses before, and she came to my Zoom office hours often for help on the homework assignments. For the two essays, Rocio chose an article (see Appendix 4) published by GLAAD, an American organization that monitors the media for defamatory representations of the LGBTQIA+ community. The article presents the results of an audit of over 100 television episodes\u2019 depiction of transgender people and argues that they were misrepresented as being either victims or villains. In her first essay, Rocio\u2019s analysis focused primarily on the article\u2019s claim that transgender people are misrepresented because they were portrayed as sex workers in 20% of the episodes audited. She used the statistical literacy practice Critiquing the Data Quality when she consulted other articles to \u201csee if more than one source has the same statistical research.\u201d In the following excerpt, she cited an article that described a survey of transgender people in the U.S. and Read the Data she found there in an unclear way. In the article with GLAAD, it is shown that 20% of transgender characters are depicted as sex workers and \n 123 in the article, \u2018Decriminalizing Prostitution is Central to Transgender Rights,\u201d it is analyzed that 19% of trans people have been involved with sex work. Having (20%+19%)/2=0.195 shows a very tiny amount of difference of this representation. Both of these numbers are very close by but the the main concept of these statically numbers is to represent how the unfairness towards transgender people led them to be unemployed and have less opportunities to carry on with their lives. (Rocio\u2019s Essay #1)  In this excerpt, Rocio used the statistical literacy practice Critiquing the Data Quality by consulting another source of information on the topic of transgender people and sex work. The second source, a survey of transgender people, reported that 19% of respondents had engaged in sex work\u2014essentially the same percentage that the GLAAD article reported as a misrepresentation in the media. Her claim, based on the two data sources, was that negative representations in the media create an environment that pushes transgender people into sex work (see Figure 35).  Figure 35 Toulmin Diagram of Rocio\u2019s Argument in Essay #1 \n The warrant for her claim is the arithmetic calculation in which she worked with the 20% from the GLAAD article and the 19% from the other source. It seems that she found the average of the two percentages when she wrote \u201c(20%+19%)/2=0.195.\u201d Her reasoning is unclear in the warrant as she wrote about the \u201cdifference\u201d in the \n\n 124 rates and not the mean that she had calculated. She also wrote that the \u201cnumbers are very close by,\u201d which suggests she might have compared the percentages absolutely (a one percentage point difference), which is appropriate when comparing how close two rates are to one another, but her written arithmetic calculations did not clearly support this warrant. In my role as Teaching Assistant, Rocio and I met to discuss her essay. In this meeting, I asked her to explain her calculations, but she said she didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d done that arithmetic. One reason might be that the task urged students to \u201cdo some math\u201d and so she did just that without having a clear goal as to why she was doing a calculation. One of the goals of Reading the Data is to compare two values, and we discussed what calculations would better explain her warrant that the two sources reported very similar results. At the time of this conversation, I was very focused on encouraging students to critique their articles\u2019 authors\u2019 use of data to support claims. It is only through analysis that I noticed that Rocio\u2019s first claim, that the negative portrayals in the media created discriminatory conditions for transgender individuals, potentially forcing them into sex work, was an interesting and reasonable argument. At the time, my feedback was focused on the idea that GLAAD was claiming misrepresentation while a survey found the same rate in the population.  I therefore encouraged Rocio to reflect on why GLAAD cited the 20% statistic as a misrepresentation in light of the evidence in the survey article that found 19% of transgender people have engaged in sex work. She expressed hesitation to negatively critique the article because she believed that transgender people in America face \n 125 discrimination, and the article supported that stance. I encouraged her to view her critique as an act of allyship and advocacy for better journalism on a topic she cared passionately about.  In her revised essay (Essay #2), she crafted a new argument (see Figure 36) that critiqued the article for an anti-sex work bias.  GLAAD has analyzed statistics that revealed a misrepresentation towards transgender people, but is it actually? Or is GLAAD trying to offend transgender people by the work they participate in? (Rocio\u2019s Essay #2)  These questions illustrate Rocio\u2019s argument that GLAAD\u2019s claim that 20% is a misrepresentation is incorrect and potentially offensive. In the revised essay, Rocio used the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data in her revised warrant that more clearly compared the two rates.  Analyzing the 20% that GLAAD found to be an offensive representation towards transgender people and having the actual 19% off a survey constructed with transgender people, it is shown that there is only a 1 percentage point difference\u2026 This is a 1 in 5 ratio, being 20 out of 100 trans people in both percentages and GLAAD could have possibly thought that the number would\u2019ve been smaller and assumed it was a negative portrayal towards trans people working as sex workers. (Rocio\u2019s Essay #2)  In this excerpt, there is evidence that Rocio Critiqued the Data Quality by comparing data from multiple sources. The warrant for her argument is clearer than in Essay #1 because she compared values and interpreted that comparison; she described the \u201c1 percentage point difference\u201d between the two statistics, and she made connections between equivalent forms (1 in 5, 20 out of 100) to support the warrant that the two \n 126 values are almost the same. Comparing data is an example of reading between the data. Converting between equivalent forms of ratios was modeled in class as a way to make sense of a number, put it in perspective, and/or communicate it simply and memorably to others. This revision also shows evidence of relative thinking (Lamon, 1993) and estimation. She rounded 19% up to 20% and then used equivalent ratios to argue that the rates are essentially the same. Rocio demonstrated understanding that a percent is a special kind of ratio, and she needed to use multiplicative reasoning to make this comparison between rates. She used this reasoning about rates to clearly explain her revised warrant. Finally, her revised argument contains another strategy for Critiquing the Data Quality: considering the author\u2019s bias. Rocio\u2019s statement, \u201cGLAAD could have possibly thought that the number would\u2019ve been smaller and assumed it was a negative portrayal towards trans people working as sex workers,\u201d (Essay #2) is evidence that she was thinking about why the author presented the data that they did. Figure 36 Toulmin Diagram of Rocio\u2019s Argument in Essay #2 \n Rocio repeatedly engaged in the statistical literacy practices of Critiquing the Data Quality and Reading the Data. In the first essay, she consulted a second source to verify the data, which is one goal of Critiquing the Data Quality. In our meeting, \n\n 127 she expressed uncertainty about how to think about the information she found while consulting the second source. The revised essay showed increased clarity in her description of the warrant, a revision to her claim, and additional uses of the statistical literacy practices. This example illustrates how opportunities to revise supported one student\u2019s use of statistical literacy practices and helped her elaborate an argument.   Discussion  This chapter further examined the third research question (What statistical literacy practices did students use?) by analyzing four focal students\u2019 use of the practices described in Chapter 5 in response to self-selected news articles. Did they use the practices Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality? What strategies and concepts did they use? Because the students wrote two versions, and received feedback between, it is also possible to examine whether and how four focal students\u2019 use of these practices changed over time and with feedback and the opportunity to revise?  The students in this study learned to use statistical literacy practices through instruction, group work, homework problems, feedback, and opportunities for revision. The four focal students highlighted in this chapter used the statistical literacy practices Critiquing the Data Quality and Reading the Data in their essays for various goals and in multiple ways using concepts and strategies taught in class. These are summarized in Table 9 along with a description of the feedback they received on their rough drafts. Consistent with the findings in Chapter 5 and with research, the affordances of the articles the students chose and their interpretations of the task influenced whether and how they used the practices. An article that reported \n 128 the results of a survey, for example, afforded different opportunities to Critique the Data Quality than did an article that cited government data. Feedback and revision provided opportunities for students to revisit or expand upon their initial attempts to use statistical literacy practices to craft arguments in response to the data, visual representations of data, and data-based claims in the news articles. Feedback and instruction focused on the goals and strategies of the statistical literacy practices and seemed to have an impact on students\u2019 revised warrants and arguments.  Both Rocio and Nikki Critiqued the Data Quality by fact-checking the reported data. Ridgway, Nicholson, Gal, and Ridgway (2018) describe fact-checking in terms of a \u201cpositive disposition\u201d towards statistics as opposed to believing that statistics are all lies or, conversely, represent some undeniable truth. Both students\u2019 difficulty interpreting the results of the fact-checking suggests there is more to this strategy for Critiquing the Data Quality than having a positive disposition. After receiving feedback, Rocio used the practice Reading the Data to support her interpretation of the data she found when she consulted a second source. This corroborates the findings from Chapter 5 that fact-checking requires a goal and further suggests that students may need support to decide how to think about the information they find when they fact-check reported data. Analysis of Shaun\u2019s use of statistical literacy practices provides an elaboration on the statistical literacy practices described in Chapter Five. He used several concepts to Read the Data with goals of making sense of the data, critiquing a visual representation, and comparing data. Furthermore, Shaun\u2019s Essay #1 and #2 illustrate a \n 129 way a student can critique how dominant cultural narratives can be perpetuated by statistical arguments in the media (Weiland, 2017). His critique of the New York Times graph showing the correlation between the rate of gun ownership in a nation and gun deaths was ultimately a critique of how gun-control regulations dominate the media narrative, and this narrative does not offer sufficient solutions.  Finally, the analysis of how Julia used Reading the Data illustrates how students may need support around understanding social indicators and making sense of reported data in news articles. This corroborates research that suggests students draw conclusions from data in school assignments without considering whether these conclusions make sense (Pfannkuch & Wild, 2004). With support and instructor feedback, Julia described how the author had constructed the mortality rate, but her essay reflected a struggle to make sense of this indicator in the context of COVID deaths in the Navajo community. For students who are used to \u201cskipping the numbers\u201d the statistical literacy practice Reading the Data may be the most important first step in learning to use statistical literacy practices.    \n 130  Table 9 Summary of Focal Students\u2019 Use of Statistical Literacy Practices Across Two Essays  Essay #1 (week 2) \u201cRough Draft\u201d Feedback focus Essay #2 (week 7) \u201cFinal Version\u201d Julia No evidence of SLPs SLP: Reading the Data Goal: To make sense  Strategy: Using \u201crough math\u201d SLP: Reading the Data Goal: To make sense  Strategy: Using \u201crough math\u201d Concept: Social Indicators Nikki SLP: Critiquing the Data Quality  Goal: Assess source Strategy: Using background knowledge SLP: Critiquing the Data Quality  Goal: Assess accuracy of reported data Strategy: Fact checking source SLP: Critiquing the Data Quality  Goal: Assess accuracy of reported data Strategy: Fact checking source Shaun SLP: Reading the Data Goals: Critique data-based claims, Critique visual representations  Strategy: Using \u201crough math\u201d  Concepts:Relative thinking, Association, Confounding variables SLP: Reading the Data Goal: Compare values    SLP: Reading the Data Goals: Critique data-based claims, Critique visual representations, Compare values  Strategy: Using \u201crough math\u201d  Concepts:Relative thinking, Association, Confounding variables Rocio SLPs: Reading the Data & Critiquing the Data Quality  Goal: Compare data Strategies: Checking another source, Using \u201crough math\u201d SLP: Reading the Data Goal: Compare data Strategy: Using \u201crough math\u201d   SLPs: Reading the Data & Critiquing the Data Quality  Goal: Compare data Strategies: Checking another source, Using \u201crough math\u201d Concept: Equivalent values  Rocio, Nikki, Shaun, and Julia all revised their first essays, and analysis of these revisions provided evidence that feedback and opportunities for revision \n 131 allowed students to learn how to use two statistical literacy practices. In their revised essays, all these students created or refined the warrants to their arguments, crafting more precise and stronger arguments. Furthermore, the process of feedback and revision allowed them a second chance to use statistical literacy practices in the same context and perhaps to clarify the requirements of the task itself (e.g., students knew they were expected to \u201cdo something\u201d with the numbers they found in their articles but may not have been clear on the goals). The resulting revised essays showed how students refined their use of these practices and assessment of what students know and can do was improved. The rough draft essays were a type of formative assessment that guided both class instruction and the feedback students received on their essays. This supports the research on formative assessment (e.g., Burkhardt & Schoenfeld, 2019) that describes how student learning is supported when teachers use formative assessments. Much of the research on statistical literacy with students offers snapshots of one-time tasks which necessarily limit what students will do. This has important implications for adopting a strengths-based approach to teaching and researching students\u2019 learning. One might assume a student can\u2019t do something or doesn\u2019t know something when in fact they may not have seen the need to use a particular strategy or concept in response to a task. A next step in supporting students in developing statistical literacy might be to design formative assessment cycles for statistical literacy practices that offer students the opportunity to repeatedly use these practices to make sense of and critique data, visual representations of data, and data-based claims in the media.  \n 132 Finally, these findings suggest a question regarding the use of \u201crough math\u201d as a useful strategy for students to make sense of reported data. While most school-based statistics instruction focuses on procedural fluency (Bakker & Derry, 2011), the strategy of using \u201crough math\u201d to estimate quantities and relationships between quantities may lower the stakes of getting a precise and correct answer and instead help focus students\u2019 attention on sensemaking. Three of the four students highlighted in this chapter used this strategy, and all needed support (via feedback focused on their goals) to use \u201crough math\u201d in a way that moved beyond just performing calculations for their own sake to doing so as part of a statistical literacy practice.   \n 133 Chapter 7: Discussion, Conclusion, and Implications   The purpose of this study was to examine students\u2019 use of statistical literacy practices in an undergraduate course on statistical reasoning. The online course was designed for non-STEM majors and students who had historically struggled in mathematics courses. Students wrote three essays over the ten-week term that asked them to analyze the use of data in news articles about social justice topics. Essays #1 and #2 were written in response to self-selected news articles containing data, data-based claims, and visual representations of data. Essay #2 was an opportunity to revise Essay #1. Essay #3 followed the same format as the first two essays except the students responded to an article selected by the course instructor. As the course Teaching Assistant, I graded all the essays and gave the students written and, in some cases, verbal feedback on their first essays.  The following research questions guided this study: 1. How did students respond in writing to a news article with statistical claims, data, and visual representations of data?  2. What arguments did students write? When students made arguments, what types of arguments did they make? 3. What statistical literacy practices did students use?  a. Did these change over time and with the opportunity to revise for 4 focal students?   \n 134 Summary of Findings  To answer the first research question, I examined students\u2019 Essay #3 written in response to the instructor-selected article. The purpose of this first question was to understand students\u2019 responses \u201con their own terms\u201d (Moschkovich & Brenner, 2000) by documenting what they chose to write about. Students\u2019 writing clustered into four topics that were influenced by the content of both the assigned article and the course instructional activities. The students\u2019 essays focused on four topics: the source of the article (The Brookings Institution), the sampling method used to collect survey data, the article\u2019s focus on only three racial/ethnic categories, and the graphs. As suggested by both theory and research (Lampert & Cobb, 2003; Vygotsky, 1980), the students followed the social norms of a university course by writing about the ideas we had discussed in class.   The underlying purpose of the second research question was to systematically describe the students\u2019 writing. I used Toulmin\u2019s (2003) method to identify the students\u2019 arguments. The students overwhelmingly wrote arguments that agreed with claims in the article rather than arguments that were critical of the authors\u2019 conclusions. That is not to say that the students did not critique parts of the article, only that the overall stance in their essays was to agree with the article. This agreement has several potential sources including the norms around authoritative texts, students\u2019 personal beliefs about the topic, and norms around the instructor as the audience for the essays.  \n 135  Analyzing students\u2019 arguments in this way was an important methodological tool. First, creating argument diagrams proved to be a tool for helping me to notice the students\u2019 strengths in their writing. Though I set out to adopt a strengths-based perspective, the first several times I read through the students\u2019 essays I focused on their mistakes and misconceptions. Many students seemed only to report the data in the Brookings Institution article, and I despaired of finding evidence of statistical literacy practices in their writing. It was through the act of looking at each essay in its entirety and diagramming the overall argument of each essay that I began to see how students were using concepts and strategies in service of goals. The diagrams helped me to see the proverbial forest and not get distracted by each individual tree. Furthermore, using Toulmin as an analytical tool helped me to identify and focus on the arguments the students were making, not the arguments I thought they should have made. Through that analysis, I was able to meet the students where they were and uncover their strengths.  The Toulmin argument analysis also provided me with a means to uncover the mathematical and statistical concepts, the strategies, and the goals that students used. These were almost never explicitly stated by students and instead were inferred through analysis. Concepts and strategies appeared in the warrants of the arguments, and goals were revealed in the students\u2019 claims or in the interplay between their claims and warrants. Essentially, the claims revealed why they were using concepts and/or strategies.  \n 136  This Toulmin analysis also made it possible to answer the third research question about mathematical practices. I identified the statistical literacy practices students used by looking at the concepts, strategies, and goals that students used in their arguments. Two practices were evident in their essays: Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality. I created models of these statistical literacy practices that are grounded in the students\u2019 writing. Figures 37 and 38 summarize the practices and the concepts, strategies, and goals that students used with each practice.  I then used these models to analyze four focal students\u2019 first and second essays (written in response to a self-selected news article) to see if and how students used these practices when responding to different articles and to document any changes in their arguments after revising. The statistical literacy practices appeared in all but one essay (Julia\u2019s Essay #1). This suggests that these practices may be generalizable to other contexts in which people encounter data, data-based claims, and visual representations of data in the media. At the very least, these practices reflect the focus of the class and the ways students appropriated these practices, concepts, and strategies.  \n 137 Figure 37 Idealized Statistical Literacy Practice: Reading the Data \n Figure 38 Idealized Statistical Literacy Practice: Critiquing the Data Quality \n The final research question (3a: Did students\u2019 use of statistical literacy practices change over time and with the opportunity to revise for 4 focal students?) documented how students revised their initial essays after receiving feedback. All \n\n 138 four students\u2019 received feedback that suggested strategies and focused on goals. For example, I advised Shaun to use \u201crough math\u201d (a strategy) to compare (a goal) all intentional deaths in a nation to gun-related deaths. All four revised essays showed that students learned to use the statistical literacy practices in their revisions. This suggests that both time in the class and receiving feedback supported students\u2019 learning to use these two statistical literacy practices.  Connection to the Literature  This study builds on others (e.g., Ben-Zvi & Garfield, 2004; Zapata-Cardona, 2018) that used real-world data based on social examples. The students responded to contemporary news articles that used data in reporting on topics related to social justice. This is important because statistics education, like mathematics teaching generally, has traditionally struggled with atomistic teaching (Bakker & Derry, 2011) in which students are given a \u201ctoolkit\u201d of statistics concepts and procedures to master. Using messy, imperfect, real-world data might have benefits. First, students must decide which statistical concepts and strategies are appropriate given the affordances of their article. Rather than simply using a strategy or applying a concept because it is the current topic of instruction, students must choose for themselves what are the appropriate strategies and concepts. Second, real-world data is almost never as perfect an example of a concept as the realistic found in many textbook exercises. A normal distribution in the real world, for example, rarely mirrors the perfectly smooth bell curve most students are exposed to in textbooks. If students only ever encounter \n 139 idealized versions of distributions, they will be less prepared to make sense of messages when they encounter them.  This study also builds on others that have sought to define statistical literacy (Gal, 2002, 2019; Ridgway et al., 2018; Weiland, 2017) as what people need to know, do, think, and believe in order to make sense of and critically analyze data-based messages. These lists of skills, knowledge, and dispositions are based on the knowledge of experts who examine the landscape of data in people\u2019s everyday lives and compile a list of everything they imagine one will need to make sense of it. Analyzing statistical literacy through the sociocultural lens of mathematical practices uncovered more precisely what students need to learn. This analysis focused on goals and organized the complex lists of knowledge, skills, and dispositions into clusters of students\u2019 goal-directed activity. This clustering is especially important for instruction because it encourages both the students and the instructor to focus on goals instead of a list of procedures.  The statistical literacy practices documented in this dissertation were evident in students\u2019 responses to a written assignment. Practices were analyzed in terms of goals (why am I doing this?), strategies (how am I doing this?), and concepts (what mathematical and statistical ideas do I need?). This study documented two statistical literacy practices, Reading the Data and Critiquing the Data Quality, and described the concepts, strategies, and goals students used when engaging in each practice. There was some overlap in the concepts and strategies students used for each practice. For example, students used the strategy of using \u201crough math\u201d and the concepts of \n 140 equivalent quantities and relative thinking for both practices. What makes each practice different are the goals, and often very different goals can be achieved through similar strategies or concepts. This practice-based analysis focusing on goals provides a holistic perspective on statistical literacy. This approach is different to creating an exhaustive list of every concept, skill, or belief that we imagine might be important for a person to be statistically literate. Instead, the important distinction is not between different skills or concepts but between different goals, or reasons, for acting for a few central practices. Suggestions for Future Research   One limitation of this study is that statistical literacy practices were analyzed using almost identical tasks, the \u201cNumbers in the News\u201d essay prompt. Though examining the use of practices when students responded to different articles was a form of triangulation, more research is needed to understand what other statistical literacy practices exist and how they are used in a wider variety of contexts.   Furthermore, the sample size for examining feedback and revision was very small. It would be interesting to see whether the patterns of these two practices exist in other students\u2019 essays, in other populations, and in other contexts.  Implications for Practice This study and the course in which it was set can serve as a model for statistics instruction. Mathematics education researchers and policymakers have encouraged teachers to abandon the \u201cone right way to do math\u201d and instead encourage multiple pathways to problem solving (California Mathematics \n 141 Framework; the Common Core State Standards in the United States, 2010; NCTM, 1989). As research and policy recommendations generally continue to move towards the interconnectedness of mathematical concepts and procedures and the necessity of making connections between representations, procedures, and concepts, the reality in many classrooms has remained somewhat fixed with a pedagogical approach best summed up as, \u201cLearn all these separate concepts and procedures. Now you know math and/or statistics.\u201d This study provides an example of how teachers can adopt a more integrated approach to teaching statistics that prioritizes learning for action and using concepts and strategies in pursuit of statistical goals.  Writing assignments that are problems, as opposed to mathematics \u201cexercises\u201d (Schoenfeld, 1992), may be a powerful tool for helping students learn statistics concepts and connect those to goals. Writing requires that both students and instructors slow down in a way that discussions cannot. Mathematical reasoning in writing can more easily be examined, discussed, and revised than spoken words which vanish unless recorded. Furthermore, writing assignments encourage feedback and revision, which this study suggests can help students improve their arguments.  Because this study used a strengths-based lens to uncover and document statistical literacy practices in action, I did not look for one particular correct answer in students\u2019 writing. The task was open-ended enough to allow students some leeway in how they interpreted the assignment, in what sections of the article they wrote about, and in what statistical literacy practices (as well as the goals, concepts, and strategies) they used. In my feedback to students\u2019 Essay #1, I was responsive to their \n 142 ideas rather than simply looking for a particular correct answer. This approach may be a good model for classroom teachers, but they would need support in interpreting and knowing how to build on their students\u2019 contributions. Adopting a strengths-based view of students\u2019 learning does not mean accepting any answer. Instead, it is a shift in what the instructor pays attention to and prepares to build on in subsequent lessons. Rather than focusing only on students\u2019 errors, the instructor builds on students\u2019 strengths to determine how to support growth.  Giving students more choice in choosing topics could better support their engagement. Using real-world sources of data as opposed to textbook examples might also help students to think through the implications of their reasoning (Gresalfi, 2015) and go beyond simply reporting the data to thinking about what the data actually means in its particular context.  There may also be value in using \u201crough math.\u201d One could hypothesize that teaching students imprecise ways to calculate such as \u201crough math\u201d that focus on estimation might help them attend more to the meaning of the data they are reading and writing about because it both eliminates some of the cognitive load that precision demands and lowers the stakes so that they can focus on using their everyday knowledge and intuitions to reason about data.  Implications for Equity  This study provides evidence that students who have previously struggled in mathematics and statistics courses, students who have been neglected or harmed by math teachers and who describe themselves as hating math and \u201cskipping the \n 143 numbers\u201d when reading articles, can successfully learn to use statistical literacy practices to make sense of data, data-based claims, and visual representations of data in news media. In Chapter 4, I described the story of a student who designed and conducted a survey of their classmates and used that data to write a persuasive email to the instructor advocating for a decreased workload. This is an example of student learning: they appropriated practices taught in class for their own goals and used data that they thought would convince their audience. Clearly this student was engaging in statistical literacy. This study shows that focusing instruction and feedback on goals, giving students the opportunity to write and revise, and using social justice topics can support students who have previously struggled. Rather than provide remedial lessons in basic skills to struggling students, instructors can give statistics meaning by inviting students to critically examine data-based claims about topics they are passionate about. Focusing on goals and practices can also move instruction away from a focus on a long list of disconnected procedures.   \n 144 Appendices Appendix 1: Example Homework Problems \n   (5 points) Here\u2019s a bit of news and fund-raising solicitation that I received last year from the Swing Left people; they work to elect Democrats and progressives at all electoral levels. In relation to a Wisconsin Supreme Court election on April 7, 2020 the Wisconsin Swing Left field director, one Jared Launius, wrote,   \u201cAfter a week of waiting, and despite the Republicans\u2019 blatant attempts to suppress voters and steal an election, the results are in: progressive Judge Jill Karofsky has won a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat by a crushing 11% margin!\u201d   Here are the returns:   \n\n 145    My question to you:  In his report of the election returns, was Launius right?

In roughly 2 pages plus references, analyze this article: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/04/30/inequalities-in-housing-hardship-declined-because-everybody-is-now-worse-off/. Follow the same format you used in previous Numbers in the News assignments, reprinted here for your convenience. 1. Identify the source, including its credibility. 2. Briefly summarize the topic and theme of the article, establishing the social justice context and stating clearly what is the authors\u2019 point of view? 3. Describe the quantitative information presented in the article, including how it was presented (statement, table, figure or graph, interactive figure or graph, etc.), the source of the material, and what you found powerful or interesting or confusing or problematic about it. Be ready to quote directly. Do some calculations of your own to check or develop the meaning of the numbers cited. 4. In general, critically analyze the role and quality of the numerical information. For example, could it have been presented more clearly or meaningfully? How well do the data fit the reporter\u2019s story? Is anything about it incomplete or misleading (biased)? What assumptions do the authors make and are there explicit or hidden? Is there anything you\u2019d have done to improve the presentation of data? In sum, in what ways does the quantitative information serve the reader\u2019s (your) understanding of the justice issue/s? If you find the article to do an excellent job from a numeracy perspective, say so and point out what they\u2019ve done to bring you to that conclusion. 5. What additional information would help you make sense of the information that\u2019s reported? Identify a question or two. Do a simple calculation or two to make deeper sense of the material. If it\u2019s \u2018denominator information\u2019 that would extend or clarify the context and you can find that denominator, do it \u2013go get the information\u2014and write about it; that would be great! Cite your sources in-text and at the end of your essay (References). 6. In sum, what value did you derive from carefully assessing the quantitative information in the context of the overall article? And/or, what questions do you have, that you think other students might have too, when it comes to understanding the material (head to toe)? Then, as you review your writing \u2013 (plan on editing your work!) \u2013 ask yourself: 1. What does this number represent? Who does it represent? 2. Does it seem correct? Is there any way I could check? \n 150 3. What does the authors\u2019 reporting this number in this way highlight? What does it obscure? 4. Is this a lot? Compared to what? 5. So what? Why does it matter (or not)?    \n 151 Appendix 4: Links to articles  Brookings Institution Article https://www.brookings.edu/articles/inequalities-in-housing-hardship-declined-because-everybody-is-now-worse-off/#:~:text=In%20June%2C%20we%20reported%20that,COVID%2D19%20pandemic%20stretched%20onward.  \u201cLatinos Face Disproportionate Health and Economic Impacts From COVID-19\u201d https://www.americanprogress.org/article/latinos-face-disproportionate-health-economic-impacts-covid-19/  \u201cFive Facts About Gun Violence\u201d https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/briefing/gun-control-suez-canal-ship-vaccine-astrazeneca.html#:~:text=The%20toll%20approaches%20pancreatic%20cancer's,or%20Alzheimer's%20(about%20125%2C000).  \u201cVictims or Villains: Examining Ten Years of Transgender Images on Television\u201d https://glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television/  \u201cDisease Has Never Been Just Disease for Native Americans\u201d https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/disease-has-never-been-just-disease-native-americans/610852/   \n 152 Works Cited Bakker, A., & Derry, J.

Osborne1, Samuel S. Malloy2, Erik C. Nisbet3, Robert M. Bond4 & \nJoseph H. Tien5*\nUnderstanding how different online communities engage with COVID\u201119 misinformation is critical \nfor public health response. For example, misinformation confined to a small, isolated community of \nusers poses a different public health risk than misinformation being consumed by a large population \nspanning many diverse communities. Here we take a longitudinal approach that leverages tools from \nnetwork science to study COVID\u201119 misinformation on Twitter. Our approach provides a means to \nexamine the breadth of misinformation engagement using modest data needs and computational \nresources. We identify a subset of accounts from different Twitter communities discussing COVID\u2011\n19, and follow these \u2018sentinel nodes\u2019 longitudinally from July 2020 to January 2021. We characterize \nsentinel nodes in terms of a linked domain preference score, and use a standardized similarity score \nto examine alignment of tweets within and between communities. We find that media preference is \nstrongly correlated with the amount of misinformation propagated by sentinel nodes. Engagement \nwith sensationalist misinformation topics is largely confined to a cluster of sentinel nodes that \nincludes influential conspiracy theorist accounts. By contrast, misinformation relating to COVID\u201119 \nseverity generated widespread engagement across multiple communities. Our findings indicate that \nmisinformation downplaying COVID\u201119 severity is of particular concern for public health response. \nWe conclude that the sentinel node approach can be an effective way to assess breadth and depth of \nonline misinformation penetration.\nThe proliferation of online misinformation has presented a challenge to public health throughout the COVID-\n19  pandemic1, and is characterized by broad demographic and geographic  reach2. Misinformation exposure \nreduces adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)3 and consequently has driven negative health \noutcomes in groups with high exposure to such  content4. The U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory declar -\ning health misinformation a \u201cserious threat to public health\u201d5. The significant potential for misinformation to \ndrive behavioral change such as vaccine  hesitancy6,7 underscores the importance of identifying and mitigating \nCOVID-19 misinformation.\nAssessing the public health risk posed by specific types of misinformation is challenging in the low signal-\nto-noise environment of social media platforms, which are key mechanisms for COVID-19 misinformation \n spread8,9. Since March 2020 tens of millions of tweets regarding COVID-19 have been posted  daily10,11, of which \nonly a fraction contain misinformation. Developing techniques for researchers and public health officials to \nidentify misinformation that is circulating online as well as to distinguish which types of misinformation should \nbe addressed quickly is of critical importance.\nLarge-scale repositories of COVID-19 related tweets provide important resources for identifying COVID-19 \n misinformation2,12\u201314. The computational demands of working with these large datasets are, however, consider -\nable, and determining which tweets correspond to misinformation is not straight forward. Moreover, a seem-\ningly large volume of false or misleading COVID-19 content does not necessarily imply broad engagement. The \nbreadth and depth of COVID-19 misinformation are important considerations: misinformation confined to a \nsmall, isolated group of users has different public health ramifications than misinformation being consumed by \na large portion of the population across different communities and demographic groups.OPEN\n1The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. 2Glenn College of Public Affairs, The Ohio State University, \nColumbus, OH, USA. 3School of Communication, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. 4School of \nCommunication, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. 5Department of Mathematics, The Ohio State \nUniversity, Columbus, OH, USA. *email: tien.20@osu.edu\n2\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:9832  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12450-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/Here, we describe a longitudinal, network-based approach to characterize the breadth of online engagement \nwith specific misinformation topics. We focus on Twitter, an important platform for the dissemination of content \nand influencing opinion, including COVID-19  misinformation2,15,16. Twitter has a natural network structure, for \nexample through retweets, followership and co-linkage to other domains. We utilize this network structure to \ndetect so-called \u2018communities\u2019 , tightly-knit groupings of users and accounts, discussing COVID-19 on Twitter. \nCommunities play a particularly important role in the propagation of online content. Content sharing within \ncommunities is a key mechanism for exposure to and amplification of  viewpoints17,18, and provides important \ncontext for breadth of misinformation penetration. Incorporating community structure and other network \nfeatures into misinformation monitoring efforts can thus enhance the detection of false or misleading content \nthat has the potential to become broadly disseminated and to drive behavior change.\nFrom each community we selected and monitored a subset of accounts, referred to as \u2018sentinels\u2019 , from July \n2020 to January 2021. This borrows from an epidemiological concept known as sentinel  monitoring19, in which \nsampling sites are chosen based on their ability to both represent a key population and their production of  data \nthat is of a known and consistent quality. Objectives of epidemiological sentinel monitoring include detecting \npresence and patterns of disease  occurrence19. Analogously, we define sentinel accounts here as a subset of online \naccounts that can be used to detect the presence and patterns of content within online communities. Sentinel \nnodes are thus used to identify and characterize the types of content circulating within online communities. In \nthe context of misinformation on social media platforms, sentinel nodes provide a way to assess both the depth \nand breadth of misinformation penetration. Note that there are many possible ways to select sentinel nodes from \na given community. Here we select a subset of influential nodes from each community to use as sentinel nodes, \nas a majority of Twitter content is driven by a small subset of  accounts20. Thus, there is some overlap between the \nselection of sentinel accounts and opinion leadership within the constituent online communities. The concept \nof sentinel accounts is, however, distinct from that of opinion leaders, and other selection criteria for sentinel \naccounts may yield sentinels that are not themselves influential but are nonetheless useful for monitoring and \ndiagnostic purposes.\nSentinel communities were characterized according to the link sharing behavior of their constituent accounts. \nTwitter community structure has been observed to be highly assortative with respect to media  preferences21, \nwhich have been shown to be correlated with attitudes regarding COVID-1922,23. Characterization of communi-\nties in terms of media preference allows for the establishment of baseline metrics for the propensity to engage \nwith and propagate COVID-19 misinformation, and comparison of tweet similarity across the media preference \nspectrum. This is critical for assessing breadth of misinformation penetration, including identifying consequen-\ntial events where specific false or misleading content propagates from a fringe group that regularly engages in \nconspiracy theories to a more mainstream community.\nThis structured \u2018sentinel node\u2019 approach provides a way to compare tweets across segments of the Twitter \necosystem and identify misinformation topics with broad penetration, while only requiring modest data storage \nand computational resources. Further, our longitudinal approach helps address issues with selection bias and \ntemporal changes in phrase and hashtag usage that can be problematic for cross-sectional  studies24.\nWe find evidence that the linked-media preferences of the sentinel accounts is strongly correlated with their \npropensity to post COVID-19 misinformation. Accounts linking predominantly to right-leaning domains tended \nto post more COVID-19 misinformation than those linking predominantly to left-leaning domains. Importantly, \nwe observe that sensational topics were largely confined to a subset of conspiracy minded communities, while \nmisinformation on COVID-19 severity was much more widespread. This includes a large \u2018virality\u2019 event that \nappears to be catalyzed by former President Donald Trump. These results indicate that perceived COVID-19 \nseverity is of particular concern for public health.\nResults\nBefore describing our empirical results we briefly overview our methods, which are described in further detail \nbelow (see \"Methods \" section). Sentinel nodes were identified as prominent accounts within communities from \nthe retweet network among accounts posting about COVID-19 (see Methods section \"Sentinel recruitment and \ndata collection\"). We then categorized the political valence of each community by examining patterns of link-\ning to external websites (see Methods section\u00a0\"Sentinel community characterization using linked domains\"). \nTweet content was characterized by topic and cluster by a set of human coders (see Methods section\u00a0\"COVID-\n19 misinformation by cluster\"). Next, tweets containing content about vaccines or the severity of COVID-19 \nwere identified using a set of keywords that were commonly used to discuss these topics during the period of \nobservation (see Methods section \"COVID-19 vaccines and disease severity content\"). Finally, we examined \ninter-cluster content spread by examining the similarity in the text of tweets across communities over time (see \nMethods section\u00a0\" Flagging inter-cluster content spread\").\nTwitter communities and sentinel node identification. A query for tweets containing the term \n\u2018covid\u2019 yielded 168,950 tweets (74% retweets) sent on May 27, 2020 by 142,331 unique accounts (Methods, Sec-\ntion\u00a0 \"Sentinel recruitment and data collection\"). We constructed a weighted, directed graph with adjacency \nmatrix A, where Aij is the number of times that account j retweeted account i. The in-degree of node k is thus the \nnumber of times that k was retweeted, and the out-degree of k equals the number of times that k retweeted other \naccounts. Here we say that account i retweeted account j if account j was the original poster of the retweeted con-\ntent. We excluded self-loops (self-retweets). The largest connected component of this \u2018retweet network\u2019 , denoted \nG, contained 78,680 nodes and 87,030 total retweets.\nModularity maximization using a Louvain  method25 yielded 148 communities in G , ranging in size from \n5,641 to 6 nodes (Methods, Section\u00a0\"Sentinel recruitment and data collection\"). Let C  denote the largest 28 \n3\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:9832  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12450-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/communities comprised primarily of English-speaking, domestic accounts. Each community in C  contained at \nleast 429 nodes, from which we selected the 15 most-frequently retweeted accounts as sentinel nodes  to follow \nlongitudinally. Note that the in-degree distribution for G  has a heavy tail: the 15 most highly retweeted nodes \nin a community account for on average 84% of the total number of times that nodes in that community were \nretweeted (median 86%; interquartile range 77% to 96%). We will refer to the set of sentinel nodes as S , and the \nsentinel nodes drawn from community c  in G  as Sc.\nTo examine robustness of the community assignments, we constructed a second retweet network \u02dcG based \nupon the same search term over a second, later time interval (June 8-9, 2020). While 35% (148/420) of the sen -\ntinel nodes from G  were present in \u02dcG , all of the 28 communities in S  were represented in \u02dcG (in the sense that at \nleast one node from each community in S  was present in \u02dcG ). The Rand index comparing the Louvain-detected \ncommunities for nodes common to both G  and \u02dcG was 0.96 (z-score 897.7)26, indicating significant correlations \nin the community structure of G and \u02dcG and consistent with robustness in the community structure of the Twitter \nconversation regarding COVID-19 over this time period.\nThe most recent 3200 tweets posted by each sentinel node in S  were collected at least once per week between \nJuly 1, 2020 and January 6, 2021, yielding a dataset of all 4,130,909 tweets posted by the sentinel nodes over this \ntime period, with the possible exception of deleted tweets.\nSentinel community characterization using linked domains. We characterized sentinel communi-\nties through the domains shared in their tweets posted from 7/1/2020\u201310/3/2020. We used principal compo-\nnents analysis (PCA) to derive a linked domain score for each of our sentinel communities. Notably, we made no \nassumptions on the bias or reliability of the shared domains, so any correlation between the linked domain score \nwith COVID-19 misinformation is not a contrivance of the dimension reduction process.\nThe 2,152,849 tweets posted from 7/1/2020 - 10/3/2020 contained 706,564 links. Of these, 147,510 linked to \nTwitter and 44,529 were shortened, yielding 514,525 non-shortened links to 8624 distinct non-Twitter domains. \nPCA on the domain frequency matrix (Methods, Section\u00a0\" Sentinel community characterization using linked \ndomains \") from each of the 28 communities in C  resulted in the distribution of domains along the first princi-\npal component value shown in Figure\u00a0 1. Note that media sources with conservative-leaning partisan scores as \ndescribed  in27 are associated with positive first component values (eg. foxnews.com, oann.com), while more \nliberal media sources are associated with negative entries (e.g. motherjones.com, washingtonpost.\ncom). A table of the domains associated with the 30 most positive and negative first principal component values \nis given in the Supplementary Materials. In the remainder we will refer to the first PCA score as the \u2018Left\u2019 / \u2018Right\u2019 \nlinked domain score.\nLeft / Right linked domain scores for each sentinel node community are shown in Fig.\u00a0 2. While hierarchical \n clustering28 results in a dendrogram in which the highest silhouette score (0.894)29 corresponds to two clusters, \nwe instead chose a dendrogram cut producing three clusters (silhouette score of 0.737) as seen in Fig.\u00a0 2. The \ncommunities in the \u2018Right\u2019 cluster were skewed to the left due to disproportionate sharing of a domain connected \nto a single sentinel node in each \u2018Right\u2019 community. Repeating the PCA and clustering process after removing \nFigure\u00a01.  Distribution of linked domain first principal component entries by Media Bias Fact Chart (MBFC) \n categories27. 38% of linked domains from sentinel nodes were listed in MBFC as either Left, Center Left, Center, \nCenter Right, or Right, and 9% were listed as either Pro Science, Questionable, Conspiracy, or Satire. Treating \nthe political categories as an ordinal variable with \u2018Left\u2019 being equivalent to 1, \u2018Center Left\u2019 = 2, \u2018Center\u2019 = 3, \n\u2018Center Right\u2019 = 4, and \u2018Right\u2019 = 5, there is a correlation of 0.66 between the first PCA value and the political tilt \nof the domains represented.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:9832  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12450-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/these two domains shifted the \u2018Right\u2019 communities approximately 10 units to the right on the linked domain \nscore, while the \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Far Right\u2019 clusters exhibited negligible differences in their Fig.\u00a0 2 positioning (see \nSupplementary Materials). The dendrogram following removal of these two domains resulted in three clusters \nhaving the highest silhouette score (0.814).\nThe cluster in Fig.\u00a0 2 with the most negative inter-cluster average linked domain score contained several \nDemocratic politician accounts, while the cluster with the most positive inter-cluster mean score contains some \nRepublican politician accounts. Profiles in the most positive cluster were, on average, about seven times more \nlikely to post tweets containing strings associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory (e.g. \u201cqanon\u201d , \u201cwwg1wga\u201d , \n\u201cnew world order\u201d) than acounts in the other two clusters (see Supplementary Materials). We thus labeled the \ncluster with most positive average score as \u2018Far Right\u2019 and the cluster with most negative average score as \u2018Left\u2019 . \nThe remaining cluster contained accounts associated with mainstream conservative media pundits. When com -\nbined with the additional cluster analysis described above, this led us to label the final cluster as \u2018Right\u2019 .\nCOVID\u201119 misinformation by cluster. To compare COVID-19 misinformation prevalence in tweets \nfrom the Left, Right and Far Right clusters, we randomly sampled 1,151 tweets stratified by cluster and topic. \nThe four topics examined were COVID-19 mortality, masks, hydroxychloroquine, and Plandemic. Tweet identi-\nfication utilized a substring search (Methods, Section \"COVID-19 misinformation by cluster\").\nFigure\u00a0 1 indicates that the \u2018Conspiracy\u2019 and \u2018Questionable\u2019 media bias categories tended to be associated with \nmore positive (Right-leaning) linked domain scores, suggesting that tweets containing misinformation may be \nmore prevalent in the Right and Far Right clusters. To test whether prevalence differed between clusters, we \ndeveloped a coding sheet with factual background information on the most common false or misleading claims \nassociated with the aforementioned topics (see Supplemental Material). Four human coders employed the refer -\nence sheet to individually annotate ( 1=misinformation, 0= no or unsure) whether each tweet presented mis-\ninformation. Coding results yielded a Krippendorff \u2019s alpha of 0.73, indicating adequate inter-coder  reliability30.\nThe summative results of the human coding are presented in Table\u00a0 1. In total, 14.4% of the tweets from \nthe Left cluster on these four topics contained misinformation, compared to 85.1% and 88.2% of tweets \nfrom the Right and Far Right clusters, respectively. This difference between the three clusters was significant, \n\u03c72(2,N=1151)=563.3, p<.001 , rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference in misinformation prevalence \nbetween clusters. Additional analysis indicated the difference in misinformation prevalence between the Right \nand Far Right clusters was not significant, \u03c72(1,N=790)=1.7,p=n.s. . There was substantial variation in \nFigure\u00a02.  Sentinel communities projected onto the first component of the linked domain PCA space.

As described in Section\u00a0\"COVID-19 misinforma-\ntion by cluster\", there is high prevalence of misinformation regarding COVID-19 mortality specifically and \nCOVID-19 severity more broadly in tweets posted by the Right and Far Right clusters of accounts. Abundant \nonline vaccine misinformation has also been  documented14. COVID-19 severity perceptions and vaccina-\ntion decisions are related: perceived risks of infection versus vaccination factor into vaccination  decisions31,32, \nand polls indicate that perceived low risk of severe outcome is a potentially important rationale for vaccine \n hesitancy32.\nTweets about vaccines and COVID-19 severity from sentinel nodes were obtained by filtering COVID-related \ntweets on associated keywords and phrases. Example keywords and phrases included \u2018death rate\u2019 , \u2018fatality rate\u2019 , \nand \u2018confirmed cases\u2019 for COVID-19 severity, and \u2018vaccine\u2019 , \u2018pfizer\u2019 , \u2018moderna\u2019 , and \u2018johnson and johnson\u2019 for \nvaccinations. These two topics were further subset with additional keyword and phrase filters to identify tweets \nconcerning vaccine hesitancy, vaccine misinformation, and tweets that downplayed COVID-19 severity. Example \nkeywords and phrases included \u2018will not take\u2019 for vaccine hesitancy, \u2018change dna\u2019 for vaccine misinformation, and \n\u2018lower than flu\u2019 and \u2018mild\u2019 for downplaying severity. Complete lists are given in the Supplementary Materials.\nThe COVID-19 severity substring search returned 27,832 tweets from the Left, 1997 from the Right and 7377 \nfrom the Far Right. Of those, 1322 Left, 372 Right and 1831 Far Right tweets contained phrases associated with \ndownplaying COVID-19 severity. The vaccination substring search returned 22022 tweets from the Left, 1781 \nfrom the Right and 4298 from the Far Right. Of those, 933 Left, 165 Right and 528 Far Right tweets contained \nvaccine hesitancy phrases, while 312 Left, 19 Right and 401 Far Right tweets contained vaccine misinformation \nrelated phrases.\nFigure\u00a0 3 compares tweet rates between communities for tweets concerning vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, vac-\ncine misinformation, COVID-19 severity, and downplaying severity. For each topic and community, we first \ncompute the tweets per active account day for that cluster by dividing the total number of topical tweets by the \nnumber of active account days (Methods, Section\u00a0\"Sentinel recruitment and data collection\"). We then scale this \nquantity for community i  by dividing the tweets per active account day for i  by the sum of the tweets per active \naccount day across all communities. This quantity is labeled the scaled per capita tweet rate for community i . \nEach row of Fig.\u00a0 3 shows the scaled per capita tweet rates for a given topic.\nWe observed tweets containing vaccine hesitancy phrases across each cluster, though relatively few com-\nmunities in the Left engaged with this topic. Further examination of vaccine hesitancy tweets from the Left  \nindicates that the majority of these tweets were commenting on \u2018experimental\u2019 clinical trial progress for vaccine Table 1.

Phrases used for topic identification are \ngiven in the Supplementary Materials.\n6\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:9832  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12450-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/development, rather than expressing hesitancy to vaccinate. Vaccine misinformation and severity downplaying \ntweets were largely confined to the Right and Far Right. By contrast, scaled per capita rates for all vaccine and \nseverity tweets were highest for the Left. We thus observe selective higher engagement on vaccine hesitancy, vac-\ncine misinformation, and downplaying severity from the Right and Far Right, despite lower engagement overall \non vaccine and COVID-19 severity tweets compared to the Left.\nPerceived COVID-19 severity. A time series of daily tweets containing phrases downplaying COVID-19 \nseverity aggregated by cluster is shown in Fig.\u00a0 4. We observe sustained high volume from the Far Right (red) \nand Right (orange) throughout the study period. We also observe occasional spikes, for example at the end of \nAugust. These \u2018bursts\u2019 are considered further in Sect.\u00a0\"Flagging inter-cluster content spread \".\nWidespread posting of tweets downplaying COVID-19 severity was observed across Right and Far Right com-\nmunities, indicating cluster-wide engagement with the topic as opposed to engagement restricted to a handful \nof communities. For all but one of the communities in the Right and Far Right clusters, more than 15% of the \ntweets about COVID-19 severity contained phrases associated with downplaying COVID-19 risk. The proportion \nof COVID-19 severity tweets that downplayed COVID-19 risk was over 70% for one community in the Right.\nA majority of downplaying tweets from the Right (59%) and Far Right (75%) contained phrases connected to \nthe questioning of reported incidence and death statistics (Methods, Section\u00a0\"COVID-19 vaccines and disease \nseverity content \"). An inspection of these tweets reveals that both clusters tended to use words like \u201covercount\u201d , \n\u201cinflated\u201d and \u201cfalse positives\u201d . They also highlighted various comorbidities identified in the Centers for Dis-\nease Control (CDC) death statistics as the true causes of death. Further, a large fraction of tweets downplaying \nCOVID-19 severity from the Right (47%) and Far Right (30%) contained phrases downplaying illness severity \nat the individual level. Such tweets tended to emphasize the survival rate for someone that contracts COVID-19. \nThese results suggest that the perception that COVID-19 does not have a serious impact on the morbidity and \nmortality of the population or those individuals that contract the disease is not confined to a small subset of \ncommunities, but is widespread among the Right and Far Right clusters.\nVaccines\nSentinel node tweets about COVID-19 vaccinations include both misinformation (e.g. \u201cthe COVID vac-\ncine will alter your DNA \u201d) as well as vaccine hesitant sentiments (e.g. \u201cthe vaccine was rushed\u201d). Both have the \npotential to undermine public vaccination campaigns. Figure\u00a0 5 shows daily tweets by cluster containing vaccine \nmisinformation phrases (Top) and vaccine hesitant phrases (Bottom) over the study period (Methods, Sec-\ntion\u00a0\" COVID-19 vaccines and disease severity content\").\nTweets containing vaccine misinformation phrases were largely confined to the Far Right, which exhibited \nmultiple days with high vaccine misinformation engagement relative to the other clusters. Three communi-\nties accounted for more than 70% of all Far Right vaccine misinformation tweets, suggesting heterogeneous \nengagement with such content. Inspection of these tweets indicates that vaccine misinformation content was \nnot dominated by any one narrative. Subtopics for vaccine misinformation tweets from the Far Right are given \nin Table\u00a0 2. Apart from those tweets related to \u2018Plandemic\u2019 (a conspiracy theory not solely confined to vaccines), \nno single topic accounts for greater than 15% of the vaccine misinformation space.\nVaccine hesitancy tweets were more widespread among the Right and Far Right clusters compared with the \nLeft (Fig.\u00a0 5, Bottom). There are several days on which both these clusters engage with hesitancy content. Notably, \nthese days occur both before and after Pfizer\u2019s November announcement of efficacy results from their phase 3 \ntrial. The percentage of vaccine-related tweets containing vaccine hesitancy phrases was comparable pre- and \nFigure\u00a04.

The Far Right\u2019s tweets were more likely to use phrases suggesting that the poster will not \ntake the vaccine or urging others not to take the vaccine ( 38% of their total vaccine hesitant tweets compared to \n6% for the Right), while the Right was more likely to mention reports of adverse reactions ( 42% of their hesitant \ntweets compared to 13% of the Far Right).\nFlagging inter\u2011cluster content spread. Figure\u00a0 6 (Top) shows trigram cosine similarity between pairs \nof clusters over time (Methods, Section\u00a0 \"Flagging inter-cluster content spread\"). The inter-cluster similarity \nbetween the Left and the other two clusters is nearly zero for all but a handful of days. By contrast, the Right \nFigure\u00a05.

Removal of topical tweets resulted in burst scores below the flagging \nthreshold, consistent with the high burst scores on flagged days being driven by their spread. More in depth \ninformation including detailed examination of flagged days can be found in the Supplementary Materials.\nTopical tweets from flagged days show three themes: downplaying COVID-19 severity (e.g. doubting CDC \nreporting statistics and questioning the validity of COVID tests), tying of COVID-19 to positions of the Repub-\nlican party from the 2020 presidential election (i.e., opposition to mail-in ballots and deriding politicians critical \nof Donald Trump), and news associated with Donald Trump\u2019s COVID-19  diagnosis35 and subsequent departure \nfrom Walter Reed Medical  Center36. The highest burst score corresponds to a topical tweet on August 30, 2020 \nrelated to CDC reporting of COVID-19 death statistics. This is noteworthy, given the sustained posting of tweets \ndownplaying COVID-19 severity by the Right and Far Right throughout the study period (Section\u00a0\" COVID-19 \nvaccines and disease severity content\"), and motivates further examination of content associated with the August \n30, 2020 flagged day in Fig.\u00a0 6 (Bottom).\nExample: inter-cluster spread event. The high burst score on August 30, 2020 (Fig.\u00a0 6, Bottom) was driven \nby tweets claiming that the CDC had \u2018quietly updated\u2019 COVID-19 death statistics indicating that only 6% of \nthe deaths previously categorized as being due to COVID-19 were actually caused by COVID-19, while the \nremaining 94% were caused by underlying  conditions37. Figure\u00a0 7 plots cumulative tweets on this topic from \neach cluster normalized by the number of communities in the cluster. Initial tweets occur in the Far Right, with \nearly amplification within the Far Right corresponding to tweets linking to or retweeting the Twitter account of \nthe Gateway Pundit (cyan dashed line). Other studies have identified the prominence of the Gateway Pundit on \nTwitter generally and among fake news domains  specifically38. A subsequent amplification event occurs follow-\ning a retweet by Donald Trump (black dashed line) of a known QAnon account on this  topic37. The Right then \nbegins to post on this topic. In this example, we thus observe a misinformation pathway that begins in the Far \nRight, includes accounts associated with conspiracy theorists, and subsequently spreads to more mainstream \ncommunities following amplification by an influential node.\nDiscussion\nThe structured, data-light approach we have taken to monitoring COVID-19 misinformation is, to our knowl -\nedge, distinct from other published misinformation monitoring approaches to date. Online communities within \nsocial media platforms vary widely in their posted  content39. The presented framework for longitudinal monitor -\ning of sentinel nodes selected from online communities can support early detection of content and narratives \nmoving across communities, including noteworthy events such as content migration from a community with \nextremist tendencies into communities closer to the mainstream. This approach complements panel-based lon-\ngitudinal studies that can be conducted at scale with regards to demographic information such as age, gender, \nFigure\u00a07.

Here we use influential accounts within each community as sentinel nodes, as previous \nwork has shown that COVID-19 online content  generally20 and COVID-19 misinformation  specifically16 is \ndriven by a small set of influential accounts. We note that other criteria for sentinel node selection, such as a \nmixture of influential and randomly selected accounts, may also be desirable for detection and characterization \nof circulating content within communities. Principled selection of accounts translates into modest data require-\nments: we collected 4,130,909 tweets posted by 420 accounts over the six month period. By contrast Chen et. \nal.12 pulled 764,613,007 COVID-19 related tweets over the same time frame. Although collecting more data \nmay sometimes be preferable, doing so increases the costs of monitoring and makes monitoring for the spread \nof misinformation more complex.\nThe polarization of the U.S. electorate, the ramifications and connections with interactions and content on \nsocial media, and the politicization of the COVID-19  pandemic40\u201342, have been extensively documented. Our \nfinding that accounts sharing right-leaning domains more frequently posted COVID-19 misinformation com -\npared with accounts sharing left-leaning domains is consistent with other  studies9,22,23,38,43, and demonstrates a \ncorrelation between sharing right-leaning media on Twitter and sustained posting of COVID-19 misinformation. \nThis is of particular concern given the influence of these sentinel accounts for COVID-19 discourse on Twitter. \nWhile causal relationships between media exposure and polarization are actively  debated44,45, polarization has \nbeen shown to impact compliance with recommended  NPIs46\u201348, and polling data suggests that it will be detri -\nmental to mass vaccination  efforts6,49.\nTranslation of misinformation exposure to public health impact depends upon many factors, including extent \nof misinformation penetration, specific misinformation content, and demographic characteristics and social \nenvironment of the misinformation  consumer50. Loomba et\u00a0al6 demonstrate in an experimental setting that \nrecent exposure to COVID-19 misinformation can produce statistically significant decreases among individu -\nals\u2019 intent to vaccinate, although both the nature of the false or misleading content and the demographics of the \ninformation consumer can amplify or dampen this effect. The measurable impact of misinformation on vaccina-\ntion rates is consequential given the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Misinformation \nthus presents a critical threat in the persuasion of the vaccine hesitant, who play a key role in the direction and \nduration of the pandemic.\nSensationalist narratives have been the focus of much discussion and do indeed present a potential risk to \npublic health: among misinformation narratives presented to respondents, Loomba et\u00a0al. find the claim that \nthe COVID-19 vaccine would alter host DNA to be associated with the largest decrease in vaccination intent of \nthe misinformation types  considered6. Hotez et\u00a0al51 include \u2018genetically modified humans\u2019 in their primer for \nhealthcare providers for correcting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. We found that the genetic alteration, \nmicrochips, and Plandemic COVID-19 conspiracy theories were largely confined to Far Right communities, and \ndid not garner widespread cross-cluster support. However, there was widespread penetration of misinformation \ndownplaying COVID-19 severity, including cross-cluster propagation of content claiming manipulation of CDC \ndeath counts. These latter findings are consistent with survey  results50 and other Twitter  studies52 which indicate \nwidespread misconceptions of COVID-19 severity both online and offline.\nThe prevalence of tweets downplaying COVID-19 severity across both the Right and Far Right clusters has \npublic health implications. Romer and  Jamieson53 found that belief that the CDC exaggerated COVID-19 sever -\nity was associated with decreased vaccine willingness, and surveys released slightly after our observation period \nended (February 2021) suggest that perceived COVID-19 severity is a key factor in an individual\u2019s decision to \n vaccinate54,55. Signaling from many accounts that COVID-19 is not a severe disease, despite reputable evidence \nto the contrary, could instill this position in Twitter users that consume our sentinels\u2019 content, especially if social \nmedia is their primary news  source3,22. This may be particularly true if perceived vaccine risks outweigh the \nperceived risks from  infection31.\nOur sentinel approach is flexible, and can be extended to other topics and platforms (given data availability). \nThe basis of the method consists of identifying subsets of nodes in online communities, and using these nodes \nto examine content similarity over time between communities or clusters of communities. We have intention-\nally taken a simple approach to measuring content similarity, using cosine similarity of trigrams. This technique \ncaptures similarity driven by overlap in words (and thus, for example, captures retweet-driven similarity), but \nwould not capture similarity of tweets using different words to express related content. Using approaches such \nas  word56\u201358 or tweet  embeddings59 to address this is an area for future work.\nImportantly, this analysis addresses the broader case of misinformation, which we consider to be false or mis-\nleading content regardless of intent, as opposed to the subset of misinformation known as disinformation which \nrefers to intentionally disseminated false or misleading content within a target group to advance an agenda or to \ncause harm. The described framework could be used in conjunction with emerging techniques in the detection \nof influence operations, such as those developed by Smith et\u00a0al.60, in order to explore the extent to which such \nactors drive meaningful narrative shifts across the social media ecosystem.\nA natural question is what specific mechanisms underly high burst score days for inter-cluster content similar -\nity. Our data suggest that highly active accounts can serve as bridges for inter-cluster spread, but more detailed \nexamination is needed to assess whether this is a robust feature driving high burst score days. We note that \nthe sentinel account approach is not designed for mapping content spread in detail, as the number of accounts \nselected is intentionally small. Analogous to epidemiological sentinel monitoring, the online sentinel accounts \nallow detection of presence and patterns in the data, but more detailed investigation (analogous to contact \ntracing for infectious diseases) is needed to deduce mechanisms of spread. Sentinel monitoring can identify \ncontent that is garnering attention in disparate communities, prompting more detailed follow-up investigation \non specific content diffusion pathways and other potential drivers of content similarity. More detailed analysis \ncan include considerations of primary and secondary spread of content, as well as movement of content across \ndifferent platforms.\n11\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:9832  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12450-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/A limitation of this study is its restriction to Twitter. Each social media platform has its particular biases in \nuser base and online functions, and study of consistencies and differences between platforms with regards to \nhealth information is important for misinformation monitoring and mitigation efforts. Existing COVID-19 \nrelated work includes analysis of pro-vaccination and anti-vaccination content on  Facebook61, popularity of \nY ouTube COVID-19 misinformation and sharing of these videos via  Facebook62, and cross-platform comparisons \nof Twitter and  Facebook16. Developing similar structured approaches to misinformation monitoring within and \nacross additional platforms is an area for future work.\nIn conclusion, the work presented here illustrates the promise of structured approaches to monitoring online \ncontent. Principled approaches are needed for efficiently navigating the high volume, high noise to signal online \nenvironment. Network-based approaches such as that taken here can be particularly useful, given the fundamen-\ntal role of networks in online content propagation. Sentinel accounts provide a way to identify content circulating \nwithin and between online communities. Many different approaches can be taken for selecting sentinel accounts \nbesides that which we used here. Studying different selection criteria in the context of various topics and online \nplatforms of interest are important areas for additional research.\nMethods\nSentinel recruitment and data collection. Community structure and sentinel node identification. \nQueries for tweets containing the phrase \u2018covid\u2019 were performed on May 27 over a twelve hour period using \nTwitter\u2019s API and the tweepy Python library. Community detection was performed on the largest connected \ncomponent of the retweet network, where the weight of the arc from j to i equals the number of times node j \nretweeted i. Specifically, we maximize the following version of modularity for weighted, directed graphs:\nwhere w is the sum of all edge weights in the network, win\nk and wout\nk the weighted in-degree and out-degree, \nrespectively, of node k , Ck the community assignment of node k , and \u03b4 corresponds to the Kronecker delta. \nModularity maximization was performed using a GenLouvain  method25,63, implemented with symmetrization \nof the modularity matrix Aij\u2212win\niwout\nj\nw.\nSentinel nodes were selected by first considering the fifty largest communities in the retweet network, and \nthen selecting the 15 most highly retweeted nodes from each of the communities that consisted of predomi-\nnantly English-speaking, domestic accounts. Whether a community was predominantly English-speaking was \ndetermined by taking a random sample of 100 tweets from that community and applying Google\u2019s language \ndetection algorithm. Communities whose sample was at least 80% English were classified as English-speaking. \nA final inspection was done on the filtered sentinel communities and any community whose sentinel accounts \nwere clearly not based in the United States was removed.\nStability of community structure. To assess stability of community structure in Twitter content regarding \nCOVID-19, we assembled a second retweet network using the same phrase search (\u2018covid\u2019) over a 24 hour period \nbeginning June 8 and ending June 9, 2020. Modularity maximization was performed on this second retweet \nnetwork, and then the community structures of the May 27 and June 8 networks were compared using the Rand \nscore as described  in26. Statistical significance of community similarity was assessed using the z-Rand score (26, \nequation\u00a02.1).\nLongitudinal data collection and observation period\nWe collected tweets from sentinel nodes from July 1, 2020 through January 6, 2021 using Twitter\u2019s public-\nfacing API. This observation period was split into two sets using 10/4/2020 at 12:00 AM (ET) as the demarcation \npoint. The first portion of the data (from 7/1/2020 - 10/3/2020) was used to characterize sentinel communities \naccording to their linked domains (Section\u00a0\" Sentinel community characterization using linked domains \") and \nestablish baseline similarity between clusters (Eq.\u00a0(1 ) and Section\u00a0\" Flagging inter-cluster content spread\").\nNode attrition, active accounts, and active user days. Node attrition over the observation period may occur \ndue to several possible reasons, including a user deleting their account or suspension by Twitter. Each cluster \nretained at least 80% of their initial sentinel nodes through mid-December. Comparison of attrition over time \nbetween clusters is given in the Supplementary Materials. In order to account for sentinel attrition we define the \nconcept of an active account  as well as the corresponding notion of active account days . We consider a sentinel \naccount to be active on a given day if we observe a tweet from that account on or after that day. As an extension \nwe define active account days to be the number of days a particular account is deemed active.\nSentinel community characterization using linked domains. We examined the links that each com-\nmunity shared in their tweets posted from 7/1/2020 - 10/3/2020. Specifically, we used principal components \nanalysis (PCA)64 to produce a scalar measure of linked domain preference, and then clustered sentinel commu-\nnities according to this preference.\nA community-level domain frequency matrix was formed by examining the unique domains posted more \nthan 10 times by any given community. The i,\u00a0j entry of this matrix was the fraction of links from community i to \nthat linked to domain j , excluding links to twitter.com, domains from URL shortening services (e.g. bit.\nly) and any domain shared less than 10 times across all communities. PCA was performed for this matrix and \nthe output was cross-referenced with the media bias fact chart provided  in27.\nSentinel communities were projected onto the resulting first principal component, giving each community a \nlinked domain score. Hierarchical clustering based upon the distance between cluster  centroids28 was performed (2) Q=1\nwn/summationdisplay\ni=1n/summationdisplay\nj=1/parenleftbigg\nAij\u2212win\niwout\nj\nw/parenrightbigg\n\u03b4(Ci,Cj),\n12\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:9832  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12450-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/on the linked domain scores. Cut points in the dendrogram were compared using the corresponding silhouette \n scores29.\nCOVID\u201119 misinformation by cluster. COVID-19 misinformation by topic and cluster was determined \nthrough human coding of a random sample of tweets that were posted 7/1/2020-10/3/2020. The considered top-\nics were COVID-19 mortality, hydroxychloroquine, facemasks and Plandemic.\nRelevant tweets were selected with substring searches. First, a subset of tweets pertaining to COVID-19 was \nselected by finding any tweet that contained at least one of \u201ccovid\u201d , \u201ccoronavirus\u201d , \u201csars-cov\u201d or \u201cpandemic\u201d . These \nCOVID-19 tweets were further subset for each of the four topics below by searching for the strings: \u201cplandemic\u201d \nand \u201cscamdemic\u201d for Plandemic; \u201chcq\u201d , \u201chydrox\u201d and \u201cchloroq\u201d for hydroxychloroquine; \u201cmask\u201d for facemasks; \nand \u201cfatality rate\u201d , \u201cdeath rate\u201d , \u201csurvival rate\u201d , \u201cdeath numbers\u201d , \u201ccovid-19 death\u201d , \u201ccovid death\u201d , \u201ccovid19 death\u201d , \n\u201cdied from covid\u201d and \u201cdied of covid\u201d for covid mortality.\nA random sample of 100 tweets from each cluster for each topic was selected for coding. If a cluster did not \nhave 100 tweets on a particular topic, we took all tweets from that cluster on that topic. When possible, each \ncommunity within a cluster was equally represented in that cluster\u2019s random sample, so that a single community \ndid not disproportionately impact the coding results.\nThe coders consisted of four undergraduates from a Midwestern private university. Coders were given a refer -\nence sheet (see Supplementary Materials) and a collection of tweet texts with the time the tweet was posted. The \ntime was provided so that coders could cross-reference with the scientific consensus about the topic at the time \nthe tweet was posted. All tweets were presented through an untimed Qualtrics survey.\nCOVID\u201119 vaccines and disease severity content. Tweets pertaining to COVID-19 severity and \nvaccination were identified through a substring search of COVID-19-related tweets (those found to contain \nany of the the strings \u201ccovid\u201d , \u201ccoronavirus\u201d , \u201csars-cov\u201d or \u201cpandemic\u201d). Search strings for COVID-19 severity \nwere seeded by reading the COVID-19 tweets and searching for phrases related to the morbidity and mortality \nof COVID-19, for example those that mention disease incidence or prevalence (e.g. \u2018case spike\u2019 or \u2018confirmed \ncases\u2019) as well as death count statistics (e.g. \u2018death count\u2019). For vaccination we used \u2018vaccine\u2019 , the stem \u2018vaccinat\u2019 as \nwell as the names of the vaccine manufacturers whose vaccines received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration. Exact substring lists can be found in the Supplementary Materials.\nTo identify which topical tweets may be related to misinformation surrounding severity or vaccinations we \nconstructed additional substring lists related to downplaying COVID-19 severity, vaccine hesitancy and vac-\ncine misinformation which were used to filter severity and vaccination tweets respectively. Complete lists can \nbe found in the Supplementary Materials.\nFlagging inter\u2011cluster content spread. Inter-cluster content similarity was measured using a cosine \nsimilarity  score65 applied to the trigrams generated by each community\u2019s tweets. Specifically, the \u2018documents\u2019 \nused to generate the similarity score were all COVID-19 tweets (Section\u00a0\"COVID-19 misinformation by cluster\") \nsent by a particular community on a given day. These tweets were cleaned to remove stopwords, urls and men-\ntions of Twitter users, and then trigram frequency vectors were generated using the NLTK package in  Python66. \nWe define the daily similarity between clusters A and B as the arithmetic mean of the similarity scores between \ndistinct pairs of communities in A and B.\nA day was flagged as containing viral content if the similarity between two clusters was anomalously large \naccording to the \u2018burst-score\u2019 given in Eq.\u00a0(1 ). This metric is an adaptation of the burst-score introduced  by33 for \ninter-cluster similarities. Specifically, ( 1) measures between similarity on day t  in terms of standard deviations \nfrom the historic mean. Implicit in this measure is the assumption that the similarity between clusters A  and B \nis stationary in time and does not exhibit a trend. Validity of this stationarity assumption was assessed with an \naugmented Dickey-Fuller  test67, performed with the adfuller model in the  statsmodels68 Python package \nusing a \u2018constant only\u2019 model with 0 lag (see Supplementary Materials).\nLatent semantic analysis (LSA)34 was used to identify topical tweets that drove high similarity on days in which \nat least one pair of clusters was flagged. LSA was separately applied to the tweets posted by both flagged clusters, \nwhere documents corresponded to individual tweets and terms corresponded to the tweet trigrams. The singular \ndocument vectors associated with the five largest singular values were used to identify topical tweets from each \ncluster on the flagged day. Specifically, a sharp drop in the magnitude of the document vector components was \nidentified and those tweets with component magnitudes above the drop were selected as topical tweets. Topical \ntweets common to both clusters were removed and the between cluster similarity was recalculated. Removed \ntweets were considered to be drivers of the burst on that day if the recalculated burst score was lower than the \nflagging criterion.\nData availability\nTweet IDs and user IDs corresponding to sentinel nodes that were verified accounts as of July 22, 2020 are avail-\nable at: https://  github. com/  joeti  en/ senti  nel- node-  misin  fo.\nReceived: 1 December 2021; Accepted: 20 April 2022\nReferences\n 1.

At the same time, such measures threaten to curtail capitalist expansion and thus Brazil 's \nneoliberal model of economic development . Jair Bolsonaro 's 2018 presidential campaign  responded to th ese \nthreats by  fueling anti-environment sentiments  and anti -environmentalist enmity.  Once inaugurated, he \nimmediately began the work of dismantling national environmental governance  structures.  Yet his strategies \nfor doing so are often masked by what this article describes as a ' firehouse effect ', where h is tactics appear  \nchaotic, confused , and lack ing any particular goal . The article uses  a combination of interviews with 35 \nenvironmental experts, participant observation, and a review of secondary sources  to zoom in on Bolsonaro' s \nanti-environmentalism within the context of the contemporary turn toward populist authoritarian neoliberalism . \nBy focusing on how Bolsonaro 's policies serve to weaken protective environmental measures that limit capitalist \nextraction, the article  unearths the major anti -environment strategies of the Bolsonaro administration. This \nframework thus allows us to see thr ough the ' firehouse effect ' to make some sense of Bolsonaro' s methods, \nfurther building on  emerging research on the political ecologies of the contemporary populist au thoritarian \nneoliberal turn . Moreover, the article  shows the utility of applying a generalized populist authoritarian \nneoliberal framework to a particular context  in order to identify its local processes and specificities.    \nKeywords: Populist authoritarian neoliberalism, environmental governance, Bolsonaro, Brazil , 'firehouse \neffect ' \n \nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 \nAu Br\u00e9sil, la menace imminente d 'extinction massive a suscit\u00e9 des mesures de plus en plus exceptionnelles pour \nprot\u00e9ger les biomes sensibles.

Introduction  \nThe Amazon rainforest is the largest and most biodiverse tropical rainforest in the world,  with 60% \nfalling within Brazilian borders. Although the rainforest  is most likely what comes to mind when people \ncontemplate environmental politics in Brazil, the country is home to two other important biodiversity hotspots \n\u2013 the Atlantic Forest and the C errado (Myers et al. 2000) . The relatively high rate of habitat loss in all three \nbiomes \u2013 the latter up to and over 9 0% \u2013 has stoked a deep sense of urgency to curtail deforestation in Brazil,  \nwith conservatio nists using a combination of surveillance via satellite (Voiland 2019)  and legal structures (Jung \net al. 2017)  to limit extractive practices in these biomes.  \nIn what has been referred to as a judicial -parliamentary coup,  Brazil 's former president Dilma Rousseff \nof the Worker 's Party (PT) was impeached in 2016 (Saad -Filho and Boffo 2020) . And after the failure of her \nsuccessor (and former vice president) Michel Temer 's administration to address a deepening economic crisis, \nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva  (aka Lula)  appeared likely to win the 2018 election. A founding member of the PT, \nLula had previously served as president from 2003- 2011 and is widely regarded as one of Brazil 's most popular \npresidents  (Saad -Filho and Boffo 2020) . However, in a continued attempt to take down the PT, Lula was \narrested in April of 2018 under charges of corruption (Wilkinson 2018) .2 Taking advantage of the political \nunrest associated with corruption scandals and the economic crisis, Jair Bolsonaro, a retired military officer and \nmember of the conservative Social Liberal Party, ran a contentious and polarizing campaign steeped in a politics \nof enmity  towards the  environment and 'other s'.3  \nIn January 2019, Bolsona ro was inaugurated as Brazil 's president. Congruent with Brazil 's agribusiness \nand associated interest groups, he insisted that Brazil 's economic failures are, amongst others, a result of the \n \n2 Lula was released in November 2019, the charges were later annulled, and the presiding judge Sergio Moro was found to \nbe biased by the Supreme Court (Brito 2021) . \n3 As McCarthy (2019)  notes, the distinction of internal and external 'others' (e.g. immigrants and racialized minorities) as \nenemies of progress is a common tactic of populist authoritarian neoliberal leaders and assists the justification of the \ndissolution of democratic protections, norms, and institutions.  \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  825 \n measures taken to combat biodiversity loss and species extinctions . He immediately began the work of \ndismantling national environmental governance structures and institutions. His anti -environment actions were \nso swift and numerous that the press had difficulty deciding which ones to headline (Gonzales 2019) . For \nexample, when Bolsonaro 's initial plans to merge the Ministry of Environment (MMA) with the Ministry of \nAgriculture , Livestock, and Food Supply (MAPA) met opposition  (Casado and Londo\u00f1o 2019) , he instead \nappointed Ricardo Salles4 as head of the MMA. Salles, who was convicted of altering an environmental \nprotection plan to benefit extractive industry as former head of a S\u00e3o Paulo stat e environmental agency, went \nto work turning the MMA into a pro -agribusiness ministry (Schipanii and Harris 2019) , thus \" answering the \nRural Caucus ' interests \" (Environmental Nongovernmental Organization [ ENGO]  employee specializing in \npublic policy, July 2019) . Around the same time, Bolsonaro announced plans to move environmental licensing \nto a self -regulated scheme (Gonzales 2019) . On the day of  his inauguration, Bolsonaro issued a presidential \ndecree to \" supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international \norganizations and nongovernmental organizations  (NGOs)  in the national territory. \" As part of this initia tive, \nSalles immediately suspended all partnerships between NGOs and federal environmental agencies in Brazil, \npending a review of all such partnerships (Stargardter 2019) .  \nOver two years later,  there continue to be signs that Bolsonaro is weakening environmental agencies, \neasing and privatizing environmental regulation, and diverting environmental funding to agribusiness  (Branford \nand Torres 2021; Escobar 2021; Reuters 2021) . Yet his attempts to do so have often seemed chaotic, \ndisorganized, and haphazard, creating the appearance of a lack of strategy.5 In part, this is due to his conflicting \ndeclarations of his love for the environment and his record of dismantling protective measures for that same \nenvironment (Fox and Lang 2019) . But this perception is also due to his penchant for issuing statements that \nare overwhelmingly falsifiable (Aos Fatos 2019)  and presidential decrees on actions that are not possible n or \nlegal (Coletta and Faria 2019; Spring 2019a; The Associated Press 2019) . Also contributing to the perception \nof a lack of strategy, Bolsonaro is known for ' shooting from the hip. ' In his first six months in office, he  issued \n202 decrees compared to 94 and 174 for the two presidents before him (Harris and Schipanii 2019) . From an \noutside observer 's perspective, his actions indicate a high degree of incompetence. Yet the net effect has been \nthat Bolsonaro has succeeded in weakening environmental governance structures in Brazil (Ferrante and \nFearnside 2019; Spring 2019b) . \nAlthough the rapid ascendance of Bolsonaro came as a surprise to many , it is consistent with  the more \ngeneral recent turn toward populist authoritarian neoliberalism  across the globe . As is the case in Brazil, this  \ntrend is widely recognized as emerging from the continued failure of neoliberal reforms to address problems of \ngrowing socioeconomic inequality, unemployment, and poverty following the 2008  economic crisis  (Bruff and \nTansel 2019b; Fabry and Sandbeck 2019b; McCarthy 2019) . Yet there is some debate on how the shift to \nneoliberal authoritarianism unfolds  and few studies that have examined this shift have focused their  analysis o n \nenvironmental deregulation.  Moreover, although such works are beginning to emerge, few have sought to \nunderstand the role of antics  (seemingly random and erratic behaviors and actions ) in masking this shift. In this \narticle, I address th ese gaps by examining Bolsonaro' s anti-environmentalism  within the context of the \ncontemporary turn toward populist authoritarian neoliberalism. I do so by going directly to environmental \nexperts , including those in academia, government agencies, and NGOs.   \nMy reasoning for this approach  was that, r egardless of how participants felt personally toward \nBolsonaro, environmental experts would presumably have  reliable knowledge on the anti -environmental effects \nof Bolsonaro' s policies . Building on this knowledge, I argue that there are at least five  major strategies that can \nbe identified in Bolsonaro' s antics  and that  the 'firehouse effect ' works  to mask the se. The strategies include  the \n'skeletonizing ' of environmental administrative bodies, dissolution of CONAMA and other civic spaces, \n \n4 At the time of the latest draft of this article, Salles recently resigned after facing illegal logging probes. He was replaced \nby a 20+ year veteran agribusiness lobbying board member, Joaquim Alves Pereira Leite (Ennes 2021) . \n5 In this article  I use the term ' strategy ' to refer to an ov erall plan for accomplishing specific goals. I thus use the term \ninterchangeably to describe Bolsonaro' s 'master plan ' of removing barriers to capital accumulation, as well as his specific \nsets of plans for achieving this goal (e.g. ' skeletonizing ' of envi ronmental bodies). I use the term ' tactic ' to refer to specific \nactions that are deployed as part of a strategy.  \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  826 \n reorganizing within the ministries, defunding of NGOs  and federal universities , and cooptation of exceptional \nenvironmental measures  in times of crisis . I describe each of these in the below sections . Before I get to these, \nhowever, I briefly summarize  the situation in Brazil and review the literature on political ecologies of \nauthoritarian neoliberalism and the strategies emplo yed by authoritarian neoliberal leaders  with respect to the \nenvironment .  \n \n2. Extinction, e xception, and e nmity in Brazil   \nIn recent history, Brazil  was widely acknowledged  as a global leader in combatting climate change  and \nspecies extinctions  (Branford and Borg es 2019; Casado and Londo\u00f1o 2019; Trinkunas 2014; Viscidi and \nGraham 2019) . Through a combination of measures that included stricter legislation , law enforcement,  and \nmoni toring and surveillance to crack  down on illegal logging and  support  reforestation , Brazil was able to \nreduce its deforestation rate by around 80% between 2005 and 2012, among other environmental successes \n(Silva Junior et al. 2021) . At the same time , the measures  that led to these results  were often criticized as being \ntoo restrictive , in terms of  regulations on land use for Brazil 's agricultural outputs  (Arsenault 2017) . For \nexample, agricultural and ranching businesses with unpaid environmental fines were prevented from receiving \ngovernment subsidies  until settling their debt, municipalities  with high rates of illegal deforestation were \n\"blacklisted \", and t he network of Protected Areas was expanded  (Carvalho et al. 2019) .  \nRecently , the government began to imple ment the Cadastro Ambiental Rural (CAR), a  registry that was \nset up to track compliance with the part of the Brazil 's Forest Code6 that requires specific percentages of private \nland to be set aside for conservation (the percentage varies with location). Although Philippe Le Billon \nhighlights how CAR has led to land grabbing by agribusinesses in some cases (Le Billon 2021) , conservationists \nhave found it to be a particularly important tool for establishing wildlife corridors , which are tracts of land that \nconnect isolated forest patches to offset the effects of habitat fragmentation , one of t he primary drivers of \nextinction  (Crooks et al. 2017) . To he lp ensure compliance with the Forest Code , CAR registrants are monitored \nby Brazil 's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which  has made extraordinary advances in tracking  \ndeforestation through satellite imagery, allowing for more efficient and targeted responses to illegal logging  \nand land clearing  (Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, Gandour and Rocha 2013; Assun\u00e7\u00e3o and Rocha 2019; Puthuparambil 2019) . All \nof these exceptional measures have been important for tackling high rates of deforestation a nd species \nextinction s in Brazil.  \nWhile many of the  restrictions on extractive practices  and land use  in Brazilian forests were eased by \nthe 2012 modifications to Brazil 's Forest Code , several politicians still claim  that the exceptional environmental \nregulations in Brazil are at the root of the deepening economic crisis  (Arsenault 2017; Nugent 2021) . Among \nthese is Jair Bolsonaro , who  in addition to blaming corruption for Brazil' s economic woes has described Brazil 's \nenvironmental protection as \" suffocating \" economic growth (Rachman, Blasina and Schipani 2019; Viscidi and \nGraham 2019)  and believes that  \"environmental politics (is getting)  in the way of business \" (ENGO employee \nspecializing in public policy, April 2019). Bolsonaro is staunch ly pro-business , known for his disregard for \nenvironmental regulations (Spring and Eisenhammer 2019)  and science (Escobar 2021;  Tollefson 2018) , and \nfor making racist, misogynistic, homophobic remarks (Borba 2020; Kaul 2021; Lehman 2018; Da Silva and \nLarkins 2019) . He garnered  popular attention during the presidential campaign by promising to fix corruption \nand perceived threats to the national econo my of Brazil with swift, decisive, and uncompromising action \n(Hunter and Power 2019; Tollefson 2018) . He captured  the economic angst of the ' ordinary'  citizen and directed  \nit toward internal and external racialized and ' ideological ' 'others ' (Borba 2020; D. Phillips  2019a; Tollefson \n2018) . These ideological others include all those who would get in the way of economic expansion through \ncapital accumulation, especially environmental and social advocates , and particularly scientists that support \nthese advocates ' claims (Acebes, Wilkinson and T\u00e9llez- Ch\u00e1vez 2019; Pettorelli et al. 2019; Tollefson 2018) . \nHis campaign w as steeped in anti -environment  enmity  with direct attacks on prominent Brazilian environmental \nfigures (Acebes, Wilkinson and T\u00e9llez -Ch\u00e1vez 2019)  and promises to roll back environmental regulations and \nenforcement to free up land for development and extraction  (Bogliolo 2019; Casado and Londo\u00f1o 2019; Saad-\n \n6 The Forest Code of 1965 is the country' s main mechanism for forest protection on private lands.  \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  827 \n Filho 2018) . Once in office, he has pursued his campaign  promises with fervor and total disregard for the \nConstitution and legislative processes, often atte mpting to dismantle and eradicate legal barriers to his agenda \n(Coletta and Faria 2019; Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) .  \nFor these and other reasons, many analysts recognize Bolsonaro as a populist authoritarian neoli beral \n(McCarthy 2019; Saad -Filho 2018) . At the same time, his antics make his tactics seem so chaotic and unplanned \nthat many environmental experts have expressed difficulty with  determin ing whether he has a ny strategy , or if \nhe is just ' shooting from the hip'  (Cowie, 2018; Harris and Schi panii, 2019; and as demonstrated in Section 4 ). \nMoreover, si nce this ' shooting from the hip'  has been given so little attention i n the literature o n populist \nauthoritarian neoliberal environmental governance , there is no guide for understanding how such behavior may \nserve to mask strategies . As the home of some of the most important areas in the world for biodiversity and \nclimate stability, Bolsonaro 's campaign promises to elimina te environmental restrictions on extraction  are \nalarming. Moreover, i t seems important to understand the anti- environment alism  of populist authoritarian \nneoliberal leaders  and how it relates to their strategies if we hope to develop effective counterstrategies . Next, \nI review the liter ature on political ecologies of authoritarian neoliberalism and the environmental  strategies  of \npopulist authoritarian neoliberals to situate Brazil and Bolsonaro within this broader context and argue that this \nallows us to start making sense of his antics . \n \n3. Political ecologies of authoritarian neoliberalism  \nThe rise of countries turning toward an ' authoritarian fix ' (Bruff 2014) is rapidly becoming a focus of \nstudy and cause for alarm. Putin in Russia and Xi in China in 2012, Modi in India and Erdo\u011fan in Turkey in \n2014, Duterte in the Philippines in 2016, Battulga in Mongolia and Trump in the US in 2017, Bols onaro in \nBrazil in 2019, and, most recently as of this writing, Johnson in the UK in 2019. Each of these countries has its \nown particularities and histories  that led to the election of populist neoliberal ' strongmen. ' But what they have \nin common is the ir political economic trajectories characterized by the failure of neoliberal reforms to address \ndeepening crises of socioeconomic inequality, unempl oyment, and poverty (Brown 2020; Fabry and Sandbeck \n2019a; Fraser 2017) . Although many scholars have written about these trends and their relationship to the \ncontemporary populist authoritarian turn, Ian Bruff (2014)  is one of the first analysts to define ' authoritarian \nneoliberalism ' and use it as a theoretical framework through which to understand the post-2008 global trend \ntoward 'strongman'  leadership (Fabry and Sandbeck 2019a) .  \nAlthough t he populist authoritarian s trand of the aforementioned turn seem s relatively uncontested  in \nthe academic lit erature,  the neoliberal strand is not always so clear. For example, the determined attempts  of \nleaders such as Trump a nd Johnson to exit international  partnerships and free trade  agreements  may be \ninterpreted as  a withdrawal  from neoliberalism by some . However, several  scholars have argued that such \nattempts at protectionism do not signal  a departure from neoliberalism  (Bell and Christoph 2020; Cornelissen \n2021; Cozzolino 2018; Fuchs 2017) . On the contrary, analysts such as Wraight (2019)  have honed in on this  \n'neoliberal protectionism ' to demonstrate how Trump' s trade policy (2017- 2021) was  actually a return to  past \nneoliberal practices . Such practices are aimed at forcing other nations to f all into line with their market- based \nlogic, with  coercion operating through \"the blunt use of protectionism or threats of protectionism. . . as a device \nby which powerful nations, like the U S, can insist on the imposition of market driven norms \" (ibid. p. 741) . \nThis, he argues , was evident in Trump' s trade war with China, launched to address the threat that China 's \nindustrial policies pose to the global economic order.  Meanwhile, Johnson' s protectionism is driven by a need \nto release restrictions on UK trade (rather than to impose restrictions on other nations). As Bell (2019)  argues, \nJohnson and other UK neoliberal leaders favored exiting the EU because they believed the regulations were too \nrestrictive and thus harming unfettered economic growth.  While these strategies may appear to reflect different \ngoals on the surface, Johnson and Trump are ( or were ) pursuing the same ultimate goal as Bolsonaro, removing  \nrestrictions to capital accumulation.  \nIn addition to discussions on what characterizes neoliberal leaders, t he utility of using a neoliberal \nframework to analyze seemingly disparate actors, contexts, and cases such as the ones above, has been the \nsubject of ongoing academic debate (see Cahill et al. , 2018 and Peck and Theodore, 2019 for summaries) . This \ndebate usually occurs as two supposedly polar opposites, where scholars tend toward one of  \"the twin pitfalls \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  828 \n of both monolithic fetishization, on one hand, and endless contextualization on the other \" (Holmes and \nCavanagh 2016, p. 201) . How ever, Brenner and Theodore (2002)  argue that  'actually existing neoliberalism ' is \nbest understood as series of processes of neoliberal izations , that interact with local realities in context-\ndependent ways.  Thus neoliberal  proponents and leaders  engage different processes and strategies of \nneoliberalization, depending on the tools and opportunities available to them  (Dawes and Lenormand 2019; \nPeck 2013) . Following Holmes and Cavanagh, Brenner and Theodore, Peck, and others, Dawes and Lenormand \n(2019)  attempt to find a middle ground between the two pitfalls by \" accommodating a fluid and variega ted \nappreciation of contextual difference while maintaining a structural approach that recognizes the ways in which \nlocal differences and contextually embedded forms are shaped by wider processes \" (p. X) . This becomes ever \nmore important as there is clearly an increasingly authoritarian tenor to these processes ; that is to say leaders of \ncontemporary democracies are increasingly engaging in such processes without consent (whereas before there \nwas at least the illusion of it) (Brown 2020; Bruff 2014; Peck and Theodore 2019) . This article  build s on this \nwork by using a po pulist authoritarian neoliberal framework to tease out local manifestations of  populist \nauthoritarian  neoliberal tactics that may otherwise be lost in ' endless contex tualization. ' \nSince Bruff' s (2014)  foundational article  on 'authoritarian neoliberalism ', references to the term and its \nbroad applications have grown \u2013 often as collaborative efforts to grapple with the problem \u2013  at multiple \nconferences, in edited volumes and special issu es, and in stand- alone article s. Such a ttempts to understand and \ntheorize authoritarian neoliberalism in all its shapes and forms have covered myriad and broad topics, but few \nhave focused on these as they relate to the environment. There was a notable lack of such analyses in the Oxford \nHandbook of the Radical Right  (Rydgren 2018) , which contained chapters on multiple themes and connections. \nThe environment is also missing from several other prominent works on authoritarian neoliberalism, including \nCas Mudde 's (2019)  The Far Right t oday, the special issue on ' Authoritarian Neoliberalism: Philosophies, \npractic es, contestations ' in Globalizations (Bruff and Tansel 2019b) , and on 'Authoritarian Neolibera lism' in \nCompetition & Change  (Fabry and Sandbeck 2019b) .  This is certainly not for a lack of links between the two. \nIndeed, \"(t)he connections between the widespread rise of authoritarian and populist leaders, administrations, \nand movements on the one hand and destructive trends in environmental politics and governance on the other \nare legion \" (McCarthy, 2019, p. 305). Yet , to my knowledge,  the only collaborative  attempt to  understand \ncontemporary authoritarianism that includes  a discussion of the environment , is the recent special issue in the \nAnnals of the American Association of Geographers  on 'Environmental governance in a populist/authoritarian \nera' (McCarthy, 2019) .  \nIn the introductory article to the Annals  issue, McCarthy  (2019)  argues that:  \n \n\u2026many contemporary authoritarian regimes are pursuing and deepening long -standing \nneoliberal goals with respect to the environment, removing restrictions on capitalist production \nby withdrawing from constraining international agreements and standards, rolling back domestic \nenvironmental protections, and appointing heads of polluting corporations to head the very \nagencies that are supposed to regulate those corporations . (p. 306)  \n \nYet such practices have not occurr ed without dissent. And this is where authoritarian neoliberalism \ndeparts from its predecessor, ' progressive ' neoliberalism. According to Bruff  (2014, p. 116 , emphasis in \noriginal ), \"(a)uthoritarian neoliberalism does not represent a wholesale break from pre -2007 neoliberal \npractices, yet it is qualitatively distinct due to the way in which neoliberalism 's authoritarian tendencies . . . \nhave come to the fore through a shift toward  constitutional and legal mechanisms and away  from seeking \nconsent for hegemonic projects. \" Still, a major question remains: How  do these shifts occur? In other words, \nhow does one  accomplish this elimination of  the need for consent without  . . . consent?  \nTo answer this question, some have argued that a uthoritarian strategies include attempts to marginalize , \ndiscipline, and control  \"dissenting social groups and oppositional politics rather than strive for their explicit \nconsent or co -optation \" (Bruff and Tansel 2019a, p. 234) . With respect to the environment, Acara (2019) \ndiscusses how the strategies of centralization and lack of transparency and clarity in water resource governance \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  829 \n in Turkey has normalized such processes in the country in general. Mullenite (2019)  demonstrates how flood \ncontrol infrastructure design and management ha ve been used in Guyana to create and maintain ethnic divisions \nthat served to support an ethnic nationalist aut horitarian regime. Arefin (2019)  describes how the Egyptian state \nhas reframed the causes of environmental d isasters in ways that support the continued control of the repressive \nregime. Rather than acknowledging the cause of a severe flood as a failure of environmental governance and a \nresult of climate change, the Egyptian state claimed the floods were an act o f terrorism. In this way, the state is \nable to simultaneously relieve itself of obligations with regard to environmental governance, while creating \njustifications for its continued restrictions of freedoms and use of force.   \nSeveral scholars have also not ed manipulation  of emotions by discursively linking values with political \nideologies and agendas  as a primary strategy of the far right, with some  examining the specific ways this strategy \nis deployed with respect to ideas of climate change and energy extraction (Forchtner, Kroneder and Wetzel \n2018; Graybill 2019; Lockwood 2018) . Still others have observed the important role that discourses and  \nnarratives around peace and security play in helping secure authoritarian power and control over environmental \nresources (Kantel 2019) . While studies such as these  on environmental governance strategies during the shift \nto authoritarian neoliberalism have begun to emerge, few have addressed the antics \u2013  seemingly random and \nerratic behaviors and actions \u2013  that often accompany these shifts. Several studies have relied on the idea of \n'spectacle ' to explain how Trump' s antics  quickly gained  him popularity and secured his  win at the 2016 US \nPresidential election (Fuchs 2017; Hall, Goldstein and Ingram  2016; Kellner 2016) . Pulido et al.  (2019)  show \nhow Trump' s rise in the use of ' spectacular racism ' corresponded to an intensification of environmental \nderegulation. They argue that the ' spectacular ' ways in which Trump deploys his racism , amongst others,  \nfunctions  to effectively mask the processes of environmental deregulation as they unfold. However, few studies  \nhave gone beyond the distractive aspect of ' spectacle'  to examine the sense of chaos and confusion such antics  \ncreate. Nor have studies interrogated  how such effects  add to the difficulty  of identify ing specific strategies , \nlending assistance to 'spectacle ' in masking the shift to authoritarian neoliberalism and hampering efforts to stop \nor reverse it .  \nBolsonaro demonstrates some of the same antics  characteristic of Trump 's campaign and presidency , \nand many environmental experts have struggl ed to make sense of his  anti-environment strategies . As discussed \nabove  and in alignment with other populist authoritarian neoliberal leaders , Bolsonaro has clea rly stated that he \nintends to remove barriers to capital accumulation. Thus, to make sense of Bolsonaro 's anti-environment  \nstrategies, I begin with the assumption that such  strategies are likely to proceed with the main goal of \nrestructuring federal govern ance mechanisms to eliminate barriers to capital accumulation. A nti-\nenvironmentalist enmity , then,  serves as a vehicle for de- legitimizing supporters of environmental safeguards \nand thus becomes an insurance policy against the resurrection of impediments t o unrestrained accumulation. \nAccordingly , by asking the question \"How does each strategy accomplish th e goal of removing barriers to \ncapital accumulation ?\" we can begin to fit Bolsonaro' s strategies into a framework that allows us to make sense \nof his seem ingly random tactics. To begin this work, I explain how the ' firehouse effect ' may make it difficult \nto tease out Bolsonaro' s strategies, but that viewing Bolsonaro' s anti -environmentalism  through an authoritarian \nneoliberal lens helps to bring these into clear(er) focus. Thus, I outline five major strategies of the Bolsonaro \nadministration, demonstrating how they might serve the neoliberal goal of removing barriers to capital \naccumulation by weakening protective environmental measures and intensifying anti- environmentalist enmity  \nto hamper advocates ' ability to fight back.   \n \n4. Making sense of Bolsonaro's  strategies   \nIn order to understand and track Bolsonaro' s strategies  with respect to the environment , I went to Brazil \nthree times in 2019 for a total of 12 weeks to interview, and re -interview, 35 environmental  experts in  \ngovernment agencies, academia, and environmental/socioenvironmental non-governmental organizations  \n(ENGOs/SENGOs) . My understanding of the se strategies comes from these interviews, participant observation, \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  830 \n and casual conversations, as well as from a review of secondary sources  \u2013 particularly popular  news  media , \nwhich were used for verification and clarifi cation of facts and events referred to by interviewees .7  \nWhen asked about Bolsonaro' s anti -environment strategies and potential counterstrategies, t he majority \nof interviewees  relayed a sense of chaos and confusion. \" People are totally lost and don' t know what to do\",  \nexplains an ICMBio employee (March, 2019). This includes employees in senior positions who were \" kind of \nlost and confused and following orders. \" (ibid.) Accordin g to a  founder  of a major ENGO, Bolsonaro 's strategy \n\"changes from one day to the other without telling all of his team \" as her co -founder chimes in \" childish \nbehavior \" (March 2019). Another  interviewee explained \" We're trying to be kind of focused because  there are \nso many threats from different directions \" (ENGO employee specializing in public policy, April 2019).  Even \nby July, the sentiment was \" everybody is I think still (saying), ' \u2026 This is very different. This is very strange, \nhow do we act now? '\" (SENGO executive team member , July 2019). And although several interviewees had \ndevised ways of developi ng counterstrategies by October , there was still an overall sense that \" we are in t his \ncompletely crazy situation that things happen (all the) time .  . . there are so many things that happen here, like \nsurreal things \" (Director of SENGO, October 2019).  \nRather than simply referring to Bolsonaro' s errati c behaviors as antics, one of the  interviewees referred \nto these as t he 'firehouse strategy ', where innumerable 'fires' are set and  draw out ' fire fighters ', leaving the \n'firehouse ' empty and the 'fire fighters ' mired in chaos.  Or, as the interviewee put it: \" . . . (the extreme right \ngovernment)  say(s) lots of stupid and crazy things for people to try to address these absurdities. And then, \nbehind, they make very important changes in law \" (ENGO employee specializing in public policy , April 2019) . \nIt mirrors Trump 's strategy of spectacl e as described above , yet it is unclear whether  Bolsonaro is engaging \nsuch a s trategy with intention .8 Such an analysis is beyond the scope of this article , but the effect is nonetheless \nnotable , and  goes beyond spectacle as it carries a significant component  of confusion. Thus, I argue that the \n'firehouse effect ' is brought on by at least six behaviors of a leader :  \n \n1) making statements  that conflict with actions;  \n2) making statements about intent to do something , then  retract ing the statement shortly \nafterwards ;  \n3) lying or making misleading state ments;  \n4) issuing statements and/or decrees that clearly reveal an intent to perform illegal and /or \nunconstitutional acts;  \n5) making offensive statements about marginalized categories of pe ople; and  \n6) doing all of these things in  constant and rapid succession.  \n \nThe composite  of these elements is  often mistak en for incompetence, but whether or not incompetence is at \nplay, the effect  is that it makes it difficult to identify particular strategies .  \nBolsonaro' s 'firehouse effect ' is rich with examples of all of the above elements. His  statements  about \nthe environment frequently conflict with his actions, such as  his profession of \" profound love and respect for \nthe Amazon \" (T. Phillips 2019)  and his declaration that \" protecting the forest is our duty, acting to combat \nillegal deforestation and any other criminal activities that put our Amazon at risk \" (Fox and Lang 2019) , while \nsimultaneously weakening protection of the Amazon, leading to the highest deforestation rate  in over a decade \n \n7 To be cited, popular news media sources had  to have an Ad Fontes reliability score of 40 or above (see \nwww.adfontesmedia.com ), a Media Bias/Fact Check factual reporting assessment of \"high\" (see \nwww.mediabiasfactcheck.com ), or were recommended by interviewees as a known reliable news source in Brazil (e.g. \nFolha de S.  Paulo).  \n8 At a ministerial meeting in May 2020, the minister of environment (Salles) suggested that the administration take \nadvantage of the opportunity of the media 's preoccupation with the COVID -19 crisis, as the numbers of cases and deaths \ncontinued to surge in Brazil, to work on environmental deregulation \" while we are at this moment of tranquility in terms of \npress coverage\"  (Bragan\u00e7a and Menegassi 2020; Uribe 2020) . This suggests that the administration is both aware of the \npolitical advantage of distraction  and more than willing to exploit such opportunities.  \n \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  831 \n (Climainfo 2019; Uribe, Coletta and  Moreira 2019) . As mentioned above, he has also said that he would merge \nthe ministries of environment and agriculture, later deciding not to (Casado and Londo\u00f1o 2019; globo.com \n2018) . He stated an intent to leave the Paris agreement, but later withdrew his statement (Viscidi and Graham \n2019) . Aos Fatos , an independent fact -checking agency in Brazil, analyzed 149 statements made by Bolsonaro \nin the first 10 weeks of his presidency and found that 55% of those statements \" were completely false or had \nsome degree of error \" (Aos Fatos 2019) . He has attempted to m ove the demarcation of indigenous lands from \nthe Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of A griculture  even after Congress rejected the move (Fox and Lang \n2019) , issued a decree to ease restrictions on  guns  (Harris and Schipanii 2019) , and attempted to a bolish the \nmajority of  civic spaces within the administrative structure for public participation  (Decree No. 9,759 of April \n11, 2019) . All of these were rejected by either Congress or the Supreme Court as unconstitutional (A rbex 2019; \nColetta and Faria 2019; Harris and Schipanii 2019) . Bolsonaro' s racist, misogynistic, and homophobic \ncomments are now well known (Borba 2020; Kaul 2021; Lehman 2018; Da Silva and Larkins 2019) . Although \nit remains u nproven, s everal journalists have suggested that, as  Trump  did, Bolsonaro uses outrageous and \noffensive comments to distract from scandals, such as when his son was accused of money laundering ( see for \nexample Phillips,  2020; Romm, 2019) .  \nAll these elements of the ' firehouse effect ' are mobilized constantly and in rapid succession, earning \nBolsonaro his reputation of ' shooting from the hip'  (Cowie 2018; Harris and Schipanii 2019) . In the first three \nweeks of his presidency alone , the Bolsonaro administration announced restrictions on international NGOs and \nall NGO partnerships with environmental civil service agencies, moved the responsibility of the demarcation \nof indigenous lands from the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of Agriculture, eliminated the responsibility of \nensuring LGBT rights from the Human Rights Ministry, issued a decree to reduce national ministries from 29 \nto 22, reviewed government contractors and fired those who didn' t share the political ideologies of Bolsonaro' s \nadministration, scaled back environmental enforcement, pulled out of a UN Migration accord  with 160 \nsignatories , eased restrictions on gun ownership, and legalized the use of 131 previously restricted pesticides. I \nsuggest that this rapid deployme nt of anti -advocate measures are masked, at least initially , as advocate social \nmovements9 try to keep up and triage responses , by the multiple ways Bolsonaro deploys elements of the \n'firehouse effect ' as he dismantles measures meant to protect the environment, as well as human rights.   \nBelow, to break through the ' firehouse effect ', I explore five of Bolsonaro' s anti-environment strategies \nand how these  meet the two goals of weakening of  protective environmental measures and delegitimizing \nsupporter s of those measures.  Some  of the strategies may not necessarily have been deployed as s olely  anti-\nenvironmental (i.e. they may be more anti -regulation in general) , but certainly have at least a partial anti -\nenvironment agenda and are thus still notable .  \n'Skeletonizing ' environmental administrative bodies  \nWhen Bolsonaro initially proposed to eliminate the Ministry of Environment  (MMA) , collapsing it into \nthe Ministry of Agriculture  (MAPA) , he was met with resistance not just from the opposition, but also by his \nconstituents who thought it was a bad idea  (Rocha, 2020; ENGO employee specializing in public policy, April \n2019 ). Without at least the appearance of environmental care, many in the sector  were afraid to  lose their  \ncompetitive edge in the global market, especially for beef and soy  (Casado and Londo\u00f1o 2019) . So Bolsonaro \ndecided to keep the MMA . On paper at least  (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . But his administration eliminated \ntwo departments in cha rge of climate change and mitigation, as well as one tasked with fighting deforestation \n(Escobar 2019a)  and moved the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB) , which includes the rural environmental registry \n(CAR)  to MAPA  (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020)  under the supervision of Valdir Colat to, who worked against \nthe Forest Code (Gonzales 2019) . He also transferred the management of water resources to the Ministry of \nRegional Development  (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . Meanwhile, Bolsonaro' s new  pro-agriculture minister of \nthe environment, Ricardo Salles,  was swift to demote almost all civil servant employees who held managerial, \n \n9 Here, I take the commonly accepted definition of ' social movements ' in Social Movement Theory literature: \" collective \nchallenges, based on common purposes and social solidarities, in sustained inter action with elites, opponents, and \nauthorities. This definition has four empirical properties: collective challenge, common purpose, social solidarity, and \nsustained interaction \" (Tarrow 2011, p. 9) . \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  832 \n coordination, and leadership positions  in the Ministry of Environment, as well as ICMBio \u2013  the governmental \nunit that provides research and monitori ng of protected areas and species to guide environmental regulations \u2013 \nand IBAMA, the governmental unit that enforces environmental regulations  (Audi and Martins 2019) .  \nThe Bolsonaro administration has also been working hard at cutting the funding to ICMBio and IBAMA, \nwith IBAMA  receiving a 24% cut in its budget  and the MMA spending only $R 1.17 million (US$402,500) on \npolicy planning and management in the first eight months of 2019, compared to $R 35.6 million (US$8.4 \nmillion) in the same period the year prior  (Girardi 2019). Employees of ICMBio and its af filiated research \ninstitutions that I interviewed for this project were aware that there had been some discussion on the \nrestructuring of ICMBio and possible elimination of several research centers but, as of October 2019, they had \nstill not received the r estructuring plans, nor the budget for 2019. Understandably, this limite d their activities , \nwith several feeling that this was an intentional move to render them ineffective . Moreover, with each of my \nvisits to Brazil, it was clear that living under such u ncertainty, where one might lose their job at any moment, \nwas wearing down on research center employees and their resolve. Many expressed an increasing feeling of \ndespair , and exhaustion from being in a constant state of uncertainty , to the point where they were becoming \napathetic as a protection mechanism. Referencing a quote of a biologist in a report by Bernardo Esteves  (2019) , \none of the  interviewees  summed up the process by declaring: \"(Salles is)  working like a termite. He 's destroying \nfrom inside and you cannot see it from outside. And i nside everything is gonna be destroyed\"  (ICMBio \nemployee, July 2019).  I refer to this process as the ' skeletonizing ' of environmental administrative bodies, where \nthe basic structure is left in place, but all of the ' meat ', the 'muscle ', has been removed.   \nAlthough such ' skeletonization ' of environmental administrative bodies is not new to the neoliberal \nlandscape and has been occurring in various contexts for some time  (Peck 2001) , what signifies a shift toward \nremoval of consent (and thus the authoritarian form of neoliberalism) is the silencing of MMA employees. \nAccording to several MMA  employees, many  of those who dissented,  were fired (if they weren 't tenured)  or \nremoved from their posts and demoted and/or given positions in remote  areas of Brazil  (if they were tenured) . \nOther s lamented the fact that \" now, (the new government) close(s) our mouth and we can' t say anything about \nanybody\"  (ICMBio  employee, April 2019) complete  with a  media blackout order, which restrict ed them from \nposting or publicizing anything about their work, including conservation successes.  \n \nWeakening of protective measures  \nThe 'skeletonizing ' of environmental administrative bodies has proven effective at weakening both the \nproduction of new protective measures and the enforcement of established ones. As of October 2019, the MMA \nwas still 24% empty and only 21 out of 27 state superintendent positions in IBAMA remained open  according \nto several government employees . In the first eight months of 2019, there was a 29.4% reduction in fines for \nillegal logging compared to the same period in  2018 (BBC News 2019a) . This was not due to a decre ase in \nillegal logging as deforestation increased 30% in the period of August 2018 to July 2019 compared to the \nprevious year according to Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE), which monitors deforestation by satellite  \n(Dwyer 2019; Vaughan 2019) .  \nMoreover, according to several employees in ICMBio, Bolsonaro elimina ted the screening process for \napplicants  for positions in national environmental agencies, which require  technical expertise and experience. \nInstead, he encouraged environmental military police to apply (Acebes, Wilkinson and T\u00e9llez- Ch\u00e1vez 2019; \nObser vat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . Their main qualification then, as one interviewee pointed out, was that they knew \nhow to take orders without question or thought. These new directors and presidents lack both in technical \nexpertise and strategic planning for envi ronmental stability  (Acebes, Wilkinson and T\u00e9llez- Ch\u00e1vez 2019) . \nFurthermore, according to several government employees, because all of  the decisions are made by these new \nemployees, and because they take orders from above rather than base their decisions on science and technical \nexpertise coming from below, the situation has effectively rendered the MMA and all of its affiliated institutions \nineffective . \n \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  833 \n Anti- environmentalist enmity  \nOnce Bolsonaro began to secure the ineffectiveness of the MMA and its affiliated institutions he was \nthen able to use this ineffectiveness  as further \" proof \" that such institutions are not working and are, therefore, \nunnecessary  (as described by several interviewees and in Esteves, 2019) . This adds to his claims that civ il \nservants in the advocate movement are inept and incompetent  (see Acebes et al. , 2019; Casado and Londo\u00f1o, \n2019) . In response to the INPE  report on deforestation, Bolsonaro attempted to discredit Ricardo Galv\u00e3o, the \nspace agency 's director  (Tollefson 2019) . The public dispute led to Galv\u00e3o resigning even though the satellite \nimages and their associated data, which support Galv\u00e3o' s claims,  are open and available to the public  (BBC \nNews 2019b) . When he  is not de -legitimizing supporters of protective measures, he accuses them of foul play, \nsuch as when he blamed NGOs for starting the Amazon fires that made international news in August 2019  \n(BBC News 2019b) . \nDissolution of CONAMA and other civic spaces  \nGoing hand in hand with the skeletonizing of environmental administrative bodies is the dissolution of \ncivic spaces. In March  2019, the Bolsonaro government issued a decree to dissolve  Brazil 's National Councils, \nterminate the National Social Participation Policy , and dismantle  spaces within the administrative structure for \npublic participation. M embers who thought their councils were important were told to  write a letter justifying \nthe existence of the council  within 48 days and the government would decide which counci ls to recreate. \nAccording to several interviewees, two of the major targets of these attempts were Conservation Unit councils \nand the national council for the environment (CONAMA). Fortunately, the Supreme Court limited the effects \nof the decree  to those t hat were not established through legal mechanisms , but civic spaces were still greatly \nreduced  (Coletta and Faria 2019) . According to a manage r of a major ENGO, \" In the past . . . we have a way to \ntalk with (environmental agency employees). Established places where we can talk . . . we d on't have space \nanymore to talk\"  (October 2019) . \nCONAMA  is a particularly important one of these spaces  and include d representatives from the state, \nprivate, and public sectors. In May  2019 , the council was reduced from 96 board members to 23 and the \nselection process was replaced with a lottery -style draw for  13 of the board members  (Acebes, Wilkinson and \nT\u00e9llez -Ch\u00e1vez 2019; Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . Civil society lost the greatest number  of seats, shifting the \nweight of the council towards the federal government , which maintains the ten fixed (non -lottery) positions . As \none interviewee put it: \" So now (the government has) a body that will issue rules and decisions in a way that \ninterests them \" (ENGO employee specializing in public policy, July 2019).  \nWeakening of protective measures  \nCONAMA is responsible for deliberating on and advising government policy with respect to the \nenvironment and natural resources. As such, it sets the standards for environmental practices of businesses and \ncorporations. Thus, shifting the power on the council in favor of the pro- business federal government allows \nfor environmental measures to be interpreted in favor of business.  This was made particularly clear with the \nhighly controversial removal by the council of three Resolutions meant to protect the environment from private \ninterests in September 2020 (Guimar\u00e3es 2021) . Moreover, the elimination of public participation in the form of \nvarious forums and councils, ensures a lack of oversight by and accountability to the public.  The dissolution of \npublic participation is itself a weakening of protective measures, but it also ensures that the public will have a \nreduced role (via their representatives) in deciding which protective environmental measures will be \ncompromised to accommodate the expansion of businesses.  \nAnti- environmentalist enmity  \nBy reducing public participation in governance, restriction of access to information is justified and public  \nrepresentatives  are forced to turn to secondary sources for updates on government discussions and operations.  \nWith Bolsonaro' s history of publicly attacking environmental scientists and leaders  (Angelo 2019; Tollefson \n2019) , this does not bode well for a balanced understanding of the actions of these guardians of protective \nmeasures.  \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  834 \n Reorganizing within m inistries  \nAnother tactic of the Bolsonaro administration has been  to reorganize responsibilities within the \nministries, especially to open up land for  agricultural development  and augment agribusinesses ' control over \nland in ge neral. Bolsonaro attempted to move the responsibility of the demarcation of indigenous lands from \nFUNAI (in the Ministry of Justice) to the Ministry o f Agriculture  (Acebes, Wilkinson and T\u00e9llez -Ch\u00e1vez 2019) . \nThis attempt failed .10 However , he did succeed in moving the body in charge of managing national forests, the \nBrazilian Forest Service (SFB), from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Agriculture , as well as the \nmanagement of water resources to the Ministry of Regional Development  (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . The \nSFB is also responsible for the R ural Environmental R egistry  (CAR). S et up by the Forest Code of 2012, CAR  \nrequires a certain percentage of privately owned land to be set aside for conservation.  \nWeakening of protective measures  \nThe relocation of CAR essentially means that ' the fox is guarding the hen house ' as the head of the SFB , \nValdir Colatto, is a member of the agriculture voting bloc  and worked against the Forest Code (Gonzales 2019) . \nAdditionally, the movement of CAR and SFB  has particularly significant implications for the conservation of \njaguars (Panthera onca) and their habitats since conservationists , according to interviewees in ICMBio, ENGOs, \nand academia,  have been working with landowners  and CAR to coordinate conserved lands into corridors for \njaguar use.  According to an interviewee, who is an employee of ICMBio, the use of CAR for jaguar corridor s \nis further confounded by Colatto' s pro -hunting stance , as more farmers will have guns . Poaching of jaguars due \nto conflicts with farmers is one of the major threats to the large cat in many areas of Brazil  (Paviolo et al. 2016) . \nAnd without the ability to utilize CAR to allow  for more free movement of the animals,  there are few  other \nmeans to mitigate conflict according to the interviewee . \nAnti- environmentalist enmity  \nThe intent behind the reorganization of ministries is clearly to allow agribusinesses to exercise control \nover the measures that restrict their activities  (Acebes, Wilkinson and T\u00e9llez -Ch\u00e1vez 2019; Observat\u00f3rio do \nClima 2020; D. Phillips 2019b) . In the case of the relocation of CAR, jaguar conservationists have lost an \nimportant tool for jaguar conservation, ha mpering their ability to protect the jaguar from extinction. Since such \nprocesses are so  complex, to the general public  it may read as a simple failure of conservationists to do their \njobs.  Such is arguably the case with any tools for protecting nature tha t have been transferred to the hands of \nthe very businesses that nature needs protecting from.  \nDefunding of NGOs  and federal universities  \nThe next Bolsonaran tactic actually  brings us full circle in a way: the attempt  to defund NGOs. On \nJanuary 14,  2019 Bolsonaro' s Minister of Environment Ricardo Salles  shut down \" all agreements and \npartnerships with non- governmental bodies (NGOs) which are recipients of funds managed by the MMA, \nIBAMA  (the nation 's environmental agency), ICMBio (its national park m anagement agency), and JBRJ (the \nRio de Janeiro Botanical Garden Research Institute) \" (Gonzales 2019)  until he could audit them all himself , \nanother part of the ' firehouse effect .' But it turns out  he couldn' t legally do that with NGOs  that receive \ninternational funding  and after much public outcry,  he walked it back to just those NGOs receiving federal \nfunding  and not those \"agreements or partnerships that have been already in execution \" (Gonzales 2019) . Still, \n \n10 The reason the attempt to move the demarcation  of lands failed is actually because of a recent Supreme Court case that \nset a precedent for presidential decrees. Presidential decrees have an expiration date, where they must be reviewed and \napproved by the legislative branch within 120 days. What this S upreme Court case did was establish that, if a decree expires \nbefore it can be approved, then it cannot be reintroduced in the same year. And this is also where the opposition' s strength \nlies. Not only is the legal system strong, with sympathetic judges in  the Supreme Court, but most of congress members are \nexperienced, whereas many of the rural caucus members are new and inexperienced. For presidential decrees in particular, \nthis works strongly in the opposition' s favor. One of the biggest strategies to pr event a decree from passing before its \nexpiration date is to talk as much as you can to kill time. Unfortunately for the newbies, they saw this as an opportunity to  \nbe seen and heard. So both sides of congress are talking hundreds of presidential decrees i nto expiration (Acebes, Wilkinson \nand T\u00e9llez-Ch\u00e1vez 2019) . \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  835 \n he has made attempts at limiting and/or divert ing international funding, such as the Amazon Fund. The Amazon \nFund, set up in 2008, is an international partnership with developed nations , particularly  Norway and Germany , \nto provide roughly $US87 million annually \"to prevent, monitor and combat deforest ation, as well as to promote \nthe preservation and sustainable use in the Brazilian Amazon \" (Amazon Fund no date) .  \nIn addition to attempting to limit funding sources to NGOs, the Bolsonaro administration also took aim \nat funding for federal universities in late April 2019. First announcing plans to cut funding to sociology and \nphilosophy departments, this morphed into a 30% funding cut to Brazil 's three major universities, and then a \n30% cut to all federal universities (Redden 2019) . The funding cuts were especially meant to target non -\nutilitarian disciplines in order to \" focus on areas that generate an im mediate return to the taxpayer, such as: \nveterinary, engineering, and medicine \" (Bolsonaro 2019) . In addition to the budget cuts, the administration also \nfroze funding for more than 3, 000 postgraduate research scholarships (Escobar 2019b) . \n Weakening of protective measures  \nAccording to several ENGO employees, m any of the E NGOs in Brazil have been able to maintain their \ninternational funds, since such funds are not (yet) subject to government oversight. According to one \ninterviewee in the E NGO sector, some of the E NGOs that l ost funding have shifted their funding sources to \nBrazil ian states.  However, t he actions of the Bolsonaro administration to dramatically redefine the rules of the \nAmazon Fund, particularly to restrict the use of funds by NGOs to combat deforestation and to  compensate \nproperty owners for land confiscated in protected areas, has le d to N orway and Germany freezing their funds  \n(Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . As a result, those NGOs that received funding from the Amazon Fund have had \nto suspend projects and reduce their staff , according to several employees of these NGOs . This in evitably has \nimplications for their ability to combat deforestation in the Amazon.  \nBy limiting funding to non -utilitarian disciplines in academ ia, the Bolsonaro administration silences the \ncritical voices of intellectuals  and by freezing funds for postgraduate research, they reduce a key source of \ninformation that drives environmental policy. Thus, defunding of federal universities serves to degrade the \nfoundation on which protective environmental measures are built.  \nAnti- environmentalist enmity  \nWhen the Amazon fires raged in August 2019, increasing by 84% over the previous year according to \nINPE  (BBC News 2019b; Taylor 2019) , the fires were widely regarded by conservationists as  being attributable \nto the rise in deforestation to clear land for agricultural development  (BBC News 2019b; Spring and \nEisenhammer 2019) . Bolsonaro, whose policies and rhetoric likely enabled this deforestation (Escobar 2020; \nLondo\u00f1o and Casado 2019) , indicated that environmental NGOs had intentionally set the fires to garner support \nand bolster funding (BBC N ews 2019b; Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . When these claims were found to be \nunsubstantiated, he doubled down, indicating that Leonardo DiCaprio played a role in inciting the fires  \n(Observat\u00f3rio do Clima 2020) . While Bolsonaro' s claims of the involvement of NGOs and DiCaprio in the fires \nwas unsupported by evidence, a fe w cursory glances at the social media pages of environmental NGOs at the \ntime suggests that  efforts to de -legitimize them wa s in full swing .11 \nBy defunding academ ic institutions  and especially critical social science and research, the Bolsonaro \nadministration ensures the isolation of critical social scientists and a lack of science to support their claims. \nThis, combined with Bolsonaro' s attack s on social scientists as \" cultural Marxist s\", who are supposedly aligned \nwith oligarchs to undermine traditional values (Redden 2019) , then serves to exacerbate the animosity towards \ncritical social scientists and environmentalists.  Our group of researchers experienced this first -hand. While \neating at a restaurant in Atibaia, we were approach ed by the owner, who had clearly had quite a few drinks. \nEmboldened by his intoxication, he asked what we were doing in Brazil. We explained that we were there for \nresearch, but avoided the topic we were there to study (environment and conservation). He increasingly became \nmore aggressive, asking us what we thought of Bolsonaro. We did our best to politely avoid the questions and \nstate that we were simply there to enjoy a pleasant meal. Eventually he very oddly set a glass bottle down on \n \n11 At the time of writing, it appears that the negative and threatening comments on social media have been brought under \ncontrol.  \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  836 \n our table and let it roll off the table to smash while maintaining eye contact with us. The two men who were \naccompanying him urged him to step outside and get some air and, luckily for us, he did. But the whole episode \nserved to bring the anti -intellectual and anti- environm entalist enmity into full focus. It was clear that we, and \nany intellectual environmentalists, were meant to feel intimidated and unwelcome.  \nCooptation of exceptional environmental measures in times of crisis  \nIn States of Exception , Agamben (2005)  shows how governments use exceptional historical moments  to \nincrease their power by us ing crise s to justify the suspension of constitutional rights and laws and the extension \nof military power. Similarly, Naomi Klein (2007)  argues that capitalists also use large -scale disasters , in what \nshe calls disaster capitalism , to extend their power by creating opportunities for new forms of capital \naccumulation in such a way that capitalism not only profits from the disaster itself, but from the distraction \ncreated by the disaster.  In Brazil, Bolsonaro appears to be using  crises of extreme forest loss to create \nopportunities to both extend military powers and to secure opportunities for capital accumulation.  \nThus, a  sixth strategy that emerged during the COVID -19 pandemic, one that  was also visible during the \nAmazon fires in the summer of 2019, is the use of the precedence of exceptional protective measures to guard \nagainst deforestation as justification for increased military presence in sensitive forested areas.  The \nmilitarization  of the Brazilian Amazon is not new and dates back over a century, with various Brazilian \ngovernments setting up military forces in the biome to prevent enemy infiltration of the sparsely populated \nareas, as well as to open opportunities for new extractive  practices  (de Castro, Van Dijck and Hogenboom 2014; \nL\u00f3pez 2009) . However, what is new is the use of forest protection in times of crisis as an excuse to increase \nmilitary presence in the Amazon . Although Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (aka Lula) used the military to battle \ndeforestation  during his presidency, he did so as part of a robust environmental strategy (Brands 2011) . In \ncontrast,  the need to protect the  forest  under Bolsonaro is a direct result of the lack of enforcement of \nenvironmental regulation s under his administration (BBC News 2019b; Spring and Eisenhammer 2019) .  \nWhen news of the raging Amazon fires generated global concern in 2019, Bolsonaro sent the army to \ncombat the  fires and t hey remained there until late October (Garcia 2019) . Then when Bolsonaro created a new \nAmazon Council in January 2020, he simultaneously created a new Environmental Police force composed of \nstate military police to support the new Council, also headed by a retired military general , Hamilton Mour\u00e3o,  \nwho openly supports mining development in the Amazon (Rocha 2020) . As deforestation increased  under the \ncover of the COVID -19 pandemic with  the fire s eason approaching , Bolsonaro deployed the military  to the \nAmazon  in May  2020 by Decree 10.341/2020, three months earlier than in 2019. Importantly, the Decree also \nput environmental protection of the Amazon under the control of the army.  And in October 2020, the newly \nformed Amazon Council announced that the military would remain in the Amazon until April 2021 (Carvalho \n2020) . I argue tha t, although the use of the military to protect the Amazon from foreign infiltration and to \nexpand extractive opportunities has a long history, what is new is that it is being done under a democracy where \nthere should (presumably) be consent. Under military rule, there was no such presumption.  \n (Not) Weakening protective measures  \nIn this case, rather than weakening of protective measures, this strategy takes advantage of such measures \nto secure opportunities for extraction. While the decrees to deploy the military to the Amazon state d, in part, \nthe intent to help combat fires , others believe d this to be a smokescreen to  further militarize the Amazon as  part \nof a plan to expedite the  opening of  the biome for extractive industry  (Dias 2019) . Known as the Barao do Rio \nBranco Plan,  a project proposed by Bolsonaro shortly after taking office would introduce a new hydro- electric \ndam, bridge, and highway extensions to allow for easier access to areas of the Amazon . The proposed project \nhas drawn wide criticism from socio -environmentalists due to its lack of acknowledgment and/or assessment \nof potential effects on  important biodiversity preserves , indigenous reserves and quilombo communities  (D. \nPhillips 2019a; Rocha 2019)  and there has been some indication t hat the increased militarization of the Amazon \nis associated with this project (Dias 2019) .  \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  837 \n Anti- environmentalist enmity  \nAs stated elsewhere, IBAMA is t he Brazilian  agency normally charged with monitoring and enforcement \nof environmental r egulations . However, Bolsonaro' s 2020 budget included a 25% cut to IBAMA 's forest \nmonitoring programs  (Rocha 2020) . Additionally, the creation of the Amazon Council and an  Environmental \nPolice force staffed by military personnel, as well as Decree 10.341/2020 \u2013 which  among other things  put \nenvironmental protection of the Amazon under the control of the army \u2013  superseded IBAMA 's oversight of \ndeforestation in the Amazon (Bonduki 2020; Soares 2020) . By displacing  the non- military government officials \nof IBAMA and defunding its forest monitoring programs, the Bolsona ro administration is simultaneously \nmaking a statement that IBAMA is not capable of performing its duties, while also ensuring that they are unable \nto do so.  \n \n5. Conclusion   \nFisher (2019, p. 384)  writes, \"(E)nvironmental law engages all the institutional and legal resources of a \nconstitutional democracy to operate \u2014public discourse, e xpertise, public administration, legislation, \naccountability, dispute resolution, multi- level governance and much else besides. \" Bolsonaro is actively \nremoving each of these resources at the national level. Meanwhile, as Brazil 's forests continue to suffer  from \nunsustainable levels of deforestation (Silva Junior et al. 2021)  and record numbers of fires (Muniz, Fonseca and \nRibiero 2020; Watanabe 2020) , scientists are predicting that 40% of the Amazon rainforest could become \nsavannah in the near future unless more is  done to combat def orestation and climate change (Staal et al. 2020) . \nIt is thus more critical than ever to understand why an d how Bolsonaro is accomplishing the dismantling of \nfederal environmental safeguards and institutions. Moreover, w hile such processes are understood to occur in \nshifts from \" progressive \" to authoritarian neoliberalism, there is still a broad gap in analyse s on how  this shift \noccurs. This article attempt ed to narrow this gap by conceptualizing Bolsonaro' s anti -environment antics within \nthe broader context of the contemporary authoritarian neoliberal turn.  \nFollowing Poulantzas ' (1978)  analysis of ' authoritarian statism ', Bruff (2014, p. 125)  describes the \n'authoritarian fix ' as a restructuring of state institutions  to remove barriers to capitalist accumulation . As such, \nI approach the analysis of  Bolsonaro' s strategies  with the assumption that they aim to  remov e barriers to capital \naccumulation . I show how each strategy accomplishes this goal  by either  weakening environmental measures \nthat place limit s on capitalist extraction , or by strengthening measures that can be used to extend military pow er \nand expand control over resources for extraction. But Bolsonaro must simultaneously remove the guardians of \nthe protective environmental  measures to prevent their return,  and I suggest that he accomplishes this by \nengaging anti -environmentalist enmity to de -legitimize  the supporters of e nvironmental regulation .12  \nOn a final note, w hile this article focused on Bolsonaro' s far right government, caution is warranted  in \nassign ing authoritarianism as it relates to en vironmental governance as a (strictly) far right phenomenon. Recent \nexplorations of post -political trends indicate that the far right are not alone in removing dissent in favor of \nunrestrained capitalism. Post- politics, or the yielding of power based on gl obal ideological visions of the world \nto technocratic expertise (\u017di\u017eek 1999) , is increasingly rearing its head in environmental politics. Fletcher (2014)  \ndescribes the \" orchestrating of consent \" to neoliberal agendas in the 2012 International Conservation Congress, \nwhere dissent is dispensed with through multiple str ategies geared toward creating the illusion of consent to the \nneoliberal hegemonization of international conservation. With its focus on faith in ' objective ' technocratic \nknowledge as authority, the post -politicization of environmental governance stands in stark contrast to methods \nof removal of consent by authoritarian neoliberals, which often i nclude post -truth political gas lighting to \n \n12 A theme that runs through many of the articles in this special issue is Foucault 's conceptualization of 'biopower ' and the \ntension between life and death. In connection with this theme, the exceptional measures that are being removed in Brazi l \nwere arguably put in place to ' make live'  certain forms of life that enhance biodiversity and climate stability. By removing \nsuch measures and preventing their return via enmity, these lifeforms are essentially being made to ' let die ', even to the point \nof extinction. More than that, it could be argued that these lifeforms will be ' made to die'  to make way for other lifeforms to \nbe 'made to live'  that support capitalist extraction (e.g. corn, soy, cattle) . In this sense, anti -environmentalist enmity is more \nthan just an objective of authoritarian neoliberals such as Bolsonaro. It is also emblematic of the broader enmity of life and \ndeath struggles inherent in the struggle for ' biopower. ' \nDeutsch                                                                         Bolsonaro' s anti-environment agenda  \n \nJournal of Political Ecology                                       Vol. 28, 2021  838 \n systematically extinguish public faith in any ' objective ' truth  (Neimark et al. 2019) . Yet the two accomplish the \nsame foreclosure on any paths forward that do not  center on capitalism . Thus, an interesting and important area \nfor future research could include an examination of  the confluences and divergences of the two methods with \nrespect to environmental governance.  \n \nBibliography  \nAcara, E. 2019.

Political trolls,\nsuch as the ones linked to the Russian In-\nternet Research Agency (IRA), have recently\ngained enormous attention for their ability\nto sway public opinion and even in\ufb02uence\nelections. Analysis of the online traces of\ntrolls has shown different behavioral patterns,\nwhich target different slices of the population.\nHowever, this analysis is manual and labor-\nintensive, thus making it impractical as a \ufb01rst-\nresponse tool for newly-discovered troll farms.\nIn this paper, we show how to automate this\nanalysis by using machine learning in a real-\nistic setting. In particular, we show how to\nclassify trolls according to their political role\n\u2014left, news feed, right\u2014 by using features\nextracted from social media, i.e., Twitter, in\ntwo scenarios: ( i) in a traditional supervised\nlearning scenario, where labels for trolls are\navailable, and ( ii) in a distant supervision sce-\nnario, where labels for trolls are not available,\nand we rely on more-commonly-available la-\nbels for news outlets mentioned by the trolls.\nTechnically, we leverage the community struc-\nture and the text of the messages in the on-\nline social network of trolls represented as a\ngraph, from which we extract several types of\nlearned representations, i.e., embeddings, for\nthe trolls. Experiments on the \u201cIRA Russian\nTroll\u201d dataset show that our methodology im-\nproves over the state-of-the-art in the \ufb01rst sce-\nnario, while providing a compelling case for\nthe second scenario, which has not been ex-\nplored in the literature thus far.\n1 Introduction\nInternet \u201ctrolls\u201d are users of an online community\nwho quarrel and upset people, seeking to sow dis-\ncord by posting in\ufb02ammatory content. More re-\ncently, organized \u201ctroll farms\u201d of political opinion\nmanipulation trolls have also emerged.Such farms usually consist of state-sponsored\nagents who control a set of pseudonymous user\naccounts and personas, the so-called \u201csockpup-\npets\u201d, which disseminate misinformation and pro-\npaganda in order to sway opinions, destabi-\nlize the society, and even in\ufb02uence elections\n(Linvill and Warren ,2018 ).\nThe behavior of political trolls has been ana-\nlyzed in different recent circumstances, such as\nthe 2016 US Presidential Elections and the Brexit\nreferendum in UK ( Linvill and Warren ,2018 ;\nLlewellyn et al. ,2018 ). However, this kind of\nanalysis requires painstaking and time-consuming\nmanual labor to sift through the data and to catego-\nrize the trolls according to their actions. Our goal\nin the current paper is to automate this process\nwith the help of machine learning (ML). In par-\nticular, we focus on the case of the 2016 US Pres-\nidential Elections, for which a public dataset from\nTwitter is available. For this case, we consider\nonly accounts that post content in English, and we\nwish to divide the trolls into some of the func-\ntional categories identi\ufb01ed by Linvill and Warren\n(2018 ):left troll ,right troll , and news feed .\nWe consider two possible scenarios. The \ufb01rst,\nprototypical ML scenario is supervised learning,\nwhere we want to learn a function from users to\ncategories {left,right ,news feed }, and the ground\ntruth labels for the troll users are available. This\nscenario has been considered previously in the lit-\nerature by Kim et al. (2019 ). Unfortunately, a so-\nlution for such a scenario is not directly applicable\nto a real-world use case. Suppose a new troll farm\ntrying to sway the upcoming European or US elec-\ntions has just been discovered. While the identities\nof the accounts might be available, the labels to\nlearn from would not be present. Thus, any super-\nvised machine learning approach would fall short\nof being a fully automated solution to our initial\nproblem.\nA more realistic scenario assumes that labels for\ntroll accounts are not available . In this case, we\nneed to use some external information in order\nto learn a labeling function. Indeed, we leverage\nmore persistent entities and their labels: news me-\ndia. We assume a learning scenario with distant\nsupervision where labels for news media are avail-\nable. By combining these labels with a citation\ngraph from the troll accounts to news media, we\ncan infer the \ufb01nal labeling on the accounts them-\nselves without any need for manual labeling.\nOne advantage of using distant supervision is\nthat we can get insights about the behavior of\na newly-discovered troll farm quickly and effort-\nlessly. Differently from troll accounts in social\nmedia, which usually have a high churn rate, news\nmedia accounts in social media are quite stable.\nTherefore, the latter can be used as an anchor point\nto understand the behavior of trolls, for which data\nmay not be available.\nWe rely on embeddings extracted from social\nmedia. In particular, we use a combination of em-\nbeddings built on the user-to-user mention graph,\nthe user-to-hashtag mention graph, and the text of\nthe tweets of the troll accounts. We further explore\nseveral possible approaches using label propaga-\ntion for the distant supervision scenario.\nAs a result of our approach, we improve the\nclassi\ufb01cation accuracy by more than 5 percent-\nage points for the supervised learning scenario.\nThe distant supervision scenario has not previ-\nously been considered in the literature, and is one\nof the main contributions of the paper. We show\nthat even by hiding the labels from the ML algo-\nrithm, we can recover 78.5% of the correct labels.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summa-\nrized as follows:\n\u2022We predict the political role of Internet trolls\n(left,news feed ,right ) in a realistic, unsuper-\nvised scenario, where labels for the trolls are\nnot available, and which has not been explored\nin the literature before.\n\u2022We propose a novel distant supervision ap-\nproach for this scenario, based on graph em-\nbeddings, BERT, and label propagation, which\nprojects the more-commonly-available labels\nfor news media onto the trolls who cited these\nmedia.\n\u2022We improve over the state of the art in the tra-\nditional, fully supervised setting, where train-\ning labels are available.2 Related Work\n2.1 Trolls and Opinion Manipulation\nThe promise of social media to democratize con-\ntent creation ( Kaplan and Haenlein ,2010 ) has\nbeen accompanied by many malicious attempts\nto spread misleading information over this new\nmedium, which quickly got populated by sock-\npuppets (Kumar et al. ,2017 ),Internet water army\n(Chen et al. ,2013 ),astroturfers (Ratkiewicz et al. ,\n2011 ), and seminar users (Darwish et al. ,2017 ).\nSeveral studies have shown that trust is an impor-\ntant factor in online relationships ( Ho et al. ,2012 ;\nKu,2012 ;Hsu et al. ,2014 ;Elbeltagi and Agag ,\n2016 ;Ha et al. ,2016 ), but building trust is a long-\nterm process and our understanding of it is still\nin its infancy ( Salo and Karjaluoto ,2007 ). This\nmakes it easy for politicians and companies to\nmanipulate user opinions in forums ( Dellarocas ,\n2006 ;Li et al. ,2016 ;Zhuang et al. ,2018 ).\nTrolls. Social media have seen the prolifera-\ntion of fake news and clickbait ( Hardalov et al. ,\n2016 ;Karadzhov et al. ,2017a ), aggressiveness\n(Moore et al. ,2012 ), and trolling ( Cole ,2015 ).\nThe latter often is understood to concern mali-\ncious online behavior that is intended to disrupt\ninteractions, to aggravate interacting partners, and\nto lure them into fruitless argumentation in or-\nder to disrupt online interactions and communica-\ntion ( Chen et al. ,2013 ). Here we are interested in\nstudying not just any trolls, but those that engage\nin opinion manipulation ( Mihaylov et al. ,2015a ,b,\n2018 ). This latter de\ufb01nition of troll has also be-\ncome prominent in the general public discourse\nrecently. Del Vicario et al. (2016 ) have also sug-\ngested that the spreading of misinformation on-\nline is fostered by the presence of polarization and\necho chambers in social media ( Garimella et al. ,\n2016 ,2017 ,2018 ).\nTrolling behavior is present and has been\nstudied in all kinds of online media: on-\nline magazines ( Binns ,2012 ), social network-\ning sites ( Cole ,2015 ), online computer games\n(Thacker and Grif\ufb01ths ,2012 ), online encyclope-\ndia (Shachaf and Hara ,2010 ), and online newspa-\npers ( Ruiz et al. ,2011 ), among others.\nTroll detection was addressed using domain-\nadapted sentiment analysis ( Seah et al. ,2015 ),\nlexico-syntactic features about writing style and\nstructure ( Chen et al. ,2012 ;Mihaylov and Nakov ,\n2016 ), and graph-based approaches over signed\nsocial networks ( Kumar et al. ,2014 ).\nSockpuppet is a related notion, and refers to\na person who assumes a false identity in an In-\nternet community and then speaks to or about\nthemselves while pretending to be another person.\nThe term has also been used to refer to opinion\nmanipulation, e.g., in Wikipedia ( Solorio et al. ,\n2014 ). Sockpuppets have been identi\ufb01ed by us-\ning authorship-identi\ufb01cation techniques and link\nanalysis ( Bu et al. ,2013 ). It has been also shown\nthat sockpuppets differ from ordinary users in their\nposting behavior, linguistic traits, and social net-\nwork structure ( Kumar et al. ,2017 ).\nInternet Water Army is a literal translation of\nthe Chinese term wangluo shuijun , which is a\nmetaphor for a large number of people who are\nwell organized to \ufb02ood the Internet with purpose-\nful comments and articles. Internet water army\nhas been allegedly used in China by the govern-\nment (also known as 50 Cent Party ) as well as by\na number of private organizations.\nAstrotur\ufb01ng is an effort to simulate a political\ngrass-roots movement. It has attracted strong in-\nterest from political science, and research on it has\nfocused on massive streams of microblogging data\n(Ratkiewicz et al. ,2011 ).\nIdenti\ufb01cation of malicious accounts in so-\ncial media includes detecting spam accounts\n(Almaatouq et al. ,2016 ;McCord and Chuah ,\n2011 ), fake accounts ( Fire et al. ,2014 ;\nCresci et al. ,2015 ), compromised and phish-\ning accounts ( Adewole et al. ,2017 ). Fake pro\ufb01le\ndetection has also been studied in the context\nof cyber-bullying ( Gal\u00b4 an-Garc\u00b4 \u0131a et al. ,2016 ). A\nrelated problem is that of Web spam detection ,\nwhich has been addressed as a text classi\ufb01cation\nproblem ( Sebastiani ,2002 ), e.g., using spam\nkeyword spotting ( Dave et al. ,2003 ), lexical\naf\ufb01nity of arbitrary words to spam content\n(Hu and Liu ,2004 ), frequency of punctuation and\nword co-occurrence ( Li et al. ,2006 ).\nTrustworthiness of online statements is an\nemerging topic, given the interest in fake news\n(Lazer et al. ,2018 ). It is related to trolls, as they\noften engage in opinion manipulation and spread\nrumors ( V osoughi et al. ,2018 ). Research topics\ninclude predicting the credibility of information\nin social media ( Ma et al. ,2016 ;Mitra et al. ,\n2017 ;Karadzhov et al. ,2017b ;Popat et al. ,\n2017 ) and political debates ( Hassan et al. ,2015 ;\nGencheva et al. ,2017 ;Jaradat et al. ,2018 ), and\nstance classi\ufb01cation ( Mohtarami et al. ,2018 ).For example, Castillo et al. (2011 ) leverage user\nreputation, author writing style, and various time-\nbased features, Canini et al. (2011 ) analyze the\ninteraction of content and social network struc-\nture, and Morris et al. (2012 ) studied how Twit-\nter users judge truthfulness. Zubiaga et al. (2016 )\nstudy how people handle rumors in social me-\ndia, and found that users with higher reputation\nare more trusted, and thus can spread rumors eas-\nily. Lukasik et al. (2015 ) use temporal patterns\nto detect rumors and to predict their frequency,\nandZubiaga et al. (2016 ) focus on conversational\nthreads. More recent work has focused on the\ncredibility and the factuality in community forums\n(Nakov et al. ,2017 ;Mihaylova et al. ,2018 ,2019 ;\nMihaylov et al. ,2018 ).\n2.2 Understanding the Role of Political Trolls\nNone of the above work has focused on under-\nstanding the role of political trolls. The only\nclosely relevant work is that of Kim et al. (2019 ),\nwho predict the roles of the Russian trolls on Twit-\nter by leveraging social theory and Actor-Network\nTheory approaches. They characterize trolls using\nthe digital traces they leave behind, which is mod-\neled using a time-sensitive semantic edit distance.\nFor this purpose, they use the \u201cIRA Russian Troll\u201d\ndataset ( Linvill and Warren ,2018 ), which we also\nuse in our experiments. However, we have a very\ndifferent approach based on graph embeddings,\nwhich we show to be superior to their method in\nthe supervised setup. We further experiment with\na new, and arguably more realistic, setup based on\ndistant supervision, where labels are not available.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this setup has not\nbeen explored in previous work.\n2.3 Graph Embeddings\nGraph embeddings are machine learning tech-\nniques to model and capture key features from\na graph automatically. They can be trained ei-\nther in a supervised or in an unsupervised manner\n(Cai et al. ,2018 ). The produced embeddings are\nlatent vector representations that map each vertex\nVin a graph Gto ad-dimensional vector. The vec-\ntors capture the underlying structure of the graph\nby putting \u201csimilar\u201d vertices close together in the\nvector space. By expressing our data as a graph\nstructure, we can leverage and extract critical in-\nsights about the topology and the contextual rela-\ntionships between the vertices in the graph.\nIn mathematical terms, graph embeddings can be\nexpressed as a function f:V\u2192Rdfrom the set\nof vertices Vto a set of embeddings, where dis the\ndimensionality of the embeddings. The function f\ncan be represented as a matrix of dimensions |V|\u00d7\nd. In our experiments, we train Graph Embeddings\nin an unsupervised manner by using node2vec\n(Grover and Leskovec ,2016 ), which is based on\nrandom walks over the graph. Essentially, this is\nan application of the well-known skip-gram model\n(Mikolov et al. ,2013 ) from word2vec to random\nwalks on graphs.\nBesides node2vec , there have been a num-\nber of competing proposals for building graph\nembeddings; see ( Cai et al. ,2018 ) for an ex-\ntensive overview of the topic. For example,\nSNE (Liao et al. ,2018 ) model both the graph\nstructure and some node attributes. Similarly,\nLine (Tang et al. ,2015 ) represent each node as\nthe concatenation of two embedded vectors that\nmodel \ufb01rst- and second-order proximity. TriDNR\n(Pan et al. ,2016 ) represents nodes by coupling\nseveral neural network models. For our experi-\nments, we use node2vec, as we do not have ac-\ncess to user attributes: the users have been banned\nfrom Twitter, their accounts were suspended, and\nwe only have access to their tweets thanks to the\n\u201cIRA Russian Trolls\u201d dataset.\n3 Method\nGiven a set of known political troll users (each\nuser being represented as a collection of their\ntweets), we aim to detect their role: left,right ,\nornews feed .Linvill and Warren (2018 ) describe\nthese roles as follows:\nRight Trolls spread nativist and right-leaning\npopulist messages. Such trolls support the candi-\ndacy and Presidency of Donald Trump and den-\nigrate the Democratic Party; moreover, they of-\nten send divisive messages about mainstream and\nmoderate Republicans.\nLeft Trolls send socially liberal messages and\ndiscuss gender, sexual, religious, and -especially-\nracial identity. Many tweets are seemed intention-\nally divisive, attacking mainstream Democratic\npoliticians, particularly Hillary Clinton, while\nsupporting Bernie Sanders prior to the elections.\nNews Feed Trolls overwhelmingly present\nthemselves as US local news aggregators, linking\nto legitimate regional news sources and tweeting\nabout issues of local interest.Technically, we leverage the community structure\nand the text of the messages in the social network\nof political trolls represented as a graph, from\nwhich we learn and extract several types of vector\nrepresentations, i.e., troll user embeddings. Then,\narmed with these representations, we tackle the\nfollowing tasks:\nT1A fully supervised learning task, where we\nhave labeled training data with example troll\nand their roles;\nT2A distant supervision learning task, in which\nlabels for the troll roles are notavailable at\ntraining time, and thus we use labels for news\nmedia as a proxy, from which we infer labels\nfor the troll users.\n3.1 Embeddings\nWe use two graph-based (user-to-hashtag and\nuser-to-mentioned-user) and one text-based\n(BERT) embedding representations.\n3.1.1 U2H\nWe build a bipartite, undirected User-to-Hashtag\n(U2H) graph, where nodes are users and hashtags,\nand there is an edge (u,h)between a user node u\nand a hashtag node hif useruuses hashtag hin\ntheir tweets. This graph is bipartite as there are no\nedges connecting two user nodes or two hashtag\nnodes. We run node2vec ( Grover and Leskovec ,\n2016 ) on this graph, and we extract the embed-\ndings for the users (we ignore the hashtag embed-\ndings). We use 128 dimensions for the output em-\nbeddings. These embeddings capture how similar\ntroll users are based on their usage of hashtags.\n3.1.2 U2M\nWe build an undirected User-to-Mentioned-User\n(U2M) graph, where the nodes are users, and there\nis an edge (u,v)between two nodes if user umen-\ntions user vin their tweets (i.e., uhas authored a\ntweet that contains \u201c@ v\u201d ). We run node2vec on\nthis graph and we extract the embeddings for the\nusers. As we are interested only in the troll users,\nwe ignore the embeddings of users who are only\nmentioned by other trolls. We use 128 dimensions\nfor the output embeddings. The embeddings ex-\ntracted from this graph capture how similar troll\nusers are according to the targets of their discus-\nsions on the social network.\n3.1.3 BERT\nBERT offers state-of-the-art text embeddings\nbased on the Transformer ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ).\nWe use the pre-trained BERT-large, uncased\nmodel, which has 24-layers, 1024-hidden, 16-\nheads, and 340M parameters, which yields out-\nput embeddings with 768 dimensions. Given a\ntweet, we generate an embedding for it by averag-\ning the representations of the BERT tokens from\nthe penultimate layer of the neural network. To\nobtain a representation for a user, we average the\nembeddings of all their tweets. The embeddings\nextracted from the text capture how similar users\nare according to their use of language.\n3.2 Fully Supervised Learning (T1)\nGiven a set of troll users for which we have labels,\nwe use the above embeddings as a representation\nto train a classi\ufb01er. We use an L2-regularized lo-\ngistic regression (LR) classi\ufb01er. Each troll user\nis an example, and the label for the user is avail-\nable for training thanks to manual labeling. We\ncan therefore use cross-validation to evaluate the\npredictive performance of the model, and thus the\npredictive power of the features.\nWe experiment with two ways of combining\nfeatures: embedding concatenation andmodel en-\nsembling . Embedding concatenation concatenates\nthe feature vectors from different embeddings into\na longer feature vector, which we then use to train\nthe LR model. Model ensembling instead trains a\nseparate model with each kind of embedding, and\nthen merges the prediction of the different mod-\nels by averaging the posterior probabilities for the\ndifferent classes. Henceforth, we denote embed-\nding concatenation with the symbol /bardbland model\nensembling with \u2295. For example, U2H /bardblU2M is\na model trained on the concatenation of U2H and\nU2M embeddings, while U2H \u2295BERT represents\nthe average predictions of two models, one trained\non U2H embeddings and one on BERT.\n3.3 Distant Supervision (T2)\nIn the distant supervision scenario, we assume not\nto have access to user labels. Given a set of troll\nusers without labels, we use the embeddings de-\nscribed in Section 3.1together with mentions of\nnews media by the troll users to create proxy mod-\nels. We assume that labels for news media are\nreadily available, as they are stable sources of in-\nformation that have a low churn rate.We propagate labels from the given media to the\ntroll user that mentions them according to the fol-\nlowing media-to-user mapping:\nLEFT\u2192left\nRIGHT\u2192right\nCENTER\u2192news feed(1)\nThis propagation can be done in different ways:\n(a) by training a proxy model for media and then\napplying it to users, ( b) by additionally using label\npropagation (LP) for semi-supervised learning.\nLet us describe the proxy model propagation for\n(a) \ufb01rst. Let Mbe the set of media, and Ube the\nset of users. We say a user u\u2208Umentions a\nmediumm\u2208Mifuposts a tweet that contains\na link to the website of m. We denote the set of\nusers that mention the medium masCm\u2286U.\nWe can therefore create a representation for a\nmedium by aggregating the embeddings of the\nusers that mention the target medium. Such a\nrepresentation is convenient as it lies in the same\nspace as the user representation. In particular,\ngiven a medium m\u2208M, we compute its repre-\nsentation R(m)as\nR(m) =1\n|Cm|/summationdisplay\nu\u2208CmR(u), (2)\nwhereR(u)is the representation of user u,\ni.e., one (or a concatenation) of the embeddings\ndescribed in Section 3.1.\nFinally, we can train a LR model that uses R(m)\nas features and the label for the medium l(m).\nThis model can be applied to predict the label of\na useruby using the same type of representation\nR(u), and the label mapping in Equation 1.\nLabel Propagation ( b) is a transductive, graph-\nbased, semi-supervised machine learning algo-\nrithm that, given a small set of labeled examples,\nassigns labels to previously unlabeled examples.\nThe labels of each example change in relationship\nto the labels of neighboring ones in a properly-\nde\ufb01ned graph.\nMore formally, given a partially-labeled dataset\nof examples X=Xu\u222aXl, of which Xlare la-\nbeled examples with labels Yl, andXuare unla-\nbeled examples, and a similarity graph G(X,E),\nthe label propagation algorithm \ufb01nds the set of un-\nknown labels Yusuch that the number of discor-\ndant pairs (u,v)\u2208E:yu/ne}ationslash=yvis minimized,\nwhereyzis the label assigned to example z.\nRole Users Tweets User Example Tweet Example\nLeft 233 427141 @samirgooden @MichaelSkolnik @KatrinaPierson @samesfan diari Trump folks\nneed to stop going on CNN.\nRight 630 711668 @chirrmorre BREAKING: Trump ERASES Obama\u2019s Islamic Refuge e Policy!\nhttps://t.co/uPTneTMNM5\nNews Feed 54 598226 @dailysandiego Exit poll: Wisconsin GOP voters excited, sc ared about Trump #pol-\nitics\nTable 1 : Statistics and examples from the IRA Russian Trolls Tweets dataset.\nThe algorithm works as follows: At every iter-\nation of propagation, each unlabeled node updates\nits label to the most frequent one among its neigh-\nbors. LP reaches convergence when each node has\nthe same label as the majority of its neighbors. We\nde\ufb01ne two different versions of LP by creating two\ndifferent versions of the similarity graph G.\nLP1 Label Propagation using direct mention .\nIn the \ufb01rst case, the set of edges among users U\nin the similarity graph Gconsists of the logical\nOR between the 2-hop closure of the U2H and the\nU2M graph. That is, for each two users u,v\u2208U,\nthere is an edge in the similarity graph (u,v)\u2208E\nifuandvshare a common hashtag or a common\nuser mention\n(u,h)\u2208U2H\u2227(v,h)\u2208U2H\u2228\n(u,w)\u2208U2M\u2227(v,w)\u2208U2M\nThe graph therefore uses the same information\nthat is available to the embeddings.\nTo this graph, which currently encompasses\nonly the set of users U, we add connections to the\nset of media M. We add an edge between each\npair(u,m)ifu\u2208Cm. Then, we run the label\npropagation algorithm, which propagates the la-\nbels from the labeled nodes Mto the unlabeled\nnodesU, thanks to the mapping from Equation 1.\nLP2 Label Propagation based on a similarity\ngraph .\nIn this case, we use the same representation for\nthe media as in the proxy model case above, as de-\nscribed by Equation 2. Then, we build a similarity\ngraph among media and users based on their em-\nbeddings. For each pair x,y\u2208U\u222aMthere is an\nedge in the similarity graph (x,y)\u2208Eiff\nsim(R(x),R(y))> \u03c4,\nwhere sim is a similarity function between vectors,\ne.g., cosine similarity, and \u03c4is a user-speci\ufb01ed pa-\nrameter that regulates the sparseness of the simi-\nlarity graph.Finally, we perform label propagation on the\nsimilarity graph de\ufb01ned by the embedding simi-\nlarity, with the set of nodes corresponding to M\nstarting with labels, and with the set of nodes cor-\nresponding to Ustarting without labels.\n4 Data\n4.1 IRA Russian Troll Tweets\nOur main dataset contains 2973371 tweets by\n2848 Twitter users, which the US House In-\ntelligence Committee has linked to the Russian\nInternet Research Agency (IRA). The data was\ncollected and published by Linvill and Warren\n(2018 ), and then made available online.1The time\nspan covers the period from February 2012 to May\n2018.\nThe trolls belong to the following manually as-\nsigned roles: Left Troll, Right Troll, News Feed,\nCommercial, Fearmonger, Hashtag Gamer, Non\nEnglish, Unknown. Kim et al. (2019 ) have argued\nthat the \ufb01rst three categories are not only the most\nfrequent, but also the most interesting ones. More-\nover, focusing on these troll types allows us to es-\ntablish a connection between troll types and the\npolitical bias of the news media they mention. Ta-\nble1shows a summary of the troll role distribu-\ntion, the total number of tweets per role, as well as\nexamples of troll usernames and tweets.\n4.2 Media Bias/Fact Check\nWe use data from Media Bias/Fact Check\n(MBFC)2to label news media sites. MBFC di-\nvides news media into the following bias cate-\ngories: Extreme-Left, Left, Center-Left, Center,\nCenter-Right, Right, and Extreme-Right. We re-\nduce the granularity to three categories by group-\ning Extreme-Left and Left as LEFT, Extreme-\nRight and Right as RIGHT, and Center-Left,\nCenter-Right, and Center as CENTER.\n1http://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-twe ets\n2http://mediabiasfactcheck.com\nBias Count Example\nLEFT 341 www.cnn.com\nRIGHT 619 www.foxnews.com\nCENTER 372 www.apnews.com\nTable 2 : Summary statistics about the Media\nBias/Fact Check (MBFC) dataset.\nTable 2shows some basic statistics about the\nresulting media dataset. Similarly to the IRA\ndataset, the distribution is right-heavy.\n5 Experiments and Evaluation\n5.1 Experimental Setup\nFor each user in the IRA dataset, we extracted all\nthe links in their tweets, we expanded them recur-\nsively if they were shortened, we extracted the do-\nmain of the link, and we checked whether it could\nbe found in the MBFC dataset. By grouping these\nrelationships by media, we constructed the sets of\nusersCmthat mention a given medium m\u2208M.\nThe U2H graph consists of 108410 nodes and\n443121 edges, while the U2M graph has 591793\nnodes and 832844 edges. We ran node2vec on\neach graph to extract 128-dimensional vectors\nfor each node. We used these vectors as fea-\ntures for the fully supervised and for the distant-\nsupervision scenarios. For Label Propagation, we\nused an empirical threshold for edge materializa-\ntion\u03c4= 0.55, to obtain a reasonably sparse simi-\nlarity graph.\nWe used two evaluation measures: accuracy,\nand macro-averaged F1 (the harmonic average\nof precision and recall). In the supervised sce-\nnario, we performed 5-fold cross-validation. In the\ndistant-supervision scenario, we propagated labels\nfrom the media to the users. Therefore, in the latter\ncase the user labels were only used for evaluation.\n5.2 Evaluation Results\nTable 3shows the evaluation results. Each line\nof the table represents a different combination of\nfeatures, models, or techniques. As mentioned in\nSection 3, the symbol \u2018 /bardbl\u2019 denotes a single model\ntrained on the concatenation of the features, while\nthe symbol \u2018 \u2295\u2019 denotes an averaging of individ-\nual models trained on each feature separately. The\ntags \u2018LP1\u2019 and \u2018LP2\u2019 denote the two label propa-\ngation versions, by mention and by similarity, re-\nspectively.We can see that accuracy and macro-averaged F1\nare strongly correlated and yield very consistent\nrankings for the different models. Thus, hence-\nforth we will focus our discussion on accuracy.\nWe can see in Table 3that it is possible to pre-\ndict the roles of the troll users by using distant su-\npervision with relatively high accuracy. Indeed,\nthe results for T2 are lower compared to their T1\ncounterparts by only 10 and 20 points absolute in\nterms of accuracy and F1, respectively. This is im-\npressive considering that the models for T2 have\nno access to labels for troll users.\nLooking at individual features, for both T1 and\nT2, the embeddings from U2M outperform those\nfrom U2H and from BERT. One possible reason\nis that the U2M graph is larger, and thus contains\nmore information. It is also possible that the so-\ncial circle of a troll user is more indicative than\nthe hashtags they used. Finally, the textual content\non Twitter is quite noisy, and thus the BERT em-\nbeddings perform slightly worse when used alone.\nAll our models with a single type of embedding\neasily outperform the model of Kim et al. (2019 ).\nThe difference is even larger when combining the\nembeddings, be it by concatenating the embedding\nvectors or by training separate models and then\ncombining the posteriors of their predictions.\nBy concatenating the U2M and the U2H em-\nbeddings (U2H /bardblU2M), we fully leverage the\nhashtags and the mention representations in the la-\ntent space, thus achieving accuracy of 88.7 for T1\nand 78.0 for T2, which is slightly better than when\ntraining separate models and then averaging their\nposteriors (U2H \u2295U2M): 88.3 for T1 and 77.9\nfor T2. Adding BERT embeddings to the combi-\nnation yields further improvements, and follows a\nsimilar trend, where feature concatenation works\nbetter, yielding 89.2 accuracy for T1 and 78.2 for\nT2 (compared to 89.0 accuracy for T1 and 78.0 for\nT2 for U2H \u2295U2M\u2295BERT).\nAdding label propagation yields further im-\nprovements, both for LP1 and for LP2, with the\nlatter being slightly superior: 89.6 vs. 89.3 accu-\nracy for T1, and 78.5 vs. 78.3 for T2.\nOverall, our methodology achieves sizable im-\nprovements over previous work, reaching an accu-\nracy of 89.6 vs. 84.0 of Kim et al. (2019 ) in the\nfully supervised case. Moreover, it achieves 78.5\naccuracy in the distant supervised case, which is\nonly 11 points behind the result for T1, and is\nabout 10 points above the majority class baseline.\nMethodFull Supervision (T1) Distant Supervision (T2)\nAccuracy Macro F1 Accuracy Macro F1\nBaseline (majority class) 68.7 27.1 68.7 27.1\nKim et al.

With\nsmaller dimensionality (i.e., using 16 dimensions\ninstead of 128), we noticed 2\u20133 points of absolute\ndecrease in accuracy across the board.\nMoreover, we found that using all of the data for\nlearning the embeddings was better than focusing\nonly on users that we target in this study, namely\nleft,right , and news feed , i.e., using the rest of\nthe data adds additional context to the embedding\nspace, and makes the target labels more contex-\ntually distinguishable. Similarly, we observe 5\u20136\npoints of absolute drop in accuracy when training\nour embeddings on tweets by trolls labeled as left,\nright , and news feed .\n6.2 Comparison to Full Supervision\nNext, we compared to the work of Kim et al.\n(2019 ), who had a fully supervised learning sce-\nnario, based on Tarde\u2019s Actor-Network Theory.\nThey paid more attention to the content of the\ntweet by applying a text-distance metric in order\nto capture the semantic distance between two se-\nquences. In contrast, we focus on critical elements\nof information that are salient in Twitter: hashtags\nanduser mentions . By building a connection be-\ntween users, hashtags, and user mentions, we ef-\nfectively \ufb01ltered out the noise and we focused only\non the most sensitive type of context, thus auto-\nmatically capturing features from this network via\ngraph embeddings.Method Accuracy Macro F1\nBaseline (majority) 46.5 21.1\nBERT 61.8 60.4\nU2H 61.6 60.0\nU2M 62.7 61.4\nU2H\u2295U2M 63.5 61.8\nU2H/bardblU2M 63.8 61.9\nU2H\u2295U2M\u2295BERT 63.7 61.8\nU2H/bardblU2M/bardblBERT 64.0 62.2\nTable 4 : Leveraging user embeddings to predict\nthe bias of the media cited by troll users.\n6.3 Reverse Classi\ufb01cation: Media from Trolls\nTable 4shows an experiment in distant supervi-\nsion for reverse classi\ufb01cation, where we trained a\nmodel on the IRA dataset with the troll labels, and\nthen we applied that model to the representation\nof the media in the MBFC dataset, where each\nmedium is represented as the average of the em-\nbeddings of the users who cited that medium. We\ncan see that we could improve over the baseline by\n20 points absolute in terms of accuracy and by 41\nin terms absolute in terms of macro-averaged F1.\nWe can see in Table 4that the relative ordering\nin terms or performance for the different models is\nconsistent with that for the experiments in the pre-\nvious section. This suggests that the relationship\nbetween trolls and media goes both ways, and thus\nwe can use labels for media as a way to label users,\nand we can also use labels for troll users as a way\nto label media.\n7 Conclusion and Future Work\nWe have proposed a novel approach to analyze the\nbehavior patterns of political trolls according to\ntheir political leaning ( leftvs.news feed vs.right )\nusing features from social media, i.e., from Twit-\nter. We experimented with two scenarios: ( i) su-\npervised learning, where labels for trolls are pro-\nvided, and ( ii) distant supervision, where such la-\nbels are not available, and we rely on more com-\nmon labels for news outlets cited by the trolls.\nTechnically, we leveraged the community struc-\nture and the text of the messages in the online so-\ncial network of trolls represented as a graph, from\nwhich we extracted several types of representa-\ntions, i.e., embeddings, for the trolls. Our exper-\niments on the \u201cIRA Russian Troll\u201d dataset have\nshown improvements over the state-of-the-art in\nthe supervised scenario, while providing a com-\npelling case for the distant-supervision scenario,\nwhich has not been explored before.3\nIn future work, we plan to apply our methodol-\nogy to other political events such as Brexit as well\nas to other election campaigns around the world,\nin connection to which large-scale troll campaigns\nhave been revealed. We further plan experiments\nwith other graph embedding methods, and with\nother social media. Finally, the relationship be-\ntween media bias and troll\u2019s political role that we\nhave highlighted in this paper is extremely inter-\nesting. We have shown how to use it to go from\nthe media-space to the user-space and vice-versa,\nbut so far we have just scratched the surface in\nterms of understanding of the process that gener-\nated these data and its possible applications.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research is part of the Tanbih project,4which\naims to limit the effect of \u201cfake news\u201d, propaganda\nand media bias by making users aware of what\nthey are reading.
