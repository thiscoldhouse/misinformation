For the conceptualization of polarization, both the increasing extremity\nof ideological views as well as the structure of the interactions between individuals matter\n(Baldassarri & Page, 2021). When people only associate with others whose views they share,\nhomogeneous and polarized communities emerge (Baldassarri & Page, 2021). Depending on\nwhatdrivesthesein-groupversusout-groupdynamics,theliteraturedistinguishesbetweentwo\ntypesofpolarization(Wilsonetal.,2020). Ideologicalpolarizationreferstoopposingideological\nviewsamongpartisans;anda\ufb00ectivepolarizationisconcernedwiththea\ufb00ectiveattitudetowards\nothers(Wilsonetal.,2020).\nIn this paper, I use the conceptualization outlined above to identify appropriate measures of\nideological and a\ufb00ective polarization in social media networks. Moreover, I show that these\nmeasuresoutperformotherpopularapproachestoquantifyingpolarization.

The literature conceptualizes ideological polarization\nasfollows: ontheonehand,itisunderstoodastheplacementofindividualsonanideological,\ne.g., liberal\u2013conservative scale, or a partisan scale involving parties on the political spectrum\n(Abramowitz&Saunders,2008;Fiorina&Abrams,2008). Whenpartisansmovetowardsthe\nopposingendsofthosescales,ideologicalpolarizationincreases(Abramowitz&Saunders,2008).\nOntheotherhand,ideologicalpolarizationcanrefertoincreasingdi\ufb00erencesinpolicystances\n(Fiorina&Abrams,2008). Theopinionsthatpeopleholdregardingpoliticalandsocialissues,\nsuch as immigration or labor market policies, indicate to what extent society is ideologically\npolarized. Bothpartisanidentityandpolicystancesarerelated,butitisimportanttopointout\nthatthetermideologicalpolarizationcanrefertoeither,orboth,oftheseprocesses(Kubin&\nvonSikorski,2021).\nA\ufb00ectivepolarizationdescribesthea\ufb00ectiveattitudetowardslike-mindedanddisagreeingothers\nanditisthusconcernedwithin-groupversusout-groupdynamics(Druckman&Levendusky,\n1Notethatafurtherdistinctionissometimesmadebetweenthepolarizationofpoliticalelites(elitepolarization),\norsocietyatlarge(masspolarization)(Carothers&O\u2019Donohue,2019).

Theconceptreferstoeitherin-groupfavoritism,out-grouphostility,orbotha\ufb00ective\nreactionstakingplacesimultaneously(Iyengaretal.,2012). Whilethereiswidespreadconsensus\nthata\ufb00ectivepolarizationhasincreasedoverthelastdecades(Iyengaretal.,2019;Mason,2016),\nit is disputed whether in-group favoritism or out-group hostility is the main driver of this\ndevelopment. Forinstance,Iyengaretal.(2012)arguethatin-partya\ufb00ectionhasonlyslightly\nchanged in the United States since the 1980s while out-party dislike has increased steeply.\nConversely,Parketal.(2021)concludethata\ufb00ectivepolarizationismainlydrivenbyin-group\nfavoritismratherthanout-grouphostility.\nRecently,therelationbetweenideologicalanda\ufb00ectivepolarizationhasattractedscholarlyatten-\ntionandseveralcompetingexplanationshaveemerged. First,partisanidentityissaidtoreinforce\na\ufb00ectivepolarization(Dias&Lelkes,2022). Whentheidenti\ufb01cationwithapoliticalpartybecomes\nfundamentaltotheperceptionofoneselfandothers,thiscanfuelhostilitydirectedtowardspolit-\nicaladversaries(Dias&Lelkes,2022). Second,starkideologicaldisagreementsmightstrengthen\nanimositytowardsotherpartiesandtheirvoters(Lelkes,2021;Orr&Huber,2020;Webster&\nAbramowitz,2017). Accordingtotheseexplanations,ideologicalpolarizationreinforcesa\ufb00ective\npolarization. However, other studies argue that it is in fact a\ufb00ective polarization that drives\nideologicalpolarization. Druckmanetal.(2021a,2021b)forinstanceshowthatpre-pandemic\nout-partyhostilityshapesthesubsequentpandemic-relatedbeliefsandpracticesthatindividuals\ndevelop. Toconclude,thedirectionoftherelationbetweenideologicalpolarizationanda\ufb00ective\npolarizationisdisputedandseveralexplanationsincludingmutualreinforcementbetweenthe\ntwotypesofpolarizationarepossible(Baldassarri&Page,2021).\n2.1 Traditional Measures of Political Polarization\nTraditionally,surveyssuchastheAmericanNationalElectionSurveyareusedtomeasurethe\ntwo types of polarization (Iyengar et al., 2019). To quantify ideological polarization, survey\nrespondentsareaskedtoindicatehowliberalorconservativetheyare,whichpartytheyusually\nvotefor,orwhatopiniontheyholdregardingdi\ufb00erentpoliticalissues(Kubin&vonSikorski,\n2021). Whenthoseideologicalleaningsdivergestrongly,ideologicalpolarizationishigh.\n3\nAsurvey-basedmeasureofa\ufb00ectivepolarizationnotonlyincludestheideologicalleaningsofthe\nsurveyrespondents,butalsohowtheyfeeltowardsothersholdingsimilaroropposingviews\n(Iyengar et al., 2012). For instance, participants are asked to rate how they feel towards the\nout-groupona\u2018feelingthermometer\u2019thatrangesfrom0(verycold)to100(verywarm)(Iyengar\netal.,2012). Otherapproachesinclude\u2018socialdistance\u2019measuresthataskrespondentstoindicate\nwhethertheywouldwanttohaveacolleague,neighbor,befriendswith,ormarrysomeonewith\nanopposingideologicalleaning(Druckman&Levendusky,2019). Furthermore,respondents\nmightindicatehowmuchtheytrusttheirin-groupversusout-groupandwhichstereotypesor\ntraits, such as intelligence, independence, sel\ufb01shness, or ignorance, they associate with them\n(Druckman&Levendusky,2019). A\ufb00ectivepolarizationisconsideredtobehighwhenthereisa\ncleardi\ufb00erencebetweenthein-groupversusout-groupfeelingsreportedbytheparticipants.\nAlthoughsurveyshavebeenpredominantlyusedtomeasurepoliticalpolarization,itisimportant\nto note that these approaches are subject to several shortcomings (Iyengar et al., 2019). For\nexample,theexternalvalidityofsurveysislowandthesurveyresponsesmightdi\ufb00erfromthe\nrespondents\u2019real-worldbehaviorwheninteractingwiththeirin-groupversusout-group(Iyengar\netal.,2019;Lelkes,2021). Moreover,surveyinstrumentsarereactiveandtheresultsmightthus\nbein\ufb02uencedbytheframingofthequestionnaireitems(Iyengaretal.,2019). Asrecentresearch\nshows,thisisespeciallyproblematicforthequanti\ufb01cationofa\ufb00ectivepolarization(Druckman&\nLevendusky,2019). Surveyparticipantsconsistentlyoverestimatesocialidentitiesandcleavages\nalongpartylinesbothwithregardstotheirin-group(Vandeweerdt,2021)andtheirout-group\n(Ahler&Sood,2018).

In\nanotherexample,respondentsestimatethat38.2%ofRepublicansearnedover$250,000peryear,\nwhereastherealfractionis2.2.%.\n2.2 Political Polarization on Social Media\nThe \ufb01ndings outlined above emphasize that survey-based measures need to be interpreted\ncautiouslyandthatmoreinformationonactualbehavioramongandtowardspartisansisneeded.\nAsaconsequence,recentresearchhasturnedtobehavioraltracedatacollectedonsocialmedia\n4\nplatforms.

From this line graph, I retrieve a weight matrix Wthat contains the exponentiated\nshortest path distances for each node pair in G\u2032. Moreover, I calculate the means \u00afxand\u00afy\nof the respective vectors and then determine their centred versions; i.e., \u02c6x= (x\u2212\u00afx)and\n\u02c6y= (y\u2212\u00afy). Next,Icalculatethe(network)standarddeviationas \u03c3x,W=pPW\u00d7(\u02c6x\u2297\u02c6x)\nand\u03c3y,W=pPW\u00d7(\u02c6y\u2297\u02c6y).\nThemeasureisde\ufb01nedas:\n\u03c1x,y,G\u2032=PW\u00d7(\u02c6x\u2297\u02c6y)\n\u03c3x,W\u03c3y,W\nwhere \u02c6xand\u02c6yarethecentredvectors, Wistheweightmatrix, \u00d7isanelement-wiseproduct\noperation,and\u2297istheouterproductoperation.\n32\n8.3 Scale Invariance\nI argue that the ideological and a\ufb00ective polarization measures are scale invariant.

Asoutlinedinthe\nmainarticle,thenextstepofthedataanalysisinvolvesestimatingtheideologicalleaningsofthe\nTwitterusers.\n13.1 Alternative Approaches\nOtherstudieshaveproposedvariousapproachestoestimatingideologicalleaningonTwitter.\nI review them here to demonstrate why the approach I choose and describe in the following\nsectionisthemostappropriateinthiscase.\n48\nFirst,itispossibletoestimateideologicalleaningbasedonapieceoftextsincecertainwords\nor discursive techniques can be indicative of the ideological leaning of the speaker (Slapin &\nProksch,2008). Althoughthisisanestablishedapproach,thedictionarywhichthismethodis\nbasedondatesbackto2008anditworksbestforinferringideologyfromlongertextsinsteadof\nshortTwittermessages. Moreover,allusersrelyonasimilarvocabularytodiscusstheCovid-\n19restrictionsanditisthereforenotpossibletomeaningfullydetectideologybasedonword\nusage.\nSecond,priorstudieshaveusedURLsharingbehaviorasanindicatorofideology. Forinstance,\nCinellietal.(2021)determinewhichnewsoutletsusersonsocialmedialinktointheirpostsand\ntheyusethebiasscoresprovidedbymediabiasfactcheck.com(MBFC)toestimatetheideological\nuserleaning. However,itisquestionablewhetherthisapproachcapturesthetrueideological\nleaningofuserswell. Forinstance,Lazeretal.(2020)analyzetheCovid-19tweetsofregistered\nvotersintheUnitedStatesandtheyspeci\ufb01callyinvestigatethemostsharedURLsbyDemocrat\nandRepublicanvoters. Their\ufb01ndingssuggestthatRepublicanTwitterusersalsoshareliberal\nsourcessuchascnbc.comorcnn.comandthatDemocratsalsolinktoconservativenewsoutlets\nsuch as nypost.com or foxnews.com. It follows that URL sharing behavior is not a reliable\nindicatorofideologicalleaning.\nAthirdapproachtoestimatingTwitteruserideologyreliesonaBayesianidealpointestimation\nintroducedinBarber\u00e1(2015)andBarber\u00e1etal.(2015). Inthisestimationmethod,alistofelite\nTwitteraccountscomprisingpoliticians,mediaoutlets,pundits,andexpertsisidenti\ufb01ed.

Oncethescoresfortheeliteaccountsaredetermined,thismethodestimatesscores\nforotherTwitterusersbyconsideringhowmanyleft-leaningandright-leaningaccountsthey\nfollow.\nImportantly,theelitescoresusedinBarber\u00e1(2015)andBarber\u00e1etal.(2015)datebackto2015\nandthey thusdo notcapturethe currentpolitical andmedia landscapeany longer.

For my research,  I created an archive of journalistic articles using the \nonline web tool Media Cloud. I then analysed these articles  and their comment sections, if \npresent,  to determine how they were framing climate change. The framing I foun d was \noverwhelmingly political , and also had a  large focus on local stories. Articles about climate \nchange also tended to occur in greater numbers corresponding with the dates of climate change \nconferences and elections. Comment  sections tended to be most numerous on articles about \ninternational politics and articles containing  more  polarizing political content. Together, I argue \nthat this is a result of  journalists\u2019  desire to connect with a local audience, the drive of online web \nalgorithms influencing how people interact with content, and the  lack of resources available to \nnews med ia companies to moderate comment sections.  \nKeywords: climate change,  news media,  archive, Quebec, journalism , anthropology of media   \niv \n \nTable of Contents  \nAcknowledgements  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ... ii \nAbstract  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................  iii \nTable of Contents  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .........  iv \nArchiving Climate Change: How Quebecois News Media Report Changements Climatiques  ....................  1 \nIntroduction  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...............  1 \nTheory and Background  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................  2 \nCanadian Journalism and the Archive  ................................ ................................ ................................ .. 2 \nThe Shift to Digital Journalism  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............  5 \nEnvironmental Reporting in News Media  ................................ ................................ .............................  9 \nMethods and Design  ................................ ................................ ................................ ...............................  14 \nFindings  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ..................  18 \nDiscussion and Analysis  ................................ ................................ ................................ .........................  29 \nArticles  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................  29 \nComments and the Comment Sections of Climate Change Articles  ................................ ....................  34 \nConclusion  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ..............  38 \nReferences  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...............  40 \n \n \n \n \nArchiving Climate Change: How Quebecois News Media Report Changements Climatiques  \nIntroduction  \nClimate change first became real to me when I took a high school class in environmental \nscience. I ended up in the class by accident , due to  a hasty move across the continent, \nmismatched high school graduation requirements, and limited class space . To my surprise, it \nsoon became one of my favourite classes.  It was one of the first times where what I was learning \nwas specifically  related to current events and looked at ways to explain and think of  solutions to \nongoing problems. This new perspective, combined with the enthusiasm and passion of my \nteacher, fuele d my curiosity for environmental science.  \nWater quality and snow melt experiments, essays on technology and ecology, and an art \nproject made entirely out of recycled objects were  some of  my first exploration s into what \nclimate change was. When I graduated  high school, I found myself going further, minoring in \nenvironmental studies, which brought new perspectives through different classes: biology, \ngeography, politics. With the new program came new friends , and whenever someone would \nshare a headline of a politician declaring that climate change was fake or that humans had no \nimpact on the environment in our group chat, we would each pile on and proclaim how ignorant \nand na\u00efve they sounded. This became increa singly  common with Donald Trump\u2019s election  as \npresident of the United States and the  torrent of  headlines surrounding his disastrous climate \nchange decisions.  \nI found myself wondering  what kind of discourse s about climate change  I could  find in \nQuebec , where I moved in 2016.  The Canadian province  had always had  an image in my mind of \nbeing more progressive and socially minded about environmental matters  than the United States , \nand even other parts of Canada. How would  Quebecois news media report on  climate  change? A  \n2 \n \nprovince that is so proud of its hydropower ; that implemented a carbon tax before the rest of \nCanada ; that seems to be  constantly  in an argument with Alberta about the effects of  oil \nproduction . These musings  set me forth on my path to discover how climate change Quebec\u2019s \nonline news media  was portraying climate change , which I present in the research paper that \nfollows . \nI start  with the history of Canadian journalism and how it became a distinct entity. From \nthere , I explore  how the shift to digital news media impacted reporting  and article content , then \nhow climate change and the environment are reported on  in Canad a as a whole . Having laid out \nthis background , I move on to de scribe  my methods and  the design of the research project . These \nare followed by the findings , which are subsequently discussed and analysed to develop a more \nnuanced understand ing of  what they mean for how climate chang e is reported on in Quebec.  \n \nTheory and Background  \nCanadian Journalism and the Archive  \n The history of Canadian journalism is tied to the founding of CBC Radio -Canada . \nEstablished in the late 1920s as a royal commission in response to \u201ca keen desire for cultivation \nof national unity a nd national identity, especially in relation to the threat of Americanization\u201d \n(McLeod & Camlot, 2019 , p. 41 ). Before the 1920s, radio had been  broadcast in Canada for \nofficial news and used privately . CBC Radio -Canada , however, was founded with the intention  \nto be  central to Canadian democracy and nation -building as well as a method  to cultivate the \ntastes of Canadians. Both the government and the public consider CB C Radio -Canada\u2019s \nbroadcasts to be  high cultu re and worth preserving . They are  also credited with  paving the way \nfor Canadian print culture  by encourag ing Canadian writers to create texts for a Canadian \n3 \n \naudience  (McLeod & Camlot, 2019) . The name CBC Radio -Canada  now r efers to a multimedia \nentity,  with CBC in charge of anglophone content production , and Radio -Canada in charge of \nfrancophone content production (What Is the Difference between CBC, Radio -Canada and \nCBC/Radio -Canada? , n.d.) . Together CBC Radio -Canada has played and  continue s to play a \nleading role  in the evolution of Canadian cultural production . \nIn keeping with this legacy, CBC Radio -Canada  preserves an archive of what it has \ndetermined are  \u201cmajor Canadian historical events, dates, and literary and political \ufb01gures, which \nit then presents to the general public as a popular online resource\u201d (McLeod & Camlot, 2019, p. \n37). Ironically , the process used to create th is archive of news media was lost, as no emphasis \nwas placed on  documenting such decisions and how they would influence the archi ve. \nNonetheless,  when an archive is collected, it is done so \u201cin relation to the audience for whom the \narchive seemingly performs\u201d (McLeod & Camlot, 2019, p. 35) . This means that there are \ninterp retive possibilities in both the shape the archive takes and in its contents.  \nAn archive , as the dictionary tells us,  is a collection of information that often contains \nrecords around a central theme (Merriam -Webster, n.d.) . In another register, this can be taken up \nas a collection of  speech act s, and we  must look at the different levels of th ose speech act s both \nindependently and within  their context (Austin, 1975) . We explore not only what the texts  in an \narchive  intend to mean, but what action they perform by existing. This insight into meaning , that \nits manifestation as  text performs  an action in the world , can shed light on the way an archive \ncan be the foundation of  something as large and nebulous as  a national Canadian identity  or \nclimate change (Tully, 1988) .  \nCBC Radio -Canada \u2019s climate change journalism archive does not only  tell us about  the \ninformation within the articles themselves . What is present and what is absent  (assessed by way \n4 \n \nof other archives)  also tells u s about those who created the material and the archive itself . We get \nat this by examining  what a text is doing in relation to other texts and ideologies . This \nexamination is  combined with the ideas presented within the text  itself , to shed light on what can \nbe learned about \u201csocial innovation and legitimation\u201d through the study of the \u201cwords we use to \nconstruct and appraise the social world\u201d (Tully, 1988, p. 119) . Furthermor e, the CBC  archive  \nreveal s relations of power through what i t contains , in each item \u2019s content, and the fact of a \nsuccessful negotiation for its inclusion . They are simultaneously a record of the news events \nrecorded within the articles, and a \u201cregister of  the struggles for and about cultural identity and \nsignificance\u201d (McLeod & Camlot, 2019, p. 48) .  \nWe can also understand an article  as an answer  to a question. In the presence of a \nquestion \u2014perhaps  overtly , in a mission statement  or original programmatic call , or implicitly, as \nidentified through interpretive recovery \u2014each item and the archived ensemble gain another \nlayer of meaning . The CBC Radio -Canada archive\u2019 s historical context thus sheds light on its \nexistence from another perspective : by creat ing a better understanding of how a topic gain ed \npopularity  and its framing , which is also to say, how it was an answer to a meaningful question . \nUnderstanding historical context extends to the materiality of an archive as well . As I explore in \nthe next section, a n archive of online news media will tell a different story than print news \nmedia, not least because the methods for collecting the article s differ (Stoler, 2009) . \n In sum, archive s offer insight into how people have defined this thing called climate \nchange and related events over a specific period of time, how they have interpreted what \nhappened, and what it means to them (Stoler, 2009) . My intention is to bring these insights to \nbear on the contemporary, to do an anthropology of the actual (near future and recent past) \n(Rabinow, 2003, p. 55) , by reading articles contained in the archive of Canadian journalism on \n5 \n \nclimate change over a specific, recent period  of time and tied to a place: Quebec from 2015 -\n2020. This case can shed light on \u201cwhat we know and how we know it\u201d (Stoler, 2009, p. 45) .  \n \nThe Shift to Digital  Journalism  \nWhile CBC Radio -Canada\u2019s history spans the rise of digital media, my inquiry centers on \nits recent digital archive of climate change journalism . There are aspects of digitalization and the \nrise of the platform internet that are pertinent to this archive as well as my study of it (Plantin et \nal. 2018) . The way that news media portray s the construction of a topic helps people understand \nthe world, and they \u201chave traditionally played an important role in the uptake of scientific \nresearch by the public\u201d (Bray, 2018, p. 156) . If, as argued above, CBC -Radio Canada\u2019s archives \nwere responsible for shaping and influencing, as well as revealing, \u201cmanifestations and \ninterpretations of national identity\u201d (McLeod & Camlot, 2019, p. 47 ; D. Scott, 2004) , a similar \nprocess can occur  with major scientific topics.  \nBray (2018)  usefully divides the developmen t of a scien ce story in the era of digital \njournalism into three phases , each dominated by a different type of article . The first phase is the \nfirst 48 hours after the event happens . In this phase, articles are most likely to be news reports \nwith a foregrounding approach . They are characterized by how they give an overview of the \nevents or research and by how they are often reliant on being first in the field to break the news. \nThe s econd phase takes place from 48 hours after the event up to the beginning of the second \nmonth after the event. During the second phase, articles that use the information from events or \nresearch  as background  to support arguments and claims  are more common . Finally, the third \nphase takes place from the end of the second phase and lasts until a year after the original event. \n6 \n \nThis phase is characterized by articles that are more  opinionated and tangentially related to the \noriginal event, such as  editorial s (Bray, 2018) .  \nBray develops this analysis by  tracing reporting on a research article over the course of a \nyear. What is more, she places it in the conte xt of a decreasing  number of dedicated science \neditors and journalists, causing fact checking  to become  more difficult. Once journalists\u2019 \ncoverage  gets to the phase of discussing actions required to solve a problem, political experts are \nconsulted more tha n scientific experts. Even when scientific experts are consulted, this can be \nmisleading: \u201c[their] claims are often presented as more certain\u201d and applied to different contexts \nthan they were originally intended to explain (Bray, 2018, p. 160) . \nCompetition from news blogging has also made a substantial impact  on the way that \nnews media report  (Cody 2015) . It is now easier to be a  popular  news source with a small \nbudget, as individuals  or small groups  can start blogs, websites, or social media accounts where \nthey cover current events and give their thoughts on what is happening  to an audience . As a \nresult, institutionally vetted news sourc es and academic expertise  can be displaced by a flood of \nother sources of var ying quality. This type of mass media is often published on the assumption \nthat people are circulating an article and acting on it without even reading the article. It relies on \na performance of displays of passionate participation and enables those circulating the \ninformation to maintain power through a process of mediation  (Cody 2015) .  \nI use \u201cm ediation \u201d here in the sense defined by Cody (2015),  as a two -way process in \nwhich the represented subject depends on the representative for the constitution of its identity.  \nDecisions about m ediation give form to  that which is mediated . A decision that  cater s to the  \nlocation of the audience  or reflects the identity  and ideology  of the journalist  is not external to, \nbut rather , co-constitute s what an article is and does . Accordingly , an event  is changed and made \n7 \n \nanew  by its mediation  into a text  of any sort, including a digital text. The affordances of the \ndigital are integral to the mediation of events that happens in digital journalism. As I elaborate \nbelow, f ormatt ing and fasten ing, meaning both \u201ctied to \u201d and \u201caccelerated \u201d (Koopman 2019) , \nalong with the  behaviour of social media and search engine a lgorithms , all contribute to  \npassionate participation with online information .  \nSince  internet  platforms such as Google or Facebook use advertisements as revenue, to \ngenerate more revenue  and increase profits , the algorithms  on these platforms  prioritize content \nthat speedily draws  the most  views . One of the most effective ways of drawing  views and  \nencouraging engagement is to provoke feelings of anger and strong negative emotions  \n(Bartholomew, 2018) . As a result,  these algorithms have come to be overwhelmingly driven  by \npromoting content that stimulates outrage and polarization, while also stressing the importance \nof an individual\u2019s reputation on the platform. This emphasis means  users on the platforms are \nmore likely to see and  share content that creates outrage and divisiveness . Other users then  rush \nto contrib ute their take on the story and spread it to as many of their followers as they can . They \nare driven to keep engag ing by the possibility of boost ing their own popularity and tak ing \nadvantage of ratings, which in some cases increases the amount of money a user makes (Bray, \n2018; Cody & Paz, 2021) , and continues to  make m ore money  for the hos t platform via \nadvertising . \nNews about climate change is thus often written to resonate strongly with readers , \nanother outcome of which is that  an event that is impersonal and distant can be made to seem \nlike something with emotional  value to a particular individual (Mazzarella, 2017) . A strong \ncollective emotional resonance that emerges  from interacting with a piece  of media  creates affect  \n(Bialecki, 2019) . Journalists work to  produce this kind of  affect in their audiences through their  \n8 \n \nuse of images and texts as a way to increase engagement  with their audiences . To avoid being \nignored  in the flood of information , journalists add more opinionated language to the articles and \nsensationalize events to boost their work on social  media  to help the reader identify with it, in \nturn genera ting more views. This type of mediation can intensify affect, shaping an event using \nan emotional and sentimental style, and thereby giving it new meaning for its audience (Bialecki, \n2019) . When journalists use affect this way, they generate shared sentiment and unite people \nthrough online mass media.  \nAs Bray explains, m ore blog -like articles , such as  editorials , open themselves up to more \ncommentary  from th eir audiences  and have an increased likelihood of generating gossip and  \nspeculation  (2018) . The greater number of sources putting out information also  gives readers \nmore room to agree  or disagree  with the information they consume . This can contribute to a \npositive feedback loop , where more polarizing content shows up more frequently, as it is driven \nby algorithm s and begins to drive them  in turn  (Bray, 2018; Cody & Paz, 2021; Mazzarella, \n2019) . \nFurthermore,  as Cody and Paz  found  (2021) , as a topic becomes more polarized, those \nreading and interacting with articles are more likely to be other individuals who agree  with them, \nas they have already shown they will engage with  the content  through actions such as \nparticipating in comment sections or sharing the content on social media . Even those who \ndisagree with the content  may share it , if only out of disgust, spreading its framework and  its \nreach.  Because  of the algorithms and user engagement, this has the potential to create an echo \nchamber, where audiences  are interacting with the same content and forming shared experiences \nbased on their digi tal location  (Bray, 2018; Cody & Paz, 2021; Mazzarella, 2019) .  \n9 \n \nIf mediation is intentionally manipulated and generate s strong polarization , mass media \nhas the potential to become a centralized ideological narrative on which  a populist movement can \ncenter (Mazzarella, 2019) . Groups frequenting polarized echo chambers  have a greater  \npossibility of morphing in to a populist mobilization  (Bray, 2018; Cody & Paz, 2021; Mazzarella, \n2019) . Sharing specific ideological narratives through mass media online can be taken advantage \nof and manipulated by those with power over the algorithm or even simply an advanced \nknowledge of how it works , in order to direct a growing populist movement.  (Bray, 2018; Cody \n& Paz, 2021) .  \nThis kind of polarization and circulation of mis - and disinformation has contributed to \ncomment sections on websites becoming increasingly toxic and requiring more rigorous \nmoderation by website owners. Employing a moderation team can be both mentally and \nfinancially draining for news media companies, and as a result, due to a lack of resources, more \nand more news sites have been choosing not to have comment sections (Radio Active , 2016) . As \na larger company, CBC Radio -Canada is one of the few Canadian news sites that still offers \ncommenting on articles, but due to budget cuts over the last two decades and the toxicity of \ncomments around certain topics, comment sections on CBC Radio -Canada articles are not \nalways available (McLeod & Camlot, 2019) . \n \nEnvironmental Reporting in News Media  \nClimate change is a topic that is politically polarized and thus prone to generating \noutrage. It is at a high risk of manipulation to generate shares and engagement on social media \nplatforms. This also means content related to climate change is more likely to be misframed to \nfurther populist agendas because of the passionate interactions it can generate online. Here I use \n10 \n \nRoosvall and Tegelberg\u2019s definition of misframing as \u201ca form of misrepresentation that occurs \nwhen some members of a constituency are deni ed access to just representation due to their \ngeographical location in relation to the structure of a political arena\u201d (2015, p. 41) ; indigenous \npopulations are one such constituency. Since moving from a global scale to a local scale always \nrequires mediation by framing, framing can easily become misframing when referring to a global \ntopic such as cli mate change (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) . \nThe e nvironmental justice movement originate d in the 19 70s among ra cialized and \nmarginalized communities in the United States who are the most impacted  by pollution and \nclimate change . As the movement grew in popularity, however, r eporting on environmental \njustice and climate change took up a mainstream scient ific framing that separated natur e from \nhumanity.  This version of \u201cnormal science\u201d  (Latour & Woolgar, 1986) also situated nature as a \nresource from which capital and wealth  could be extracted . This can be seen today in the way the \nnews media often fram es climate change in terms  of lifestyles  and traditions in wealthy nations , \nfocusing on \u201cair, water, wages, housing, education, health, equity, and justice\u201d (Roosvall & \nTegelberg, 2015 , p. 43 ).  \nWhen it comes to news media, the need to understand framing is important because \narticles come from specific ideological standpoints and produce future ideologies. When \nreporting on climate change, news media choose which speakers to focus on, based on the stories \nthey want to tell, and speakers are given voices based on the ideologies that the authors want the \narticle to convey. From here, implications o f the articles result from views of the already \nestablished status quo and contribute to reaffirming or challenging it. The ideolog ies of both the \nmedia and the audience are involved in creating different interpretations of the information in the \narticle (Carvalho, 2007) .  \n11 \n \nTo understand how this has impacted the way Canadians, and specifically Quebecois, \nview climate change,  the archive of news media that has reported on climate change must be \nexamined critically. News media articles reporting on climate change do not question the \nconstruct of climate change that they employ; they rely on its embedded assumptions and \nassociat ions. These, in turn, are spread each time the construct is used . Examining what the \narticles say about climate change can shed light, not just on what events or which facts count as \nclimate change in these places, but also on how the writing climate chang e is conceptualized in \nthe writing. This is how climate change arrives to  individuals consuming the news media.  \nThe examination  of climate reporting  can also lead to insight into \u201cthe tension between \ndifferent extensions of space and how these relate to p eople\u201d (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015 p. \n44). To make an impact, an article must resonate with its audience . As a result, the way climate \nchange is framed in Canada may differ from the way it is reported on in another country, or even \nwithin Canada across dif ferent provinces and communities (Ellen Good, 2008).  \nA study by Konieczna et al. (2014) found that Canadian journalism  has a smaller \naudience and less impact  globally  than American journalism . Canad ian journalists also rely on  \nCanadian voices. As a result, Konieczna et al. explain  that news media coverage of climate \nchange in Canada deploys a  national  focus on the \u201cglobal problem\u201d (2014 , p. 503 ). They found \nthat Canadian sources reporting on  the Copenhagen summit were more likely than American \nsources to use a local framing than a global framing and did not make as many references to \nglobal causes and effects.   \n However, because of Canada\u2019s political ecosystem and the presence of CBC Radio -\nCanada as a public broadcaster that is \u201cless dependent on advertisers and audiences\u201d, CBC \nRadio -Canada  has the privilege of being able to focus  less on luring  audiences and advertisers \n12 \n \n(Konieczna et al., 2014 , p. 493 ). And in fact, Konieczna et al. found that the  number of articles \ncovering climate chang e in Canada was much larger than in the United States, due largely to \nCBC  Radio -Canada , \u201cwhich aired more than twice as many climate change stories as did any \nother channel\u201d (2014 , p. 503 ). This was especially true during the 2008 Canadian federal election \nwhen the importance of cl imate change as a political issue grew significantly (Konieczna et al., \n2014) . \nEllen Good  also found that Canadian news media reported on climate change  with greater \nfrequency  than news media in the United States and  than in other  international papers. She \nadditionally notes that s cience is the most popular frame for  reporting on  climate change in \nCanada , with g reenhouse gasses as a fairly popular framing device . These, she observes, are \nascribe d the blame for climate  change rather than  direct human causes (Ellen Good, 2008) . Both \nstudies (Ellen Good, 2008; Konieczna et al., 2014)  showed tha t the more a  topic is covered by \nthe media, the larger awareness is about it in the public agenda, and the more its audience \nconsider s it important , meaning that climate change is a prominent issue in Canada .  \nWe can also see t he importance of understanding  framing when it limits  a news source\u2019s \nability to communicate the seriousness of a situation. This is apparent  with articles when climate \nchange is framed as a threat, such as portraying it as the cause of natural disasters, which were \nfound to not be as frequently written as those with a more positive outlook (Ellen Good, 2008) . \nFraming  can be p roblematic  when used in this way,  because it can cause the audience to \nmisunderstand what is happening with climate change in Canada (Konieczna et al., 2014) .  \nAs discussed above, f ailure to question this type of framin g is dangerous because a n \narticle \u201creproduces rather than contests given ideological systems\u201d or social conventions  around \nclimate change  (J. W. Scott, 1991, p. 778) . An article presents experiences that are necessarily \n13 \n \nlocated. Further, w hat cou nts as an experience is \u201cneither self -evident nor straightforward\u201d ; it is \n\u201calways contested, and always therefore political\u201d (J. W. Scott, 1991, p. 797) . To challenge the \nnorm and invite change, an author would need to call into question the portrayal of climate \nchange in the language of their own text, and question how that portrayal came into existence. \nEven w hen done, this will not ultimately guarantee neutrality, but it will give insight into the \ncreation of that subject over time (J. W. Scott, 199 1).   \nKonieczna et al. also point ed out the impact of leaving out  this kind of questioning  when \nlooking at the overwhelming ly local focus of Canadian articles on climate change. When it \ncomes to a global issue like climate change, it can be difficult to convey the complexity of the \nissue without filtering it through a domestic lens, framed by local history and politics. Using a \nglobal framing of climate change allows journalists to shape the image of climate change more \nethically , focusing on the wellbeing of a \u201cglobal humanity\u201d (Konieczna et al., 2014 , p. 504 ) and \nemphasizing \u201cglobal values\u201d and \u201cglobal citizenship\u201d (p. 492 ). A more local focus is more \nspecific to a certain community at a specific time, which they explain happens \u201cbecause of a lack \nof connection to a global community\u201d, and at the same time can reinforce isolation from the \nglobal community (Konieczna et al., 2014, p. 492 ). For example, nation -states domi nate media \nrepresentations of climate change, especially reporting on climate conferences. Groups that are \nnot nation -states are left out, such as Indigenous peoples.  \nAs previously mentioned, j ust like with framing, Roosvall and Tegelberg explain how \nmisfr aming can also shape identity and tie articles to specific geography.  Climate change a rticles \nabout specific provinces and countries are about those areas at the expense of other areas ; this \nseparation of climate change into separate individual  events and areas is an example of the \nfailure of news media reporting on the scale of climate change . Understanding misframing  of \n14 \n \nevents such as climate conferences  \u201callows researchers to determine whether climate related \nissues are connected to relevant scales in media reporting\u201d and better understand how local \nunderstandings of climate change shape politics (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015 , p. 50 ). When it \ncomes to digital news media, this is especially important because of how accessible and \ninfluential  reporting on climate conferences is (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) . \nOne way this plays out in Canad a is that Canadian  media often portrays a \u201cwestern \u201d \nperspective of climate change, while news media often misunderstands, misrepresents, or \noutright excludes the perspectives of different Indigenous  groups  in coverage . Roosvall and \nTegeleberg note that their research \u201c indicates that indigenous peoples are \u2018used\u2019 in media \nreporting to highlight  the urgency of climate change, while their political perspectives are largely \nignored\u201d (Roosvall &  Tegelberg, 2015 , p. 44 ). They found that independent and alternative news \nmedia was more likely to include  Indigenous  perspectives  on climate change. When it c ame to \nlarger mainstream media, there was more concern about how much attention a story would  \ngenerate, citing an example of the focus on the impacts climate change will have on polar bears \nin Canadian arctic media , and the absence of reporting on the concerns and impacts climate \nchange will have on the indigenous communities living there (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) . \n \nMethods and Design  \nThrough the process of carrying out my research  and working with existing archives,  I \ncreated my own archive by collecting articles about climate change from Quebecois news media \nsources. As I previously discussed, the methods that I used to create my archive can inform what \nthe archive can tell me . In the same vein, because I created this archive, it will be filtered through \nmy own framing and biases , as well as those of the tools that I used to help me create the archive. \n15 \n \nI have documented the process here to shed light on how I arri ved at the archive I have  as well as \nto keep the context of  my archive with the archive itself.   \nI chose to do my research online because we obtain so much  of our news  online through \nsocial media and news sites  today , through various algorithms and search engines. Sp ecifically, I \nlooked at Quebecois online news media because of its eas y accessibility and the influence that \nonline news media has over the actions of groups and individuals. Understanding h ow climate \nchange is reported in Quebec provides anthropological i nsight into the way that this media \nshape s their view of climate change  (Stalcup, 2020) . To find the articles for my research, I used \nthe platform Media Cloud. Media Cloud is an online \u201copen source platform\u201d that allows \nindividuals to \u201c[study] media ecosystems\u201d (About , n.d.) . I chose Media Cloud because it can \ndisplay media stories  and articl es that different online platforms have published , and more \nspecifically allow ed me to filter  the stories and articles to  those that correspond ed with one \nspecific geographical  location : Quebec.  \nTo determine the sources  and articles  I would  includ e, I used the pre -created media \ncollection on Media Cloud titled \u201cQuebec, Canada \u2013 State & Local\u201d  from the Media Cloud \nSource Manager tool.  This media collection  contains  a total of 2 09 sources with stories going \nback to 2010. Media Cloud created the collec tion as one of many geographical collections using \nthe ABYZ News Links index. The  Media Cloud  staff has worked on these collections as well, \nworking to verify that the sources are reporting from or about the areas that they are linked to. \nThey also take su ggestions from their userbase and individuals who are from these locations \n(Approaches to Searching by Place in Media Cloud , n.d.) . \nThe search term I used when exploring this media collection was \u201c changements \nclimatiques ,\u201d or \u201cclimate change \u201d in English. T his was the term that was most commonly used to \n16 \n \ndescribe climate change in French among the media sources in the collection , as well as the term \nused by the government of Canada (Canada, 2017) . I examined sources over a five -year period, \nstarting with Justin Trudeau\u2019s election  as prime minister  during the week of November 4th of \n2015  and ending the same week in November of 2020.  I chose to start on this date because , not \nonly did Trudeau promise to focus more on climate change during the election campaign \n(Narwhal, n.d.) , but a month later the Paris Agreem ent was signed at the 2015 UN Climate \nChange Conference (COP21).  \nI used two tools from Media Cloud to find the  articles  that I looked at. The first tool is \nExplorer, which gives details on how certain keywords or phrases  media is reporting on . It \nallowed me to track attention  over time as well as the percentage and number of articles \npublished on a given day containing specific keywords . It also showed me other statistics , such \nas what other words trended with the keywords I searched (About | Explorer | Media Cloud , \nn.d.).  \nThe second Media Cloud tool I used to find articles was Topic Mapper, which also looks \nat specific key words and phrases, allowing me to collect specific articles  that were related to \nthose that I had viewed with Explorer. It collects the articles via a process of \u201cspidering\u201d which \nfollows links that are in the stories related to my keywords, returning a co llection of related \nstories and how often those stories were linked  or further reported on by other news sources  at \nthe time of the search. Like with Explorer, Topic Mapper also allowed me to see other words that \nwere commonly associated with my keywords. It also gave me an idea of which sources reported \non climate change based on the parameters of my search. This allowed me to g et a better idea of \nthe kinds of climate change articles that were mo st prominent  online  (About | Topic Mapper | \nMedia Cloud , n.d.) . \n17 \n \n When looking at the results from Explorer and Topic Mapper, I chose to view my results \nby week, rather than by day or year.  This allowed me to see spikes in popularity more clearly, \nespeciall y when , after periods of low engagement, a day with two or three stories  would cause a \nspike . Viewing the stories by week also made it more manageable to view trends over a five -year \nperiod, even as the number of stories increased over time.  \nI chose to analyze stories from the weeks with spikes in popularity and selected the top \nten peaks over the entire five -year period. I also selected the top two peaks from each year , \nstarting the week of November 4th, 2015 . This was  to account for the fact that there  was more \nmedia released in later years, skewing the peaks  in favour of later years when viewing the \namount of content published . I did this for three different data sets. The first two data sets were \nfrom Explorer ; one showed the percent age of stories pub lished every week that contained my \nkey phrase \u201c changements climatiques ,\u201d while the other showed me the number of stories \npublished per week containing the phrase. The third data set was from Topic Mapper and showed \nme how many times an article was linked  back to  in each  week.  \n After I had determined which weeks I would be looking at, my next step was to look up \neach week  to determine what events may have been happening at the time that might have \ncontributed to the spike. I examined the Topic Mapper results for each week  that I had collected \nand sorted the data by the  articles that had the most link shares. I chose the to p five articles from \neach week to analyze in more depth. I then looked for the main themes and topics of each article \nincluding the events and places they contained. I also recorded which source had published the \narticle, when  it published  the article,  and whether the source  allowed comments  on its articles . If \nthe source  did allow comments  on an article , I would record whether there were comments \n18 \n \npresent, and, when comments  were present,  I recorded the number of comments and the topics of \ndiscussions in th e comment sections.  \nFindings  \nFirst, I will discuss the  dates of the  weeks when climate change reporting was trending.  \nThe first measure of trends was what percentage of the media on a given week matched my \nsearch terms. When looking at the weeks with the highest  percent age of stories published  related \nto \u201cchangements climatiques ,\u201d the earlier years had higher percentages  which then declined a s \ntime went on.  As a result, the top ten weeks by percent had a higher concentration in the earlier \nyears : all but two of the weeks are from either 2015 or 2016,  and no weeks appeared after 2018.  \nTable 1: Percent of Stories Per Week  on \u201cchangements climatiques\u201d ( cc) \nTop 2  cc Articles for \nEach Year  Percent  of cc Articles \nPublished  Top 10  cc Articles \nOverall  Percent  of cc Articles \nPublished  \n4-Nov-15 6.31% 4-Nov-15 6.31% \n2-Dec-15 13.08 % 18-Nov-15 6.03% \n16-Nov-16 3.34% 2-Dec-15 13.08 % \n14-Dec-16 3.14% 9-Mar-16 5.07% \n19-Sep-18 1.94% 23-Mar-16 3.18% \n17-Oct-18 1.79% 8-Jun-16 2.56% \n12-Dec-18 2.83% 12-Oct-16 2.73% \n10-Apr-19 2.1% 16-Nov-16 3.34% \n4-Dec-19 1.31% 8-Mar-17 2.46% \n12-Feb-20 1.68% 12-Dec-18 2.83% \n \nThe second measure of trends was the total number of stories published  related to \n\u201cchangements climatiques\u201d during a given week. The number of articles related to my search \ngradually went up over the five-year period . The number of weeks  clustered around later years in \nthe top ten weeks for articles published  reflects this as well , as no top weeks  appeared before \n2018 , and all but four of the weeks are from 2019.  \n19 \n \nTable 2: Number of \u201cchangements cl imatiques\u201d (cc) Stories per Week  \nTop 2 cc Articles for \nEach Year  Number  of cc \nArticles  Published  Top 10  cc Articles \nOverall  Number  of cc \nArticles Published  \n2-Dec-15 31 12-Dec-18 403 \n12-Oct-16 24 1-May-19 416 \n17-May-17 137 2-Oct-19 707 \n7-Jun-17 194 16-Oct-19 546 \n19-Sep-18 164 30-Oct-19 545 \n31-Oct-18 254 13-Nov-19 348 \n2-Oct-19 707 4-Dec-19 343 \n16-Oct-19 546 29-Jan-20 331 \n7-Oct-20 382 7-Oct-20 382 \n28-Oct-20 397 28-Oct-20 397 \n \nThe final measure of trends I used was the number of stories related to \u201cchangements \nclimatiques\u201d  that were linked  to, measured  through  the process of  spiderin g. As with  the results \nfor the number of articles published over time, the number of articles that were linked to \nincreased over time. In the top ten, the earliest week was in 2017, and all but three of the weeks \nare from 2019 .  \nTable 3: Numb er of Links per Week  \nTop 2 cc Articles for \nEach Year  Number of Links  to \ncc Articles  Top 10  cc Articles \nOverall  Number of Links  to \ncc Articles  \n18-Nov-15 19 7-Jun-17 124 \n2-Dec-15 38 12-Dec-18 155 \n7-Jun-17 124 1-May-19 172 \n13-Sep-17 81 12-Jun-19 118 \n13-Jun-18 81 10-Jul-19 115 \n19-Sep-18 106 26-Aug-19 123 \n2-Oct-19 316 2-Oct-19 316 \n16-Oct-19 247 16-Oct-19 247 \n13-Nov-19 127 13-Nov-19 127 \n29-Jan-20 109 29-Jan-20 109 \n \n20 \n \nMany of the  weeks  also corresponded with significant environment related events, such \nas international climate change conferences, the release of high -profile climate change reports  or \npolicies , climate change related strikes, natural disasters, and heat records. Other  weeks also \ncorresponded to high profile political events that were not necessarily overtly  related to the \nenvironment or climate change, such as national election campaigns in Canada and the United \nStates and the change of government officials  in both countri es.  \nDespite collecting  a total of  60 weeks , only 32 of those weeks we re unique  because  some  \nwere in the top for multiple categories . Among the  weeks  that appear in the top ten overall and \nthe top two per year, the weeks  that came up in the top the most were:  Dec 2, 2015, Dec 12, \n2018, Oct 2, 2019, and Oct 16, 2019.  Dec 2, 2015 corresponds with the Paris Agreement, Dec \n12, 2018 corresponds with a diffe rent UN climate change conference, and the two weeks  in \nOctober of 2019 both took place after the climate marches and during the campaigning leading \nup to a Canadian federal election.  \n  \n21 \n \nTable 4: Weeks  and Corresponding Events  \nWeek  Occurrences  Events  \n2-Dec-15 4 Paris Agreement  \n12-Dec-18 4 UN climate change conference  \n2-Oct-19 4 Climate marches, Canadian election  \n16-Oct-19 4 Climate marches, Canadian election, new IPCC report  \n7-Jun-17 3 G7 summit, Trump's climate change actions, Environment Day  \n19-Sep-18 3 Quebec elections, G7 meeting  \n13-Nov-19 3 Greta Thunberg  speaks  in Vancouver, new Canadian \ngovernment  \n29-Jan-20 3 Hottest January on record, Australia fires  \n4-Nov-15 2 New Environment Minister, Paris Conference  \n18-Nov-15 2 Paris Conference  \n12-Oct-16 2 International agreement to limit emissions, Paris  Agreement  \nratified  \n16-Nov-16 2 COP22, US election  \n01-May-19 2 UK promise to cut emissions to zero  \n4-Dec-19 2 New Canadian government  \n07-Oct-20 2 Prince William TED talk about climate change  \n28-Oct-20 2 US election  \n9-Mar-16 1 Vancouver Declaration on climate change, new heat record  \n23-Mar-16 1 New h eat record  \n8-Jun-16 1 World Environment Day  \n14-Dec-16 1 US election  \n8-Mar-17 1 UN climate change panel  OHCHR  \n17-May-17 1 UN climate change conference  \n13-Sep-17 1 US leaving Paris Agreement  \n13-Jun-18 1 New IPCC publication  \n17-Oct-18 1 IPCC report, UN climate change meeting  \n31-Oct-18 1 IPCC report, UN climate change meeting  \n10-Apr-19 1 Substantial  rain and ice storms  \n12-Jun-19 1 Environment Day  \n10-Jul-19 1 Hottest July ever recorded  \n26-Aug-19 1 IPCC report released  \n30-Oct-19 1 Upcoming COP25, Chile cancelling hosting  the conference  \n12-Feb-20 1 Fires in Australia  \n \n22 \n \nI recorded a total of 160 articles over the 32 unique weeks .

With the outlier included  the articles about a climate conference \nhad the most comments with 1,008 comments.   \nTable 12: Themes with More than One Article with Comments  \nTheme  Count of Themes  Count of Comments  \npolitics  18 521 \neconomics  7 208 \nlocal impacts  7 59 \nclimate conference s 6 102 (1,008)  \nenergy  6 195 \nresearch  5 112 \nelection  2 115 \ntechnology  2 54 \nagriculture  2 20 \npollution  2 32 \ngreenhouse gasses  2 36 \nTotal  59 1,454 (2,360)  \n \nIn the comment sections, the topic of discussion was often either a debate about politics \nor a debate as to what the most correct or best way to solve climate change problems would be. \nQuestions to the author of the article or other commentors were also common . While there were \nthe occasional comments outright denying climate change, they were not common and other \ncommenters  often responded directly to them with explanations as to why climate change is , in \nfact, real.  \n \n29 \n \nDiscussion  and Analysis  \nArticles  \nOne of the first things I noticed in my findings was that the percent age of articles  \npublished related to \u201c changements climatiques\u201d decreased from 2015 -2020 , while at the same \ntime the number of articles related to \u201cchangements climatiques\u201d  and th e number of times these \narticles were linked to increased from 2015 -2020. The first result, the decrease in percentage of \narticles as time goes on, is supported by Cod y\u2019s (2015)  and Bray\u2019s (2018)  explanation of the \nincrease in mass media online. Their findings for newspapers in southern India and for English -\nlanguage scientific article alt-metrics, respectively, holds for Quebec: the percent age of articles \nreferencing \u201cchangements climatiques\u201d is decreasing, while the overall number of articles \nreferencing \u201cchangements climatiques\u201d increased  in Quebecois news media. Despite the \ndecreasing percentage , the increase in the amount of news media reporting on climate change  \nsignif ies that this decrease in percentage does not necessarily mean that climate change is \ndisappearing from the public sphere in Quebec  (Ellen Good, 2008; Konieczna et al., 2014) . \nSupporting this interpretation, c ontext show s that events i nspired spikes not only in \npublications of stories about \u201c changements climatiques ,\u201d but also in the sharing of content \nrelated to the subject. Most of the events that corresponded with spikes in publication and linking \nto articles have a direct connection  to climate change or the environment , unsurprisingly as I \nselected for those terms . However, there were also spikes that did not have such a direct \nconnection. These were  political events , such as elections and international conferences , which \nhighlights a connection between politics and climate change  in news media. This is also \nsupported by Bray \u2019s (2018)  findings that politicians and po litics are where the digital news \nmedia is turning to when looking for strategies to combat climate change.  As mentioned in \n30 \n \nSkinner\u2019s framework (Tully, 1988)  and Scott\u2019s discussion of it (2004) , placing the articles in the \ncontext of the events happening around when they were written is useful . Understanding what \nwas going on helps understand not just what is in an article, but  how a topic comes into being. \nThus , it is relevant that n ot all the articles I collected which  were  published at the time of major  \nevents discussed th ose events ; they  also mentioned  other news related to climate change.  \n In a few  cases, some articles were linked  to more frequently months or years after they \nhad originally been published. Because these articles were often covering the details of \nnoteworthy events  such as the Paris Agreement or the US announcing withdrawal from the Paris \nAgreement, they served as fore grounding articles in the moment. Later on, they are used by other \narticles to reference the news media coverage of those events as they  happened  (Bray, 2018) .  \nWhe n it comes to the different organizations  writing content about climate change,  over a \nthird  (60) of the articles came from Radio -Canada . La Presse, the second most linked to source , \nhad less than half the number  of articles that Radio -Canada did at 17. La Presse  is one of \nCanada\u2019s largest French language newspapers, as well as an independent, non -profit organization \n(La Presse , n.d.) . Nearly half  (77) of the  160 articles  came from these  two sources , which are \nlargely regarded as reputable news sources in Quebec  with a center -left bias  (ICI Radio -Canada , \n2022; La Presse , 2022) . Radio -Canada\u2019s dominance of the findings is predictable due to its \nability to take advantage of government funding and its reputation as a pillar of Canadian cult ure \n(McLeod & Camlot, 2019) . \nOther  source s that came up  frequently, however, w ere Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al  and its \nsister paper, Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec.  Together they are responsible for  12 articles , making them \nthe third most popular source in the findings . Both founded and owned by Quebecor, the two \npapers are  right -leaning tabloid s with a reputation for sensationalizing content and a mediocre  \n31 \n \nfact-check rating  (Le Journal de Montreal , 2022) . The sensationalized stories allow them to \ncompete with larger and better funded news media companies, such as Radio -Canada, by \nboosting the likelihood that their article s will be promoted by social media and search engine \nalgorithms (Bray, 2018; Cody, 2015) . Together, Radio -Canada, La Presse, and Quebecor  are the \norganizations that are being linked to  online more frequently in Quebecois communities, which \ngives them a greater reach and greater influence over the perception of  climate change  in \nQuebec .  \n When it comes to location s, most of  the articles\u2019  (105) focus is on Canada -related news. \nArticles fo cused on Quebec (46) came up most frequently , followed by Canada at a national \nlevel  (36), and then articles with an international  scope  (31), which demonstrates a more local \nframing by Quebecois news media . This is in line with Ellen Good (2008) \u2019s and Konieczna  et \nal.\u2019s (2014) findings on  the way Canadian news media  frames  climate change . Quebec sources \nwould choose  to frame climate change related news locally first, with the intention to  appeal  to a \nQuebecois audience, b efore a national, and then an international framing . Each level of \nmodulation from international to provincial adds another lens and another framing to the \nportrayal of climate change, as the journalists strive to find a story that will resonate with their \nspecific  audience.  It also decreases the  scope of climate change  the audience is exposed to, as \nthey are more likely to have narrow ly and  specifically  framed pieces of what is happening \nrelated to climate change rather  than a  larger, more complete  picture  (Ellen Good, 2008) . \nOutside of Canada, the United States was the most frequent country  targeted by articles  \n(13), even above  other Canadian provinces.  This is not merely because Quebec shares a border \nwith the United States, because the other provinces that border Quebec, such as New Brunswick \nand Ontario, were only the focus of one article each. This is also congruent with Koniecz na et \n32 \n \nal.\u2019s (2014)  findings, as the United States\u2019  news  media perspective is more global, due to its need \nto cater to a much larger audience than Canada.  \nAlberta  and Saskatchewan, both provinces from the prairies , were  the provinces  most \nfeatured in articles  outside of Quebec itself , with five articles each . This becomes more \nsignifican t when taken in context of Quebec\u2019s perceived ongoing rivalry with Alberta and the \nprairies regarding energy production, climate change strategies,  and Canadian politics . Articles \nabout Alberta or the Prairies, including Saskatchewan, are more likely to generate outrage . \nAlberta and Saskatchewan  are easier to sensationalize as a villain or antagonist to Quebec\u2019s \nefforts , making them appealing subjects  to Quebecois  journalists looking to boost engagement of \ntheir content  source  (Bray, 2018; Cody & Paz, 20 21). \n When it came to events reporte d on, the Paris Conference and the carbon tax  were  the \ntwo most popular topics  with nine articles each . The two topics are connected in Quebec, as \nQuebec was the first province to implement a provincial carbon tax, and the agreement reached \nat the Paris Conference would eventually lead to a nation -wide Canadian carbon tax program. \nThey are als o polarizing to pics, with many arguments and disagreements about how the \ngovernment and politicians should apply both the carbon tax and the results of the Paris \nConference in practice. Articles about Canada\u2019s national climate change strategy (7) and articles \nabout  Trump \u2019s effects on climate change  (6) and pulling out of the Paris agreement  (3) were also \nprevalent  in addition to being highly contested and polarizing topics. Each of these  events is a \ngovernment initiative that affect s individuals\u2019 lives and journalists would have initially covered \nthem as the news broke, and then again as people began to propose solutions and disagree, \nmaking them topics that were more likely to generate engagement and become prioritized by \nalgorithms.  All of these reasons make these topics more appealing  to journalists, especially \n33 \n \nbecause they can be framed as directly affecting individual Quebecois (Bray, 2018; Cody & Paz, \n2021; Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) .  \nWhen it comes to the themes  in the articles, articles mentioning politics (77) were the \nmost common by more than double , with close to  half of  all the articles containing reference s to \npoliti cs. Included in th ese articles  are international conferences, government regulations and \npolicies, and protest movements. Even articles that did not primarily focus on political events \noften contained information about the political effects of natural disasters or climate change on a \nsingle community, which demonstrates a heavy political framing  in the media ecology \nsurrounding \u201c changements climatiques \u201d in Quebec. This also fits with the rise in politics and \npolitical figures consulted in digital news media , as mentioned previously (Bray, 2018) . \nThe second most common theme was the exploration of the local impacts of climate \nchange on an area  (36). This type of framing is consistent with findings about the prevalence of \nlocal framing surrounding climate change in Canada (Ellen Good, 2008; Konieczna et al., 2014) . \nIt also means that these articles are more susceptible to misframing  as they seek to make \nconnections with their local audiences . Climate conferences are also on the list , as the sixth most \ncommon theme, mentioned in 22 of the articles, supporting how a lot of climate change in \nCanada is reported on via framing through the se conferences  (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) . \nHowever , despite this, research was just above climate conferences with 25 articles, implying \nthat Quebec news media still considers research  to have  an impact when  framing articles relat ed \nto climate change  in Quebec. Natural disasters were  not as frequently featured in articles  (9), \nwhich also makes algorithmic sense because they  are shared, unifying events, less likely to \ngenerate  polarized  reader engagement . News media has less incentive to publish them, and when \n34 \n \nthey are published, less engagement mean s lower  priority within algorithms, leading to even less \nvisibility  (Ellen Good, 2008) .  \nThe data on the main events  and themes covered in the articles further supports the \nargument made by Scott (1991)  on how the way climate change  is portrayed can reproduce \nspecific ideo logical systems. We can see this most visibly in what  the news media  is not \nreporting  on in the articles that were shared, such as various species going extinct, the use of \nchemicals and pesticides in farming , and the effects of their runoffs on water sources, or , apart \nfrom  the Trans Mountain Pipeline , the extraction of natural resources. Even the stories covering \nthe Trans Mountain Pipeline focused on the scandal it caused for Trudeau and the implications it \nwould have for relations between the government and Indigenous  communities.  The way these \narticles frame the pipeline  also support s the way that indigenous communities are used in news \nmedia with regard to climate change  in Canada  (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) . Overall, \nIndigenous  narratives and perspectives are broadly  missing from the findings , apart from  those \narticles about pipelines  and climate related protests . \n \nComments and the Comment Sections of Climate Change Articles  \n When it comes to reader  engagement, comment sections on the articles were  uncommon , \nwith less than half of the articles (68) offering the option to comment. This number decreased by \nmore than half again to 31 articles that had attracted  one or more reader comments. Radio -\nCanada was responsible for nearly all the comment pages  (27).  This is due  to the previously \nmentioned lack of resources , both in workforce  and financial,  required to host a sufficiently  \nmoderated comment section.  Radio -Canada  themselves have reported on the difficulties of \n35 \n \nrunning news media comment sections, with smaller news sites finding the job taxing and a \nminefield of harassment (Radio Active , 2016) .  \nDespite its more robust funding, moderation limitations also affect the nature of the \ncomments on articles published by Radio -Canada . Radio -Canada removed anonymous \ncommenting (Radio Active , 2016) , and other comment sections required sign -up with email and \nverification before posting or us ed Facebook comment sections. These changes , combined wi th \ncomment moderation by newspapers staff on the lookout for misinformation and disinformation, \nmeans it is also probable that  moderators have dissuaded or removed  more inflammatory or \nmisleading comments. This pushes the contents of comments to a more moderate tone than they \nmight have otherwise ha d. This is one probable  reason  for the lack of comments about climate \nchange denial . Comment ers were more  likely to  discuss  the political ramifications of climate \nchange and debat e viable  solutions  to climate change problems. Not all the solutions mentioned  \nwere feasible or even ma de sense, but they demonstrate d a desire to come up with a solution \nrather than to deny that there was a problem.  \nWe can also see d ifficulties  in dealing with comment sections  in the absence of results in \nthis paper on comments from Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec. Both  sources \nregularly include comment sections  on their articles , however, in mid 2020, the company s topped  \noutsourcing their comment  sections  to Facebook  due to technical difficulties and now self-host \nand run their comment sections on the ir own site . This resulted in articles published in or prior to \n2020  having their comment sections deleted (Journal, 2020) .  \n In the findi ngs, Radio -Canada would be  the source with the most comments (676), if not \nfor an outlier from Le Figaro . Le Figaro only had one article in my findings, but  there were 906 \ncomments on that single article. Le Figaro is a large francophone newspaper from Fra nce, with a \n36 \n \nreputation for factual  reporting and a right -center bias  (Le Figaro , 2022) . The article in question \nis a foregrounding (Bray, 2018)  article announcing the Paris Agreement and  detailing the results \nof the Paris C onferenc e. The article had a much more international reach than any of the \nCanadian news media articles  in the findings , and the framing of this article is abundantly  global , \nwith a slight focus on France. The behaviour of the participants also reflects th is in the \ncomments,  with a more diverse population engaging than those on the Canadian sites with \ncomments .  \nMost of  the comments  from the outlier , however,  express extreme dissatisfaction with the \nParis Agreement because they do not feel like it is doing enough . There are also a lot of \ncomments by individuals voicing their discontent and mocking political leaders and NGOs  for \nnot living up to expectations of their desired efforts against climate change . These comments are \nan example of how outrage dr ives engagement. As readers interact through t he comment section, \nthe cycle of outrage  grows , as an increased number  of individuals feel the  need to contribute \ntheir thoughts  to the discussio n. The increased levels of engagement contribute to boost  the \narticle\u2019s  popularity in social media and search algorithms (Bray, 2018) .  \nLooking at the rest  of the find ings for the comment sections , the types of articles that \nwere more likely to have comments framed in a more international  scope,  which is supported by \ntheir appeal to a wider audience. However, the location featured in the articles with the highest \ncomment  count  (205) , was the United States. Articles about the United States  that readers \ncommented on  were  almost entirely about Trump\u2019s  climate change policies , including  pulling the \nUS out of the Paris Agreement. These kinds of articles attracted  comments  that criticized  \nAmerican politics as well as a lot of ridicule towards Trump . \n37 \n \nSimilarly, excluding the outlier, the article with the most comments  overall (113) , focuse s \non Alberta  pulling out of Canada\u2019s national climate change strategy . This fits with the earlier \ndiscussion  of Quebec\u2019s villainization  of Alberta and the prairies , combined with the \ncontroversiality of Canada\u2019s national climate change strategy.  It is also consistent with the same \noutrage driven engagement that we can see  in the comment sections of both the outlier and the \narticles about the United States. U nderstanding how social media algorithms prioritize outrage \nand engagement (Bray, 2018; Cody & Paz, 2021) , an article about Alberta pulling out of \nCanada\u2019s climate change policy  is more likely to  motivate engagement from Quebecois w ho are \nangry or dissatisfied with Alberta\u2019s actions or excited to berate its choices . \nWith the outlier, articles about climate conferences generated the most engagement from \nreaders in comment sections  (945) . Without it,  articles about politics generated the most \nengagement  in the comments (521).  Articles with an economic focus or discussing local impacts \nwere equally likely to attract comments, but articles about economics had a far greater number of \ncomments (208) than those about local impacts  (59). One way this can be explained is that the \nframing of articles about local impacts are far more specific to certain communities  and receive \nless engagement outside of those communities , while economics is a much less location -bound \ntopic, allowing fo r engagement from individuals who might not be from the specific location that \nan article is framed towards (Konieczna et al., 2014; Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) . Another \nreason is because  the topic of economics is one that lends itself much more easily to outrage and \npolarization than a report about climate change in  a local area. This explains how the articles \nwith economics would generate more engagement, as  an algorithm would be more likely to pick \nthem up and promote them , in addition to further spreading through those who are engaging with \nthem  sharing them with others.  \n38 \n \nWe can see t he overwhelming use of a political framing of climate change in the impact \non the perception of individuals discussing events in comment sections , as they constantly \ndecried specific politicians for their mistakes . The popularity of more localized framing can also \nbe seen here as readers wrote comments that, at times, blam ed one individual for a problem that \nis much larger than any one person could  be responsible for  (Roosvall & Tegelberg, 2015) . This \nkind of environment is ripe for the type of exploitation that Cody (2015)  and Carvalho (2007)  \nargue populist leaders seek to take advantage of. Through the polarization and political \n(mis)framing  of climate change , it is easier for populist leaders to take advantage of these spaces,  \ndrive outrage , and mobilize the  individuals interacting with this type of news media.  \n \nConclusion  \nIn the end, I gained  a deeper  underst anding of what  climate change reporting looked like \nin Quebec over a five-year period. Some things  I expected, such as the outrage generated by \narticles about the climate change policies of the United States and Alberta and the general  \nincrease in climate change reporti ng over the years, especially since both Trudeau\u2019s election and \nthe Paris Conference  at the end of 2015. I was not expecting to find so little outward climate \nchange denial, instead finding it in a more subtle form, rather than outright denial . What was \nmissing from the articles told me a lot more.  It also surprised me how few news media \ncompanies offered comment sections on their pages, although in the context of budget cuts and \nlaws surrounding responsibility for web content, it makes sense that comment s ections have \nbecome less popular over the years.  \nThe way I interact with news media online has the potential to shap e future news media \nabout climate change. In my group chat, we had posted  outrage  driven articles and sometimes \n39 \n \ndiscussed them solely based on the sensationalized headlines , without fully  reading the content \nof the article.  Even though I did not agree with the content in some of the articles, I still shared \nthem and contributed to thei r popularity and their exposure to others. This kind of engagement \nwith news media might have  negative  consequences  that I do not immediately se e, such as how \nothers might understand the article I shared and where it might go after.  It tells social media \nalgorithms that this is the type of content that I want to see via my engagement.   \nIt is extremely easy  to manipulate groups of people into mobilizing around an ideology, \nespecially  when  others intentionally shape  that ideology through misframing and deceit. Seeing \nhow I have  been unknowingly contributing to it  disturbs me. I also realize that I am not alone in \nthis behaviour.  I have seen many other people, friends and family engage with news media in \nthis way.  A lot of sensationalized news media spreads because of people who do not necessarily \nagree with it but are engaging with it. Together we are telling algorithms and news media \ncompanies that we will click on and share that kind of content, making it more profi table for \nthem.  \nSharing media is only one part of engaging with news media though.  Another aspect is \nmaking sure that I pay more attention to the framing and mediation of articles that I read. The \nbenefits of doing this allow us to think more critically ab out what is going on around us, and to \nremember to look for the perspectives and framing that are missing when researching \ninformation or reading news media. This way we can work to fill in the blanks and create or \nboost the perspectives that are missing.  \n \n \n  \n40 \n \nReferences  \nAbout . (n.d.). Media Cloud.

Unfortunately, these platforms have also been a safe haven for abusive users who harass,\nbully other users or spread misinformation and disinformation. Social media platforms have a huge\nincentive to police these abusive users and keep them in check to allow other genuine users to use\ntheir platform. Social media platforms employ several different content moderation techniques to\nperform this task. These techniques vary across platforms, for example, Parler believes in using\nthe least restrictive moderation policies and having open discussion spaces for their users. These\npolicies were used by several members responsible for the 2021 US Capitol Riots.\nOnJanuary12, 2021, Parlerasocialmediaplatformpopularamongconservativeuserswasremoved\nfrom the Apple App store, the Google Play Store, and Amazon Web Services. This was blamed\non Parler\u2019s refusal to remove posts inciting violence following the 2021 US Capitol Riots [12].\nTo return to the app stores, Parler would have to modify their moderation policies drastically\n[36]. Shortly before being banned from Amazon Web Services, a Twitter user, donk_enby [20],\npublished frameworks and methodology for scraping Parler using their open API service. Studies\nlike Aliapoulios et al. [6] used this opportunity to collect a dataset of posts from Parler and record\nuser information [5]. After a month of downtime, with a new cloud service provider and a new\nset of user guidelines, Parler was back online [54]. Our study looks into the moderation changes\nperformed by Parler and studies any noticeable differences in user behavior.\nUsing Google\u2019s Perspective API, we notice a decrease in the toxicity content shared in posts. We\nalso notice similar trends in other labels such as identity attack, insult, severe toxicity, profanity,\nand threats. We study the most popular topics being talked about on Parler and compare other\ntopicstouncoveranychangesinthetopicsofdiscussion. Finally, theMediaBiasFactCheckservice\nalso checks the factuality of a sample of news websites being shared. We find an increase in the\nfactuality in the news sites being shared. We also notice a decrease in the number of questionable\nsources and conspiracy or pseudoscience sources being shared.\niii\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Dr. Shirin Nilizadeh, my thesis supervisor for guiding me through my thesis.\nDr. Nilizadeh has also helped me on other research projects and continues to motivate me to be\na better student.

These abusers make\nit harder for genuine users to enjoy the platform by reducing the positive impact of connecting with\nothers on social media platforms. Abusers can misinform users on current news events, and defraud\nusers by stealing their money on the pretense of selling them a product [13]. They also discourage\nnewer users from joining the platform and can contribute to a platform\u2019s downfall. Social media\nplatforms, hence use content moderation policies to police these abusive users.\nTheseplatformsdiffervastlyinmoderationpolicies. Someplatforms, suchasTwitterandYouTube,\nbelieve in fact-checking every post to curb false claims while some platforms, such as Facebook,\nonly fact check political advertisements. Similarly, platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok\nalso moderate content which can be toxic in nature. Other platforms believe in a laissez-faire\napproach to moderation, where only a specifically targeted attack or severely hateful content is\ntaken action against. Parler was one of these platforms. Ever since its inception in 2018, they have\nfollowed a hands-off approach to moderation believing that it fosters better discussion and protects\nusers\u2019s free speech [56]. This was until January 6th, 2021 when Parler gained a lot of notoriety\nfor being home to several protesters who stormed Capitol Hill. Parler was then dropped by their\ncloud service provider Amazon Web Services and removed from the App Store and the Google Play\nstore [23].\nThis forced Parler users to be disconnected for a considerable amount of time before coming back on\nFebruary 9, 2021. After a brief hiatus of a month and finding an alternative cloud service provider,\nParler also made changes to their user guidelines to be re-instated into the App Store and the\nGoogle Play store. After Parler was banned from the Apple App Store and the Google Play store,\nmobile users were not able to use Parler. Shortly after, their cloud service provider Amazon Web\nServices also banned Parler due to their inaction on posts inciting violence. Although Parler found\nan alternative cloud service provider, they had to abide by the App Store and the Play stores rules\nand guidelines. This meant a change in their moderation policies and new user guidelines.\nChapter 1. Introduction 2\nThesechangeswouldintroducemorestringentmoderationpolicieswhichwouldcurbhatespeech[36].\nThe goal of this study is to examine how changes in moderation policies would impact how users\nwould view and continue to use the Parler platform. Several other prior studies and current ef-\nforts have focused on topics, such as comparing moderation policies on different online platforms,\nidentifying the impact of de-platforming, identifying small groups of unmoderated communities,\nor similar topics [49, 27, 9, 62, 66]. Due to the unique nature of Parler\u2019s de-platforming and the\ntimely nature, we believe that this area of research can teach us a lot about user behaviors as well\nas online social media platforms in general. There also exists a lack of work in content modera-\ntion post moderation policy changes on Parler. The current study fixes this void by studying the\nchanges noticed on Parler post moderation policy changes. We hope that our research can also\nshed a light on how policy changes affect the whole platform and its ecosystem and whether these\npolicy changes are effective.\n1.1 Research Questions\n\u2022Has the prevalence of hateful and toxic content decreased? Our study explores this question\nto study the effectiveness of the content moderation techniques and compares them from the\npre-and post- moderation policy posts.\n\u2022Have the topics of discussion changed? If so what are the changes? This question would also\nhelp understand the impact of moderation change on user behavior.\n\u2022Is there any difference in the credibility of news sources being shared between pre and post\nmoderation policy changes?\nTo answer the above research questions, we will use data collected about users and posts before\nas well as after moderation policy changes. Before being taken down, several internet sleuths deci-\nphered Parler\u2019s open API system and other studies also collected data including posts, comments,\nand user information. For example, donk_enby collected about 70 TB of public Parler data from\nJanuary 6 2021 [20]. This was the first open-sourced Parler public data that was released. Works\nsuch as [6, 49, 8, 43] have used either the whole dataset, or used the technique to collect new data\nto study various themes, such as vaccines andpolitics. Our study uses the data from Aliapoulios\net al. [6] and also we collect new Parler data using a custom build crawler, to understand how\nthe change in moderation policies affected the hateful rhetoric, the spread of conspiracies, etc. We\nlabeled our dataset as post moderation policy change and the data collected by Aliapoulios et al. [6]\nas pre-moderation policy change data.\nChapter 1. Introduction 3\nUsing the collected data, we conduct several qualitative and quantitative analyses to capture any\ntrends while comparing data from post moderation policy changes and pre-moderation policy\nchanges. These analyses also help us answer our research questions. First, we extracted posts\nfrom both of the datasets to analyze the presence of toxic content. We used the Perspective service\nto score the likelihood of toxic content due to their open source methodology as well as their rou-\ntinely updated classifier models to match current social media lingo [7]. Using the results obtained\nfrom this step, we compared both the pre and post moderation policy change data to answer our\nfirst research question. The Perspective service powered by Google uses machine learning to iden-\ntify hateful or toxic texts by providing a score from 0.0-1.0 based on the attribute. The service\noffers labels or scores for 6 attributes: i) Toxicity, ii) Severe Toxicity, iii) Identity Attack, iv) Insult,\nv) Profanity and Threat. Using the scores for each post in each dataset, we were able to compare\nwhether there was any change in the amount of hateful or toxic rhetoric present on the Parler\nplatform.\nIn the next stage, we explored whether the supposed moderation changes had any impact on the\ntopics of discussion. To investigate this, we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic\nmodeling technique to model and extract popular topics of conversations. We used these topics to\ncompare the different datasets and visualize the results using a word cloud. This also helped us\nanswer our second research question about whether the topics of discussion have changed.\nTo answer our final research question on the credibility of news sources being shared, we extracted\nlinks being shared via posts and investigate the websites that users were being redirected to.\nWe used the Media Bias Fact Check service (MBFC) to rate the credibility of the news sources\nbeing shared. MBFC is an open source service that uses manual labeling to certify a website\u2019s\nbias, country of origin, and factuality as well as the use of pro-science, conspiracy or questionable\nsources.\nFindings: Using the methods described above, we answered our research questions and uncovered\nsome notable findings shared below:\n\u2022Using the Perspective API, we collected and compared scores for the 6 available attributes.\nWe noticed that several posts in the post policy change dataset had a score for toxicity closer\nto 0. Meanwhile, most of the posts having a higher probability score for toxicity were present\nin the pre policy change dataset. These scores indicate that toxic posts were more probable\nto be found in posts before the moderation changes implemented by Parler.\n\u2022We also noticed a similar decreasing trend in severe toxicity, profanity, identity attacks,\ninsults, and threats.\nChapter 1. Introduction 4\n\u2022After using LDA to find the most popular topics talked about, we found several topics related\nto right-wing political groups in both datasets. We also found several Parler-specific words\nsuch as Parleys present in the earlier dataset. We theorize that the cause for this might be\ndue to users migrating from other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook which\ndo not use these terms. These new users could be talking about the Parler-specific terms,\nintroducing them to other users, and learning about them themselves.\n\u2022We also found a high usage of terms like WWG1WGA , which is a popular term used amongst\nconservative political groups. It is associated with the political conspiracy theory and person-\nality of QAnon, widely popular on the internet before and after the capital riots. It stands for\nWhere We Go as 1, We Go All which defines the togetherness of the QAnon community [33].\n\u2022While studying and comparing the links shared by Parler users, we noticed a steep increase\nin links directing users to Rumble, which is an online social media platform to share videos.\nWhile categorizing the most popular websites, we also noticed a high number of links leading\nto personal blogs, which were mostly political in nature. Oftentimes, these blogs or websites\nwere making claims without providing sufficient credible evidence.\n\u2022Using a service called Media Bias Fact Check (MBFC), we also used the extracted links to\nadd attributes based on the credibility, factuality, country of origin, and general authenticity\nof the news websites. We notice an increase in the factuality and credibility scores from the\npre moderation policy dataset to the post moderation policy. We also notice a decrease in\nthe number of conspiracy-pseudoscience and questionable source links being shared.\n\u2022We also compared the number of followers and followings between the datasets as well as the\nnumber of badges awarded to users. We noticed an increase in both the number of followers\nand the followings. This indicates that Parler is still being used by older users who were\npresent before the moderation policies were changed. Similarly, we noticed that the number\nof users with the verified and gold badge had increased leading us to believe that a large\nchunk of users has not abandoned or migrated out of Parler. This adds credibility to our\nstudy and our findings.\n5\nChapter 2\nRelated Works\n2.1 Parler Dataset\nWhen compared to other popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, Parler\nis younger. Due to this, we notice that not a lot of studies have focused on collecting or establishing\na framework to collect data from Parler. An exception to this is the pre policy change dataset we\nuse extensively in our study to perform comparisons [6]. Other related work on establishing a\nframework for data collection has focused on older versions of the Parler API, which are now\noutdated [20, 49].\n2.2 Studies About Parler\nDuring our work, we noticed that Parler\u2019s users were predominantly conservative. We see this in\nthe topics of discussion as well as their bio\u2019s. Works have looked into similar fringe platforms like\nVoat, 4chan, Gab [46, 27, 9, 62, 66]. There have been studies comparing topics of discussion on\nParler and Twitter [49]. Although there exists work in this domain, most of the work is focused on\nexploring the existence or prevalence of a single topic. Papasavva et al. [46] uses Voat to study the\nspread of the QAnon movement while Hitkul et al. [49] uses the capitol riots, a pivotal movement\nin Parler\u2019s history, to compare topics of discussion between Parler and Twitter. We believe that\nour work differs in this aspect as we are studying the changes localized to Parler and how users\nreacted to a brief hiatus of Parler. Jakubik et al. [29] have used posts on Parler around the time\nof the US Capitol riots to compare with similar posts from Twitter. The study analyzed emotions\nsurrounding posts on Parler and Twitter and concluded that users on Parler had a comparatively\nless negative response when compared to users from Twitter.\n2.3 Moderation Policy Updates\nThere have been studies that investigate the moderation policies on other social media platforms\nlike Twitter. Jhaver et al. [30] is one such study that examined how deplatforming users on\nTwitter could impact their userbase. They studied the effectiveness of this moderation policy by\nChapter 2. Related Works 6\nexamining their followers and the shift in talking points. They found that banning significantly\nreduced the number of conversations about all three individuals on Twitter and the toxicity levels\nof supporters declined. Ribeiro et al. [53] found that migration of the two subreddits to standalone\nwebsites reduced the audience of posts, but also found that users became more active and more\ntoxic. Trujillo & Cresci [61] found that interventions had strong positive effects on reducing the\nactivity of problematic users both inside and outside of r/The_Donald. Some scholarships have\nexamined the effects of deplatforming individuals on the sites that sanctioned influencers move to\npost-deplatforming [4, 51, 55, 42]. These researchers found a common result, that deplatforming\nsignificantly decreased the reach of the deplatformed users, however, the hateful and toxic rhetoric\nincreased.\n2.4 Hate Speech Detection and Classification\nResearchontoxicityhasemployedmachinelearning-baseddetectionalgorithmstoidentifyandclas-\nsify offensive language, hate speech, and cyberbully [67, 15]. For example, Koratana and Hu [32]\nclassified comments into seven groups clear, toxic, obscene, insult, identity hate, severe toxic, and\nthreat. ElSherief et al. [21] categorized online hate speech into directed and generalized. Studies\nlike Miok et al. [40] use bayesian attention networks to detect hate speech. Rana et al [50] uses\nemotion based hate speech detection algorithms. Other studies like Raut et al. [52] and Ahmed et\nal. [3] use LSTM neural network models for hate speech detection. The machine learning methods\nuse a variety of features, including lexical properties, such as n-gram features [45], character n-gram\nfeatures [38], character n-gram, demographic and geographic features [64], sentiment scores [17, 57,\n24],averagewordandparagraphembeddings[45,19],andlinguistic,psychological,andeffectivefea-\ntures inferred using an open vocabulary approach [21]. The state-of-the-art toxicity detection tool\nis available through Google\u2019s Perspective API [7]. Perspective uses a single multilingual token-free\nCharformer model that is applicable across a range of languages, domains, and tasks. Perspective\nalso claims that through extensive experiments on multilingual toxic comment classification bench-\nmarks derived from real API traffic and evaluation of an array of code-switching, covert toxicity,\nemoji-basedhate, human-readable obfuscation, distribution shift, andbias evaluation settings, they\nshow that their proposed approach outperforms strong baselines [34].\nInourstudy, wehaveusedthePerspectiveAPItolabelpostswithadditionalattributesliketoxicity,\ninsult, profanity, severe toxicity, identity attack, and threat. These attributes contain a probability\nscore ranking how prevalent an attribute can be seen in each post. Studies like Papasavva et al. [47]\nalso use the Perspective API to add more information to their dataset of 4chan posts.\nChapter 2. Related Works 7\n2.5 Media Bias Fact Check\nOur current study uses the Media Bias Fact Check (MBFC) service to add additional attributes\nlike credibility, factuality, and the general authenticity of the posts. Gruppi et al. [25] used MBFC\nservice to label websites and the tweets pertaining to COVID-19 and 2020 Presidential elections\nembedded inside these articles. These websites are part of a seed set, which are used along with\ntheir respective RSS feed to collect every article shared by the website. Weld et al. [65] analyzed\nmore than 550 million links spanning 4 years on Reddit. The authors used MBFC to annotate\nlinks to news sources with their political bias and factualness. MBFC is widely used for labelling\ncredibility and factuality of news sources for downstream analysis [37, 26, 58, 14, 41] and as ground\ntruth for prediction tasks [18, 60, 48]. Our study examines the websites shared by users, which\nare in circulation on the Parler social media platform. We believe that this allows us to make\nconclusions about the user base of Parler as well as evaluate their moderation changes.\n.\n8\nChapter 3\nParler\nParler is a social networking and microblogging service initially launched in August 2018 as an\nonline website and later released as a mobile application. Parler markets itself as a free-speech\nalternative to other mainstream social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. In the\nearly years of its existence, several prominent conservative figures joined the platform and brought\nalong several customers with them. A key reason for some of these figures migrating to Parler was\nbanned on other social media sites such as Twitter and YouTube. For example, in June 2019 there\nwere several service disruptions to Parler\u2019s services due to the sudden influx of accounts. The new\naccounts had originated from Saudi Arabia and promoted the use of Parler after accusing Twitter\nof arbitrarily banning users.\n3.1 Parler Terms and Workings\nSigning up on Parler: At the time of the study, Parler required new users to sign up by inputting\ntheir email, phone number, and name. The provided phone number would be verified by sending a\none-time valid password. Currently, Parler has changed their sign-up sheet to only require either an\nemail or a phone number and a secure password. Parler auto-generates and populates the password\nfield with a strong 14-character password consisting of lowercase and uppercase alphabets along\nwith numbers from 0-9 and special characters such as !, -, _, $, % and &. This password can be\noverwritten with a user-chosen password if desired. After signing up, a user can start view other\nposts called Parleys on the service. A user can also start posting their own Parleys, comments,\necho or upvote on other accessible Parleys. Accessible Parleys constitute Parleys from public users\nor private users who have accepted a request to be followed. Comments on a Parley are not\nmulti-layered like others, we see on other popular social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.\nUsers can instead mention another user by using the @character followed by their username to\nindirectly reply to their comment. Similarly, upvotes on Parler are comparable to likes on Twitter\nand Facebook. Echoing a post on Parler can be done in two ways: i) A user can echo a Parley\nwith no additional added text or ii) A user can instead elect to echo a Parley with additional\ntext either adding more information about the original Parley or conveying their opinion on the\nChapter 3. Parler 9\noriginal Parley. Upvotes on posts are similar to the like function on platforms like Facebook and\nTwitter.\nUser Filters: Parler allows real-time comment moderation for the original poster. The poster\ncan block or hide comments similar to Twitter. The poster can also add a list of words to filter\nthe comments similar to Instagram. Parler users can also block other users to hide their Parleys.\nParler also offers a mute option which ensures that the user no longer sees the person\u2019s Parleys\nand comments. There is also a subscribe option that allows users to be notified of new Parleys\nfrom the subscribed user. This option is similar to the subscribe and notify option from YouTube.\nUsers can also report inappropriate Parleys and comments which break Parler\u2019s rules.\nParler Search Feature: Parler also displays a search box after a user has logged in which can be\nused to search for Parleys using hashtags and users using their name or username. The search box\nhowever cannot be used to search for Parleys using text. There are two kinds of users on Parler:\nPrivateandPublicusers. Private users can hide their parleys from users who are not approved,\nfollowers. Parleys from public users on the other hand can be seen by any Parler user. Parler also\nhas a setting under Account Privacy Options to set a public account as an openaccount. Parleys\nfrom open accounts can be seen by anyone on the internet and do not require a valid Parler account\nto be viewed. By default, every new account is an open account.\nNotifications & Badges: After posting a Parley, the user will receive notifications for each\ncomment posted. Users can turn off this feature which is turned off by default. Parler also notifies\nusersiftheircommentswereupvotedorifacommentmentionstheirusernameusingthe @operator.\nParler also employs a system of rewarding and identifying other users by presenting them with\nBadges. At the time of this study, Parler awarded 7 badges: i) Verified: Users who have proved to\nParler as being real humans and not bots. Users can request this badge by sending Parler an official\nID along with a picture to verify their identity. ii) Gold: Parler users cannot request a gold badge,\ninstead, Parler offers this badge to users with a large following. With this badge, Parler intends to\nhelp users identify influencers and distinguish them from other accounts impersonating them. iii)\nParler Early Adopter: Parler rewards users who were active before December 30th, 2018 with the\nParler Early Adopter badge. iv) Parler Employee: This badge can be seen on Parler employees as\ndenoted by the name. v) Parler official: This badge is present on official Parler accounts used to\nwelcome users to the platform, check the status, and make announcements. Like the gold badge,\nthis is used to help users distinguish official Parler channels from other impersonators. vi) RSS:\nThis badge is awarded to accounts that use an RSS feed to post Parleys. vii) Private: This badge\nis placed on private Parler accounts. A figure of the badges can be seen in fig 3.1\nParler Home & Discover Pages: After logging in, Parler users are welcomed to their homepage\nChapter 3. Parler 10\nFigure 3.1: Figure of available badges\nconsisting of recent Parleys posted by following users, a menu bar on the left containing quick links\nto their profile, notifications, a Parler store page, and Parler\u2019s Discover page. The homepage also\nincludes two display tabs on the right showing trending users and hashtags. Unlike other major\nsocial media platforms, Parler markets and sells merchandise like hoodies, hats, beanies, mugs,\nshirts, and gift cards. After manually searching for hashtags similar to Parler Store, we could not\nfind any Parleys promoting their merchandise from users. The discover page contains Parleys from\nother users on the platform. Refreshing the discover page does not populate the page with newer\nposts which leads us to believe that adding parleys to the discover page is not automated. Scrolling\ndown on the discover page does call Parler\u2019s backend services to download more parleys. Parler also\ndoesn\u2019t limit the parleys displayed to just verified users. We have noticed a handful of Parleys from\nusers with no badges. Initially, we assumed that the Discover page was user-specific and that the\nParleys seen were due to the user\u2019s activities on the platform. During our data collection phase, we\ndisprove this theory by noticing the same parleys in the same order from multiple different Parler\naccounts with different browsing histories.\nUser Profile: The left pane also includes a link to the user\u2019s profile. Users can use this link to view\ntheir parleys, look at the number of followers or followings and also edit their profile information.\nWhile editing their profile, users can add both: a profile and a cover image. The profile image\nis displayed on the profile along with their parleys. The cover image is only visible from a user\u2019s\nprofile. Users can also add their name, location, their website, and a description consisting of 200\nor lesser characters.\nChapter 3. Parler 11\nTrending: The home page also contains two tabs on the right pane of the screen displaying 5\ntrending users and 5 trending hashtags. These users are retrieved by using a backend API call\nto Parler\u2019s server. The API call returns 10 users and 10 hashtags unlike only the 5 that get\ndisplayed. We did notice a minimum requirement for a user to appear under trending users was\nto have the verified badge. Initially, we assumed that users appearing under the trending users\nwas based on some automatic mechanism based on the views their profile or their parleys were\ngenerating. Similarly, we assumed that trending hashtags were automatically refreshed based on\nthe number of parleys using the hashtags. During our data collection we noticed that this was\nnot the case, however, and we can reasonably establish that the users and hashtags were either\nmanually handpicked or manually updated after a set interval of time.\n12\nChapter 4\nData Collection\n4.1 Pre Policy Change Parler API\nInitially, prior to being removed from app stores, Parler\u2019s websites used an open API format to\ncommunicate with the backend Parler servers. These APIs were used to fetch and send data related\nto user profiles, parleys, comments, etc. These API standards were changed before Parler was\nreinstatedtotheappstoresandhavechangeddrasticallyasdetailedinSection4.3. UsingtheseAPI\ndiscoveries from [20], Aliapoulios et al. [6] built a crawler to collect Parler user information, parleys\nand comments. In the first step, a collection of user unique identifiers (UUID) was established.\nThese identifiers are unique across parler and do not change, unlike the user\u2019s username or name.\nThe UUIDs were retrieved using an API request which maps a single monotonically increasing\ninteger to a UUID. These UUIDs were later used to gather posts and user information.\nThe endpoints used to collect the data were:\n\u2022/v1/post: Used with the UUIDs collected from the previous step to collect post information.\nA similar endpoint was also used to collect comments. Data such as the post text, upvotes,\ncreated at, hashtags and URLs if any were present would also be present from the API\u2019s\nresponse.\n\u2022/v1/user: Used with the UUIDs collected from the previous step to collect user metadata.\nAmong the collected information were: user badges, bio, followers, followings, posts, com-\nments, and date joined.\nSome fields were collected like the upvotes on a parley, followers or followings of a user, and\nthe number of comments and posts were reformatted from strings to integers to allow for easier\nnumerical analysis. Each response from the API was stored as a JSON object and shared publicly\non Zenodo [5].\nChapter 4. Data Collection 13\n4.2 Pre Policy Change Data Collected\nThe data collection tool used in Aliapoulios et al. [6] managed to collect user information for almost\nall of the users present at the time based on estimates published by Parler. They also managed\nto collect posts and comments from these users dating back all the way back to 2018 when Parler\nwas created. At the end of the data collection phase, the study collected user information from\n4,079,765 users and 98,509,761 posts, and 84,546,856 posts. These 4M users were used as a seed\ndataset in Section 4.4 stage to collect data post policy changes instituted by Parler.\n4.3 Post Policy Change Parler API\nUsing a custom-built web scraper written in Python, we collected data using the back-end API\nservicing Parler\u2019s website. The API endpoints were discovered while using Parler from a desktop\nbrowser. We discovered 10 main endpoints used to share information from Parler\u2019s servers.\n\u2022/functions/post/fetch/FetchParleyController: Used to display a single post using a unique\npost_id\n\u2022/functions/post/create/PostParleyController: Used to post Parleys or comment on Parleys\n\u2022/functions/upload_video and /functions/uploadimage: Used to upload a media file as part\nof a parley or comment.\n\u2022/functions/trending_hashtags: Returns a list of ten trending hashtags. Used to show users\na list of trending hashtags on their front page.\n\u2022/functions/trending_users: Similar to the trending_hashtags, trending_users return a list\nof 10 users with the verified badge. These users are displayed to every user on their front\npage.\n\u2022/pages/feed: Used to request parleys posted by a specific user using their username. The\nendpointonlyreturns20parleysperrequest. Olderparleysneedtoberequestedincrementing\nthe page number counter. This endpoint is also used to retrieve the discover page for the\nlogged-in user.\n\u2022/functions/heartbeat: Used to increment the number of views on a Parley. Requires post_id\nto increase views. Currently, the website version of Parler does not share the number of views\non a post although the previous version allowed users to view this.\n\u2022/pages/hashtags: Requires a logged-in user to type in a hashtag to search for parleys.\nChapter 4. Data Collection 14\n\u2022/pages/profile/view: Requires a valid username of a Parler user. Returns metadata informa-\ntion about users: number of 1) followers, 2) following, 3) parleys, 4) likes, 5) comments, 6)\nbadges, textual information: 1) display name and 2) text in the user bio. The endpoint also\nreturns a link to access the user profile and cover images.\n\u2022/pages/search-results: Similar to /pages/hashtags required a text but unlike the former, it\ncan search for users.\nWe used the Postman API tool extensively to set up request headers, cookies, and request form\ndata and also to test outputs from our scraper for all the endpoints. We used the tool to test\nseveral types of request data types and noticed that Parler only supported receiving data from the\nform data fields.\n4.4 Web Scraper\nAfter establishing these endpoints, we built a web scraper using the requests module [28]. Since\nParler requires a valid user log in to use these APIs, we started checking the cookies used by Parler\u2019s\nwebsite. We noticed a session token called parler_auth_token being set to a 64-bit key. A new\nsession key was initialized and distributed to the user on every log-in but each session key was valid\nfor 60 days from the time of log-in. We used this session key to initialize our cookies along with\nother required fields auto-generated by the requests module. To collect parleys posted by a user,\nwe used the /pages/feed endpoint along with the username of a valid user. The username was used\nas part of the form data encoded in the body of the request. The two required fields in the body:\npageanduserwould be set to the page number and the username, respectively.\nDue to changes in the API, we were no longer able to collect data from all users hence we used\nthe dataset of users from Aliapoulios et al. [5] to collect posts from Parler. The study uses a list of\n4,079, 765 users to collect posts and we perform a similar step. We divided the 4,079,765 users into\nbatches of 500,000 users each. The scraper used multiple threads to collect multiple user parleys\nsimultaneously but the cumulative outgoing requests were rate limited to avoid overwhelming\nParler\u2019s servers or causing any disruption in their normal services. The endpoint returns the\n20 most recent parleys from the user and a page number counter can be incremented to retrieve\nother older parleys. The web scraper increments the page number count until there are no parleys\nleft to retrieve. We collected information about the post body, any URLs posted, a URL to the\nlocation of any media posted, the date posted, the number of echoes, and other metadata such as\nthe badges of the poster.\nChapter 4. Data Collection 15\nThe endpoint returned data in the form of a list of JSON objects. After recursively traversing all\nthe pages of a user to collect all the posted parleys, each JSON object was appended to a list and\nstored as a list of JSON.\nFor our next phase of data collection, we used the /pages/profile/view endpoint. This endpoint\nrequires a valid username along with a valid session token and returns the number of followers\nand following, badges, account creation date, text in bio, whether the account is public or private,\naccount name, and a link redirecting to the profile and cover images stored on Parler\u2019s servers.\nThe profile API uses form data stored inside the delivered request to serve user information. The\nkeyuserwould be set to a value of a valid username. To collect profile data after the moderation\npolicy change, we use a seed dataset of 13.25M users from Aliapoulias et al. [6] to collect user\nprofile data.\nUnlike the previously used post API to collect posts, the profile API returns all the information in\na single request and hence does not have to be run recursively. The returned message is encoded\nas a JSON object with the keys being data headers and the values being corresponding data\nvalues.\nWhile testing a small dataset of users to scrape posts and profiles, we noticed that Parler often\ndoes not return the values for all headers. We noticed that a lot of posts were missing values for the\ndate of creation. We also noticed some users were missing values for profile and cover images. The\nscrapper tool built for data collection was modified after noticing this to log and store information\nabout missing fields. After a specific batch of users\u2019s data was collected, we used these log messages\nto re-collect data and fill in the missing fields.\nAfter using the scraper to collect posts and user profile data, we decided to use the trending\n_hashtags and thetrending_users endpoints to try to collect a sample of users not included in our\nseed dataset. We verified the trending users and hashtags were not user specific by comparing the\nresults using two different Parler accounts. We noticed the same users and hashtags under trending\nand therefore concluded that they were not user specific. While looking into adding more users\nto our dataset, we also explored collecting data from the discover page. Similar to the trending\nusers and hashtags, the discover page was not user specific but only included Parleys by users\nwith a verified badge. To collect data from the discover page, we used the same feed endpoint but\ninstead of sending a username we instead send the text discover. The resulting request is similar\nto collecting Parleys and can be saved as a JSON object as well.\nWe set up the scraper to collect trending users and hashtags every hour for a 72-hour time period\nto test the results. After this, we extracted unique users and hashtags and noticed only 100 unique\nusers and hashtags being collected. We determined that the trending users and hashtags were\nChapter 4. Data Collection 16\nnot being refreshed in a timely manner. The users returned from trending users were also only\nlimited to users with the verified badge. After conducting a similar collection phase for the discover\npage, similar to the trending users and hashtags, the posts were not updated in a timely manner\nsuggesting some form of manual intervention. Due to these reasons, we decided not to use the\ntrending hashtag and users or the discover page to add users to our dataset.\n4.5 Post Policy Change Data Collected\nAs we can see in table 4.1, after scraping posts from all the users in our dataset, we collected\n17,389,610 parleys from 432,654 active users. Several other users part of the initial seed dataset of\n4,079,765 were no longer active or had deleted their accounts. We label them as missingusers,\nas either, they would have changed their usernames, after Parler was reinstated back, or they were\nbanned by Parler or the users themselves deleted their account. These parleys consisted of users\nposting around 9M links as well as plain text in the body. A majority of these posts were primary\nposts that have no parent. If a parley is an original parley and is not an echo of another parley,\nit is known as a primary post with no parent. For a vast majority of the primary parleys we\ncollected the full text body, a URL if a link was shared, the title of parley, date of creation, flags\nfor trolling, sensitive and self-reported, an upvoted flag, a counter of echoes and likes. We noticed\nthat Parler has a trolling flag which might be set manually by moderators or automatically by the\nplatform.\nTable 4.1: Post Policy Change Data Collected\nCount Users\nPosts 17,389,610 4,079,765\nUser Data 12,497,131 13,248. 086\nWe also used the profile_view endpoint to collect profile information on 13.25 million users.\nWe found that 12,497,131 of these users still had a valid Parler account and therefore we could\ncollect metadata for these users. We collected and saved all the key-value pairs returned in JSON\nobjects from the API in separate JSON files to allow for easier use. For a vast majority of the\naccounts, Parler returned the number of followers, the number of following, status(account available\nor deleted), the number of and types of badges given to the user, and a description of all badges\navailable on Parler at the time of collection, date of parley creation, whether the account is private\nor public and also whether the account is being followed by or a follower of the user logged in. A\nminority of profiles have one or more of these fields missing due to changes on the Parler platform\nfrom when the user created the account and the time of data collection.\nChapter 4. Data Collection 17\nEthical consideration. Due to the large size and the potentially user-sensitive data collected,\nwe also took several ethical considerations. We only gathered posts from profiles set to public and\nmade no attempt to access private accounts. We also made no attempts to maliciously gather\nthis data, instead of using the same backend APIs that a user browser would request data from.\nFurthermore, we make no attempts to trace users across other social media platforms or link\naccounts to real-world persons.\nThe most recent announcements by Parler have put the number of customers around 20M. We\ncollect user information for 11.7M of these users which ensures that the trends observed in our\ndata are seen on the platform as well. Meanwhile, since we only collect posts from 432,654 users we\nacknowledge that certain trends and analyses conducted might not be accurately reflected on the\nplatform. However, as of January 2022, months after returning to app stores on both the Android\nand Apple platforms Parler disclosed that they estimate to have around 700,000 to 1M active users.\nThis ensures that we have collected a significant part of data to study and base our findings on. We\nalso believe that since we are comparing the same users from a previous seed dataset, the trends\nnoticed in our dataset should generally also be present on the platform.\n18\nChapter 5\nUser Information Metrics\nAfter analyzing data collected about Parleys from both the datasets, we decided to analyze user\ninformation collected. Some of the information collected was: badges, names, followers, and follow-\nings. Here, we also sort the Parleys based on username to conduct research on topics of discussion.\nWe start by comparing the number of badges present in each dataset as well as comparing the\nnumber of common badges between both the datasets that the users have attained.\n5.1 Badges\nWe extracted badges for every user in the dataset of pre moderation policy change as seen in\nTable 5.1. We notice that badges like Parler employee could help us come to the conclusion that\nParler probably employed around 25 employees around the time of data collection. These numbers\nalso suggest a large number of users are private users. We also see quite a large number of users\ngoing through Parler\u2019s verification process to prove that their account is not a bot. Users submit\na picture of a valid ID which would verify them and award them with a Verified badge. We also\nnotice a large number of popular influencers who have been awarded a Goldbadge to show that\npopular users are using Parler.\nIn Table 5.2 we can see the badges collected from the post moderation policy change dataset. When\ncomparing the number of users with the verified badge we notice an increase which could prove\nthat users are still active on Parler since receiving the verified badge requires user action and is not\nautomatic. Wealsonoticeanincreaseinthenumberof Goldbadgeswhichcouldmeanthatexisting\nParler users have gained popularity to require a Gold badge . A sharp increase in the number of\nverified users can also be seen which might be due to users being fearful of an influx of bots as\nParler was growing as a platform and attracting attention from other social media users.\n5.2 User Metrics\nAfter looking at the badges, we extracted the metrics following andfollowers from both datasets.\nThe resulting set of values did not form a standard distribution and hence we choose to use the\nChapter 5.

They would be displayed on user profiles\nas their real name. To match names derived from users to a gender we follow the U.S. Census\nBased method used in Nilizadeh et al. [44]. The dataset of names includes a score ranging from 0\nto 1 which denotes the likelihood of the name belonging to a person of either male or the female\ngender. A higher score denotes that the person is likelier to be of the male gender and similarly\na lower score denotes that the person is likelier to be of the female gender. We use a threshold\nof 0.95 or greater to be classified as a male and a threshold of 0.05 or lower to be classified as\nfemale [44]. Using this data, we record names that are usually used to address males and females.\nHistorically, most social media services like Facebook and Twitter have reported more female users\nthan male [59]. As we can see in Figure 5.1, Parler does not follow this trend. Instead, we notice\nChapter 5. User Information Metrics 21\nMale Female Ambiguous0204060% of usersGender\nFigure 5.1: Histogram showing gender results rounded up\nthat a large majority of users on Parler are male.\n5.4 Summary\nWe notice an increase in the number of verifiedbadges handed out by Parler. This shows us that\nusers are going through Parler\u2019s verification process and are willing to show and guarantee other\nusers that they are not bots and are human users. Interestingly, we notice that the number of users\nwith the Privatebadge has decreased post moderation policy. We also notice an increase in the\nnumber of other badges like the Goldbadge as well as an increase in the number of followers and\nfollowing per user. This might indicate that users are still using Parler. Using the names from user\nprofile data we also analyze their gender. We noticed a large number of male users which suggests\nthat Parler is predominantly a male-dominated social media platform. This is contrary to other\nsocial media services like Facebook and Twitter which have reported a higher share of female users\nwhen compared to male users [59].\n22\nChapter 6\nParley Analysis Using Persective API\n6.1 Introduction to the Perspective API\nThe Perspectve API is a tool developed by Google, available for users to identify abusive texts or\ncomments.

Thesescorescanhelpusersinferwhether\na text contains harmful aspects or not. The service was mainly marketed towards moderators, who\ncan use the automated service more easily to review comments. Perspective is used by developers\nat platforms like Disqus and The Wall Street Journal to aid their moderation techniques [63]. It\nis also used by studies to obtain and sometimes compare different datasets of texts or comments.\nThe Perspective API offers its services in Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German,\nHindi, Spanish, Russian, Korean, Portuguese, and several other languages. The newest generation\nof Perspective algorithms has also been trained to be effective across different usages and styles of\ntext. This is important when monitoring communities, which can develop standard practices and\npopular words over time that are not seen in other communities.\nWe notice such occurrences on Parler while manually scanning some users. For example, the\nphraseWWG1WGA was highly active on Parler. The phrase, which stands for Where We Go as\n1, We Go as All, is associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory and Parler served as the de-facto\ncommunication platform for most of these surrounding conversations [11].\nAs discussed above, Perspective returns a list of attributes along with scores for each reporting\nthe prevalence of the individual attribute. Perspective allows users to retrieve the scores for the\nfollowing attributes [16]:\n\u2022Toxicity: Toxicity is defined as a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely\nto make people leave a discussion.\n\u2022Severe toxicity: Severe toxicity on the other hand goes further into the hateful nature and is\ndefined by Perspective as a very hateful, aggressive, disrespectful comment or otherwise very\nlikely to make a user leave a discussion or give up on sharing their perspective. This attribute\nChapter 6. Parley Analysis Using Persective API 23\nis much less sensitive to more mild forms of toxicity, such as comments that include positive\nuses of curse words.\n\u2022Identity Attack: Defined by Perspective as negative or hateful comments targeting someone\nbecause of their identity.\n\u2022Insult: This attribute is defined by Perspective as an insulting, inflammatory, or negative\ncomment towards a person or a group of people.\n\u2022Profanity: Perspective defines profanity as swear words, curse words, or another obscene or\nprofane language.\n\u2022Threat: Describes an intention to inflict pain, injury, or violence against an individual or\ngroup.\n6.2 Perspective Scores Data Collection\nPerspective provides users with two endpoints: i) AnalyzeComment where a comment or a text is\nanalyzed and returns the likelihood scores for the chosen attributes, and ii) SuggestCommentScore\nwhich allows users to suggest scores, often used to change how a comment or piece of text was\nevaluated by Perspective. For our study, we used the AnalyzeComment API to collect attribute\nlikelihood scores for each post from both the pre moderation policy change and post moderation\npolicy change datasets. Similarly, for each individual post we collected likelihood scores for each of\nthe 6 attributes: i) Toxicity, ii) Severe Toxicity, iii) Identity Attacks, iv) Insults, v) Profanity, and\nvi) Threats.\nFor each post, a request formulated with the text from a Parley required attributes, and the\nlanguage was sent. The response would be a list of attribute likelihood scores which were stored\nalongside the corresponding posts. While collecting the scores, English was used as the default\nlanguage for all posts since previous studies showed us that a large majority of Parler\u2019s userbase\nwas using English as their language of choice to communicate with other Parler users [6].\nPerspective\u2019s AnalyzeComment API endpoint returns attribute scores on a successful request as\nmentioned above. On an unsuccessful request, the response contains an error type, message, and\na description of the error failing the request call. While collecting attribute likelihood scores, we\nnoticed some requests resulting in these errors, and the posts were made note of. These posts were\nseparated based on error type and handled in the second stage of sending Perspective requests for\nthe attribute likelihood scores.\nChapter 6. Parley Analysis Using Persective API 24\n6.3 Perspective Score Analysis\nAfter saving these attribute likelihood scores, we performed a simple Mann-Whitney test for each\nattribute since they were not following a normal distribution. The tests were performed separately\nfor each attribute to compare their scores between pre moderation policy changes and post modera-\ntion policy changes. The tests revealed a significant difference in the distribution of all 6 attributes\n(p < 0.001), and we could reject the hypothesis that the distribution of scores is the same in both\nthe pre and post moderation policy changes. The resultant U values are shown in Table 6.1.\nTable 6.1: Mann Whitney Test for Perspective Scores\nU Pre Policy Change v/s Post Policy Change\nIdentity Attack 100,134,726,346,717\u2217\u2217\u2217\nThreat 90,420,711,260,114\u2217\u2217\u2217\nProfanity 96,825,187,118,705\u2217\u2217\u2217\nToxicity 96,825,187,118,705\u2217\u2217\u2217\nSevere Toxicity 92,914,792,700,764\u2217\u2217\u2217\nInsult 99,313,869,277,933\u2217\u2217\u2217\nNote: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001\nTable 6.2 also shows the min, max, mean and median scores for both the datasets as well as\na separate column for disappeared users who are only present in the pre policy change dataset.\nThrough this table, we can also observe that both the mean and median scores for all the attributes\narelowerpostmoderationchangewhencomparedtotheparleysfrompremoderationpolicychange.\nInterestingly, we also observe that the scores for disappeared users are the lowest on every attribute\nas well.\nTable 6.2: Perspective Score Comparision\nPre Policy Change Disappeared Post Policy Change\nMetric MinMaxMeanMedian MinMaxMeanMedian MinMaxMeanMedian\nIdentity Attack 00.990.18 0.12 00.990.11 0.06 00.990.16 0.10\nThreat 01.00.22 0.15 01.00.16 0.12 01.000.19 0.12\nProfanity 01.00.18 0.08 01.00.11 0.04 01.000.12 0.05\ntoxicity 01.00.28 0.16 01.00.16 0.07 01.000.22 0.12\nInsult 01.00.25 0.14 01.00.13 0.04 01.000.21 0.11\nsevere_toxicity 00.990.17 0.07 00.990.09 0.04 00.970.12 0.05\nChapter 6.

In these histograms, we notice that the labels toxicity 6.2b, severe toxicity 6.1d and\nprofanity 6.1c had a higher number of posts with scores above 0.65in the pre moderation policy\nchange parleys when compared to parleys from the post moderation policy change. Since Parler\u2019s\nre-entry to the Apple store required action towards posts inciting violence [36], we can conclude\nwith these scores that Parler has worked on reducing toxicity levels shared by their users.\nChapter 6.

We also noticed that a subset\nof users who have disappeared show lower toxicity scores than both the pre and post policy change\nusers. After plotting each of the attributes returned by Perspective, we notice additional evidence\nto further answer our research question. It shows that the prevalence of toxicity did decrease after\nthe moderation changes.\n27\nChapter 7\nTopics of Discussion\n7.1 Introduction\nIn this part of the study, we used textual data collected from Parleys to pick the most popular\ntopics. We were initially motivated to study this to observe the most popular topics. Using these\ntopics from each dataset, we compare them to learn about any changes in the discussion. Although\nwe aim to learn about the effectiveness of moderation techniques, we acknowledge that not all of\nthe changes in the topics might be caused due to changes in moderation. We discuss this in more\ndepth in Chapter 9. To extract the most popular topics we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA) topic modeling technique. The LDA technique builds a topic including relevant words to\nform a list of popular topics which can be studied and compared.[10]\n7.2 Methodology\nFor this phase of our analysis, we used textual data collected with Parleys from our data collection\nphase as described in chapter 4. First, we removed all the URLs as this would be analyzed later and\nalso removed any unicode characters representing emoticons. After this, we also remove stopwords\npresent in our dataset before extracting popular topics. We use a corpus of stopwords from the\nNatural Language Toolkit as a list of stopwords to remove from our data. We then use the LDA\ntechnique to extract the most popular topics discussed. Using this list of topics we construct a\nword cloud as seen in Figures 7.1a and 7.1b. .\n7.3 Word Cloud\nThe LDA technique used in the previous step highlights hidden topics that have not been developed\nyet. This allows us to compare not just the words being used but actual topics of discussion. We\nnoticed a lot of interest in the 2020 US Elections in our pre moderation policy changes. This can be\nattributed to the fact that the elections took place during the time period of pre moderation policy\nand most news and discussions about the subject were before post moderation policy parleys were\ncollected.\nChapter 7. Topics of Discussion 28\nWe also noticed a reduction in the usage of words like WWG1WGA which stands for Where We\nGo as 1, We Go as All. This term is associated with the QAnon conspiracy movement. We also\nfound several Parler specific words such as Parleys present in the earlier dataset. We theorize that\nthe cause for this might be due to users migrating from other social media platforms like Twitter\nand Facebook which do not use these terms. These new users could be talking about the Parler\nspecific terms, introducing them to other users, and learning about them themselves.\n(a)Word Cloud of Popular topics Pre Moderation Policy\nChanges\n(b)Word Cloud of Popular topics Post Moderation Policy\nChanges\nFigure 7.1: Word Cloud comparing popular topics between pre and post modera-\ntion policy changes\n7.4 Summary\nIn this section, we uncovered several topics which were widely discussed during several periods of\nParler\u2019s existence. We noticed some fringe topics being discussed on Parler which have been proven\nto have originated on other social media platforms. By visualizing the topics in a word cloud we\nalso noticed a lot of users coming to terms with Parler\u2019s terms like parleys, echoes, etc.\n29\nChapter 8\nLinks Shared in Parleys Analysis\n8.1 Extracting Links\nAfter the data collection phase, we conducted a brief manual study of the Parleys collected. While\nviewing the Parleys collected, we observed that several users were sharing links to news websites\nand other social media websites like YouTube, Twitter, and Rumble. We wanted to further examine\nthis and understand any trends, specifically aligning these trends with the rhetoric around online\ncommunities would allow a better understanding of the changes.\nTo extract links being shared to external websites from Parleys, we used every Parley in both\nthe pre moderation policy change and the post moderation policy change and check for any valid\nURLs being present. After this, we extracted only the top-level domain names from each URL\nbeing shared and add them to our set of links. We also stored the number of times each domain\nhas been shared and use it to measure the popularity of websites in each dataset.\nWe also use these top-level domains to categorize the top 130 links being shared in Table 8.2. After\nnoticing a large number of news sites being shared we decided to use the Media Bias Fact Check\nservice which labels news sites on how credible they are, country of origin, any political bias or the\npresence of conspiracy theories, questionable sources, or pro-science sources.\nChapter 8.

Links Shared in Parleys Analysis 31\nFrom Table 8.1 we can see the sharp rise in popularity of Rumble on the Parler social media\nplatform. We can also notice the decline in Twitter links being shared. These observations could\nbe explained by the sharp rise in the rhetoric surrounding censorship on Twitter and other popular\nsocial media platforms [1].\n8.2 URL Categorization\nAfter extracting links from Parleys, we noticed that we had collected 151,713 links from the pre\nmoderation policy dataset and 61,564 links from the post moderation policy dataset. Out of these,\nwe selected the top 130 links by frequency of shares to categorize into:\n\u2022News Websites: Websites that report current news events and opinion pieces from individual\njournalists. Example: CNN.com ,FoxNews.com ,TheEpochTimes.com , etc\n\u2022Social Media Websites: Websites or online platforms used by users to maintain social con-\nnections, share information, and meet new users. Example: Twitter.com ,Facebook.com , etc\n\u2022Media Hosting: Websites used to store and share media (images, videos or gifs) primarily.\nExample: giphy.com ,imgur.com , etc\n\u2022Personal Blog: Websites maintained by a single person which shares news reports about live\nevents or other articles. Most of the websites in this category were political commentary by\na known influencer. Example: bonginoreport.com ,Hannity.com , etc\n\u2022Other: We also noticed websites for online petitions, search engines, etc which were catego-\nrized under this.\nThe results of these categorization steps can be seen in Table ??\nTable 8.2: Website Categories\nCategory Pre Policy Post Policy\nNews 85 88\nSocial Media 18 17\nMedia Hosting 12 4\nPersonal Blog 8 17\nOther 6 4\nChapter 8. Links Shared in Parleys Analysis 32\n8.3 Media Bias Fact Check\nAftercategorizingsomeofthelinkscollected, wenoticedseveralnewssitesbeingsharedanddecided\nto study these links. We used the Media Bias Fact Check(MBFC) service to measure factuality,\npresence of any bias, country of origin and presence of conspiracy or pseudoscience, questionable\nsources, and pro-science sources.\nMBFC is an independent organization that uses volunteer and paid contributors to rate and store\ninformation about news websites [2]. The organization states its objective as To determine the bias\nof media and information sources and the level of overall factual reporting through a combination\nof objective measures and subjective analysis through the use of our stated methodology. . We used\na list of links shared from both of our datasets to obtain labels for:\n\u2022Factuality: Referred to as how factual a website is. Scored between 0-5 where a score of 0\nmeans that a website is not factual and a 5 is very factual. MBFC defines that for a website\nto be very factual and get a score of 5, it should pass its fact-checking test as well as make\nsure that critical information is not omitted. Failure of any of these criteria reduces their\nscore [39].\n\u2022Bias: MBFC assigns a bias rating of Extreme left, left, left-center, least biased, right-center,\nright, and extreme right. To assign a bias rating to a website, MBFC contributors check\nthe website\u2019s stance on American issues which divides left-biased websites from right-biased\nwebsites [35]. Some examples of these issues are:\n\u2013General Philosophy: Left-biased websites often view issues as a collective issue and are\ngenerally more collective in their thinking. These websites also value equality, environ-\nmental protection, social safety nets, and expanded educational opportunities. On the\nother hand, right-biased websites view issues as an individual over a community. They\nprefer a limited government with individual freedom and property rights.\n\u2013Abortion: Left-biased websites believe that abortion is legal in most cases while right-\nbiased websites support the opposite.\n\u2013Economic Policy: Left biased websites believe in income equality, higher taxes on the\nwealthy, government spending on social programs and infrastructure, and stronger reg-\nulations on business and minimum wages. On the other hand, right-biased websites\nbelieve in lower taxes, lesser regulations on businesses, reduced government spending,\nwages being set by the free market, lesser government spending, and charity over social\nnets.\nChapter 8. Links Shared in Parleys Analysis 33\n\u2013Education Policy: Left-biased websites favor lowering the cost of education and govern-\nment spending while right-biased websites favor the method of homeschooling and are\noften critical of what is taught in public schools.\n\u2013Environmental Policy: Left biased websites believe in strong environmental regulations\nand a governmental policy to reduce climate change which is man-made. Right biased\nwebsites believe that the free market should make decisions about the climate and they\nwill make the best decision compared to the government.\n\u2013GayRights: Leftbiasedwebsitessupportthelegalizationofgaymarriageandprotections\nagainst discrimination in the workplace. Right-biased websites are generally opposed\nto gay marriage and believe that some anti-discrimination laws interfere with citizen\u2019s\nfreedom of religion.\n\u2013Gun Rights: Left biased websites to favor stricter background checks and regulations for\ngun owners and banning certain high capacity weapons from preventing mass shootings.\nRight-biased websites believe that owning a gun is a constitutional right from the sec-\nond amendment and any strong regulation against owning guns is a restriction of their\nfreedom to bear arms.\n\u2013Healthcare: Leftbiasedwebsitestofavoruniversalhealthcareandbelievethathealthcare\nisahumanright. TheyalsosupporttheAffordableCareActwhileright-leaningwebsites\noppose it and believe that corporations can provide better healthcare than governmental\nprograms.\n\u2013Immigration: Left-leaning websites believe in less restrictive immigration laws, provid-\ning a pathway to citizenship and a moratorium on deporting while right-leaning websites\nbelieve in stronger borders, deporting any undocumented immigrant, and a more restric-\ntive immigration policy.\n\u2013Military: Left-leaning websites critic the government on military spending and believe\nthat it should decrease while right-leaning websites believe in increasing military spend-\ning.\n\u2013Personal Responsibility: Left-leaning websites believe in stronger laws to protect indi-\nviduals and to provide structure. Right-leaning websites on the other hand believe in\nfair competition and the government\u2019s role to hold personal responsibility accountable.\n\u2013Regulation: Left-leaning websites believe that stronger regulations need to exist to pro-\ntect consumers and the environment. Right-leaning websites believe in very relaxed\nChapter 8. Links Shared in Parleys Analysis 34\ngovernment regulations and that stronger regulations hinder the free market and de-\ncrease job growth.\n\u2013Taxes: Left-leaning websites believe in a progressing tax system and are not opposed to\nraising taxes to increase government spending while right-leaning websites are against\nincreasing taxes for governmental spending. They are also against a progressive taxing\nsystem and believe in a flat-rate tax system.\n\u2013Voted ID: Left-leaning websites believe that voter IDs are not required and that it places\nan undue burden on lower-income voters while voter fraud is virtually non-existent.\nRight-leaning websites believe that voter IDs are a significant part of a democracy and\nshould be required for all voters.\n\u2013Workers Rights: Left-leaning websites believe in unions, and governmental regulations\nfor minimum wages and support worker\u2019s rights while right-leaning websites believe that\nthe free market will force higher-profiting corporations to reward workers with higher\nwages.\n\u2022Presence of conspiracy-pseudoscience: Websites that publish unverified information related\nto known conspiracies such as the New World Order, Illuminati, False flags, aliens, anti-\nvaccine, etc. For example, sources that promote human-influenced climate change denial or\ntake anti-vaccination positions will be classified as pseudoscience [39].\n\u2022Country of origin: Manually labeled by contributor based on the founding of the website.\n\u2022Usage of questionable sources: MBFC defines this as A questionable source exhibits any of\nthe following: extreme bias, overt propaganda, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a\ncomplete lack of transparency, and/or is fake news. Fake News is the deliberate attempt to\npublish hoaxes and/or disinformation for profit or influence [39].\n\u2022Usage of pro-science sources: The website\u2019s usage of pro-science sources or facts supporting\ntheir arguments earns them a pro-science sources label.\nAfter this step, we collected labels for 7.72% and 1.77% of all links being shared on Parleys from\nthe pre and post moderation policy change dataset respectively. Using these labels, we created\nhistograms to visualize the results. At first, we noticed a decrease in the number of conspiracy-\npseudoscience news articles in Figure 8.2c. We also notice the same decrease in the usage of\nquestionable sources and pro-science in Figures 8.2e and 8.2f. We also notice that the country of\norigin for several websites is unknown in the pre moderation policy change dataset. Often times\nthese websites are obscure sites sharing news articles that are not credible. In Figure 8.2a we also\nChapter 8.

Using these labels we can come to the\nconclusion that the credibility of the URLs being shared did increase. We also record other data\nlike the bias of these websites which can be useful for future studies.\n37\nChapter 9\nLimitations & Future Work\nIn our current dataset i.e., the post-policy change dataset, we were not able to collect a random\nsample of users, hence our analysis might not yield a full-scale impact of the moderation policy\nchange. The other limitation of our work is that users might have changed their usernames when\nParler was reinstated back online, as to evade possible detection. We also found that MBFC\nuses the American definition of the key issues, however, we found about 5% of the links that\nwere originating from the UK, hence MBFC might not have given the full analysis for these links.\nAnother limitation of our study is that users could have changed their profiles to private. We also\ndid not run any analysis for the comments on these posts. Comments can also shed light on the\nmoderation changes that Parler undertook.\nThedecisiontousethePerspectiveAPItoanswertheresearchquestion RQ# 1: Has the prevalence\nof hateful and toxic content decreased was based on the merits of their service such as i) Perspective\nopen sources their methodology and ii) Perspective actively updates their dictionaries to match\ncurrent lingo being used on social media platforms. The continuous update, while helping us stay\ninformed would not be an accurate assessment of words used in the past. For example, A word\nused in a Parley from 2018 could have a different connotation or meaning now when compared\nto its original usage. This brings about only a minor limitation since Parler is a relatively young\nsocial media platform(founded in 2018) and hence contains texts with words whose connotations\nand meanings haven\u2019t vastly changed since.\nWhile answering our RQ #2: Have the topics of discussion changed? If so what are the changes?\nwe use word clouds to show popular topics over a period of time consisting of the US Presidential\nElection along with other key events in the US Political field. Some of these events could have\nled to a change in the popularity of a specific topic. We have also noticed that such events divide\nusers and bring about several toxic traits which are not usually seen. Due to these observations,\ncomparing popular topics between pre and post moderation policy changes can be unreliable.\nIn the future, we plan to obtain a random sample of the users after Parler was reinstated back\nonline. We assume that this will shed even better light on the effectiveness of the moderation\nChapter 9. Limitations & Future Work 38\nchange. We also plan on comparing the users based on gender, to understand if either of the\ngenders is more active on parler after the moderation changes, compared to the pre-policy change\ndataset. We also plan to sort the perspective scores into two sets, one below 0.5 and one above 0.5\nfor all the attributes, in both the pre and post policy change dataset, to understand what topics\nwere getting more toxic and what topics were less toxic. We also plan on doing a more thorough\nanalysis to find the exact countries that we could not find and labeled them as unknown . We\nalso plan to study the user comments on posts to understand if the moderation changes are being\nreflected in the comments also.\n39\nChapter 10\nConclusion\nOnJanuary12, 2021, Parlerasocialmediaplatformpopularamongconservativeuserswasremoved\nfrom the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Amazon Web Services, Parler\u2019s cloud\npartner also stopped hosting Parler content shortly after. This was blamed on Parler\u2019s refusal\nto remove posts inciting violence following the 2021 US Capitol Riots. Several studies published\nframeworks and methodology for scraping Parler data using their open API before Parler went\noffline. Parler was eventually allowed back after they promised that they will strengthen their\nmoderation to remove hateful content. Our study looks into the effect of these policy changes on\nthe user discourse in the pre policy dataset that was collected is published in previous studies, and\nthe post policy dataset, that we collected by first establishing a new framework to collect posts\nand user information from Parler.\nInitially, Parler\u2019s open API service was leveraged to collect a large number of parleys and user\ninformation by studies like Aliapoulios et al. [5]. The current study, using the newer version of\nParler\u2019s API, collects a similar dataset to compare the changes in moderation policies. Using obser-\nvations from this study we aim to help social media platforms make informed decisions on content\nmoderation policies. We also hope to study how effective these content moderation techniques are\non curbing harassment, hate speech, and the spread of misinformation and disinformation. Social\nmedia platforms can benefit from this because content moderation is widely used to grow their\nuserbase and actively encourage newer users to join their platform.\nOur study wanted to answer three main research questions:\n\u2022RQ #1: Has the prevalence of hateful and toxic content decreased? Our study explores this\nquestion to study the effectiveness of the content moderation techniques and compare them\nfrom the pre and post moderation policy posts.\n\u2022RQ #2: Have the topics of discussion changed? If so what are the changes? This question\nwould also help understand the impact of moderation change on user behavior.\nChapter 10. Conclusion 40\n\u2022RQ #3: Is there any difference in the credibility of news sources being shared between pre\nand post moderation policy changes? After manually glancing at some posts we noticed a\nlarge number of links to news websites being shared. Therefore, we decided to study these\nlinks and find any differences in the credibility of the news sources being shared.\nUsing Google\u2019s Perspective API in section 6, we look into answering RQ #1. We notice a decrease\nin trend in the toxicity of Parleys being posted post moderation policy changes. Using this trend\nwe can conclude that yes the prevalence of hateful and toxic content did decrease after moderation\ntechniques were changed on Parler.\nFrom our data collection phase, we used the Parleys collected, and in section 7 use this data along\nwith the LDA topic modeling technique to observe any changes in the topics of discussion. We\nobserveseveralchanges, mostlyduetothenatureoftheeventsoccurringduringthetimeofposting.\nWe observe a decrease in some conspiracy theory rhetoric talked about in section 7.\nTo answer our RQ #3we used the MBFC service which manually labels websites to score their\ncredibility along with certain other labels. We noticed a decrease in the presence of conspiracy\npseudoscience as well as questionable sources. We also notice an increase in the factuality as\nwell as pro-science sources which suggest that the credibility of the news sites being shared has\nincreased.\n41\nBibliography\n[1] Emily A.

Following an invite-only phase, it officially opened to the\npublic on February 6th, 2024, leading to a significant expansion of its user\nbase. In this paper, we present a longitudinal analysis of user activity in\nthe two months surrounding its public launch, examining how the platform\nevolved due to this rapid growth. Our analysis reveals that Bluesky exhibits\nan activity distribution comparable to more established social platforms, yet\nit features a higher volume of original content relative to reshared posts and\nmaintains low toxicity levels. We further investigate the political leanings of\nits user base, misinformation dynamics, and engagement in harmful conversa-\ntions. Our findings indicate that Bluesky users predominantly lean left polit-\nically and tend to share high-credibility sources. After the platform\u2019s public\nlaunch, an influx of new users\u2014particularly those posting in English and\nJapanese\u2014contributed to a surge in activity. Among them, several accounts\ndisplayed suspicious behaviors, such as mass-following users and sharing con-\ntent from low-credibility news sources. Some of these accounts have already\nbeen flagged as spam or suspended, suggesting that Bluesky\u2019s moderation\nefforts have been effective.\nKeywords: Bluesky, decentralization, online social media, misinformation\nEmail address: gianluca.nogara@supsi.ch (Gianluca Nogara)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier May 6, 2025arXiv:2505.02317v1  [cs.SI]  5 May 2025\n1. Introduction\nDecentralized social media platforms have emerged as alternatives to tra-\nditional, centralized networks, offering users greater control over their data,\ncontent moderation, and online interactions. Unlike mainstream platforms,\nwhich rely on centralized governance and proprietary algorithms, decentral-\nized platforms distribute authority across independent servers or protocols,\nreducing single points of failure and promoting transparency [1, 2, 3, 4].\nBluesky Social1is a novel decentralized social media platform for mi-\ncroblogging based in the United States. Founded by Jack Dorsey as a\nTwitter-like alternative, Bluesky aims to provide a more open and user-\ncontrolled social networking experience. Originally based on an invite-only\nsubscription, the platform officially opened to the public on February 6th,\n2024 [5]. With only a few thousand users active in January 2024, the platform\nregistered more than one million new users on the first day of its opening [6].\nRecent events, such as the banning of X/Twitter in Brazil and the 2024 U.S.\npresidential election, have contributed to a surge in new users on Bluesky,\nparticularly among those who have grown distrustful of X and are seeking an\nalternative platform for political discussions and online discourse [7, 8, 9]. As\na result, Bluesky has attracted millions of new users, solidifying its position\nas a viable alternative to mainstream platforms [10].\nAs decentralized platforms like Bluesky gain traction, they present new\nopportunities and challenges in online social dynamics, user behavior, and\nmoderation strategies. On the one hand, they empower users with greater\ncontrol over their online interactions, reduce reliance on centralized author-\nities, and promote transparency in content moderation [4]. On the other\nhand, the decentralized nature of these platforms raises concerns about the\neffectiveness of moderation, the spread of misinformation, and the potential\nfor fragmented online communities with varying moderation standards [11].\nHere, building upon the preliminary findings of our previous work [12],\nwe conduct a comprehensive analysis of user activity on Bluesky following\nits public launch on February 6th, 2024. Specifically, we examine key char-\nacteristics of the platform, including temporal patterns of user engagement,\nthe prevalence of different languages, and the structural properties of the\nfollower network. We then investigate the estimated political leanings of\nBluesky users and their relationship with sharing information from sources\n1https://bsky.social/about\n2\nof varying reliability and participation in harmful conversations. Lastly, we\nanalyze the largest communities on the platform and assess the extent and\neffectiveness of content moderation measures implemented during Bluesky\u2019s\ninitial months of global availability. This work expands on our preliminary\nreport [12] by adding an analysis of source credibility, examining the trend of\nhigh and low credibility sources along the timeline, and extending the study\nof toxicity from English and Japanese to other languages in the data. We also\nbuild a resharing network by linking users who shared posts, which allows\nus to analyze communities based on the characteristics of the users. Finally,\nwe leverage user status information to analyze how many users have been\nmoderated by the platform or are no longer present.\n2. Related work\nDistributed social networks aim for decentralization, allowing users to\nhave more control and privacy. Early efforts like LifeSocial.KOM [13] and\nPeerSON [14] were based on the peer-to-peer model but faced challenges in\nperformance and reliability. This led to a shift toward server-based federated\nmodels like Mastodon [2, 3]. This approach balances flexibility and ease of\nuse while maintaining some decentralization [1].\nMastodon, created in 2016, is a free and open-source social media platform\nthat allows users to create their own servers (\u201cinstances\u201d) and connect with\nothers across the globe. It is a decentralized social network, meaning that it\nis not owned by a single entity, but rather a network of independent servers\nthat are connected together. A number of studies have identified striking\nfeatures that make up Mastodon\u2019s distinct \u201cfingerprint,\u201d distinguishing it\nfrom better-known online social networks [15, 1]. Mastodon has, however,\nsuffered from some natural pressures towards centralization, which can lead\nto potential points of failure [2].\nTo overcome this weakness, Bluesky developed its own decentralized AT\nprotocol. Scalability, security, and ease of use make it an attractive option for\nbuilding open and decentralized social media applications that prioritize user\nprivacy and data security [4]. Using standard web technologies and re-using\nexisting data models from the Web 3.0 protocol family also contribute to its\nefficiency and reliability [16]. Additionally, its federated networking model\nbolsters security by dispersing data across numerous servers, mitigating the\nrisk of a single point of failure [2].\n3\nExisting literature on Bluesky primarily focuses on general platform anal-\nysis, highlighting its features and overall structure. Several studies have\ndelved into the political dynamics and polarization within social networks,\nfocusing on user activity patterns and interactions [17]. These analyses re-\nveal how user interactions often lead to the formation of ideological group-\nings, which can evolve into echo chambers. Additionally, the impact of these\ndynamics on political division within decentralized social networks has been\nthoroughly examined. Other research has explored the platform\u2019s federated\nmodel [18], which allows users to curate their own experiences through cus-\ntomizable user feeds while maintaining interoperability between instances.\nAdditional studies have focused on content analysis and user activities [19].\nThey have identified trends in user engagement and content virality, such as\nthe types of posts that gain traction and the role of influencers in shaping\ndiscussions, highlighting differences from traditional centralized platforms.\nFinally, interactions were collected at the millisecond level by creating a\nmulti-network temporal dataset [20] in order to perform an analysis of com-\nplex temporal dynamics such as community formation and social sanction\npatterns, i.e., user blocking.\nDifferently from previous work, our work focus on the evolution of the\nplatform during its opening to the public to see if this has led to substantial\nchanges in users or activities. Before the opening, the platform\u2019s controlled\naccess reduced the risk of unauthorized or harmful usage. To study how this\nchanged after the opening, we conducted an extensive longitudinal study of\nusers and their activities before and after the opening.\n3. Methods\n3.1. Data collection\nWe collected data using Bluesky\u2019s free and publicly available Firehose\nendpoint, which grants developers real-time access to platform activities such\nas user posts, follows, and likes [21, 22]. This endpoint ensures uninterrupted\ndata collection by allowing reconnection and retrieval of up to 72 hours of\npast data in case of disruptions, ensuring comprehensive coverage during the\nobservation period.\nWe employed the dart library from the AT protocol [23], leveraging the\nFirehose endpoint2[24]. This data collection process was performed through\n2https://atprotodart.com/docs/lexicons/com/atproto/sync/subscriberepos/\n4\nFigure 1: Bar chart summarizing key dataset statistics over the whole observation pe-\nriod: total posts, posts containing links, active users, shared messages (with links), follow\nactions, and block actions. Values are presented on a logarithmic scale due to different\norders of magnitude.\nthe use of an existing open-source project [25]. The process is both straight-\nforward and flexible, as the AT protocol does not require user authentication\nfor access.\nBluesky enables the tracking of various user activities on the platform.\nOur analysis focuses on key actions: posts, replies, reposts, follows, and\nblocks, which constitute the primary forms of user interaction and commu-\nnication. Users follow others to stay updated, create posts to share content,\nrepost content from others, reply to engage in discussions and block users to\nprevents another users from interacting with them.\nWhile Bluesky\u2019s terms of service do not impose privacy restrictions on\ndata collection, we strictly collect only publicly available user information,\nposts, and associated metadata in accordance with its Privacy Policy.3We\ndo not publicly release the collected data and provide only anonymized in-\nformation in this paper, except for select prominent accounts discussed in\n\u00a74.7.\nFig. 1 presents key statistics of our dataset, collected over a 56-day pe-\nriod from January 9 to March 4, 2024 and encompassing 114 million user\n3https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy\n5\nactivities, including posting activities as well as follow and block actions. To\nanalyze the language distribution in shared content, we first removed irrele-\nvant content (e.g., URLs, emojis, etc.) and then applied a language classifier\nusing the langdetect4NLP library.\n3.2. News source labeling\nTo evaluate the reliability of news outlets shared on Bluesky, we label web\ndomains using NewsGuard5ratings, following a well-established approach in\nthe literature [26, 27, 28]. NewsGuard is a reputable, independent organi-\nzation that employs experts to assess news sources based on criteria such\nas transparency, accountability, adherence to journalistic standards, and er-\nror correction. Its ratings range from 0 (highly unreliable) to 100 (highly\nreliable), providing a standardized measure of news source credibility. Fol-\nlowing prior work [29, 30, 31], we classify news outlets with a NewsGuard\nrating of 30 or lower as low-credibility , and those with a rating higher than\n60 as mainstream news sources.\nWe also leveraged political bias ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check\n(MBFC),6an independent organization that evaluates news media sources,\nto classify the political leaning of news websites shared on Bluesky. Sources\nare categorized along a seven-point political spectrum: Extreme Left (-3),\nLeft (-2), Left-Center (-1), Least Biased (0), Right-Center (1), Right (2),\nand Extreme Right (3). We compute the political leaning score of a user by\naveraging the leaning of the sources shared by that user across their posts,\nfollowing previous work [32].\nApproximately 6.2 million posts (8.7% of all posts) contained a URL.\nAmong these, we rated about one million posts using NewsGuard scores,\nrepresenting 16% of posts sharing URLs, and approximately 850k posts with\nMBFC political ratings, representing 13.6% of posts containing URLs.\n3.3. Community detection\nTo study user communities and interactions, we build a directed, weighted\nnetwork based on user reshare activities. Users are represented as nodes and\nan edge ( i\u2192j, w) represents user jresharing content by user i wtimes. We\napply the Louvain community detection algorithm [33] to the undirected,\n4https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/\n5https://www.newsguardtech.com/\n6https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\n6\nFigure 2: Online activity on Bluesky before and after the public opening (Feb. 6th),\nindicated by the dashed line.\nunweighted version of this graph, obtaining 14,381 different communities.\nWe studied the five largest communities, which represent 87% of users in\nour data. To gain a deeper understanding of the discussions within each\ncommunity, we manually examined both users and the content they shared.\nFor each community, we selected a sample of 30 users that included both\nrandomly chosen members and those with the highest sum of in- and out-\ndegree. We analyzed the posts shared by these users and, when possible,\ninspected their active profiles on the Bluesky web interface to observe their\nmost recent activity and interactions.\n4. Results\n4.1. Temporal patterns of online activity\nAs shown in Fig. 1, original posts are the most common user activity on\nthe platform, suggesting that users prefer creating new content over resharing\nor interacting with existing posts. This trend may be driven by the platform\u2019s\nrapid user-base expansion and it contrasts with existing centralized social\nmedia platforms, such as Twitter/X, where resharing via retweets is more\nprevalent [34, 35].\nFig. 2A presents the daily number of unique active users along with follow\nand block actions. The platform\u2019s public opening on February 6th (dashed\nline) triggered sharp spikes in activity, peaking at one million active users and\n7\nover 7 million follow actions the next day. These surges represent a nearly six-\nfold increase in active users and a 35-fold increase in follow actions compared\nto the previous day. Both trends declined rapidly in the following days,\neventually stabilizing at slightly higher levels than those observed before the\nopening, likely reflecting the waning initial excitement around the platform.\nThe rise in users and follow actions was accompanied by a 3.6-fold surge\nin blocking activity, increasing from 33,269 to 120,054 instances. Blocking\nactivity stabilized after a few days but remained slightly elevated compared to\npre-February 6 levels. During the observation period, 287,539 users blocked\na total of 758,681 accounts, accounting for 2.7 block actions received per user\non average. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of blocking behavior,\nwith some users blocking a disproportionately large number of accounts, the\nmean number of accounts blocked per user was higher (9.5).\nFig. 2B depicts the volume of shared posts over time, categorizing user\nactivities into original posts, replies, and reposts. As previously noted in\nFig. 1, original posts are the most prevalent form of shared activity, a trend\nthat becomes even more pronounced following the platform\u2019s public launch.\nAs expected, the platform\u2019s opening on February 6th triggered a sharp\nincrease in shared content across all types of posts, driven by the influx of new\nusers. The volume of original posts surged 4.3-fold, from 362k on February\n5th to 1.5M the next day. Reposts and replies also saw substantial growth,\nrising from 262,201 and 297,717 to 990,835 and 656,063, respectively. Despite\nthese initial spikes, posting activity rapidly declined in the following days.\n4.2. Prevalence of different languages\nFig. 3A shows the trends of the top five languages used throughout the\nobservation period. Japanese posts surged immediately after the platform\u2019s\nopening, becoming the most used language. In contrast, content in other lan-\nguages, including English, remained relatively stable, exhibiting only minor\nfluctuations following the opening.\nFig. 3B shows the prevalence of the top 10 languages in user posts, high-\nlighting the dominance of English and Japanese, which together account for\nmore than two-thirds of all content. The share of English content declined\nfrom 43% to 30% following the platform\u2019s opening, while Japanese content\nincreased from 14% to 44% over the same period.\n8\nFigure 3: (A)Trend of 5 top languages on Bluesky during the observation period.

Changes in the follower network\nSimilarly to what we did for the reshare network, we build another net-\nwork using the follow actions in the dataset. In this network, a directed\nedge ( i\u2192j) represents user ifollowing user j. The sharp increase in follow\nactivities after the public launch, shown in Fig. 2, is reflected in various fol-\nlower network statistics measured before and after the platform\u2019s opening,\nas detailed in Table 1.\nWhile the density of the follower network slightly decreased post-opening,\nthe size of the strongly connected component more than tripled, and the\naverage degree more than doubled. This suggests that Bluesky users tend\nto follow more accounts after the opening. The out-degree distributions in\nFig. 4A further confirm this trend.\n9\nFigure 4: Complementary cumulative distributions of node (A) out-degree and (B) in-\ndegree in the follower network.\nThe average number of followers per user increased from 9.6 before Febru-\nary 6th to 20.3 after, while the median rose from 3.0 to 4.0. Similarly, the\naverage number of accounts followed increased from 7.4 to 14.9, with the\nmedian rising from 2.0 to 4.0. Fig. 4 plots the distributions of out-degree\n(number of follow actions) and in-degree (number of followers). The ten\naccounts that gained the most followers and the ten accounts that followed\nthe most users before and after the opening of the platform are presented in\nTable 2.\nThis analysis suggests potential spamming or automated behavior, as\nsome accounts followed an unusually large number of users immediately after\njoining Bluesky (Fig. 4A). The crossover in the tails of the out-degree CCDF\ncurves (just before out-degree 105) results from the uneven distribution of\nfollow activities and the disparity in the number of users before and after the\nplatform\u2019s opening. Notably, in each period, a single outlier user performed\nan exceptionally high number of follow actions \u2014 50,570 before and 167,220\nafter, approximately 2\u20133 times the number of actions of other users listed\nin Table 2. Since the number of users performing follow actions before the\nopening is about one-third of those after (see Table 1), the probability in the\nCCDF tail is higher for the earlier group. When these two outlier users are\nremoved, the crossover between the CCDF curves disappears.\nAmong the users who gained the most followers (Table 2), several re-\nmained consistent across both periods, with the majority being news outlets\nsuch as The Washington Post ,The New York Times , and Bloomberg . This\n10\nTable 2: Annotated list of the ten users with the most new followers and the ten users who\nperformed most follow activities before and after the platform\u2019s opening.

Despite this trend,\nthree new Japanese accounts entered the top ten following the platform\u2019s\npublic launch, with one rising to second place\u2014surpassed only by the official\nBluesky account.\nBefore the platform\u2019s opening, the users who followed the most new ac-\ncounts were primarily English-language accounts and appeared to engage\nin normal activity, with the exception of one user who was suspended by\nBluesky. After the opening, however, the composition of these users changed\nsignificantly: half were Japanese, two accounts were deleted, one was sus-\npended, and two were flagged as spammers by Bluesky. Unlike the overall\nnetwork behavior, these users were more engaged in reposting activities than\nin creating original posts.\n4.4. Political leaning of Bluesky users\nFig. 5 presents the distribution of estimated political alignment among\nactive Bluesky users, defined as those who shared at least five posts linking\nto rated websites. Each user\u2019s political alignment is determined by averaging\nthe political bias scores of the websites they shared during the observation\nperiod (see \u00a73.2). We can observe that the distribution is skewed towards\nliberal leaning, consistent with previous findings reported for Twitter before\n11\nFigure 5: Distribution of the average political leaning score of users that shared at least 5\nlinks to rated domains.\nMusk\u2019s acquisition.7We present the distribution of political leanings com-\nputed over the entire observation period, as no significant differences were\ndetected before and after the platform\u2019s opening (Mann-Whitney U test,\np= 0.05).\nWe determine each user\u2019s political leaning based on the average bias score\nof their posts. In this analysis, we make the simplifying assumption that a\nnegative bias score indicates a left-leaning, a score of zero indicates a cen-\ntrist, and a positive score indicates a right-leaning, acknowledging that this\nthresholding is inherently arbitrary. The analysis revealed that the major-\nity of active users on the platform are classified as left-leaning (bias score\n<0), accounting for 74 .61% of the sample. In contrast, 18 .17% of users\nare categorized as centrist (bias score = 0), and only 7 .21% are identified\nas right-leaning (bias score >0). Accordingly, we report the distribution\nover the entire observation period, as the comparison between the pre- and\n7https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-use\nrs/\n12\nFigure 6: Moving average (7-day) of the percentage of high credibility and low-credibility\ndomains shared by users. (A)Percentage of posts sharing links to high-credibility domains,\ni.e., NewsGuard ratings \u226560.(B) Percentage of posts sharing links to low-credibility\ndomains, i.e., NewsGuard ratings \u226430\npost-opening phases of the platform did not yield a significant difference.\n4.5. Credibility of information shared on Bluesky\nOverall, the prevalence of low-credibility content shared on Bluesky dur-\ning the period of analysis is negligible, comprising only 0.08% of all posts.\nSimilarly, the proportion of users who shared at least one link to low-credibility\nsources is very small, accounting for just 0.13% of all users.\nFig. 6 presents the daily proportion of posts sharing links to high- and\nlow-credibility websites. We observe a noticeable decline in the share of\nhigh-credibility domains after the platform\u2019s public opening, whereas the\nproportion of low-credibility domains remains relatively stable throughout\nthe observation period. Despite these trends, high-credibility domains are\nshared 125 times more frequently than low-credibility ones on an average\nday. The median daily share rate is approximately 10% for high-credibility\ndomains, compared to just 0.08% for low-credibility domains.\nFigure 7 presents the most frequently shared low- and high-credibility\nwebsites throughout the entire observation period. The composition of low-\ncredibility domains remained largely consistent before and after Bluesky\u2019s\npublic opening, with one notable exception: wsws.org , a far-left socialist\nsite known for publishing disputed claims, which saw its share decrease by\nhalf compared to pre-opening levels. However, this decline is not due to\na reduction in the actual sharing of this domain but rather to the overall\nincrease in the sharing of all domains. As expected, many of these low-\ncredibility sources are news agencies that have been previously accused of\n13\nFigure 7: Most shared (A) high-credibility and (B) low-credibility websites during the\nperiod of analysis.\nspreading disinformation [36]. Regarding high-credibility domains, a signifi-\ncant observation is the presence of German news agencies\u2014e.g., spiegel.de\nandtaz.de \u2014alongside English-language sources, such as nytimes.com , and\ntheguardian.com . This suggests that German users may be more active\non Bluesky compared to other social networks, potentially reflecting regional\ndifferences in platform adoption.\nConsistent with findings reported for other social media platforms [37,\n38, 31, 39], we observe evidence of so-called \u201dsuperspreaders,\u201d i.e., a small\nsubset of users responsible for the majority of unreliable content shared on\nBluesky. Specifically, we find that ten accounts (1.8% of all users who shared\nlow-credibility content) were responsible for disseminating 62% of links to\nlow-credibility sources.\n4.6. Toxicity of Bluesky conversations\nWe analyzed the toxicity of online conversations on Bluesky using Detox-\nify [40], a model used to detect toxic comments, focusing on the languages\nsupported by the model (English, Italian, French, Russian, Portuguese, Span-\nish, and Turkish). We present results for the entire observation period, as\nno significant temporal variations were detected in toxicity after the public\nopening.\nWhile the the distributions of toxicity scores are different across different\nlanguages ( p <0.05 according to a Kruskal-Wallis test), Fig. 8A shows that\nonly a small fraction of posts exhibit concerning levels of toxicity in all cases.\nThe same pattern holds for user toxicity, computed by averaging the toxicity\nscores of all posts each user shared, as shown in Fig. 8B. In this analysis we\ndid not use a threshold, but results are similar when we eliminate users with\n14\nFigure 8: Toxicity of Bluesky posts. (A)Density distribution of toxicity for the different\nlanguages. The color assignment is indicated in the companion figure. (B)Distributions\nof the percentages of posts containing toxic content per user, by language.\nonly one post (less than 7%).\nAfter a Bonferroni correction, we collected the pairs of languages with sig-\nnificant differences in toxicity per user ( p <0.05): English (EN) differs from\nSpanish (ES), Russian (RU), Italian (IT), and French (FR); and Portuguese\n(PT) differs from Spanish (ES), Russian (RU), Italian (IT), and French (FR).\n4.7. Interplay between misinformation, political leaning, and toxicity\nWe further examined the interplay between misinformation, political lean-\ning, and toxicity for Bluesky users over the entire period of analysis. To\nexplore whether these factors varied with users\u2019 activity levels\u2014for exam-\nple, whether more active users were more likely to share toxic or mislead-\ning content\u2014we divided users into categories based on how frequently they\nposted. Users who posted between one and nine times were considered low\nactivity , those with 10 to 99 posts were classified as high activity , and users\nwith 100 or more posts were classified into a hyper activity group.\nAs shown in Fig. 9A, we observe that extreme users, on the left and\nthe right side of the political spectrum, are associated with a lower quality\nof shared information (computed as the average rating of all the links they\nshared) compared to other users. We do not find significant differences be-\ntween the three classes of users (low, high, and hyper active users), indicating\nthat these patterns hold regardless the number of user posts.\n15\nFigure 9: Interplay between metrics by user activity levels. The error bars represent the\nstandard deviation. (A) Relationship between political bias and reliability, (B)between\npolitical bias and toxicity, and (C)between reliability and toxicity. The NewsGuard rating\nin the panel (C) is depicted only from 50 to 100 (even if NewsGuard rating goes from 0\nto 100) as no ratings below 53 were present.\nFig. 9B illustrates the correlation between toxic behavior and political\nleaning. We observe that left-leaning users exhibit higher toxicity levels\nthan center or right-leaning users, which may be attributed to their greater\npresence on the platform. This behavior is particularly pronounced among\nmore active users.\nFinally, as shown in Fig. 9C, we do not observe significant patterns in\nthe relationship between toxic behavior and misinformation sharing on the\nplatform.\n4.8. Analysis of communities\nWe now explore the five largest reposting communities identified using\nLouvain\u2019s algorithm (see \u00a73.3 for details). These communities are numbered\nby size, with community 1 being the largest and community 5 the smallest.\nThey are relatively homogeneous, organized primarily by language groups\nand type of content shared. Table 3 shows the percentages of users in each\ncommunity.\nThrough a manual review of hashtags, linked domains, and images (see\n\u00a73.3 for details), we found that much of the content circulating within these\ncommunities is related to artistic and cartoon themes. A strong Japanese-\nlanguage presence is evident in the dataset, particularly within community\n1, which is characterized by apolitical, artistic, and explicit content. Similar\nthemes appear in communities 3 and 4, which also share English-language\nartistic material, though community 4 is more explicit in tone and subject\n16\nTable 3: Annotated list of the five largest user-level communities with the respective\npercentages of users in the dataset, the dominant language of the community, and a brief\ndescription of the content shared by their users.\nCommunity % of users Language Description\n1 35.5 Ja explicit art cartoons\n2 19.7 En democrats\n3 13.7 En art cartoons\n4 10.4 En explicit art cartoons\n5 7.5 De democrats\nFigure 10: User-level community analysis.

In contrast, communities 2 and 5 are politically focused, with English\nand German as their dominant languages respectively. Reviewing shared\ndomains within these communities reveals that both exhibit a left-leaning\npolitical orientation.\nAs shown in Fig. 10A, we computed the distributions of toxic messages\nshared on average by users across different communities. We used a toxicity\nscore threshold of 0.5 to define a toxic text [41, 42]. The analysis of the dis-\ntributions indicates that communities 2 and 4 exhibit a higher proportion of\nusers engaging in the dissemination of toxic messages, with median values of\n3.7% and 3.5% toxic content per user, respectively. In contrast, community\n3 demonstrates lower levels of toxicity, characterized by a median value of\n1.0%. Users within communities 1 and 5 display minimal to negligible toxic\nbehavior relative to other communities, both presenting a median toxicity\n17\nlevel of 0.0%. While the toxicity does not vary by community topic, it does\nvary by language, with English having a higher level of toxicity than German\nand Japanese. Kruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni correction reveal statis-\ntically significant differences ( p <0.001) among all community pairs except\nfor between communities 2 and 4.\nWe also analyzed the distribution of political leanings among users in\ndifferent communities. As shown in Fig. 10B, the overall political orientation\nskews left, with community medians clustering between -0.67 and -1, in line\nwith the general Bluesky population.\n4.9. Content moderation\nWe further examined moderation on the platform by analyzing the status\nof user accounts. To do this, we used the getProfiles endpoint,8which\nprovides information about user profiles, including their status.\nA user\u2019s account status varies depending on their standing on the plat-\nform. Active accounts return a status of Online , while deleted accounts\nreturn InvalidRequest , indicating that the profile was likely canceled by the\nuser. Moderated accounts produce one of two responses\u2014 AccountDeactivated\norAccountTakedown \u2014both signaling a policy violation. The former typically\nindicates a temporary enforcement action, while the latter reflects a more\npermanent removal.\nAs of November 2024, most users in our dataset (95.9%) remained active.\nIn contrast, 3.6% of accounts had been deleted, 0.4% were temporarily deac-\ntivated, and 0.1% had been permanently removed\u2014indicating that 0.5% of\nusers had been subject to platform moderation.\nTo understand the reasons for user moderation, we analyzed the extent\nto which users in each of these groups shared toxic and low-credibility con-\ntent. Fig. 11A suggests that moderation was done against users who violated\nthe terms of service, as users who shared links from low-credibility sources\nremain. Similarly, in the case of toxicity, the moderated categories do not\nexhibit different behavior from other users, as shown in Fig. 11B, likely be-\ncause toxicity is not officially mentioned in the community guidelines [43].\nKruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni correction were performed on the cate-\ngory of account according to toxicity and misinformation per user. The tests\nreveal statistically significant differences ( p <0.001) between all categories\n8https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-actor-get-profiles\n18\nFigure 11: Analysis of user status categories.

Discussion\nIn this study, we provided the first large-scale analysis of how Bluesky\u2019s\ntransition from an invite-only platform to a publicly accessible one affected\nuser activity and network structure. Our findings reveal that while Bluesky\nexhibits a broad distribution of activity similar to more established social\nmedia platforms, it stands out due to a higher volume of original content\ncompared to reshared posts and low levels of toxicity. After the public open-\ning, Bluesky experienced a surge in new activity. The influx of Japanese\nusers is an intriguing trend that warrants further investigation, as it may\nindicate that Bluesky\u2019s conversational dynamics are particularly appealing\nto this demographic.\nWe uncovered evidence of suspicious user behavior, including accounts\nthat followed large numbers of users and shared content from low-credibility\nnews outlets. A small subset of users was responsible for the majority of\nunreliable content shared, a pattern previously observed on other platforms\nlike Twitter/X. Following the platform\u2019s public opening, some of the most\naggressive account followers were flagged as spam or even deleted or sus-\npended, suggesting attempts to misuse the platform. The fact that some of\nthese suspicious actors were swiftly banned or labeled as spam indicates that\ncontent moderation mechanisms are actively functioning on Bluesky. Our\nanalysis of account statuses further reveals that only 0.5% of users have been\nmoderated, while 3.6% are no longer on the platform, leaving 95.9% of users\n19\nactive [44].\nWe examined the reshare network, identifying that the five largest com-\nmunities accounted for 87% of users. Our findings suggest that English-\nspeaking communities exhibit higher levels of toxicity compared to other\nlanguage-based communities, though overall, toxicity levels remained rela-\ntively stable across different languages. We also confirmed that Bluesky users\nlean predominantly left-wing politically, as indicated by the classification of\nshared domains and the political orientation of the largest communities.\nOur findings have several important implications for understanding de-\ncentralized social media dynamics and content moderation. The relatively\nlow levels of toxicity on Bluesky, combined with its high proportion of original\ncontent, suggest that decentralized platforms may foster a different type of\nuser engagement compared to centralized counterparts. However, the emer-\ngence of suspicious activity, including users sharing low-credibility informa-\ntion and engaging in mass-following behaviors, indicates that Bluesky is not\nimmune to manipulation attempts. The platform\u2019s ongoing moderation ef-\nforts, which have already flagged or removed some misbehaving accounts,\nhighlight both the challenges and potential effectiveness of content gover-\nnance in decentralized environments.\nThe left-leaning political orientation of Bluesky\u2019s user base raises ques-\ntions about ideological fragmentation and the extent to which decentralized\nplatforms may cater to specific political communities. The significant influx\nof Japanese users also suggests that Bluesky may be attracting geographically\nand linguistically distinct user groups, which could influence the platform\u2019s\nfuture development and community structure.\nThis study has several limitations. First, our analysis covers a relatively\nshort period (56 days), during which the platform underwent a significant\ntransformation as it opened to the public. As a result, our findings capture\nearly trends that may continue to evolve over time. Second, approximately\n8% of reposts could not be traced back to their original posts due to the con-\nstraints of our data collection period. Third, the credibility and political bias\nscores we used were available only for a subset of websites, limiting the scope\nof our misinformation analysis. Finally, our toxicity analysis was restricted to\nlanguages supported by Detoxify\u2014namely English, Spanish, French, Italian,\nPortuguese, Russian, and Turkish\u2014leaving out other languages that may\nhave distinct toxicity patterns.\nFuture research should extend the analysis over a longer period to assess\nthe long-term evolution of Bluesky\u2019s user behavior, content sharing patterns,\n20\nand moderation effectiveness. A deeper investigation into the rise of Japanese\nusers on the platform could provide insights into regional adoption patterns\nof decentralized social media. In addition, the slopes of the two degree dis-\ntributions should be compared so as to check for any decreases in slope, thus\nindicating the emergence of larger hubs. Further studies should also explore\ncontent moderation approaches in decentralized networks, comparing their\neffectiveness against those of centralized platforms. Additionally, expanding\ntoxicity and misinformation analysis to a broader range of languages could\noffer a more comprehensive understanding of harmful content dynamics in\nmultilingual decentralized spaces. Finally, the network analysis could be\nextended to study block actions among users.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the Swiss National Science Foun-\ndation (grant number CRSII5 209250) and the Italian Ministry of Education\n(PRIN PNRR grant CODE prot.

Introduction\n\u201cThe most important thing in communication is hearing what isn\u2019t said.\u201d\n\u2014 Peter Drucker\nIntent refers to the purpose or goal behind an action (Bratman, 1984), which involves the mental state\nof aiming to achieve a specific outcome (Bratman, 2009). In various aspects, such as law, psychology,\nand artificial intelligence, understanding intent helps interpret actions and predict future behavior accu-\nrately (Anscombe, 2000). Recent research has focused on intent in interpersonal communication (Mittal\net al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024a), human-machine communication (Weld et al., 2022), individual consump-\ntion (Chen et al., 2022), and pragmatic language (Yerukola et al., 2024). Similarly, news as a medium of\npublic discourse, identifying the intent behind news has garnered increasing interest among researchers.\nHowever, existing research on news intent struggles with the intricate manifestations of this abstract concept\nin news, often resorting to unstructured descriptions to analyze news intent (Gabriel et al., 2022), lacking\nstandardization for effective quantitative analysis and comparison. Limited structured research on news\nintent focuses on specific cases, such as detecting advertising intent in health news (Kang, 2019), relying on\nparticular subjects rather than broader theoretical frameworks, which restricts their general applicability.\nTo bridge this gap, our research is guided by the following research objectives (ROs):\nRO1:To establish a foundation for news intent research from a theory-driven approach and to explore\nwhat news intent is and the benefits of deconstructing it.\nRO2:To develop a comprehensive and rich dataset for news intent perception and investigate how the\nmodel perceives news intent and how our framework facilitates this perception.\nRO3:To examine and leverage the implications of news intent and to explore how perceived news intent\ncan be utilized to deepen news understanding and achieve practical value.\nToachievetheseobjectives,wedrawinsightsfrommultidisciplinarytheoriesandproposeadeconstruction-\nbased framework to facilitate the perception of news intent, resulting in a structured and more universally\napplicable framework. By modeling news production as an intentional action (Cushman and Mele, 2008,\nAnscombe, 2000, Bratman, 2009), this approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how news\nintent shapes news production and causes specific social impacts (Figure 1). Motivated by this observation,\nwe present the first Conceptual Deconstruction-based NewsINTent Understanding framework (Nint),\ndeconstructing news intent from perspectives of rational action (Gergely and Csibra, 2003) and outcomes\n(Malle and Knobe, 1997, Cushman, 2015). Specifically, Nintdeconstructs news intent into three key\ncomponents: belief, desire, and plan, each representing a core aspect of intent (detailed in Section 2).\nOur emphasis on both internal components and external connections of news intent marks a significant\nimprovement from previous research, which overlooks the interrelations between these elements.\nBased on Nint, we curate a news intent perception dataset, NewsInt , with fine-grained labels of belief,\ndesire, plan, and intent polarity, aligned with human perception following a two-stage annotation process.\nThis dataset not only surpasses existing news datasets in its detailed annotation of news intent but also\nfacilitates a systematic study of news production as an intentional action: it covers multiple topics and diverse\nnews types, capturing substantial social reactions and effectively simulating real-world intent perception\nevaluation. Moreover, surprisingly, we find that intent can aid in revealing reporting motivations, predicting\npotential impacts, and enhancing resilience to misinformation and persuasive content in general news. We\ndesign methods and empirically demonstrate the implications of news intent in important news-related\ntasks, such as fake news detection, news popularity prediction, and propaganda detection.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical foundation\nof our proposed framework (RO1). Section 3 provides details of dataset curation (RO2). The proposed\nmethods for identifying news intent (RO2) and enhancing news applications (RO3) are presented in Section\n4. In Section 5, we conduct experiments and report the results of our methods in news intent identification,\nas well as explore the practical value of news intent through experiments on three application tasks. Section\n6 discusses the theoretical and practical implications of this work. Section 7 reviews the related works of this\nresearch. Concluding remarks are provided in Section 8.\n2. News Intent Deconstruction\nUnlike previous studies that directly handle intent from language descriptions (Gabriel et al., 2022), we start\nfrom the conceptual deconstruction of news intent to clarify intent ambiguity, step by step. Then, inspired\nby intentional action studies (Anscombe, 2000, Cushman and Mele, 2008, Bratman, 2009), we delve into\nthe process of news generation to instantiate the concept of intent and its elements from news writing and\nsocial reactions. The proposed framework is illustrated in Figure2.\n1Relevant resources will be made publicly available.\n3\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\n2.1. Conceptual Deconstruction\nThis section aims to facilitate a structured analysis of intent and its deconstruction from the concept\nperspective, as explored by psychologists, philosophers, and cognitive scientists over several decades.\nIntent. People do things intentionally, and people intend to do things (Bratman, 1984). The concept of\n\u201cintentional action\u201d (Cushman and Mele, 2008) requires understanding the intent behind deliberate behavior,\nlinking human intent closely with actions. Based on psychological research, we offer a deconstructed\ntheory-driven definition of intent:\nDefinition 1 (Intent).Intent refers to a cognitive state that emerges from rational planning, grounded in the\nagent\u2019s desires and beliefs.\nMotivated by the broad theory of intent (Cushman, 2015), we decompose intent into three key elements,\ncomprising beliefs,desires, andplans.\nBelief.In modern cognitive philosophy, \u201cbelief\u201d describes an agent\u2019s acceptance of a proposition as true or\nfactual (Schwitzgebel, 2021). This concept does not require active contemplation or accuracy (Armstrong,\n1973,Wellmanetal.,2001).

Contemporaryphilosophysuggeststhatmoralqualityattributionistheinferenceaboutanindividual\u2019s\ndesires (Ames and Fiske, 2015). Desires, as representational cognitive states, convey a positive attitude\ntowardthescenariostheydepict(Sinhababu,2017)anddriverelatedactions(Smith,1994,Anscombe,2000).\nFor example, news articles about vaccination may be driven by desires such as \u201cexpressing concerns about\nvaccine dangers\u201d, \u201ccriticizing government policies\u201d, \u201ccapturing interest for financial gain\u201d, or \u201ceducating the\npublic about vaccination.\u201d\nDefinition3 (Desire).Todesire pmeanshavingatendencytoengageinactionsthoughttofacilitateachievement\nofp.\nPlan.An individual may have many desires, but without commitment, these desires often remain unacted\nupon (Bratman, 2009). Commitment requires formulating plans, which involve considering conditions\n(Bratman, 1987) and simulating behavior sequences (Phillips et al., 2002). By devising specific plans,\nindividuals refine options to identify the components of their final intent (Sukthankar et al., 2014). For\ninstance, in reporting on vaccination risks, plans might include \u201cemphasizing risks while presenting both\npros and cons,\u201d \u201chighlighting severe side effects with doctor quotes,\u201d or \u201cfabricating alarming death rates\nand suggesting a government conspiracy.\u201d These illustrate deliberate narrative crafting and allow flexibility\nin responding to changing circumstances (Sheng et al., 2022b).\nDefinition 4 (Plan).Plans are devised to address desires by setting objectives and linking actions to their\nanticipated outcomes.\n4\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\n2.2.NintFramework\nBy deconstructing intent into three fundamental components, we aim to further instantiate their presentation\nin news articles, as news content is the principal conveyor of information to the audience (Newcomb, 1958,\nVan Dijk, 2013). Specifically, we introduce the conceptual deconstruction-based news intent understanding\nframework, Nint, for news intent identification and develop a multi-level and fine-grained classification\nsystem, considering the aspects of news writing and social reactions.\nBelief identification. Beliefs shape the perspective and attitude of news articles, influencing their narrative\ndirection. According to K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck and Can (2020), beliefs can be categorized into three classes: (i) Favor ,(ii)\nAgainst, and(iii) Neutral .\nSpecial attention should be given to non-neutral news articles. While complete neutrality is unrealistic,\nsystematic bias can lead to harmful outcomes like polarization (Spinde et al., 2021). Identifying beliefs is\ntreated as a multi-class classification task.\nDesire identification. Desires are reflected in the intended impact of the news and the internal as well as\nexternal benefits pursued, representing their core purpose. We examine desires (Murayama et al., 2022)\nacross two facets:\ni)Impact on the target. Intent to induce specific effects on a target, such as harming reputation, giving\ncommendation, or inciting violence (Pramanick et al., 2021, Lu et al., 2023).\nii)Desired social reactions. To provoke public responses, including fostering dialogues (Mendoza et al.,\n2020), triggering collective emotions (Luvembe et al., 2023), and influencing public opinion (Mahony\nand Chen, 2024).\nDesires are categorized as follows: (i) Public interest, aimed at benefiting the general populace (Porlezza,\n2024) (e.g., disseminating scientific information). (ii) Political interest, intended to promote a political\nagenda (Son and Fielding, 2024) (e.g., undermining election contenders). (iii) Economic interest, focused on\nfinancial gain (Immorlica et al., 2024, Quandt, 2024) (e.g., producing sensational stories for profit). (iv)\nPsychological fulfillment, aimed at seeking pleasure or social interaction (Wardle and Derakhshan, 2017)\n(e.g., enthusiasm for an ideology, emotional expression, or parody). As news articles can embody multiple\ndesires, the identification of desires is framed as a multi-label classification task.\nPlan identification. Plans are reflected in the writing strategies of news articles, designed to achieve desires\nbased on contextual beliefs (Mele, 1997, Heider, 2013). Following Piskorski et al. (2023), we examine two\naspects of plans:\ni)News framing. Defined as \u201chighlighting the prominence of some facets of a topic\u201d (Ali and Hassan,\n2022, Sinelnik and Hovy, 2024), we use a classification system with 14 general categories (Piskorski\net al., 2023).\nii)Persuasion. This involves particular linguistic choices aimed at swaying the audience (Hasanain et al.,\n2024, Sajwani et al., 2024).\nThe overarching categorization for plan is based on journalism\u2019s ethical standards (Ireton and Posetti, 2018):\n(i) Fair, news should present diverse viewpoints, aim for equilibrium, and offer adequate context. Fair\nreporting builds trust and credibility; (ii) Unfair, lacking balanced perspectives or sufficient context. Plan\nidentification is framed as a binary classification task.\nNews intent identification task. Building on the previous bottom-up analysis, the intent identification task\n5\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nis divided into belief, desire, and plan identification. To assess the societal impact of news and provide a\nholistic evaluation, intent polarity is categorized as: (i) Harmful, which threatens democracy and scientific\nprogress, or exacerbates societal divisions, fosters an environment of increased polarization and hostility\namong different groups (Sheng et al., 2022a); (ii) Unharmful, which aims to inform, educate, or entertain\nwithout causing harm, foster understanding, and encourage positive discourse.\n3.

Data Annotation\nWe transform our framework into a sequential question-answering process for annotation, following a\nfine-to-coarse approach. Annotators start with writing strategy analysis (e.g., persuasive language, frame\nanalysis) and progress to high-level intent analysis (e.g., desire identification), concluding with intent polarity\nclassification. Three team members with expertise in mass communication and annotation developed a\nguideline that includes instructions and examples to clarify each element and aims to provide annotators\nwith clear, well-defined annotation guidelines that minimize the potential for unrestricted subjective interpre-\n7\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\ntations. This guideline balances concise intuition-based and detailed instructions, aiding in recruiting more\nannotators. Feedback from trial annotations is used to refine the guidelines iteratively. We use Qualtrics3for\ndesigning and managing the annotation interface.\nThe study has received approval from the research ethics committee, and all data collection has consented\nto research use. We ensured that the recruited workers were paid fairly and conducted an optional post-study\ndemographics survey.\n3.2.1.

Simulta-\nneously, we strive to recruit annotators from diverse geographical regions, ethnicities, and socio-economic\nbackgrounds. The recruitment is done via Prolific4, a platform for high-quality data collection.\nThe annotation procedure consists of a qualification stage and a taskstage. During the qualification\nstage, participants complete a tutorial to familiarize themselves with the task and interface. This 10-minute,\nexample-centric training session includes: (1) definitions with concise examples, (2) a hands-on approach\nwhere annotators achieve a coherent grasp of each concept by providing them with a collection of pre-\nclassified examples of each concept, and (3) two comprehension tests using examples that highlight common\nchallenges in understanding news intent (see Figure 5).\nOnly annotators who complete the full training and pass both comprehension tests are enlisted into\nthetaskstage, wherein it provides annotations for 20 randomly assigned examples. The recruitment\nprocess persists until each news item secures at least three annotations to ensure reliability. Low-quality\nquestionnaires are discarded if either of the two attention checks presented every 10 items fails.\n3.2.2. Quality Control\nTo enhance annotation quality, we incorporated feedback from the experimental annotation process. By\nprioritizing questions regarding the fundamental elements of news writing strategies, annotators are encour-\naged to read the news more carefully while arranging questions concerning higher-level elements (such as\ndesires and intent polarity) to later sections, following a fine-to-grain sequential annotation strategy.\nAfter conducting trial annotations and discussions, we also found that continuous exposure to the same\nthemes can increase cognitive load and lead to over-sensitivity to patterns. To alleviate this, we reorganized\n3https://www.qualtrics.com/\n4https://app.prolific.com/\n8\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nthe data to avoid consecutive articles on the same topic, aiming to reduce fatigue by interspersing varied\ntopics, keeping annotators more engaged and less weary.\nWe also implement a dual quality control procedure. In addition to assessing participants\u2019 understanding\nof news intent and conducting screenings, manual reviews are performed to further ensure the reliability of\nthe annotations: whether the time spent and the number of clicks per annotation page are consistently and\nsignificantly below the estimated values during the trial annotation.\nOverall, N=57participants joined our project, with 13disqualified for failing to meet the criteria\nas mentioned earlier. Ultimately, over 2,200 fine-grained annotations from multi-topic news articles were\nincluded.\n3.2.3.

However, the development of automated\nmethods relies on costly manual annotation, which creates scalability bottlenecks. To address this issue,\nwe investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as cognitive simulators and explore their\npotential to perceive news intent.\nProblem definition. Based on the proposed framework Nint, we decompose news intent identification into\n10\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nbelief, plan, and desire identification sub-tasks, with a special focus on the potential influence of news intent\ndetecting intent polarity at the article level.\nGiven an input sequence xrepresenting the content of a news article and a model M, let a task-specific\nprompt prepended to the input be p, and the output is y. Under this formulation, Standard Prompting can\nbe described as:\nStandard Prompting: y=M(x\u2225p),\nwhich constructs prompts that only contain the task description and the given news.\nDMGfor news intent identification. To address the inherent complexity of news intent analysis where\nsurface-level semantics often diverge from latent communicative goals, we propose a Deconstruction-based\nMulti-level Guidance ( DMG) Prompting framework. This two-stage cognitive architecture allocates cogni-\ntive load, mirroring human workflows while preventing LLM hallucination through constrained reasoning\npathways.\nDMGPrompting is grounded in the Nintframework to decompose the intent into constituent elements,\nbreaking down the overall intent into more manageable components ( first-level ), further deconstruction and\nreasoning of internal intent elements according to its characteristics in the news domain, aiming to guide\nthe model\u2019s reasoning from diverse perspectives ( second-level ):\nDMG: y=M(x\u2225pdmg),\npdmg={pB,pP,pD,p},\nwhere {B,P,D}denote the intent components: belief, plan, and desire, respectively. pdmgincludes instruc-\ntions guiding the model Mthrough the cognitive reasoning process based on the Nintframework. Figure 7\nshows a working example.\nIn thefirst-level deconstruction, intent is deconstructed into belief, plan, and desire, guiding the model to\nprogressively perceive news intent. The first component of intent is belief analysis, where the model evaluates\nthe stance of the news regarding the central theme or contentious issue of the news articles, categorizing it\nas favor, against, or neutral. The second component of intent is plan analysis, the model determines if the\nnews is written fairly with competing perspectives and sufficient context, categorizing it as fair or unfair. To\nachieve this goal, the second-level deconstruction is conducted to guide the model to examine how the news\nis framed, allowing for multiple selections from categories such as \u201cFairness and Equality\u201d or \u201cSecurity and\nDefense\u201d, and then assesses whether the article employs persuasive writing techniques. Thirdly, in desire\nanalysis, the goal is broken down by second-level deconstruction to identify the intended target of the news\nand the effect the news aims to achieve, categorizing the effect as positive, negative, or neither. Then, it\nevaluates whether the news desires to incite social debate, challenge or transform readers\u2019 pre-existing\nbeliefs, and identifies the social emotions the news aims to trigger (e.g., anger, trust, surprise etc.). Based on\nthese analyses, the model determines the news\u2019s desire, categorizing it into public interest, political interest,\neconomic interest, or psychological fulfillment.\nFinally, in the intent polarity analysis, the model synthesizes all the information from the previous\nanalyses to evaluate the potential influence of intent, provides an interpretable polarity scoring disentangled\nfrom lexical biases, categorizing it as harmful or unharmful.\n4.2.

This method benefits from the training signals generated by DMG Prompting while\nimproving efficiency for downstream applications.\nAs outlined in Figure8,DMInt introduces a cognitive-inspired architecture that decomposes news intent\nthrough multi-view extractors and dynamic view-gated aggregation, enabling joint modeling of compositional\nsemantics and contextual writing patterns via local-global interactions.\nText encoder. Given the news topic and news content, we concatenate them using the [sep]token as input.\nSpecifically, RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) is employed as text encoder:\nW=RoBERTa ([topic||[sep]||content ]),\nwhere ||is the concatenation operator.\nMulti-View Extractor (MVE). Following Nintframework, we develop three multi-view extractors to\nexplicitly capture different dimensions of news intent. Each extractor incorporates both global and local\ninteractions. Specifically, the global-view interaction module examines interactions across the entire context\nto model the global information necessary for each intent dimension, including overall discourse and context,\n\u02c6F=Extractor global(W;\u03b8),\nwhere \u03b8denotes the relevant parameters. Additionally, modeling the content of specific segments and\neven words is crucial for understanding detailed framing strategies, event progression, and specific writing\ntechniquesinthenews.

By integrating global and local interactions, MVE enhances the comprehensiveness and accuracy of\nunderstanding news intent. In practice, the global and local interaction modules are implemented using\nmulti-head attention and 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes.\n12\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nGiven the extracted specific features Ftfor each t\u2208 {B ,D,P}, representing belief, desire, and plan,\nrespectively, we can obtain the corresponding identification result Ct, as follows\nCt=\u03c3(MLP(Ft)),\nwhere \u03c3(\u00b7)represents the sigmoid function, MLPrefers to the multi-layer perceptron employed for classifi-\ncation.\nIntent Aggregator (IA).

Avoiding neglect of the emphasis on dimension-specific information, the intent aggregator builds an\nadaptive approach, allowing the proposed DMInt to adjust and combine these representations dynamically.\nGiven WandE, the weight vector FGis calculated by\nFG=MAttn (W)\u2295E,\nwhere MAttn (\u00b7)is a masked attention module for encoding the context features of input news and \u2295denotes\nthe sum operation. FGis then fed into a gate network to derive the aggregating logits Mof each dimension:\nM=softmax (Gate(FG;\u03d5)),\nwhere \u03d5stands for the parameter of the gate network, and the softmax function is used to normalize the\naggregating logits M. Finally, the ultimate representation of news intent can be driven by weighting the\ndimension-specific representations:\nFI=\u2211\ufe01\nt\u2208{B,D,P}MtFt,\nCI=\u03c3(MLP(FI)).\nLoss functions. The Cross-Entropy Loss ( L) is employed for the classification:\nL(\u02c6y,y) =\u2212N\u2211\ufe01\nk=1(yklog\u02c6yk+(1\u2212yk)log(1\u2212\u02c6yk)),\nwhere y,\u02c6y, and krepresent the ground truth, prediction, and the number of categories, respectively. Given\nground truth Y,Lallcan be formulated as:\nLall=\u2211\ufe01\nt\u2208{B,D,P,I}L(Ct,Yt).\n5. Results\nIn this section, we present the results of experiments on the intent identification task to demonstrate the\nperformance of our proposed method for understanding news intent. Following this, we conduct experiments\non three application tasks, showing that the news intent learned through our approach can enhance model\nperformance in these representative news-related tasks.\n5.1.

Experimental Performance\nThe experimental results presented in Table 4 indicate that the performance of all models has significantly\nimproved through the application of our proposed method5. With the power of Nint, models are endowed\nwith cognitive-level modeling and reasoning abilities. This approach fundamentally reduces reliance on\ncostly human-annotated datasets, enhancing intent identification through structured reasoning patterns that\nmimic human perception, enabling efficient and human-granular analysis of news ecosystems at scale.\nThisapproachenablesastructuredandaccurateperceptionofnewsintent. AsshowninFigure7,standard\nprompting falls short due to superficial understanding, while the proposed method provides multi-level,\nmultifaceted information and a deeper perception of news intent. It is noteworthy that DMGprompting\nrequires only a single inference, as questions are sequentially listed, and the model responds to them in order.\nIn the illustration, pairing the answers with their respective questions is intended to enhance readability.\n5All metrics are calculated using the Python package scikit-learn.\n14\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\n5.1.2.

Experiments\ndemonstrate that the intent features captured through our method DMInt possess noticeable potential to\nimprove the performance of various downstream models.\nApplication tasks. We conduct a series of experiments on three application tasks that benefit from under-\nstanding news intent and hold unique research value:\n\u2022Fake news detection: A classification task to distinguish fake news from real news (Sheng et al., 2021,\nZhu et al., 2023, Hu et al., 2023, 2024, Nan et al., 2024), which is essential for maintaining information\n15\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nintegrity (Zhou and Zafarani, 2020). Uncovering the deceptive intents behind the news will deepen\ndetectors\u2019 news understanding and eventually benefit the judgments.\n\u2022News popularity prediction: A regression task that holds intrinsic value as a computational proxy for\nunderstanding real-world information propagation dynamics (Fan et al., 2021). It predicts popularity by\nclick counts to reflect audience engagement.\n\u2022Propagandadetection: Aclassificationtaskaimstodistinguishpropagandisticnewsfromnon-propagandistic\nnews. Propaganda refers to the expression of opinion or action by agents that is deliberately designed to\ninfluence the opinions or actions of others for predetermined ends (Jowett and O\u2019donnell, 2018).\nDatasets. The dataset statistics employed for the three application tasks are presented in Table 6. The\nGossipCop dataset, part of the FakeNewsNet repository (Shu et al., 2020), is divided into training, validation,\nandtestsetsbasedonatemporalpartitionfollowingpriorwork(Zhuetal.,2022,Nanetal.,2025),simulating\nreal-world fake news detection scenarios. The MINDdataset (Wu et al., 2020) is employed adhering to Fan\net al. (2021). The QPROPdataset (Barr\u00f3n-Cedeno et al., 2019) consists of 51.3k articles from 104 news\nsources, with each article labeled as either propagandistic (Prop.) or non-propagandistic (Non-prop.). A\ntemporal split of the dataset is implemented, ensuring that the publication dates of the news in the test set\nare later than those in the training set, as the model should not have access to future news during training.\nApplication task-specific baselines. To evaluate the performance of our inferred news intent features and\nthe proposed method DMInt, we select corresponding baseline models for three application tasks. The\npreprocessing, training, and testing configurations follow the corresponding official implementations. We\nemploy late fusion of the intent features with the task features obtained from the baseline model using\na two-layer MLP. For the fake news detection task, we select three representative and recent fake news\ndetection methods as baselines:\n\u2022BERT-Emo (Zhang et al., 2021) integrates the writer\u2019s emotion into consideration. To ensure fairness in\ncomparisons with other models, we retain only its content-based branch for fake news detection.\n\u2022ENDEF (Zhu et al., 2022) proposes an entity debiasing method aimed at mitigating entity bias in fake\nnews detection, following a cause-and-effect causal perspective.\n\u2022MSynFD (Xiao et al., 2024) introduces a multi-hop syntactic dependency graph to model syntax informa-\ntion together with sequence-aware semantic information.\nFor news popularity prediction, to access our model\u2019s performance, we select the three top-performing\nmethods identified in Fan et al. (2021) as baseline models:\n\u2022SeqSpa extracts both sequential and spatial characteristics of news to capture the nuanced patterns\neffectively.\n\u2022GCN-buzz leverages the relational structure of news by utilizing a heterogeneous graph and encodes the\ninformation flow from the current buzzword to the context.\n\u2022F4captures the local as well as global news-entity correlations and designs an aggregation module to\nprovide a holistic representation of news.\nFor propaganda detection, we compare the improvements achieved by our proposed method against the\nfollowing baseline models:\n\u2022IPD, the document-level prediction variant proposed by Yu et al. (2021), is built upon the features\nidentified by Barr\u00f3n-Cedeno et al. (2019), which encompass lexicon, readability, vocabulary richness,\nand style, and contributes to an effective propaganda detection model.\n\u2022RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019). We employ a pre-trained RoBERTa model to encode news articles, fine-tuning\n16\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nonly the last layer to leverage its enhanced contextual representation capabilities. The news embeddings\nare then fed into a two-layer multi-layer perceptron for propaganda detection.\n\u2022DET (Chernyavskiy et al., 2024), a discourse-enhanced transformer-based architecture for propaganda\ndetection, which utilizes Rhetorical Structure Theory for discourse representations.\n5.2.1. Experimental Details\nData preparation. To generate sufficient training data for DMInt, we employ DMGPrompting to scale\nup annotation efforts on the NewsInt dataset. The structured reasoning procedure not only bypasses\nthe scalability bottlenecks of manual annotation but also establishes a foundational infrastructure for fully\nautomated intent identification systems, representing a promising direction.\nTable 7: Dataset statistics.\nCount Train Val Test Overall\nIntent#harmful 4,911 188 56 5,155\n#unharmful 7,348 312 144 7,804\nBelief#favor 638 22 17 677\n#against 2,473 87 57 2,617\n#neutral 9,148 391 126 9,665\nDesire#pub. int. 3,892 174 74 4,140\n#eco. int. 6,398 249 32 6,679\n#pol. int. 7,847 298 112 8,257\n#psy. ful. 3,043 121 22 3,186\nPlan#unfair 7,840 301 143 8,198\n#fair 4,419 199 57 4,761\nThe best-performing model from Section 4 is used to annotate the remaining data in NewsInt , yielding\nmulti-dimensional fine-grained intent labels (categories of belief, desire, plan, and intent polarity), along with\nadditional labels from the second deconstruction. This enhances the LLM\u2019s intent perception and provides\nmore material for analysis and future research. Utilizing LLMs for labeled data augmentation significantly\nreduces the cost of acquiring supervised data (Zhou et al., 2023) and has been shown to provide even\nbetter labeling quality than crowdsourced human annotations that lack adequate design and quality control\n(Gilardi et al., 2023, Sheng et al., 2025). This approach creates opportunities for training specialized models\nfor application tasks (Ye et al., 2025).\nLLM-annotateddataverification. Wefurtherconductedhumanverificationontheannotateddatagenerated\nby our method to assess its capability for augmenting training data. We randomly selected 500 labeled\nentries for quality assessment. After completing a pilot annotation experiment, all annotators were asked to\nevaluate whether the provided labels aligned with their understanding of the news (credible/incredible).\nFifteen annotators participated in assessing the credibility of news annotation results, and each article was\nevaluated by at least three independent annotators. Ultimately, 94%, 97%, 95%, and 91% of the data\nwere judged credible by at least one annotator for beliefs, plans, desires, and intent polarity, respectively.\nFurthermore, 76%, 77%, 74%, and 78% samples corresponding to the belief, plan, desire, and intent polarity\nlabels, were collectively labeled as credible by at least three annotators. The verification results demonstrate\n17\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nsubstantial agreement, with 84%, 85%, 83%, and 86% pairwise agreements, as well as multi-rater kappa\nvalues(Randolph,2005)of0.764, 0.776, 0.749, and0.795forbeliefs, plans, desires, andintents, respectively.\nIt signifies that the posterior consistency of model annotations with human perception is quite strong.\nDataanalysis. TheresultingdatadistributionispresentedinTable7. Thehuman-annotatedsetisdesignated\nas the test set, the human-validated set serves as the validation set, and the remaining data is used for\nmodel training. In the intent category, the dataset exhibits a significant imbalance, which is consistent\nwith the results of human annotation and reflects the current digital news information landscape (Zhang\nand Ghorbani, 2020). While most news articles exhibit a neutral belief (\u201cneutral\u201d being the predominant\nclass) by avoiding explicit leaning, they rarely adopt a balanced multi-perspective approach, resulting in an\nunbalanced view for readers (Asp, 2007) (\u201cunfair\u201d is the predominant class of plan). Furthermore, \u201cpolitical\ninterests\u201d emerge as the prevalent category in desire, surpassing the proportion of political news itself.\nThis underscores the pivotal role of news in contemporary democratic political systems. Additionally, the\nprominence of \u201ceconomic interests\u201d reflects the evolving profit models within the news industry (Nelson\net al., 2024).\nCount5276\n3539\n2427\n2016\n1478\n1035 929771 709 694 644483329174Political (P)\nPublic opinion\nHealth and safety\nPolicy prescription and evaluation\nLegality and jurisprudence\nEconomic\nCultural identityCrime and punishment\nSecurity and defense\nMorality\nFairness and equality\nCapacity and resources\nExternal regulation and reputation\nQuality of life\nCount5161\n3674\n329130632870\n1811\n1139\n624\n257Anger\nAnticipation\nTrust\nFear\nDisgustSurprise\nSadness\nJoy\nNone\nFigure 9: Distribution of news frames and desired social emotion in overall NewsInt .

As shown in Figure9, a strategic approach of media outlets is observed to engage audiences\nthrough emotionally charged content, underscoring the power of media in shaping social narratives and the\nimportance of information literacy among audiences. The media\u2019s emphasis on political and public opinion\nframes reflecting the critical role of news framing in shaping public opinion and influencing civic engagement,\ncoupled with the targeting of strong emotions like anger and anticipation, highlights a calculated approach\nto influencing public discourse and maintaining audience interest.\n5.2.2.

Discussion\n6.1. Internal and External Connection of News Intent\nWe provide a preliminary analysis of the proposed NewsInt dataset, aiming to enhance the understanding\nof news intent for future research. We offer an analysis of the relationships among the internal elements of\nnews intent, as well as an examination of the connections between the elements of news intent and real-world\nimpacts triggered by the news article. We show that (1) the internal elements of intent exhibit synergistic\nconsistency, collectively forming the intent behind news production action, which mirrors the theory of\nrational action (Mele, 1997), and (2) within intentional action, intent, actions, and outcomes constitute a\ncausal chain, a causality that is reflected in the relationship between the intent of news production and the\nsocial feedback it generates.\nInternal consistency. The proportion of news with \u201cunfair\u201d plans across different belief and desire categories\n19\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nFavor Against Neutral0.82310.9713\n0.6357\nPublic interestEconomic interest Political interestPsychological fulfillment0.33480.76630.82280.8726\nFigure 10: Belief-Plan and Desire-Plan correlation.

Subfigure (a) shows that \u201cAgainst\u201d beliefs have the highest proportion of unfair plans,\nwhile \u201cNeutral\u201d beliefs align with fairer writing. Subfigure (b) reveals that articles driven by psychological\nfulfillment exhibit the highest proportion of unfair plans, whereas public interest-driven articles have the\nlowest proportion. These findings illustrate the consistency among the internal elements of intent, aligns\nwith the \u201cconsistency criterion\u201d theory of intent (Dennett, 1987, Tomasello, 2023): Intents, as mental states\nintricately linked to action, drive agents to formulate plans that effectively achieve their desires based on\ntheir belief of the situation (Audi, 1993, Heider, 2013).\nCOVID-19 (#post)Guns (#post)\ngender rights (#post)-2-101Public int.\nEconomic int.\nPolitical int.\nPsychological ful.\nCOVID-19 (depth)Guns (depth)\ngender rights (depth)-2-101\nFigure 11: Desire-Outcome connection in average post (left) count and average reply depth (right) over three topics.\nExternal connection. We selected three topics (COVID-19, gender rights, and gun control) to analyze the\ndesire dimension in news intent and its relationship to real-world consequences, as this dimension is most\nclosely related to outcomes. We utilized post count and discussion depth as outcome proxies to statistically\nassess the relationship between news intent and these outcomes. The data was standardized using Z-scores\nto ensure uniform representation across all subjects, z=x\u2212\u00b5\n\u03c3, where xdenotes the original data point, \u00b5is\nthe mean of the data point, and \u03c3is the standard deviation of the set.\nAs shown in Figure 11, the intent behind news production correlates with social media engagement.\nPsychological fulfillment (red lines) leads to the highest number of posts and discussion depth due to its\nsensational nature. Economic interests (yellow lines) stimulate more discussions on COVID-19, potentially\ndriven by conspiracy theories and the economic repercussions of the pandemic. Political interests (green\nlines) provoke in-depth debates, exhibiting greater relative discussion depth despite fewer overall discussions,\nespeciallyongenderrights. Publicinterestnews(bluelines), oftenleaningtowardeducationalorinvestigative\njournalism, elicits less reaction, except for gun-related topics, which are highly contentious. These findings\nhighlight that modeling news production as an intentional action offers deeper insights into the news lifecycle:\nit links intents, actions, and consequences, providing a comprehensive framework for future research.\n20\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\n6.2.

Specifically, we include:\n(1) an ablation study on the contribution of each intent element across three application tasks, and (2) a\ntoken-level attention visualization, which illustrates how each intent component attends to different parts of\nthe input text across these tasks.\nAblation study of each intent element across three application tasks. The ablation study is conducted by\nselectively removing each intent component\u2014belief, desire, or plan\u2014from the integrated DMInt model.\nThe intent features generated by these model variants are subsequently utilized to assist the best-performing\nmodel in application tasks. The averaged results over 5 runs are shown in Table 10. The results show\nthat removing any single component consistently leads to a drop in performance, indicating that each\nintent element contributes unique and essential information. These findings empirically confirm the distinct\nfunctional roles of belief, desire, and plan in modeling news intent. For instance, the removal of the belief\ncomponent significantly degrades performance in fake news detection, whereas the desire component plays\na more critical role in predicting news popularity, likely due to its sensitivity to extravagant language and\nemotional appeal.\nVisualization of each intent component\u2019s attention over the input text. We compute token-level gradient-\nbased attribution scores from the corresponding expert modules in our DMInt model. Specifically, for the\ninput news instance, we perform a forward pass through the model to extract the belief, desire, and plan\nfeatures, then compute the gradient of each feature with respect to the hidden states of the input tokens.\nThe magnitude of these gradients reflects the sensitivity of each intent component to each token, effectively\nindicating the varying levels of attention that each intent component pays to the input.\nAs shown in Figure12, each visualization example demonstrates how the belief, desire, and plan\ncomponents focus on different aspects of the input depending on the task. Consistent with the results\npresented in Table 10, these components provide complementary perspectives to the application tasks, with\neach playing a distinct role; the absence of any one of these components leads to a decline in performance.\nIn fake news detection, the model assigns high importance to emotionally charged phrases and speculative\nlanguage (e.g., \u201cgiven his famous wife an ultimatum\u201d, \u201creportedly telling\u201d, \u201cinsider told\u201d), particularly\nthrough the desireandplanchannels, thereby aiding in the identification of potential patterns in fake news.\nFor news popularity prediction, the beliefanddesirecomponents emphasize attitude (e.g., \u201cimpressively\nenough\u201d, \u201cdevoted an ever-increasing\u201d), while planfocuses on factual details (e.g., \u201cover 800 engineers\u201d).\nThe strong expressions of attitude captured by the model contribute positively to predicting the popularity\nof the news. In propaganda detection, beliefanddesiretend to highlight public accountability statements\n21\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nDespite looking super loved

Limitations and Future Work\nDespite our proposed approach offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective framework for\nintent modeling in news articles, there is still space for future directions. Currently, our method is designed\nand evaluated solely on news with unimodal textual format, which limits its applicability in multimodal\nor interactive formats increasingly common in modern journalism. Expanding news intent research to\nencompass such richer modalities is needed to build a more comprehensive analysis system. Future study,\nsuch as constructing multimodal intent datasets, is required to establish the baseline and benchmark for\nmore news formats. Besides, it also requires careful extraction and alignment of cross-modal signals (e.g.,\nimage-caption pairs, video transcripts) via cross-modal interaction designs, such as integrating our text-based\nframework with vision-language pretraining models such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2024b),\nand cross-modal transformers (Xu et al., 2023). The investigation of these problems is left for future work.\n7. Related Work\n7.1. General Intent Understanding\nRecent advances in intent understanding span multiple domains: Dialogue systems focus on decoding user\ngoals through utterance patterns (e.g., service requests (Louvan and Magnini, 2020)), while recommendation\nsystems infer user intents from behavioral traces (e.g., purchase propensity (Chen et al., 2022, Liu et al.,\n2024)). These approaches typically operationalize intent as explicit functional objectives directly tied to\nobservable interactions.\n22\nExploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach\nOur work, however, addresses the unique challenge of news intent. News intent fundamentally diverges\nby operating within asymmetric persuasion contexts . Unlike conversational goals that align with participants\u2019\nmutual awareness (Schwarz et al., 1991), news narratives often conceal their core intents beneath surface-\nlevel informativeness (Schwarz, 2014). Thus, a theoretically grounded framework is essential to navigate this\ncomplexity and to unravel the complex interplay between the inner components of intent, news production\npractices, and their broader social impact.\n7.2. Perception of News Intent\nPrior work related to news intent mining falls into two paradigms with inherent limitations: Empirical\ntaxonomy approaches (Kang, 2019, Dharawat et al., 2022) manually categorize intents within narrow\ndomains(e.g.,healthissues)usingtopic-specificlabels(CaballeroHinojosa,2023). Whileyieldingfine-grained\nclasses(e.g., Electorallegitimacyconcerns), thesetaxonomieslacktransferableschemas; forinstance, amodel\ntrained on taxonomies specific to Korean political news (Kim et al., 2023) fails to capture intents beyond\nthat topic. Heuristic feature engineering studies (Chen et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2024) approximate intent\nthrough surface correlates, such as lexical markers and sentiment shifts. These handcrafted or unsupervised\nproxies treat intent as a variant of stylistic features, focusing on feature selection or optimization for a single\nintent category (i.e., deception intent). As a result, they are unable to model diverse intents\u2014a critical\ndrawback considering the multi-intent compositions present in news narratives (e.g., simultaneous deception\nandagenda-setting). Gabrieletal.(2022)proposedavagueconceptofintent, relyingonannotators\u2019intuition\nand free-text descriptions, which hampers precise assessment and efficient usage. These attempts are limited\nto specific topics and datasets, lacking broader theoretical foundations.\nIn contrast, we propose the Nintframework, grounded in interdisciplinary studies, to eliminate the\nambiguity of intent and provide a structured framework for intent modeling and practical application,\nenabling cross-task applications.\n8. Conclusion\nThis research introduces a new perspective in news studies by conceptualizing news production as in-\ntentional action and offering a deconstructive analysis of news intent. We present Nint, a conceptual\ndeconstruction-based news intent understanding framework grounded in interdisciplinary studies, to sys-\ntematically investigate news intent. Then, we enhanced the perception capabilities of LLMs regarding news\nintent and compiled a dataset containing 142.5k fine-grained labels. Finally, we validated the practical value\nof news intent and our proposed computational modeling approach in downstream news-related tasks. Our\nfindings demonstrate the internal consistency and external connection of news intent, providing valuable\ninsights for news intent cognition and computational social science.\nReferences\nMohammad Ali and Naeemul Hassan. 2022.

Employingtechniques borrowed from data journalism, it develops a form of cross-platform analysisthat is attuned to both commensurability as well as platform speci \ufb01city. It analyses the most\nengaged-with or top-ranked political content on seven online platforms: TikTok, 4chan,Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google Web Search. Discussing the extent towhich social media platforms marginalize mainstream media and mainstream the fringe,the analyses found that TikTok parodies mainstream media, 4chan and Reddit dismiss itand direct users to alternative in \ufb02uencer networks and extreme YouTube content. Twitter\nprefers the hyperpartisan over it. Facebook \u2019s\u201cfake news \u201dproblem also concerns declining\namounts of mainstream media referenced. Instagram has in \ufb02uencers (rather than, say,\nexperts) dominating user engagement. By comparison, Google Web Search buoys theliberal mainstream (and sinks conservative sites), but generally gives special interestsources, as they were termed in the study, the privilege to provide information ratherthan of \ufb01cial sources. The piece concludes with a discussion of source and \u201cplatform\ncriticism \u201d, concerning how online platforms are seeking to \ufb01lter the content that is posted\nor found there through increasing editorial intervention. These \u201ceditorial epistemologies \u201d,\napplied especially around COVID-19 keywords, are part of an expansion of so-calledcontent moderation to what I call \u201cserious queries \u201d, or keywords that return of \ufb01cial\ninformation.

The following\nexamines that thesis through an analysis of the current state of what globally could be called the\u201cmisinformation problem \u201d(Allcott et al., 2019 ) across seven online platforms: TikTok, 4chan,\nReddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Google Web Search.

On such\nyouthful platforms as TikTok and to a lesser extent Instagram,misinformation may be delivered sarcastically or insincerely,making it dif \ufb01cult to characterize intent ( Phillips and Milner,\n2017 ). On the masked or anonymized political boards and\ncommunities of 4chan and Reddit, problematic sources are not\nas copiously referenced as mainstream ones, but that \ufb01nding does\nnot mean to suggest the absence of a problem, as the mostreferenced collection of sources are extreme YouTube videos,many of which end up being deleted from the platform. The usersof mainstream social media as Twitter and Facebook continue topoint in great proportions to hyperpartisan sources, originallyde\ufb01ned as \u201copenly ideological web operations \u201d(Herrman, 2016 ).\nPolitical spaces on Instagram, however, were found to be the\u201ccleanest \u201d, where most election-related content is non-divisive\nand earnestly posted, and in \ufb02uencers, with some exceptions, were\nfound to be responsible information providers, debunking rather\nthan spreading 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories.\nThe research provides a technique for \u201ccross-platform\nanalysis \u201d, or the examination of a single phenomenon\n(through engagement analysis) across a variety of social media.It thereby addresses critiques of \u201csingle platform studies \u201d, where\nsocietal trends or phenomena are seen through one social medialens without the bene \ufb01t of a comparative perspective that would\nfurnish a baseline (Rogers, 2019). Engagement analysis of a singlesubject matter (election-related information, in this case) isconsidered one robust cross-platform approach since it\ncaptures each platform \u2019s top content, which refers to the posts\nor web URLs that receive the most interactions (directly orindirectly). It has the bene \ufb01t of being more global in its\noutlook compared to other cross-platform approaches that relyon seeking one or more digital objects shared across platforms(e.g., a hyperlink) and comparing resonance (Rogers, 2017).\nBut the cross-platform approach put forward here is not blind\nto platform speci \ufb01cities. It seeks to account for differing platform\nmetrics, vernaculars of use and user subcultures. Accounting forthis \u201cmedium speci \ufb01city\u201dis performed in at least three ways. The\n\ufb01rst is that engagement is measured distinctively per platform, as\ndiscussed in some detail below. Second, social media\nmanipulation (such as arti \ufb01cially amplifying misinformation so\nthat it appears to be engaged-with content) also differs perplatform. One is interested in fake followers on Instagram andbots on Twitter, for example. Being attuned to platformvernaculars, \ufb01nally, rests on the study of cultures of use. For\nexample, certain sound effects or facial gestures on TikToksuggest disbelief or mistrust. In all, commensurability therebyrelies on both the cross-platform study of engagement as well asindividual platform analyses imbued with a medium-speci \ufb01c\napproach.\nIn the following I \ufb01rst introduce the current misinformation\nproblem online as bearing some resemblance to the quality of\ninformation debates from early web history. The contemporary\nconcerns, however, \ufb02ow from the \u201cfake news \u201dcrisis of 2016,\ntogether with the continual study of the extent to which theplatforms have addressed the issue (and also how they have doneso). Moreover, these debates have not escaped the politicization of\u201cbig tech \u201dand its supposed \u201cliberal bias \u201d(Vaidhyanathan, 2019 ),\na claim that is also a source of empirical study in the Google WebSearch analysis below.\nIndeed, designating certain information as problematic may\nbe political (and increasingly politicised), because, as othersbefore us also have found ( Benkler et al., 2018 ;Rogers and\nHagen, 2020 ), it is more prevalent on the right side of the\npolitical spectrum, as are problematic or \u201cinauthentic \u201dusers,\nthough they are not alone there. Making a case for balancingthe partisanship of sources outputted by social media and searchengines (rather than serving \ufb01lter bubbles through\npersonalization, for example) is among the emerging sourceadjudication methods under consideration, as I will discuss.The piece concludes with a discussion of source criticism onsocial media, including the recent rise of \u201ceditorial\nepistemologies \u201dalongside crowdsourced ones associated with\nthe (early) web.\nUNCERTAINTY ONLINE RENEWED\nThe web historically has been thought of as a space for theunsubstantiated, authored by rumour-mongers, conspiracytheorists and all manner of self-publishers and fringecontributors. Indeed, one could argue, as it was put in 1994,\nthat on the web the \u201ceminent and the crackpot \u201dstand side-by-\nside, a feature once celebrated as a productive collision(Rheingold, 1994 ;Rogers, 2004 ). Indeed, in early internet\nstudies, next to the blurring of the real and the virtual,conspiracy theory in particular but also the production andcirculation of rumor were subjects of study, before notions asthe\u201cwisdom of the crowd \u201dand projects as Wikipedia appeared to\nplace the web on a less shaky epistemological footing ( Dean, 1998 ;\nShirky, 2008 ). Arguably, social media have put paid to that brief\nperiod of relative stability. Conspiracists or at least those whodiscuss such phenomena as the link between 5G and thecoronavirus are among some of the high-pro \ufb01le in\ufb02uencers or\nmicrocelebrities found there ( Bruns et al., 2020 ). In turn, scholars\nnow write, as they did two decades earlier, that the internet is\u201cmainstreaming the fringe \u201d(Barkun, 2016 ).\nThe recent uptick in attention to the study of problematic\ncontent online could be attributed as well to the \u201cfake news crisis \u201d\nof 2016, where it was found that so-called fake newsoutperformed mainstream news on Facebook in the run-up tothe U.S. presidential elections that year ( Silverman, 2016 ). That\n\ufb01nding also set in motion the subsequent struggle around the\noccupation of the term from a type of news originating fromimposter media organisations or other dubious sources to a\nFrontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org July 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 689036 2Rogers Marginalizing the Mainstream\n\u201cpopulist \u201dcharge against mainstream and \u201celite\u201dmedia that seeks\nto delegitimate sources found publishing inconvenient ordispleasing stories ( van der Linden et al., 2020 ). In its recent\nstudy we have had calls to cease using the term, fake news ( Pepp\net al., 2019 ). There also has been a series of classi \ufb01cation moves.\nBoth the expansion as well as contraction of the notion may beseen in its reconceptualization by scholars as well as by theplatforms themselves ( Venturini, 2019 ). The de \ufb01nitional\nevolution is embodied in such phrasings as \u201cjunk news \u201dand\n\u201cproblematic information \u201d, which are broader in their\nclassi \ufb01cation, while the platforms appear to prefer terms such\nas\u201cfalse \u201d(Facebook), which is narrower ( Rogers, 2020a ). On the\nback-end the platform companies also develop responses to theseactivities. They would like to automate as well as outsource itsdetection and policing, be it through low-wage, outsourced\ncontent moderators (volunteer) fact-checking out \ufb01ts or user-\ncentred collaborative \ufb01ltering such as Twitter \u2019s\u201cbirdwatchers \u201d,\nan initiative they say born of societal distaste for a centraldecision-making authority, as found through qualitativeinterviews ( Gillespie, 2018 ; Roberts, 2019; Coleman, 2021 ).\nThey also take major decisions to label content by worldleaders (and indeed have world leader content policies), whichsubsequently land platform governance and decision-making inthe spotlight ( Twitter, 2019 ).\nMore broadly there has been a rise in the study of\n\u201ccomputational propaganda \u201dand \u201carti\ufb01cial ampli \ufb01cation \u201d\nwhich the platforms refer to as \u201cinauthentic behavior \u201d\n(Woolley and Howard, 2016; Colombo and De Gaetano,\n2020 ). These may take the form of bots or trolls; they may be\n\u201ccoordinated \u201dby\u201ctroll armies \u201d, which has been outlined in\nFacebook \u2019s regular \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior reports \u201d\n(Facebook, 2021 ). As its head of security policy puts it, Facebook\nde\ufb01\nnes it (in a plain speak manner) as \u201cpeople or pages working\ntogether to mislead others about who they are or what they aredoing \u201d(Facebook, 2018 ). Occasionally data sets become available\n(by Twitter or other researchers) that purport to be collections oftweets by these inauthentic, coordinated campaigners,\nwhereupon scholars (among other efforts) seek to make sense\nof which signals can be employed to detect them ( Roeder, 2018 ).\nOther types of individuals online have caught the attention of\nthe platforms as \u201cdangerous \u201d(Facebook), and have been\ndeplatformed, a somewhat drastic step that follows (repeated)violations of platform rules and presumably temporarysuspensions ( Rogers, 2020b ).\u201cDemonetisation \u201dalso is among\nthe platforms \u2019repertoire of actions, should these individuals,\nsuch as extreme internet celebrities, be turning vitriolinto revenue, though there is also the question of whichadvertisers attach themselves (knowingly or not) to such\ncontent ( Wilkinson and Berry, 2020 ). Moreover, there are\nquestions about why certain channels have been demonetizedfor being \u201cextremist \u201d. Others ask, is \u201ccounter-speech \u201dan\nalternative to counter-action ( Bartlett and Krasodomski-Jones,\n2015 ;Gagliardone, 2019 )?\nOn the interface, where the metrics are concerned, there may\nbe follower factories behind high follower and like counts(Lindquist, 2018 ). The marketing industry dedicated to social\nlistening as well as computational researchers have arrived at aseries of rules of thumb as well as signal processing that aid in the\n\ufb02agging or detection of the inauthentic. Just as sudden rises in\nfollower counts might indicate bought followers, a sudden declinesuggests a platform \u201cpurge \u201dof them (Confessore et al., 2018).\nPerhaps more expensive followers gradually populate an account,\nmaking it appear natural. Indeed, there is the question of whichkinds of (purchased) followers are \u201cgood enough \u201dto count and be\ncounted. What is the minimum amount of grooming? Can it beautomated, or is there always some human touch? Finally, there isa hierarchy in the industry, where Instagram followers are themost sought after, but \u201cin\ufb02uencers \u201d(who market wares there) are\noften contractually bound to promise that they have not\u201cparticipated in comment pods (group \u201cliking \u201dpacts), botting\n(automated interactions), or purchasing fake followers \u201d(Ellis,\n2019 ).\nHaving touched upon the current state of uncertainty\nonline, I would like to turn to how problematicinformation manifests itself in social media platformsaround speci \ufb01c issues. The following recounts a cross-\nplatform analysis into the \u201cmisinformation problem \u201din\nthe run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. As notedabove, the overall approach is to study most engaged-withcontent with a sensitivity to platform metrics, vernaculars ofuse and user subcultures. It relates a set of empirical studiesthat enquire into the extent to which platforms are againmainstreaming the fringe, examining more speci \ufb01cally those\nspaces conjured through \u201cserious queries\n\u201dthat contain\nelection-related as well as COVID-19 information ( Rogers,\n2021 ). When querying political hashtags, candidate and party\nnames as well as issues, and sifting through the content mostinteracted with on the platforms, how do more mainstreamsources fare in comparison to those characterized asproblematic? More to the point, is social mediamarginalizing the mainstream?\nHere I take the most salient \ufb01ndings per platform in turn,\nbefore concluding with a discussion of the emergence of editorialepistemologies put into use by social media platforms as well as\nsearch engines. Editorial source adjudication is a remarkable\ntransformation in how these platforms sift and \ufb01lter sources,\nindicating an exceptional information state, a point upon which Iconclude.\nTIKTOK: INSTILLING DOUBT IN\nMAINSTREAM ACCOUNTS\nTikTok is not usually considered a site for political encounter, but\nrecently the short video sharing platform, used predominantly byyouth, has posted rules about political content, indicating itsgrowing presence there. It also warns against \u201cmisleading\ninformation \u201dand urges users to \u201cverify facts using trusted\nsources \u201d, suggesting that misinformation could be worthy of\ninvestigation on the platform ( Mahendran and Alsherif, 2020 ).\nApart from how to locate political content, we asked, how doTikTok users express themselves politically ( S\u00e1nchez-Querub\u00edn\net al., 2021 )? How may forms of creative expression on TikTok\nmanifest themselves as misinformation?\nFrontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org July 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 689036 3Rogers Marginalizing the Mainstream\nTikTokers employ a range of creative expression such as\nsinging, dancing, duet, lip-syncing, mimicking, \ufb01nger dancing,\nviral sounds and facial expressions. Some have speci \ufb01c\nconnotations for TikTok insiders and make for trends.\nHaving queried election related hashtags, such as\n#trump2020 and #biden 2020, it was found \ufb01rst that\nTikTokers make copious use of political hashtags, attachingboth Trump and Biden-related hashtags to the same video,\nthereby striving to maximize the audience and view counts,rather than identify with one candidate or another. In theanalysis, the researchers undertook a format and contentanalysis of the top 30 videos per hashtag query, examiningwhich forms of creative expression are used in political videosand where misinformation may be imparted.\nThree forms stood out: lip-synching, viral sounds and facial\nexpressions. TikTokers match the lip movements of the\ncandidates, often sarcastically, for example when thecomedian, Sarah Cooper, 2020 lip-synched Trump \u2019s remarks\nduring a White House brie \ufb01ng on using ultraviolet light and\ndetergent to thwart the coronavirus (2020). The other forms ofcreative expression of interest here are viral audio and facialexpression. For instance, \u201cRide It \u201dby Regard is a viral sound that\nis often paired with \ufb01nger dancing to relate stories of cultural\nmisunderstanding. It was found that TikTokers use it whendealing with accusations of being a Trump supporter, such as\u201cget called racist 24/7 \u201d(sound), \u201cget yelled at for presenting facts \u201d\n(sound), and \u201caccused of not respecting women \u201d(sound). The\nviral sound denotes being misunderstood, eliciting sympathy butalso a knowing smile.\nFinally, the facial expression that approximates the doubtful\nemoji is another creative expression often encountered. In thesevideos news footage may be cut into the shots, such as multipleclips of Joseph Biden hugging women, with the intention to sewdoubt about his \ufb01tness for presidential of \ufb01ce. Here we found\nmany of the political videos instilling mistrust in news clipsthrough sarcastic and doubtful facial expressions. Such a\ufb01nding prompted consideration of adding \u201cinstilling mistrust \u201d\nas a category to the spectrum of misinformation types developed\nbyWardle (2017) , which ranges from parody (least intent to\ndeceive) through misleading content and false context tofabricated (most intent). Alternatively, one could argue that onTikTok all categories of misinformation could be hybridized, forTikTokers are employing parody when simultaneouslyintroducing misleading content, false context or othermisinformation types.\n4CHAN AND REDDIT: REFERENCING\nEXTREME YOUTUBE CONTENT\nUnlike public-facing platforms such as Facebook and Twitter,\nwhere users cultivate an online self, 4chan and Reddit are so-called masked spaces of anonymous users ( De Zeeuw and\nTuters, 2020 ). Particularly the board, 4chan/pol, and the\nsubreddit, r/TheDonald, have been associated with election\npolitics, and especially the 2016 Trump campaign, wheresupport for his candidacy took the form of \u201cthe great meme\nwar\u201d, which comprised the deployment of vernacular\nlanguage, image macros and other tactical media to supportthe candidate \u2019sc a u s e( Donovan, 2019 ). Previous research into\nmisinformation in 4chan/pol and across Reddit found little\nreference to outwardly problematic sources, such as imposternews sites or (Russian) disinformation, but rather numerouslinks to extreme videos on YouTube that were later removed(Hagen and Jokubauskait \u02d9e, 2020). Thus, while not necessarily a\nspace that links to disinformation sources, it is problematic forother reasons.\nHere, in the context of the run-up to the U.S. presidential\nelections of 2020, the research enquired into the extent to whichU.S.-based political boards and forums on 4chan and Redditshare misinformation and \u201cjunk \u201dcontent, and more speci \ufb01cally\nimposter news and other types of \u201cpink slime \u201dwebsites, termed as\nsuch for the use of low-cost, newspaper-like sites often publishingrepurposed content ( Tarkov, 2012 ;Bengani, 2019 ). We also were\nquestioning the interest these boards and communities mighthave in what has been termed an \u201calternative in \ufb02uence network \u201d,\na group of extreme social media in \ufb02uencers that \u201cfacilitates\nradicalization \u201d(Lewis, 2018 ). The research employed the so-\ncalled \u201cneedle-to-haystack \u201dtechnique, querying 4chan/pol and\nall of Reddit for the URLs of the pink slime websites, and the\u201chaystack-to-needle \u201dtechnique which queries an expert list of\nproblematic sources (hosts) in the same platform datasets (Hagen\nand Jokubauskait \u02d9e, 2020).\nNo pink slime sites were encountered, suggesting either their\nlack of signi \ufb01cance (despite returning high in Google queries) or\nthe media literacy of the users on the boards and communities (orboth). Scant amounts of problematic sources were found but likein previous research copious YouTube links were identi \ufb01ed,\nwhich led to the inquiry into whether YouTubers from thealternative in \ufb02uence network are signi \ufb01cantly present in those\nonline cultures. The alternative in \ufb02uence network is described\nhere as a set of YouTube channels \ufb02uctuating between \u201cnews and\npersonality-centric vlogging, spreading misinformation-laden\ncommentary \u201d(Burton and Koehorst, 2020 ). Indeed, many of\nthese channels were found between the boards and subredditsunder study, though their presence was unequally distributed.4chan/pol and Reddit are rather different in their mediaconsumption, with political Reddit preferring to referencevideos using the \u201calternative debate style\n\u201dand/pol electing\nmore for the \u201ctoxic vox populist \u201dstyle of single person, direct-\nto-audience ( Tuters and Burton, 2021 ). Indicating their extreme\nspeech, a signi \ufb01cant percentage of the YouTube videos referenced\non 4chan has been removed by the platform.\nTWITTER: HYPERPARTISAN SOURCES IN\nASCENDANCY\nLike Facebook and to a lesser extent Instagram, Twitter also has\nbeen the focus of public attention concerning misinformationaround the 2016 United States presidential elections and beyond.Twitter, rather unlike the other two platforms, has aided\nFrontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org July 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 689036 4Rogers Marginalizing the Mainstream\nresearchers in its study through providing curated data sets of\nRussian and alleged Iranian trolls and in \ufb02uence campaigners, or\nwhat are referred to as inauthentic users ( Gadde and Roth, 2018 ).\nThus, in the study of misinformation on Twitter, there are\ngenerally two strands of analysis to consider \u2014problematic\ncontent as well as users. During the 2016 election campaigningand running through to at least late 2019, much of that contentand those users, described as \u201csprawling inauthentic operation\n[s]\u201dwere promoting \u201cpro-Trump messages \u201d(Romm and Stanley-\nBecker, 2019 ).\nHere we revisit these claims through a study of the content and\nusers on \u201cpolitical Twitter \u201din the early run up to the 2020\nUnited States presidential elections, where we examine resultsets of queries for election-related hashtags and keywords,together with the users most active in deploying them ( Groen\nand Geboers, 2021 ). How much problematic information is\npresent in the most interacted-with content on politicalTwitter? Are problematic users among the most active? Arethey generally of a particular political persuasion?\nThe content under study are the URLs (hosts) that are\nreferenced in the tweets, and the most active users de \ufb01ned as\nthose who tweet the most. In a three-week timeframe prior to andjust after Super Tuesday (March 2020), when a cluster of electionprimaries and caucuses were held, we compared the hosts to a listof problematic sources curated by combining pre-existing labelingsites, including ( Allsides, 2020 ;Media Bias/Fact Check, 2020 ;\nOtero, 2020 )\u201cthe Chart \u201d,a n d NewsGuard, 2020 . We also\nconsulted Wikipedia and other news sources mentioning thesources in question. With one exception (related to the queryDACA, the immigration issue), we found little reference todisinformation, imposter news sources, pseudo-science,conspiracy theory sources or extreme sites. When expandingthe de \ufb01nition of problematic information to include\nhyperpartisan sites, however, over half would fall into thatcategory, with the implication that social media (or at least agoodly share of users of \u201cpolitical Twitter \u201d) appear to marginalize\nmainstream sources. Put differently, if we were to employ Craig\nSilverman \u2019so r i g i n a ld e \ufb01nition of \u201cfake news \u201d, it could be said to\noutperform mainstream sources anew, as it had in the immediaterun-up to the 2016 United States elections (on Facebook) (2016).\nFor the study of the most active users, we analyzed\n\u201cauthenticity \u201dwith the aid of Sparktoro, 2021 which employs\nindicators (abnormal tweeting activity, unusual combinations offollowers/following, etc.) to make a determination. We also\nstudied user partisanship or side-taking through qualitative\npro\ufb01le analysis. Our \ufb01ndings are not dissimilar to others in\nthat there is far more inauthenticity in the pro-Trump userbase, but we also found that there are a few \ufb02agged users on\nthe other side of the political spectrum, too.\nFACEBOOK: THE SEMINAL \u201cFAKE NEWS \u201d\nPROBLEM PERSISTS\nJournalists began calling Facebook the seminal \u201cfake news\nmachine \u201d(Gallucci, 2016 ) just after the \ufb01nding made byBuzzfeed News that so-called fake news was liked and shared\nmore than mainstream news on the social media platform in thethree months prior to 2016 U.S. presidential elections ( Silverman,\n2016 ). Since then, there has been a steady stream of stories from\nFacebook \u2019s corporate blog concerning both its crackdowns on\n\u201cinauthentic coordinated behavior \u201d,o ri n \ufb02uence campaigning, as\nwell as its initiatives to curb misinformation and \u201cfalse news \u201d,\nwhich is a narrow de \ufb01nition including pseudo-science and\nconspiracy sites though excluding hyperpartisan ones ( Mosseri,\n2017 ). The measures began in at least april 2017 with among\nother plans to economically disincentivize such sources as theinfamous Macedonian fake news factory that chose divisive pro-Trump messaging (over pro-Sanders \u2019) because it brought in far\nmore revenue ( Silverman and Alexander, 2016 ;Tynan, 2016 ).\nHas much has changed in how well \u201cfake news \u201dis consumed on\nthe platform since 2016?\nResearchers and I revisited the original Buzzfeed News story\nand its data journalism method in order to investigate the stateof the \u201cfake news \u201dproblem in Jan-March 2020 (Rogers, 2020),\nwhich is roughly the \ufb01rst of the three timeframes under\nconsideration in the original Buzzfeed News piece entitled,\n\u201cviral fake election news stories outperformed real news on\nFacebook \u201d(Silverman, 2016 ). Though it would change\ndramatically, in Feb-Apr 2016, the share and like counts ofmainstream news were well ahead of those of \u201cfake news \u201d,\nwhich Silverman de \ufb01ned as sources ranging from \u201choax sites\n[to] hyperpartisan blogs \u201d. Using election-related queries in\nBuzzSumo, 2020 , the social media research and monitoring\ntool, we compiled a list of sources and characterized them withthe aid of a series pre-existing \u201cbias\u201dlabeling sites (including\n(AllSides, 2020 ;Media Bias/Fact Check, 2020 ;Otero, 2020 )\n\u201cthe Chart\n\u201dand NewsGuard) so that we had a rough indication\nof their quality and partisanship. Sources are categorized asproblematic or non-problematic (which more colloquiallycould be called \u201cmainstream \u201d), and those falling into the\nlatter category were subcategorized as (hyper)partisan-conservative (hyper)partisan-progressive or neither of the\ntwo, again with the aid of the existing labeling sites.\nProblematic sources included imposter news (and so-called\u201cpink slime \u201dsites), pseudo-science, conspiracy theory and\nextreme sites, as was done in the Twitter study above(Bengani, 2019 ).\nIf we continue to use Silverman \u2019s\u201cfake news \u201dde\ufb01nition (that\nincludes hyperpartisan sites) then Facebook \u2019sf a k en e w s\nproblem has worsened slightly. Compared to the same periodin 2016 the proportion of \u201cfake news \u201dengagement to that of\nmainstream news has increased from roughly 1 in 4 to 1 in 3.5.I f ,h o w e v e r ,w et i g h t e nt h ed e \ufb01nition, as Facebook has done, to\n\u201cfalse news \u201dand include in that category only the sources or\nstories \ufb02agged as \u201cproblematic \u201dthe scale of the problem drops\nsubstantially to 1 in 9. It should be noted that we encountered no\nimposter news sites, which may suggest that they are welltargeted by Facebook or that they are not signi \ufb01cantly\nresonating among users.\nNonetheless, in the last period under study in 2016, when\nSilverman found that \u201cfake news \u201dperformed well, imposter sites\n(as the Denver Guardian) comprised a majority of those most\nFrontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org July 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 689036 5Rogers Marginalizing the Mainstream\ninteracted-with. One implication of the \ufb01nding is that efforts to\nidentify imposter sites (and other \u201cpink slime \u201d) continue to have\nvalue, despite the fact that they are not yet well consumed.Another implication is that if the problem remains of a\nsmaller scale, scaled-up fact-checking may continue to \ufb01nd its\nplace among the counter-initiatives, rather than only masscontent moderation and automation.\nINSTAGRAM: INFLUENCERS AS\nRESPONSIBLE INFORMATION SOURCES?\nInstagram had been one of the more understudied and under-\nappreciated social media platforms when it came tomisinformation. That changed with the release of two majorreports on the Russian disinformation campaigning surroundingthe 2016 United States presidential elections ( DiResta et al., 2018 ;\nHoward et al., 2018 ). In fact, in one study, it was noted that unlike\nthe other social media platforms Instagram actually saw a rise indisinformation activity in the period just after the elections(Howard et al., 2018 ). Many of the posts, including memes,\nwere openly divisive, but others were sarcastic and more\ndif\ufb01cult to decode with respect to stance or side-taking. As\nscholars have found, over the past few years more and morecontent online could be described as equivocal or ambivalent,where the sincerity of the post and the sender is unclear ( Phillips\nand Milner, 2017 ;Hedrick et al., 2018 ).\nIn the study of election-related Instagram posts in the early\nrun-up to the 2020 United States presidential elections (Jan-April2020), we enquired into the amount of divisive and ambivalentposts, compared to non-divisive and earnest ones ( Colombo and\nNiederer, 2021 ). How sarcastic and \u201cedgy \u201dare the top election-\nrelated posts on Instagram? Does it form the dominant mode of\npolitical discourse on the platform? We also are interested inwhether misinformation is spread in this divisive, ambivalentstyle. To begin to answer these questions, we queriedCrowdTangle, Facebook \u2019s content monitoring tool, for the\nnames of the candidates and select social issues (healthcare,gun control, COVID-19 and 5G), and coded the top 50 postsfor divisiveness (or non-divisiveness) and ambivalence (or\nearnestness), whereby each post is ultimately given a hybrid\nlabel, e.g., divisive-ambivalent. We scrutinized the candidate-orissue-related posts by in \ufb02uencers that had particularly high\nengagement scores, often at the top of the rankings. We alsosought misinformation.\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, we found that the vast majority of\nthe top posts concerning the candidates as well as the social issuesare earnest and non-divisive. Virtually no posts were found to bedivisive and ambivalent. Indeed, most posts were sincereexpressions of support. Of the few divisive posts which the\ncoders additionally found to be earnest, half were by Donald\nTrump or Donald Trump, Jr, and most of the rest concern Trumpor gun control. Apart from a few posts pushing a conspiracytheory surrounding 5G and COVID-19 (including one post thatranked second in engagement), no other misinformation wasencountered. The top 5G related post, by an in \ufb02uencer, debunkedthe conspiracy. Indeed, with a few exceptions we also found that\nthe in \ufb02uencers were posting responsibly and earnestly.\nIn a separate exercise we studied the authenticity of the\nfollowers as well as the political parties, employing the\nHypeAuditor, 2020 tool. While the Republican Party \u2019s account\nhad over 25% of suspect followers, and Trump \u2019s had 25%, the\nother candidates and party were not far behind at 20%. It shouldbe noted, though, that when separating the two categories thatmake up inauthentic followers \u2014\u201cmass follower \u201daccounts and\n\u201csuspect \u201daccounts \u2014the Republican Party and Trump tally\nhigher on suspicious followers, de \ufb01ned as \u201cInstagram bots and\npeople who use speci \ufb01c services for likes, comments and followers\npurchase \u201d(Komok, 2018 ).\nGOOGLE WEB SEARCH: LIBERAL\nSOURCES OUTNUMBER CONSERVATIVEONES\nWhile Google Web Search could be considered the dominant\ninformation machine online, among the major platforms andonline services it has been one of the least studied formisinformation. Recognizing the potential for its spread\nduring the pandemic, or what the head of the WHO called the\n\u201cinfodemic \u201d(UN DGC, 2020 ), Google has been curating the\nresults for queries concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, with sidebars ordering the of \ufb01cial information served, and results geo-\ntailored to provide local and national resources. Such informationcuration is considered unprecedented, unless one counts Google \u2019s\ndisclaimer notice on top of the results page for the query \u201cJew\u201d\n(Sullivan, 2004 ), or the cleaning up of autosuggested queries to\nremove ethnic, homosexual and other slurs ( Gibbs, 2016 ).\nAnother contemporary context behind the study of election-related Google results concerns the debate surrounding \u201cliberal\ntech bias \u201d(Schwartz, 2018 ). Could Google results be thought to\nexhibit a bias toward or against particular types of sites? How to\ncharacterize the sites returned for political queries?\nIn order to start to answer these questions, we queried\ncandidate names, political parties and a host of election-related issues in Google, with results from the \u201cUnited States\nregion \u201dfrom January 12, 2019 to March 23, 2020 ( Torres, 2021 ).\nIn an examination of the top 20 results per query, we ask, how tocharacterize the sources returned? Are problematic sourcespresent and even highly ranked? How could the results becharacterized politically? To do the analysis, we curated asource list of problematic and non-problematic sources, largely\nnews and cultural commentary, combining a set of media labeling\nsources, as in the Twitter and Facebook projects discussed above.We also consulted Wikipedia and online news mentions ofpotentially problematic sources. The categorization isconsidered rough and is meant to give an indication ratherthan a determination. With the aid of the labeling sites, wealso assigned political leanings. There are two distinctivepolitical categorization schemes, one \u201cample \u201dand one\n\u201cnarrow \u201d, with the former merging center-left and left and\ncenter-right and right, and the latter only including explicitlyleft (liberal) or right (conservative) labels, according to the sites\nFrontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org July 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 689036 6Rogers Marginalizing the Mainstream\nthat sort sources in such a fashion. (When there was disagreement\namong the labeling sites, we went with the majority.) We alsolabeled the sites returned that fell outside the categories, such as\u201cspecial interest \u201d,\u201clocal news \u201dand \u201cof\ufb01cial\u201d.\nIn all we found that the Google results for our nearly 120\nqueries resulted in scant problematic information returned.Hardly present as well were of \ufb01cial sources that we de \ufb01ned as\nfederal or local government, intergovernmental agencies,politicians, or campaign websites. Special interest sites, a broadcategory ranging from think tanks to advocacy groups, have anoutsized presence in the results, however. These sites tend tospecialize in an issue or industry, which is also an indication ofhow Google values information sources. Most signi \ufb01cantly, when\nconsidering the political leanings of sources, it is striking thatGoogle could be said not to seek \u201cbalance \u201d. That is, liberal sources\noutnumber conservative ones in the results for all queries made.\nEmploying the \u201cample \u201dcategorization, the results were 6:1 in\nfavor of liberal sources, and 3:1 when employing the narrowerscheme.\nMAINSTREAMING THE FRINGE AND/OR\nMARGINALIZING THE MAINSTREAM?\nAt the outset the question to be addressed concerned the extent\nto which social media is \u201cmainstreaming the fringe \u201d,n o ts o\nunlike the early web, prior to the development ofepistemologies that placed it on \ufb01rmer ground. Among\nthose mentioned were the wisdom of the crowd such asWikipedia \u2019s collaborative editing, but there were others. For\ninstance, Yahoo! and DMOZ employed librarianship in theirdirectory-making, Google used hyperlink analysisscientometrically, and the early United States blogosphereconstituted a kind of fact-checking, epistemic community,\nmost famously uncovering faked documents held up as\nauthentic by an authoritative TV news program (60M i n u t e s ) ,i nw h a th a sb e c o m ek n o w na st h e \u201cKillian\ndocuments controversy \u201d(Callery and Proulx, 1997 ;\nLangville and Meyer, 2006 ;Wikipedia contributors, 2020 ).\nHere we now ask the same of social media. How tocharacterize the current epistemological foundations ofonline platforms?\nIn order to grapple with that question, I brie \ufb02y sum up the\n\ufb01ndings with respect to the relationship between the\nmainstream and the fringe per platform and drawconclusions from our cross-pl atform approach. Generally\nspeaking, social media and its users appear to be\nmarginalizing the mainstream . Subsequently, I discuss the\nprospects of source adjudication in terms of results curationor otherwise managing which content is allowed to remain onsocial media platforms. It is a form of \u201cplatform criticism \u201dthat\nspeaks to the various emerging epistemologies on offer tostabilize social media.\nThe social media platforms under study have varied\nrelationships with mainstream media, at least with respectto those sources or posts most interacted with in the early run-up to 2020 United States presidential elections. Broadlyspeaking, TikTok parodies it, 4chan and Reddit dismiss it\nand direct users to alternative in \ufb02uencer networks and extreme\nYouTube content. Twitter prefers the hyperpartisan over it.Facebook \u2019s\u201cfake news \u201dproblem also concerns declining\namounts of mainstream media referenced. Instagram has\nin\ufb02uencers (rather than, say, experts) dominating user\nengagement. By comparison, Google Web Search buoys theliberal mainstream (and sinks conservative sites), but generallygives special interest sources, as they were termed in the study,the privilege to provide information rather than of \ufb01cial\nsources.\nGiven the decline of what one could call \u201cmainstream\nauthority \u201donline, how to characterize the contemporary\napproaches to source adjudication, when consideringproblematic information? That platforms are manually editing\nresults (for certain queries) indicates what I would call an\n\u201cexceptional information state \u201d.\nRecently, social media platforms and Google web search have\nbegun to curate the results of such \u201cserious queries \u201das\ncoronavirus, COVID-19 and similar terms related to the globalpandemic. Such \ufb01ltering may explain the scant amount of\noutwardly problematic information such as conspiracywebsites encountered in the top results for coronavirus queriesacross the platforms. It does, however, raise the question of theepistemology behind the authority that is being applied, andwhether it puts paid (for example) to the signals approach of\nalgorithms, and instead puts forward \u201cediting in \u201dof\ufb01cial sources\nas the top content recommended.\nEDITORIAL EPISTEMOLOGIES\nSource list or results curation is laborious work and fell intodecline with the overall demise of the human editing of the\nw e ba n dt h er i s eo ft h eb a c k - e n d ,a n da l g o r i t h m i cs i g n a l s ,\ntaking over from the editors ( Rogers, 2013 ). COVID-19 and\nthe coronavirus are thus exceptional for they have marked thereturn of the editors and raise the question of whether theirwork should extend beyond pandemic sources to election-related information, as discussed above. MaintainingCOVID-19 and the coronavirus as an exceptionalinformation state would draw the line there, though casescould be made to extend the adjudicative practice to thedemocratic process, where policymakers especially in Europehave directed their efforts. France \u2019s false news legislation\ncomes to mind, as does Germany \u2019s extension of its hate\nspeech act. There are also Facebook \u2019se f f o r t st om a i n t a i na\npolitical ad archive tool. Each is (partially) a response toconcerns of a repeat, in Europe and beyond, of the \u201cfake\nnews \u201dcrisis of 2016.\nSo far, the pandemic and (for some) election-related matters\nare\u201cserious queries \u201din the sense that the information returned\nshould not be fully in the hands of current trends in algorithmicculture but returned to editors. With content reviewers andmoderators, there is currently a blurring (and in a sensecheapening) of editors, however. Their low-wage, outsourcedwork to date has had to do with violent and pornographic\nFrontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org July 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 689036 7Rogers Marginalizing the Mainstream\ncontent rather than the \u201cquality of information \u201d(Roberts, 2019).\nThere is the question of the journalistic training andquali\ufb01cations for the editing work ( Parks, 2019 ). The\nprofessional fact-checking editors, as mentioned above, would\nstruggle with volume.\nThere are advocates of an editorial recovery online. Source\nadjudication techniques on offer these days for results curationare, among others, journalistic balance, the absence of biasedsources, fact-checked stories, and \u201clongue dur\u00e9e \u201dexpertize, be it\nof\ufb01cial and/or established. Crowd-sourcing users to \ufb02ag\ninappropriate content or only checking trending content arealso available approaches. All mark the return of qualitativelydetermining the worthiness of source appearance and could bedubbed editorial epistemologies. Each requires particularjudgements in advance of the moment of gaveling the A/B or\nignore/delete decision, as platforms are wont to decide to allow a\npost or not. (For world leaders, as mentioned, the posts may belabeled.) There is also the question of handling the volume ofposts to be scrutinised.\nWhen curating results or otherwise managing outputs, to\nundertake \u201cbalanced list \u201dwork implies making political or\npartisan source distinctions, and continually returning to theoutputs to check the weight of each side per substantivequery. An approach seeking an \u201cabsence of biased sources \u201d\npresupposes classi \ufb01cation and monitoring and likely relying\non of \ufb01cial, institutionalized in formation. Fact-checking,\nrather than on a source level, switches the efforts to the\nindividual story, and subsequently researches, archives andlabels them. At least as it has been performed on Facebookposts by DPA and AFP, the German and French newsagencies respectively, it is such meticulous work that itoutputs a total of about four fact-checks per day, if theirproduction prior to the 2021 Dutch elections is exemplary(AFP, 2021 ;DPA, 2021 ). Relying on \u201clongue dur\u00e9e \u201dexpertize\ncould be another means of offering high-quality sources, asorganisations working in the same terrain for many yearswould have accrued credibility, but to of \ufb01cial sources it would\nadd non-governmental and other specialized organisations\nwith an established track reco rd (and perhaps a noticeable\npolitical leaning).\nAnother starting point is to take an active audience approach,\nand assume that another, perhaps more signi \ufb01cant instance of\n\ufb01ltering lies with the user or what was once known as the\n\u201cwisdom of the crowd \u201d. Users are able to \u201c\ufb02ag\u201dor report\ncontent on various platforms and label it as inappropriate,misleading, etc. Taking such user reporting practices a stepfurther, as mentioned above, Twitter \u2019s\u201cBirdwatch \u201dprogram\nseeks dedicated users (not so unlike Wikipedians, albeit\nwithout the non-pro \ufb01t spirit) to sift content and enforce\nplatform rules.\nAs demonstrated in the empirical research reported above,\nengagement measures that take into account rating (liking),circulating (sharing) and commenting (reading) are anothermeans to determine the activity of audiences. On Facebook,but also on Twitter (retweeting), one may inquire into the\nstories about the coronavirus and other issues makingaudiences active. Adjudicating only those posts with thehighest engagement would allow liking and sharing to trigger\neditorial interest.\nFinally, one also could argue for an \u201canything goes \u201dapproach\nto misinformation, returning to a pre-pandemic algorithmicsignals method operated in tandem with standard contentmoderation, editing out violence, pornography, terrorism andhate. Such a return would appear unlikely as it would imply aregress in content review standards on mainstream platforms. Forexample, since 2019, Twitter policies cover not justviolence but\nits\n\u201cglori\ufb01cation \u201d(Twitter, 2019 ), as publicized in a case of the\nlabeling a Donald Trump tweet as such. Indeed, more contenttypes are scrutinized these days. Speci \ufb01cally, since the\ncoronavirus pandemic, the types have been expanded to\ninclude \u201cmisleading \u201dinformation.\nWith respect to identifying such information, Twitter writes,\n\u201cmoving forward, we may use these labels ( ...) in situations\nwhere the risks of harm ( ...) are less severe but where people may\nstill be confused or misled by the content ( Roth and Pickles,\n2020 ). Setting aside for a moment the question of taking social\nmedia company utterances at face value ( John, 2019 ), the\nstatement raises the prospect that the new editorialepistemologies, together with the contestation thataccompanies their fundaments, may abide beyond the current\nexceptional information state.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in\nthe article/supplementary material, further inquiries can bedirected to the corresponding author.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe author con \ufb01rms being the sole contributor of this work and\nhas approved it for publication.\nFUNDING\nThe research has received funding from the European Union \u2019s\nHorizon 2020 research and innovation program under grantagreement No. 732942, project ODYCCEUS.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author would like to thank First Draft and the Public DataLab for collaborating on the project that resulted in the studiesreported here.\nFrontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org July 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 689036 8Rogers Marginalizing the Mainstream\nREFERENCES\nAFP (2021).

The increasing popularity of social media promotes the pro-\nliferation of fake news, which has caused signi\fcant negative societal\ne\u000bects. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently be-\ncome an emerging research area of great concern. With the development\nof multimedia technology, fake news attempts to utilize multimedia con-\ntent with images or videos to attract and mislead consumers for rapid\ndissemination, which makes visual content an important part of fake\nnews. Despite the importance of visual content, our understanding about\nthe role of visual content in fake news detection is still limited. This\nchapter presents a comprehensive review of the visual content in fake\nnews, including the basic concepts, e\u000bective visual features, representa-\ntive detection methods and challenging issues of multimedia fake news\ndetection. This chapter can help readers to understand the role of visual\ncontent in fake news detection, and e\u000bectively utilize visual content to\nassist in detecting multimedia fake news.\nKeywords: fake news detection \u00b7fake-news images \u00b7social media \u00b7im-\nage forensics \u00b7image repurposing \u00b7multimedia \u00b7multi-modal \u00b7deep learn-\ning \u00b7computer vision.\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Motivation\nSocial media platforms, such as Twitter1and Chinese Sina Weibo2, have become\nimportant access where people acquire the latest news and express their opin-\nions freely34.

For example, in the political \feld, during\nthe month before the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Americans\nencountered between one and three fake stories on average from known publish-\ners [1], which inevitably misled the voters and in\ruenced the election results; In\nthe economic \feld, a piece of fake news claiming that Barack Obama was injured\nin an explosion wiped out $130 billion in stock value5; In the social \feld, dozens\nof innocent people were beaten to death by locals in India because of a piece\nof fake news about child tra\u000ecking that was widely spread on social media6.\nHence, the automatic detection of fake news has become an urgent problem of\ngreat concern in recent years [18,33,49].\nThe development of multi-media technology promotes the evolution of self-\nmedia news from text-based posts to multimedia posts with images or videos,\nwhich attracts more attention from consumers and provides more credible sto-\nrytelling. On the one hand, as a vivid description form, the visual content in-\ncluding images and videos is more attractive and salient than plain text and\nconsequently boosts the news propagation. For instance, tweets with images get\n18% more clicks, 89% more likes, and 150% more retweets than those without\nimages7. On the other hand, visual content is often used as evidence of a story\nin our common sense, which can increase the credibility of the news8. Unfor-\ntunately, this advantage is also taken by fake news. For rapid dissemination,\nfake news usually contains misrepresented or even tampered images or videos\nto attract and mislead consumers. As a result, visual content has become an\nimportant part of fake news that cannot be neglected, making multimedia fake\nnews detection a new challenge.\nMultimedia fake news detection aims at e\u000bectively utilizing the information\nof several modalities, such as textual, visual and social modalities, to detect fake\nnews. Visual modality can provide abundant visual information, which is pre-\nliminarily proven to be e\u000bective in fake news detection [15]. However, although\nthe importance of exploiting visual content have been revealed, our understand-\ning about the role of visual content in fake news detection remains limited. To\nfurther facilitate research on this problem, we present a comprehensive review\nof the visual content in fake news in this chapter, including the problem de\f-\nnition, available visual characteristics, representative detection approaches and\nchallenging problems.\n5https://www.telegraph.co.uk/\fnance/markets/10013768/Bogus-AP-tweet-about-\nexplosion-at-the-White-House-wipes-billions-o\u000b-US-markets.html\n6https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia paci\fc/as-mob-lynchings-\nfueled-by-whatsapp-sweep-india-authorities-struggle-to-combat-fake-\nnews/2018/07/02/683a1578-7bba-11e8-ac4e-421ef7165923 story.html\n7https://www.invid-project.eu/tools-and-services/invid-veri\fcation-plugin/\n8https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190204005613/en/Visual-\nSearchWins-Text-Consumers%E2%80%99-Trusted-Information\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 3\n1.2 Problem De\fnition\nIn this subsection, we introduce the concept of fake news and analyze the di\u000ber-\nent types of visual content in fake news.\nFake news is widely de\fned as news articles that are intentionally and ver-\ni\fably false and could mislead consumers [1, 20, 33]. On the context of social\nmultimedia, news articles refer to news posts with multimedia content that are\npublished by users, so the general de\fnition of fake news has been further re-\n\fned [3,5,6,46]. Formally, we state the re\fned de\fnition as follows,\nDe\fnition 1.1 A piece of fake news is a news post that shares mul-\ntimedia content that does not faithfully represent the event that it\nrefers to .\nIn real-world scenarios, the visual content in fake news can be broadly clas-\nsi\fed into three categories: (1) visual content that is deliberately manipulated\n(also known as tampering, doctoring or photoshopping) or automatically gen-\nerated by deep generative networks, which equals to fake images/videos in our\ncommon sense (see Figure 1a), (2) visual content from an irrelevant event, such\nas a past event, a staged work or an artwork, that is reposted as being captured\nin the context of an emerging event (see Figure 1b), or (3) visual content that\nis real (not edited) but is published together with a false claim about the de-\npicted event (see Figure 1c). All examples in Figure 1 fall under our de\fnition of\nfake news, because the images and associated texts jointly convey the mislead-\ning information regardless of the veracity of the textual or the visual content\nitself. For this reason, fake news is also referred to as misleading content [6] or\nfauxtography [46] in the context of social multimedia.\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\nFig. 1: Examples of the visual content in fake news: (a) A tampered image where\nPutin is spliced on the middle seat at G-20 to show that he is in the center\nposition of an intense discussion among other world leaders; (b) A real image\ncaptured in 2009 New York air crash, but it is claimed to be the wrecked Malaysia\nAirlines MH370 in 2014; (c) A real image taken at the moment when Hillary\nClinton accidentally stumbled, but it was maliciously interpreted as evidence of\nClinton's failing health.\n4 J Cao et al.\n1.3 Organization\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we introduce\navailable visual features for fake news detection. We continue to present existing\napproaches utilizing visual content to detect fake news in Chapter 3. In Chapter\n4, we discuss several challenging problems for multimedia fake news detection.\nFinally, we summarize available data repositories, tools (or software systems)\nand relevant competitions about multimedia fake news detection research in the\nappendix.\n2 What Visual Content Tells?\nVisual content has been shown as an important promoter for fake news propa-\nganda9. At the same time, visual content also tells abundant cues for detecting\nfake news. To capture the distinctive characteristics of fake news, works ex-\ntracted visual features from visual content (generally, images and videos), which\ncan be categorized into four types: forensics features, semantic features, statis-\ntical features and context features.\n2.1 Forensics Features\nSince the addressed problem is the veri\fcation of multimedia posts, one rea-\nsonable approach would be to directly verify the truth of visual content, i.e.,\nwhether the image or video is captured in the event. Intuitively, if the visual\ncontent has undergone manipulation or severe re-compression, or is generated\nby deep learning techniques, the news post that it belongs to is likely to be fake.\nTo access the authenticity, (blind) forensics features which can highlight the dig-\nitally edited traces of the visual content, are exploited in fake news detection\nfrom di\u000berent perspectives, including the manipulation detection, generation de-\ntection and re-compression detection.\nManipulation Detection\nManipulation detection aims at looking for patterns or discontinuities left by\noperations such as splicing, copy-move and removal. The splicing refers to copy-\ning a part of one image and inserting it into another, while the copy-move and\nremoval both happen in the same image. Because very few works [3] directly\nused these features in fake news detection yet, we also investigated the features\nmentioned in related works and summarized as follows:\n{ Camera-related features are particular patterns caused by the imaging\npipeline, such as the sensor pattern noise and color \flter array interpola-\ntion patterns, which can be destroyed by manipulation. In previous works,\nPhoto-Response Non-Uniformity [11], noise inconsistencies [26] and local in-\nterpolation artifacts [10] were used to capture the change of those patterns.\n9https://www.wired.com/2016/12/photos-fuel-spread-fake-news/\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 5\n{ Discontinuities in spatial features are often left by forgery operations.\nTo highlight these cues, gray-level run length features [47] and local binary\npatterns over the steerable-pyramid-transformed image [28] were exploited.\nNote that some of them are only applicable to speci\fc types of manipulation,\nwhich is unknown in practice. Also, some widely-spread manipulated images may\nhave undergone multiple types of processing, increasing the challenge of captur-\ning the traces of manipulation.\nGeneration Detection\nAs the rapid improvement of deep generative networks (especially generative\nadversarial network, GAN [12]), people can easily generate more photorealis-\ntic images and videos, making it hard to distinguish from natural ones. These\nmisleading generated image and videos are often obtained by modifying the\nsemantically-focused elements, for instance, the faces (mostly of celebrities), rais-\ning new threat to the trustworthiness of the visual content.\nFor generated fake images, existing works mostly focus on detecting with\nsignal-level features. In the pixel domain, the co-occurrence matrices on three\ncolor channels were used for capturing spatial correlation characteristics, which\nwere fed into the following convolutional neural network (CNN) for detection\n[29]. In contrast, McCloskey et al. started with the observation in the frequency\ndomain that GAN images have more overlapping spectral responses among the\nRGB channels and negative weights than natural ones [27]. To represent these\ndi\u000berences, this work introduced intensity noise histograms and over-/under-\nexposed rate.\nFor generated fake videos, most works are devoted to the detection of Deep-\nFakes, a series of popular implementations for superimposing existing faces onto\nsource videos. Works for DeepFakes detection mostly focused on the local fea-\ntures caused by the transformation in face-swapping such as the lacking of re-\nalistic eye blinking [22], the errors of 3D head poses introduced in face splicing\nfor detection [44], and the artifacts left in warping to match the original faces [23].\nRe-compression Detection\nA fake image or video mostly su\u000bers multiple compression in two situations: one\nis that the visual content is manipulated and re-saved at last, while the other is\nthat it is repeatedly downloaded from and uploaded to the social media platform.\nThese two situations probably indicate deliberate manipulation of visual content\nor misuse of the outdated, so we can detect fake news by predicting whether the\nattached visual content has been re-compressed.\nFor images, MediaEval VMU Task [3] (see in Appendix) extracted features\ndirectly related to the compression according to [2, 21], including probability\nmap of the aligned/non-aligned double JPEG compression, potential primary\nquantization steps for the \frst 6 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coe\u000ecients\nof the aligned/non-aligned double JPEG compression and block artifact grid. By\nthresholding the aligned/non-aligned JPEG compression maps above, Boididou\net al. created two binary maps considered as object and background respec-\n6 J Cao et al.\ntively and extracted descriptive statistics (maximum, minimum, mean, median,\nmost frequent value, standard deviation and variance) for classi\fcation [4]. Qi\net al. calculated block DCT coe\u000ecients and then performed Fourier Transform\non them for enhancement to highlight the periodicity in the frequency domain\ncaused by re-compression [30]. Furthermore, because multiple spreads may cause\na dramatic decrease of clarity, no-reference quality measurement [41] can also\nindicate re-compression.\nFor videos, the methods exploited the presence of spikes in the Fourier trans-\nform of the energy of the displaced frame di\u000berence over time [37], blocking\nartifacts [24] and DCT coe\u000ecients of a macroblock [38] to detect the double-\ncompression (mostly in MPEG videos).\n2.2 Semantic Features\nFake news exploits the individual vulnerabilities of people and thus often relies\non sensational or even fake images to provoke anger or other emotional response\nof consumers for promoting the spread of fake news. Thus, images in fake news\noften show some distinct characteristics in comparison with real news at the\nsemantic level, such as visual impacts [16] and emotional provocations [33,36] as\nFigure 2 shows. Next, we introduce how to e\u000bectively extract semantic features\nof the visual content for fake news detection.\nFakeReal\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\nFig. 2: Comparison of images in fake and real news images at the semantic level.\nWe can \fnd that fake news images are more visually striking and emotional\nprovocative than real news images, even though they describe the same type of\nevents such as \fre (a), earthquake (b) and road collapse (c).\nCNN has exhibited great power in understanding image semantics and ob-\ntaining corresponding feature representations, which can be used for various vi-\nsual tasks. VGG [34] is one of the most popular CNN models, which is comprised\nof three basic types of layers: convolutional layers for extracting and transforming\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 7\nimage features, pooling layers for reducing the parameters, and fully connected\nlayers for classi\fcation tasks (see Figure 3). Most of existing works based on\nmultimedia content adopted the VGG model to extract visual semantic features\nfor fake news detection [9,15,40].\nFig. 3: Detailed architecture of the VGG16 framework.\nConv 2D\n3*3,32Conv 2D\n1*1,32Max\nPooling\n2*2Conv 2D\n3*3,64Conv 2D\n1*1,64Max\nPooling\n2*2Conv 2D\n3*3,64Conv 2D\n1*1,64Max\nPooling\n2*2Conv 2D\n3*3,128Conv 2D\n1*1,128Max\nPooling\n2*2Conv 2D\n1*1,64FCGRUGRU\nConv 2D\n1*1,64FCGRUGRU\nConv 2D\n1*1,64FCGRUGRU\nConv 2D\n1*1,64FCGRUGRU\n(224,224,3)\ud835\udc631\ud835\udc632 \ud835\udc633 \ud835\udc634\ud835\udc591 \ud835\udc592 \ud835\udc593 \ud835\udc594\nBranch1 Branch2 Branch3 Branch4\nFig. 4: Detailed architecture of the pixel domain sub-network in MVNN. For an\ninput image, a multi-branch CNN-RNN network is utilized to extract and fuse\nits pixel-domain features of di\u000berent semantic levels.\nIn addition to the basic CNN, some recent works proposed novel CNN-based\nmodels to better capture the visual semantic characteristics of fake news. For ex-\nample, Qi et al. proposed a multi-domain visual neural network (MVNN) to fuse\nthe visual information of frequency and pixel domains for detecting fake news,\nof which the pixel sub-network was used to extract visual semantic features\n(see Figure 4) [30]. Speci\fcally, two motivations were illustrated for the model\ndesign. First, CNN learns high-level semantic representations through layer-by-\nlayer abstraction from local to the global view, while the low-level features will\ninevitably su\u000ber some losses in the process of abstraction. Considering these se-\nmantic cues such as emotional provocations are related to many visual factors\nfrom low-level to high-level [19], a multi-branch CNN network was adopted to\nextract features of di\u000berent semantic levels in the pixel sub-network. Second,\nthere are strong bidirectional dependencies between di\u000berent levels of features.\nFor example, middle-level features such as textures, consist of low-level features\nsuch as lines, and meanwhile compose high-level features such as objects. There-\n8 J Cao et al.\nfore, the sub-network also utilized the bidirectional GRU to model the relations\nfrom two di\u000berent views.\n2.3 Statistical Features\nVisual content also has di\u000berent distribution patterns between fake and real news\non social media [17]. Intuitively, people tend to report the news with images taken\nby themselves at the event scene. If the event is real, then various images taken\nby di\u000berent witnesses would be posted while if fake, there are many repeatedly\nposted images with almost the same content, just as Figure 5 shows. Thus,\nwe introduce visual statistical features to re\rect this distributional di\u000berence\nbetween real and fake news.\n(a)\n (b)\nFig. 5: Examples of images in the real and fake news event. Obviously, images in\nthe real news event (a) are much more diverse than those in the fake one (b).\nSome works [17, 42, 43] used basic statistical features about the attached\nimages to assist in fake news detection, usually from three aspects:\n{ Count : The occurrence number of images. For example, Wu et al. used the\nnumber of illustrations to assist detect fake news posts [42,43], while Jin et\nal. used the ratio of news posts containing at least one or more than one\nimages to the total posts in a news event to detect fake news events [17].\n{ Popularity : The number of sharing on social media, such as re-tweets and\ncomments. Jin et al. de\fned the image with a high popularity as a hot image,\nand regarded the ratio of hot images to all distinct images in a news event\nas a statistical feature [17].\n{ Type : Some images have a particular type in resolution or style. For ex-\nample, long images are images with a very large length-to-width ratio. The\nratio of these types of images was also counted as a statistical feature [17].\nIn addition to these basic statistical features, Jin et al. also proposed \fve\nadvanced statistical features as follows [17]:\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 9\n{ Visual Clarity Score (VCS) : Visual clarity score measures the distribu-\ntion di\u000berence between two image sets: one is the image set in a certain\nnews event (event set) and the other is the image set containing images from\nall events (collection set). This feature was de\fned as the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence between the two language model representing the event set and\ncollection set, respectively. The bag-of-words image representation such as\nSIFT was used to de\fne the language models for images. Speci\fcally, the\nvisual clarity score is\nV CS =DKL(p(wjc)kp(wjk); (2.1)\nwhere p(wjc) and p(wjk) denote the term frequency of visual word w in\ncollection set and event set, respectively.\n{ Visual Coherence Score (VCoS) : Visual coherence score measures how\ncoherent the images in a certain news event are. This feature is computed\nbased on the visual similarity between any image pair within images in the\ntarget event image set, which is denoted as\nV CoS =1\njN(N\u00001)jX\ni;j=1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;N;i6=jsim(xi; xj) (2.2)\nwhere N is number of the images in the event set, sim(xi; xj) is the visual\nsimilarity between image xiand image xj. In implementation, the similarity\nbetween images is computed based on their GIST features.\n{ Visual Similarity Distribution Histogram (VSDH) : Visual similarity\ndistribution histogram describes the image similarity distribution in a \fne-\ngranularity level, which is computed based on the whole similarity matrix of\nall images in a target news event. The similarity matrix Sis quanti\fed into\nanH-bin histogram by mapping each element in the matrix into its corre-\nsponding bin, which results in a feature vector of Hdimensions representing\nthe similarity relations among images,\nV SDH (h) =1\nN2jf(i; j)ji; j\u0014N; m i;j2h\u0000thbingj; h= 1; : : : ; H (2.3)\n{ Visual Diversity Score (VDS) : Visual diversity score measures the visual\ndi\u000berence in the image set of a target news event. Assuming a ranking of\nimages x1; x2; : : : ; x Nin the event image set R, the diversity score of all\nimages in Ris,\nVDS =NX\ni=11\niiX\nj=1(1\u0000sim(xi; xj)) (2.4)\nIn implementation, images are ranked according to their popularity on so-\ncial media, based on the assumption that popular images may have better\nrepresentation for the news event.\n{ Visual Clustering Score (VCS) : Visual clustering score evaluates the\nimage distribution over all images in the news event from a clustering per-\nspective. It was de\fned as the number of clusters formed by all images in a\ntarget news event. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm is\nemployed to cluster these images.\n10 J Cao et al.\n2.4 Context Features\nAccording to our previous analysis, rumormongers usually use visual content\nfrom an irrelevant event to fabricate fake news. To make the fake news more\nreasonable, the selected visual content needs to be semantically coherent with\nthe claim. Therefore, existing works about text-image semantic similarity aren't\napplicable for these manipulations. Instead, one of the most e\u000bective methods\nis to utilize the context information of visual content to fact-check whether the\ncurrent event is the same as the original event it belongs to. Speci\fcally, we in-\ntroduce the following context features, which mainly extracted from two sources:\nthe metadata of visual content and the external knowledge such as relevant web\npages.\nMetadata\nMetadata is text information pertaining to an image/video \fle that is usually\nembedded into the \fle. Metadata includes not only the details relevant to the\nimage/video itself such as \fle size but also the information about its production,\nsuch as position and time, which are often used in manually fact-checking [7,45].\nHowever, these features are not that helpful in practice because they usually\nbecome unavailable after default processing by social media.\nExternal Knowledge\nIn addition to metadata, some works extracted context features from the external\nknowledge obtained through reverse image search. In contrast to classical image\nsearch, reverse image search takes an image as input and returns lo relevant web\npages that include the corresponding image, title, description and time. This\nprocess can be easily automated and applied to a large number of images via\nsome search engine APIs like google reverse image search10. Next, we introduce\nthree context features as follows.\n{ Timespan : Timespan is de\fned as the time delay between the published\ntime of the news and the earliest published time of the visual content. This\nfeature is proposed to verify the originality of the visual content [35]. If\nthe timespan is bigger than a speci\fc threshold, then the visual content is\nprobably from an irrelevant event.\n{ Inter-claim similarity : Inter-claim similarity is de\fned as the similarity\nbetween the claim and the textual contents of these crawled websites. Con-\nsidering that the text information of these crawled websites is helpful for\nunderstanding the original event of the image, this feature is used to verify\nthe event consistency between the textual claim and corresponding visual\ncontent [48].\n{ Platform credibility : Platform credibility means the credibility of the\nsource platform where the visual content was published [48]. By using the\ndataset of Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)11, a web site that provides factu-\nality information about 2700+ media sources, each web page that is returned\n10https://images.google.com/\n11http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 11\nby the reverse image search was classi\fed into the following categories: high\nfactuality, low factuality and mixed factuality. The percentage of web pages\nfrom each category returned by the reverse image search was de\fned as the\nplatform credibility feature.\n3 How Visual Content Helps?\nIn the previous section, we introduced four types of visual features from dif-\nferent perspectives, i.e., forensics features, semantic features, statistical features\nand context features, for multimedia fake news detection. These features re-\n\rect the characteristics of visual content and are usually combined in prac-\ntice for covering more situations. In this section, we discuss the details of sev-\neral existing approaches utilizing visual content to detect fake news, which can\nbe broadly classi\fed into content-based approaches and knowledge-based ap-\nproaches. Content-based approaches focus on capturing and combining the\ncues from contents of di\u000berent modalities for fake news detection, without using\nany reference datasets. Knowledge-based approaches aim to use external\nsources to fact-check input claims. They assume the existence of a relatively\nlarge reference dataset and assess the integrity of the news post by comparing\nit to one or more posts retrieved from the reference dataset.\n3.1 Content-based Approaches\nA complete news story consists of textual and visual content simultaneously,\nwhich both provide distinctive cues for detecting fake news. Therefore, recent\nworks on this problem focus on utilize and e\u000bectively fuse information from mul-\ntiple modalities. Mostly, these works simply used a common recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) and a pre-trained CNN to obtain the textual and visual se-\nmantic features. Next, we introduce three state-of-the-art approaches that fuse\nmultimodal information for fake news detection.\nJin et al. [15] \frst incorporated multi-modal contents via deep neural net-\nworks to solve fake news detection problem. It proposed an innovative RNN\nwith an attention mechanism (attRNN, see Figure 6a) for e\u000bectively fusing the\ntextual, visual and social context features. For a given tweet, its text and social\ncontext are \frst fused with an LSTM for a joint representation. This representa-\ntion is then fused with visual features extracted from pre-trained deep CNN. The\noutput of the LSTM at each time step is employed as the neuron-level attention\nto coordinate visual features during the fusion.\nWang et al. [40] proposed an end-to-end event adversarial neural network\n(EANN, see Figure 6b) to detect newly-emerged fake news events based on\nevent-invariant multi-modal features. It consists of three main components: the\nmulti-modal feature extractor, the fake news detector, and the event discrimina-\ntor. The multi-modal feature extractor is responsible for extracting the textual\nand visual features from posts. It cooperates with the fake news detector to\nlearn the discriminable representation for fake news detection. The role of event\n12 J Cao et al.\n(a)\n (b)\n(c)\nFig. 6: Architectures of three state-of-the-art multi-modal models for fake news\ndetection. (a) attRNN. (b) EANN.

[9] utilized a multi-modal variational autoencoder (MVAE, see\nFigure 6c) trained jointly with a fake news detector to learn a shared repre-\nsentation of textual and visual information. The model consists of three main\ncomponents: an encoder, a decoder and a fake news detector module. The varia-\ntional autoencoder is capable of learning probabilistic latent variable models by\noptimizing a bound on the marginal likelihood of the observed data. The fake\nnews detector then utilizes the multi-modal representations obtained from the\nbi-modal variational autoencoder to classify posts as fake or not.\n3.2 Knowledge-based Approaches\nReal-world multimedia news is often composed of multiple modalities, like the\nimage or a video with associated text and metadata, where information about\nan event is incompletely captured by each modality separately. Such multime-\ndia data packages, i.e., the tuples of multi-modal information of the posts, are\nprone to manipulations, where a subset of these modalities can be modi\fed to\nmisrepresent or repurpose the multimedia package. However, the details being\nmanipulated are subtle and often interleaved with the truth, causing that the\ncontent-based approaches can hardly detect these manipulations. Faced with\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 13\nthis problem, knowledge-based approaches utilize external sources, a reference\ndataset of unmanipulated packages as a source of world knowledge, to help verify\nthe semantic integrity of the multimedia news. In the following, we introduce\nsome representative knowledge-based methods.\nJaiswal et al. [13] \frst formally de\fned the multimedia semantic integrity as-\nsessment problem and combined deep multi-modal representation learning with\noutlier detection methods to assess whether a caption was consistent with the\nimage in its package (see Figure 7). Data packages in the reference dataset were\nused to train a deep multi-modal representation learning model, which was then\nused to assess the integrity of query packages by calculating image-caption con-\nsistency scores and employing outlier detection models to \fnd their inlierness\nwith respect to the reference dataset.\nFig. 7: The package integrity assessment system of [13].\nSimilarly, Sabir et al. [31] proposed a novel deep multi-modal model (see\nFigure 8) to verify the integrity of multimedia packages. The proposed model\nconsists of four modules: (1) feature extraction, (2) feature balancing, (3) package\nevaluation and (4) integrity assessment. For each query package, the model \frst\nuses similarity scoring to retrieve a package from the reference dataset, taking\nthe query package and the top-1 related package as the input of the model. Af-\nter passing to the feature extraction and balancing modules, query and retrieved\npackages are transformed into a single feature vector. The package evaluation\nmodule, the core of the proposed model, consists of the related package and single\npackage sub-modules. The related package sub-module consisted of two siamese\nnetworks. The \frst network is a relationship classi\fer that veri\fes whether the\nquery package and top-1 package are indeed related, while the second network\nis a manipulation detector that determines whether the query package is a ma-\nnipulated version of the top-1 retrieved package. Since manipulation detection\nis dependent on the relatedness of the two packages, the relationship classi\fer\ncontrols a forget gate which scales the feature vector of the manipulation detec-\n14 J Cao et al.\ntor according to the relatedness between the two packages. In the meantime, a\nsingle package module veri\fes the coherency (i.e., integrity) of the query package\nalone. The integrity assessment module concatenated feature vectors from both\nrelated and single package modules for manipulation classi\fcation.\nFig. 8: The Package Integrity Assessment Model of [31].\nOne of the main challenges for developing multimedia semantic integrity\nassessment methods is the lack of training and evaluation data. In light of this,\nJaiswal et al. [14] proposed a novel framework, Adversarial Image Repurposing\nDetection (AIRD) (see Figure 9), for image repurposing detection, which can\nbe trained in the absence of training data containing manipulated metadata.\nAIRD is to simulate the real-world adversarial interplay between a bad actor who\nrepurposes images with counterfeit metadata and a watchdog who veri\fes the\nsemantic consistency between images and their accompanying metadata. More\nspeci\fcally, AIRD consists of two models: a counterfeiter and a detector, which\nare trained in an adversarial way. While the detector gathers evidence from the\nreference set, the counterfeiter exploits it to conjure convincingly deceptive fake\nmetadata for a given query package.\n4 Challenging Problems\nIn the previous sections, we introduce several visual features and existing ap-\nproaches based on visual content for e\u000bective fake news detection. Despite the\nresearch developments on the multimedia fake news detection problem, there are\nstill some speci\fc challenges that need to be considered.\nOne major challenge is the lacking of labeled data. Although the multime-\ndia content is rapidly growing nowadays, datasets about multimedia fake news\nare scarce, which hinders the development of this research \feld. To tackle this\nchallenge, on the one hand, we encourage researchers to pay more attention to\nconstructing and releasing high-quality labeled datasets. On the other hand, it is\nimportant to study multimedia fake news detection in a weakly supervised set-\nting, i.e., with limited or no label data for training. For example, Jin et al. [16]\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 15\nFig. 9: Architecture of Adversarial Image Repurposing Detection (AIRD).\nconstructs a large-scale weakly-labeled dataset as auxiliary to overcome the data\nscarcity issue, and proposes a domain transferred deep CNN to detect the fake\nnews images.\nBesides, another critical challenge is the explainability of fake news detec-\ntion, i.e., why a model determines a particular piece of news as fake. Although\ncomputational detection of fake news has produced some promising results, the\nexplainability of such detection remains largely unsolved, making the judgments\nunconvincing. In recent years, fact-checking approaches have aroused the atten-\ntion of researchers, which could o\u000ber a new way to tackle this challenge. Di\u000berent\nfrom traditional style-based fake news detection, these approaches utilize exter-\nnal resources (also known as knowledge) as evidence to fact-check a given piece\nof news is fake or real. For multimedia content, the relationship between the tex-\ntual and visual content and metadata is a powerful clue, which can be combined\nwith the external knowledge to make inferences. These approaches are helpful for\nbetter understanding and explaining the decision made by algorithms according\nto the involved evidence and visible inference process.\nAcknowledgements.

ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)\n51(2), 32 (2018)\nAppendix\nData Repositories\nThe step above all to detect fake news is to collect a real-world benchmark\ndataset. Though several text-based fake news datasets [25, 39] have been re-\nleased, publicized multimedia fake news datasets remain rare, hindering the de-\nvelopment of fake multimedia news detection. We here introduce representative\nmultimedia datasets in fake news detection as follows.\nMediaEval-VMU12: The earliest publicly available multimedia veri\fcation\ncorpus originates from the MediaEval 2015 Verifying Multimedia Use (VMU)\n12https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/image-veri\fcation-corpus\nExploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection 19\ntask [3], which is further extended in 2016 [5]. In the latest version, the dataset\nconsists of tweets from Twitter related to 17 events (or hoaxes) that comprise in\ntotal 193 cases of real images, 218 cases of misused (fake) images and two cases\nof misused videos, associated with 6,225 real and 9,404 fake tweets posted by\n5,895 and 9,025 unique users, respectively.\nTMM17 : Due to the insu\u000eciency of images in previous works like VMU,\nJin et al. [17] collected a new dataset by crawling posts related to the authorita-\ntively veri\fed events from Weibo. The dataset is constituted of 146 news events\nwith 50,287 posts posted by 42,441 distinct users. A total of 25,953 images are\nattached to 19,762 of the posts. Note that this work focuses on event-level de-\ntection, so there exist posts with no image attached.\nMM17 [15]: This multimedia dataset is especially for multi-modal fake news\ndetection. The authors used similar sources as [17], but text-only posts and posts\nwith duplicated, small-size and large-height images were removed. The dataset\n\fnally consists of 9,528 posts, with balanced amounts of fake and real news.\nFakeNewsNet13: In [32], Shu et al. collected fake news articles instead of\nshort statements by traversing the fact-check websites such as PolitiFact14and\nGossipCop15and then searching for the web pages of corresponding articles.\nTotally, 336 fake and 447 real news articles contain images in PolitiFact part,\nwhile 1,650 fake and 16,767 real do in GossipCop part.\nMCG-FNeWS16[8]: The \frst version of this dataset was released for the\nFalse News Detection Competition 2019. The data was collected from Weibo\no\u000ecial debunking center17and news veri\fcation system AI-Shiyao18and reor-\nganized for di\u000berent sub-tasks in the competition. For multi-modal detection\nsub-task, the whole set consists of 46,373 posts (23,186 real and 23,187 fake)\nwith 41,937 images (24,794 in real posts and 17,170 in fake posts).\nEMNLP1919[48]: This dataset is especially for verifying the claims about\nimages. The image-related news was collected from two sources: A section of\nSnopes.com named Fauxtography20for all false image-related news and a small\nfraction of true news; Reuters' Picture of the Year from 2015 to 2018 for most\nof true news. In total, this dataset contains 592 true and 641 false image-claim\npairs.\nTools\nIn addition to methods, tools to verify the visual content of fake news online\nis valuable due to its convenience to non-technical users. In this subsection, we\nintroduce some publicly available tools for multimedia content veri\fcation.\n13https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet\n14https://www.politifact.com/\n15https://www.gossipcop.com/\n16http://mcg.ict.ac.cn/wordpress/share/mcg-fnews/\n17https://service.account.weibo.com/\n18https://www.newsverify.com/\n19http://gitlab.com/didizlatkova/fake-image-detection\n20https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/category/photos/\n20 J Cao et al.\nGoogle Reverse Image Search : A service of searching by an image from\nGoogle. The veri\fers may upload the image or input the image URL to \fnd\nsimilar images as well as the web pages containing them. Other substitutions\nlike Baidu Images21, provide similar service.\nFotoForensics22: A website for forensics analysis of JPEG or PNG image,\nproviding information including error level, hidden pixels, metadata and JPEG\nquality. Over 3.3 million images were analyzed by the service so far.\nImage Veri\fcation Assistant23: A website to analyze the veracity of online\nmedia supported by REVEAL project. For an image, it extracts and visualizes\nthe metadata and detects various types of forensics features, such as double\nJPEG quantization, JPEG Ghosts, JPEG blocking artifact, error level analysis,\nhigh-frequency noise and median \fltering noise residue.\nFake Video News Debunker24: A free plugin that runs in Google Chrome\nor FireFox to verify videos and images. This integrated plugin provides service\nto obtain contextual information from Youtube or Facebook, extract keyframes\nfor reverse image search, list the metadata and perform forensic analysis.\nRelevant Competitions\nTo attract the attention from academia and industry and further promote the\ndevelopment of detection technology, considerable competitions for fake news\ndetection were held but very few of them provided visual contents. Here, we\nintroduce two competitions where visual contents can be exploited.\nVerifying Multimedia Use (VMU) : A part of the MediaEval Benchmark\nin 2015 [3] and 2016 [5], dealing with the automatic detection of manipulation\nand misuse of web multimedia content. A fake tweet was de\fned as a tweet that\nshared multimedia content inconsistent with the event it referred to. In 2015,\nparticipants were asked to predict the veracity (fake, real or unknown), given a\ntweet and the accompanying multimedia item (image or video) from an event.\nIn 2016, a new related sub-task was added to detect image tampering.\nFalse News Detection Competition 201925: A competition held for false\nnews detection on Weibo, with three sub-tasks: text-only, image-only and multi-\nmodal detection. In image-only detection, models had to predict whether the\nimage was attached to a false news post. In multi-modal detection, text, images\nand user pro\fles were all available to predict the veracity of the post.\n21https://image.baidu.com/\n22http://www.fotoforensics.com/\n23http://reveal-mklab.iti.gr/reveal/\n24https://www.invid-project.eu/tools-and-services/invid-veri\fcation-plugin/\n25https://www.biendata.com/competition/falsenews/", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "Exploring the role of visual content in fake news detection", "author": ["J Cao", "P Qi", "Q Sheng", "T Yang", "J Guo", "J Li"], "pub_year": "2020", "venue": "\u2026 , Misinformation, and Fake \u2026", "abstract": "The increasing popularity of social media promotes the proliferation of fake news, which has  caused significant negative societal effects.

Although\nthe problem is being tackled within the domain of bot detection, the impact of studies in this area is still\nlimited due to 1) not all accounts that spread unreliable content are bots, 2) human-operated accounts are\nalso responsible for the diffusion of unreliable information and 3) bot accounts are not always malicious (e.g.\nnews aggregators). Also, most of these methods are based on supervised models that required annotated data\nand updates to maintain their performance through time. In this work, we build a framework and develop\nknowledge-based metrics to complement the current research in bot detection and characterize the impact and\nbehavior of a Twitter account, independently of the way it is operated (human or bot). We proceed to analyze\na sample of the accounts using the metrics proposed and evaluate the necessity of these metrics by comparing\nthem with the scores from a bot detection system. The results show that the metrics can characterize different\ndegrees of unreliable accounts, from unreliable bot accounts with a high number of followers to human-\noperated accounts that also spread unreliable content (but with less impact on the network). Furthermore,\nevaluating a sample of the accounts with a bot detection system shown that bots compose around 11% of the\nsample of unreliable accounts extracted and that the bot score is not correlated with the proposed metrics.\nIn addition, the accounts that achieve the highest values in our metrics present different characteristics than\nthe ones that achieve the highest bot score. This provides evidence on the usefulness of our metrics in the\nevaluation of unreliable accounts in social networks.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nSocial Networks have revolutionized the way users\ncommunicate online. From a journalistic perspective,\nthese platforms allow the publication and spreading of\ninformation at a speed that traditional news medium\n(television and newspapers) do not allow. From a\npersonal user point of view, social networks are a\nmedium for publication and discussion of ideas. The\nexponential growth of users in these platforms has at-\ntracted the interest of companies, personalities, and\nother important entities that saw an opportunity in so-\ncial networks to in\ufb02uence and share their brand, opin-\nions, and thoughts.\nSocial networks also change the way information\nis consumed. Due to the amount of new content pub-\na\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-2854-2891\nb\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-0507-7504\nc\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-6892-8871lished every second, users often rely on a minimal\nnumber of indicators (such as post title and image) to\ndecide if they will proceed to read further. Not only\nthis affects the way news outlets interact with their\naudience (forcing them to adapt to a reality where\ninformation is consumed at a high rate and in large\nquantities) (Newman, 2011) but also leads to the rise\nof unreliable content spreading. In fact, the freedom\nof creating accounts with a high degree of anonymity\ncontributes towards the publication of unreliable and\nmalicious content. This type of content has been re-\ncently used as a method to in\ufb02uence user opinions on\nimportant questions with a major focus on political-\ndriven events such as elections, protests, laws, and re-\nforms. Several studies (Nikolov et al., 2015; Quattro-\nciocchi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015) have con\ufb01rmed\nthat phenomenons that in\ufb02uence user perceptions and\nopinions are present in social media. For example,\nthe echo chamber/\ufb01lter bubble effect refers to the cus-\ntomization of the content provided by social media\nGuimaraes, N., Figueira, A. and Torgo, L.\nKnowledge-based Reliability Metrics for Social Media Accounts.\nDOI: 10.5220/0010140403390350\nInProceedings of the 16th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies (WEBIST 2020) , pages 339-350\nISBN: 978-989-758-478-7\nCopyright c/circlecopyrt2020 by SCITEPRESS \u2013 Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

This phe-\nnomenon restrains the diversi\ufb01cation of the content\npresented to each individual user. In addition, users\ntend to connect with persons/accounts that share sim-\nilar interests, narrowing opinions, ideas, and informa-\ntion shared to common or similar perspectives. An-\nother well-studied phenomena affecting users\u2019 opin-\nions in social media is the bandwagon-effect. This\noccurs when a user is persuaded due to exposure to\nthe same content from several different sources. This\nbehavior is based on the underlying principle that the\nprobability of a certain individual adopting a certain\nidea, opinion, or belief increases the more other peo-\nple have adopted it. The spreading and consumption\nof unreliable content enhances the occurrence of this\nphenomenon with serious consequences. Therefore,\nit becomes crucial that social network users become\naware of what content is unreliable and which ac-\ncounts are spreading it.\nCompanies such as Facebook and Twitter are cur-\nrently testing and implementing new measures to deal\nwith the propagation of unreliable content on their\nplatforms. For example, Twitter has recently intro-\nduced a feature to add context to certain claims made\nin tweets (Fung, 2020) while Facebook is working\nwith fact-checking services to label their posts (Face-\nbook, 2020). Nonetheless, adding context and fact-\nchecking still relies heavily on human annotation and\ncomprehension and this type of labeling can only oc-\ncur after a rumor or fake news begins circulation.\nAnother focus has been to detect accounts that\nare operated automatically (bots). These software-\ncontrolled accounts can post content and interact with\nother accounts (human-operated or not) (Varol et al.,\n2017b; Davis et al., 2016). Several studies have\nworked on this approach (Varol et al., 2017a; Gi-\nlani et al., 2017; Benevenuto et al., 2010). How-\never, it is also important to mention that some bot\naccounts are not associated with the spreading of un-\nreliable content and have other purposes (p.e. news\naggregators). In addition, due to the psychological\nphenomenons previously mentioned, some human-\noperated accounts are also responsible for spreading\nunreliable content. Consequently, the distinction be-\ntween bot and human-operated accounts has its limi-\ntations on the detection of accounts that publish and\ndiffuse unreliable content.\nTherefore, in this study, we focus on building a\nframework capable of extracting and annotating un-\nreliable accounts based on the impact that they can\npose to the social network. Our de\ufb01nition of unreli-\nable accounts includes bots and human-operated ac-\ncounts (while in bot detection studies, human oper-ated accounts are normally associated with reliable\naccounts). In addition, we present knowledge-based\nmetrics to signal unreliable accounts in social net-\nworks and thus not focusing on supervised algorithms\nwhose performance can decrease through time (Varol\net al., 2017a). It is our goal to clearly distinguish ac-\ncounts that are unreliable and have an impact on the\nnetwork from those that are not (whether is because\nthey do not spread unreliable content or because the\nunreliable content is in low quantity or withing a very\nlimited reach).\nIn the next section, we review the current state of\nthe art on the detection and analysis of unreliable ac-\ncounts as well as some metrics already developed for\nsocial networks. Next, we introduce the process used\nto extract unreliable content from Twitter and then we\npropose a set of metrics based on that knowledge. In\nsection 4 we analyze accounts with high unreliable\nand reliable scores in the metrics proposed and evalu-\nate the necessity of these metrics by comparing them\nwith a state of the art bot detection system. Finally, in\nsection 4.2, we draw some conclusions and lay foun-\ndations for future work.\n2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED\nWORK\nA large number of studies have focused on the de-\nvelopment and application of social media metrics.\nFor example, in marketing, the authors in (Mu \u02dcnoz-\nExp\u00b4osito et al., 2017) proposed a set of metrics to\nmeasure user engagement with companies/brands on\nTwitter. These metrics (Interest and Engagement) use\nthe interactions of the users (replies, retweets, and fa-\nvorites) with a brand\u2019s account. Another well-studied\narea is altmetrics in scienti\ufb01c research. This corre-\nsponds to alternative metrics that measure the impact\nof scienti\ufb01c research in the community. For exam-\nple, D \u00b4\u0131az-Faes et al. (2019) use a set of metrics to\ncharacterize the impact of scienti\ufb01c research such as\nshares of tweets to paper, number of retweets link-\ning to scienti\ufb01c publication, and number of distinct\npublications tweeted. Another work adapts the h-\nindex metric to measure the impact of a publication on\nTwitter using the tweets as publications and retweets\nor favorites as citations (Razis and Anagnostopoulos,\n2014).\nSeveral other metrics measure different aspects of\na Twitter account. Activity metrics such as Twee-\ntRank and ActivityScore (Yuan et al., 2013) mea-\nsure how active an account is in the network (in gen-\neral or in a speci\ufb01c topic). Popularity metrics weigh\nthe reach of account popularity using its close con-WEBIST 2020 - 16th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n340\n\nnections. Examples of these metrics can be the in-\ndegree measure (using followers and followees count)\n(Hajian and White, 2011) and the Twitter Followers-\nFollowees ratio (Bigonha et al., 2012). Nevertheless,\nit is the metrics that allow quantifying the in\ufb02uence of\na user/account that are largely studied. Adaptations of\nthe Closeness (size of the shortest path from a node\nto every other) and Betweenness (number of shortest\npaths that pass through the node) were proposed in a\nsocial network scenario. Furthermore, different au-\nthors proposed variations of the Page Rank algorithm\napplied to social networks (Riquelme and Gonz \u00b4alez-\nCantergiani, 2016; Yamaguchi et al., 2010).\nIn spite of the large number of metrics proposed\nin the literature, there seems to be a lack of works\nthat apply these metrics in the context of unreliable\nand/or fake account detection in social networks. As\na matter of fact, regarding reliability account analysis,\nthe majority of works have focused on the detection\nof bot or spam accounts. These accounts are highly\nassociated with the spread of fake and ad-based con-\ntent through the network. Gilani et al. Gilani et al.\n(2017) developed a methodology and built a classi-\n\ufb01er to distinguish between bot and human accounts.\nThe authors use features such as the age of the ac-\ncount, number of tweets and source type and conduct\na set of experiments in which several classi\ufb01ers were\ntested with accounts whose popularity ranged from\n1 thousand to 1 million followers. The best model\nachieves an accuracy of approximately 80%, which\nis near the agreement obtained by human annotators.\nSimilar work is presented in (Benevenuto et al., 2010)\nwhere the authors use content and user behavior at-\ntributes (e.g. number of spam words in tweets, num-\nber of mentions per tweet and number of interactions\nwith other users) to build a Support Vector Machine\nclassi\ufb01er with 70% accuracy in detecting spammers\nand 96% in detecting non-spammers. Another work\n(Chu et al., 2012) presents a system to classify ac-\ncounts in social media in three categories: human,\nbot, and cyborg (which refers to accounts that are bot-\nassisted). The system is capable of distinguishing the\nthree categories with precision above 90%. Finally,\nthe work in (Varol et al., 2017a) presents a bot detec-\ntion system based on sentiment, time, content, friends\nnetwork, and account features to determine the bot\nscore of Twitter accounts. The system uses random\nforests and obtained an AUC of 0.95.\nAlthough the detection of bots and spam spread-\ning accounts can be related to the task of classifying\naccount reputation, it works only as an underlying\nproblem since accounts that spread unreliable infor-\nmation can be bot or human-operated. Few works try\nto combine unreliable accounts and metrics. In otherwords, to use social network metrics to quantify the\nimpact and in\ufb02uence that an unreliable account has on\nthe network. An on-going work proposes spread and\nskepticism metrics to evaluate if the wisdom of the\ncrowd is enough to distinguish false and true claims\n(Finn et al., 2015). However, it is very preliminary\nwork and differentiates in concept and type of data\n(the authors focus on claims). Yet another work (Al-\nKhalifa and Al-Eidan, 2011) relies on supervised and\nsimilarity metrics to predict news credibility on Twit-\nter. Nonetheless, this study is only focused on assign-\ning a credibility score to the content instead of the\naccounts.\nThis work tries to tackle the current gap in the\nstate of the art by addressing account reliability clas-\nsi\ufb01cation in general (bots and human-operated ac-\ncounts) and using knowledge-based metrics to per-\nform that classi\ufb01cation.\n3 ACCOUNT RELIABILITY\nFRAMEWORK\nIn this section, we propose a framework to retrieve\nand score accounts based on their behavior (i.e. the\ncontent they post) and their in\ufb02uence on the net-\nwork. We adopt and modify a data retrieval method-\nology presented in previous works (Guimar \u02dcaes et al.,\n2018; Guimaraes et al., 2020), and complement it\nwith newly developed metrics to classify each account\nregarding its reliability. We start by establishing some\nrequirements that we aim for our framework. Un-\nlike similar works, it is our goal that the framework\nretrieves and annotates accounts in an unsupervised\nfashion. We opt for this path due to major constraints\nin using annotated data in the classi\ufb01cation of unreli-\nable content. First, the identi\ufb01cation of what is unre-\nliable or not is a dif\ufb01cult task for annotators without\nexpertise (due to their personal beliefs and psycho-\nlogical phenomenons like con\ufb01rmation bias). Con-\nsequently, the use of Crowdsourcing platforms be-\ncomes infeasible or subject to outputting untrustwor-\nthy data. Second, the diversi\ufb01ed quantity of topics\nand the time dynamics of unreliable content would\nrequire that new annotated data was introduced after\nsome time to maintain the models updated. Our sec-\nond goal is to be able to output a quick response on\nthe computation of the reliability score of an account.\nDue to the importance of early detection on the clas-\nsi\ufb01cation of accounts (p.e. to avoid the diffusion of\nunreliable content through the network), the neces-\nsity of gathering a large amount of historical data on\neach account or to perform computationally expen-\nsive processes, may hinder the provision of a relia-Knowledge-based Reliability Metrics for Social Media Accounts\n341\n\nbility score at a reasonable time. A concrete exam-\nple can be the use of a framework with a front-end\nweb-browser add-on where, upon clicking in a certain\npost, users have the account metrics displayed. Thus,\nto ensure that the information is provided on time, it\nis important to guarantee that the framework can out-\nput a score almost instantaneously in such a way that\nit is possible to integrate it with a front-end environ-\nment without requiring the user to wait a long period\nof time for the results. These two goals lay the foun-\ndations for the data retrieval method and the metrics\nexplained and justi\ufb01ed in the following sub-sections.\n3.1 Data Retrieval\nTo establish a methodology to capture accounts that\nare spreading unreliable and reliable content, we\nmust \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne some concepts. Therefore, in this\nwork, we rely on several de\ufb01nitions provided by\nOpenSources to determine what is unreliable content.\nOpenSources is a database for online information\nsources. Although the website (http://opensources.\nco) was shut down, the database is still used by the\nscienti\ufb01c community as ground truth for several stud-\nies (Bovet and Makse, 2019; Guimaraes et al., 2020).\nThe database is currently available through the Github\nrepository1. We consider that a post/tweet propagates\nunreliable content if it contains a hyperlink to a web-\nsite whose content falls into one or several of the fol-\nlowing de\ufb01nitions, provided by OpenSources:\n\u000ffake: the news content provided is fabricated in-\nformation or distorts actual news with the goal of\ndeceiving users\n\u000fclickbait: the news content provided has an eye-\ncatching title or headline with the sole intention to\ndeceive users in social media to click the associ-\nated URL\n\u000fbias: the news content provided is extremely bi-\nased and aggressively favors the opinion of one\nside and/or demeans and insults the other.\n\u000fjunksci: the news content provided is related to\nscienti\ufb01c theories which are false or whose verac-\nity is unclear (also known as junk science)\n\u000fhate: the news content provided promotes racism,\nhomophobia, or other forms of discrimination.\n\u000funreliable2:the news content provided is unclear\nand lacks more investigation to determine its ve-\nracity.\n1https://github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/opensources\n2In this work we use the term unreliable to classify the\ncontent provided by all categories. This is the only excep-\ntion since, for the sake of coherency, we opt to keep the\nOpenSources categories names unchanged.Each source is investigated by researchers and profes-\nsionals and annotated according to the overall content\nthat provides. Each source can be annotated to a max-\nimum of 3 (out of 12) categories in a ranked manner\n(i.e. from the most predominant type of content to\nthe least). However, in this work, from all the 12 dif-\nferent categories, we only select 5 since: 1) we are\ninterested in using OpenSources only for unreliable\ncontent thus we exclude categories like \u201dpolitical\u201d and\n\u201dreliable\u201d and 2) other categories are less representa-\ntive of the problem (like \u201dgossip\u201d). In addition, we\nsimplify our classi\ufb01cation by only using the predom-\ninant tag in each website.\nOn the other hand, it is also important to de\ufb01ne\nwhat are reliable accounts. The concept is similar.\nHowever, due to the limitations on the OpenSources\nplatform in reliable content (fewer sources and very\nrestrained to the political domain), we opt by using\nMedia Bias Fact Check (MBFC) database3.\nMBFC has two different types of classi\ufb01cation for\neach source. The \ufb01rst is according to the type of con-\ntent that each source publishes. The labels include 6\ndifferent bias values ranging from the extreme right\nto the extreme left. In addition, sources that fall out\nof this spectrum, are included in labels such as \u201dPro-\nScience\u201d, \u201dConspiracy/Pseudo-Science\u201d or \u201dSatire\u201d.\nThe second type of classi\ufb01cation regards the fac-\ntuality of each source. The classi\ufb01cation has 6 labels\nranging from \u201dHighly Factual\u201d (when the source only\npresents factual content) to \u201dVery Low\u201d (when the\nsource never uses credible sources and is not trust-\nworthy).\nTo determine what is reliable, we used the sources\nclassi\ufb01ed with the following labels:\n\u000fPro-Science - Sources that consist of legitimate\nscienti\ufb01c content and are based in credible scien-\nti\ufb01c methods and source.\n\u000fLeft-Center Bias - Sources with minor democratic\nbias that are generally trustworthy for informa-\ntion.\n\u000fLeast Biased - The most credible media sources\nwith minimal bias and highly factual reporting.\n\u000fRight-Center Bias - Same as left-center bias but\ntowards conservative causes.\nThe vast majority of the sources included in this labels\nhas a factuality score ranging from \u201dMostly Factual\u201d\nto \u201dHighly Factual\u201d. Although we could restrain our\nsources solely to the ones with \u201dHighly Factual\u201d label,\nthis would lead to a high difference between the num-\nber of unreliable and reliable sources. Therefore, we\n3http://mediabiasfactcheck.comWEBIST 2020 - 16th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n342\n\nslightly relax our criteria to ensure a more balanced\nnumber of sources between classes.\nWe used the website\u2019s URL of the selected cat-\negories as a keyword for the Search API on Twit-\nter. For each query (i.e. URL), a collection of 100\ntweets was extracted on a daily basis. For each tweet,\nthe account information (such as screenname, num-\nber of followers, veri\ufb01cation status) is also extracted.\nIf repeated tweets are captured, only the \ufb01elds that\nsuffered any change are updated (e.g. the number\nof posts retweets/favorites and the number of follow-\ners/followees of the account).\nThe retrieved tweets can be used to classify ac-\ncounts regarding the content that they spread. Since\neach website from OpenSources and MBFC was used\nas a keyword, each returning tweet has a URL for that\npage or for an article (i.e. subdomain) of that website.\nThis differs from similar methodologies that use only\nthe Twitter account of the sources (Helmstetter and\nPaulheim, 2018) or directly extract articles from the\nwebsites (Baly et al., 2018). Finally, we map the clas-\nsi\ufb01cation of the site to the tweet, thus automatically\nannotating the totality of tweets captured. Several\nstudies have used this distant labelling approach with\nsuccess (Horne et al., 2019; Guimaraes et al., 2020;\nHelmstetter and Paulheim, 2018). Therefore, this an-\nnotation will be the basis for the reliability metrics\nexplained in the next section.\n3.2 Reliability Metrics\nThrough the analysis conducted in the previous sec-\ntion, we develop metrics to analyze Twitter accounts\nbased on the number of unreliable and reliable posts\n(and their social feedback).\nFrom the information extracted in the data re-\ntrieval process, the following variables will be used\nto compute the metrics.\n\u000faccount creation date\n\u000faccount number of followers\n\u000faccount veri\ufb01cation status\n\u000fpost publish date\n\u000fpost retweet count\n\u000fpost favorite count\nThe \ufb01rst metric (which serves as a baseline) is based\non the assumption that the behavior of an account re-\ngarding the content that publishes is time-independent\nand therefore the impact that an account has on the\nnetwork is solely based on the number of tweets that\nit spreads (independently of the age of the account).\nThus for an account aand reliability class (reliable,\nunreliable) c pcount acan be de\ufb01ned as:PCOUNT a;c=na;c (1)\nwhere nis the number of posts from account ain\nthe class c. This \ufb01rst metric can be summarized to a\npost count but it provides the basis for classi\ufb01cation\nof accounts. It is important to highlight that the main\ndifferences between this work and similar social net-\nwork metrics in the literature is the knowledge-based\ncomponent that was extracted and stored using the\nmethodology in the previous section. This allows a\nquick categorization of the accounts and stores the in-\nformation necessary for the computation of these met-\nrics.\nWe use the following notation to simplify the for-\nmulation of the next metrics. Each post ipublished by\naccount aand annotated with a classi\ufb01cation c, can be\nde\ufb01ned by a tuple (ti;a;c;fi;a;c;ri;a;c)where i2[0;na;c],\nti;a;cis the age of the post (in months- derived from\nthe post\u2019s publication date), fi;a;cthe number of ac-\ncounts that \u201dfavorited\u201d that post and ri;a;cthe number\nof retweets.\nThe second metric is time-aware (i.e. the older\nthe post, the less impact it has on the reliability of the\naccount) and regards the behavior ( BEH ) of the ac-\ncount, discarding any output variables such as its con-\nnections or the social feedback obtained in its posts.\nThe equation to compute these values for each class c\nis:\nBEH a;c=\u00e5na;c\ni=11\nti;a;c\nAGE a(2)\nLet us further demonstrate the intuition behind\nthese equations. The use of the multiplicative inverse\non the post\u2019s age allows a linear decrease in the impact\nof that post in the assessment of the account behav-\nior metric. Let us consider two different examples.\nThe \ufb01rst is a bot account that was actively dissemi-\nnating information prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential\nelection ( account 1). The second is a human-operated\naccount that shares extremely bias content during the\nCovid-19 pandemic ( account 2). It is reasonable to as-\nsume that the last account should achieve a higher\nscore due to the post being more recent. In fact, in\na simulated environment where account 1propagates\n50 posts in an interval of time from September to\nNovember of 2016 and an account that posts 10 posts\nin the last 2 months (May and June 2020), the results\nfor the multiplicative inverse is 1.16 and 4.83 respec-\ntively. The sum of each post\u2019s age multiplicative in-\nverse allow us to quantify each post individually and\nconsidering their respective time differences.\nThe next step in the metric is to divide the sum\nof all posts\u2019 inverse age from account aby the age of\nthe account (AGE a). There are two main reasons to\ndiminish the effect of older accounts. First, the reg-\nistration date plays an important role in most worksKnowledge-based Reliability Metrics for Social Media Accounts\n343\n\nin the fake news domain (Boididou et al., 2018; Wu\net al., 2015) with some works highlighting the impor-\ntance of this feature (Xiao et al., 2015; Castillo et al.,\n2011). Secondly, due to the ongoing efforts of Twitter\nto remove bot accounts and accounts spreading mis-\ninformation (Conger, 2020; Margolin and Thorbecke,\n2020), it is plausible that accounts with a long history\nand constant propagation would be captured by the\nsocial network\u2019s internal algorithms. Once again, let\nus consider to example accounts: account 3was cre-\nated in 2016 while account 4was registered last month\n(June 2020). Account 3 is a human-operated account\nthat published unreliable information 10 to 20 times\nin its lifespan but has recently deviated from such\ncontent. On the other hand, account 4has published\n5 tweets containing unreliable content. Due to the re-\ncent creation date of account 4, the penalization given\nby the behavior metric would be higher than account 3.\nIt is reasonable to assume that a recently created ac-\ncount that propagates unreliable content in its \ufb01rst\nmonths could potentially be a bot or even an unreli-\nable account that will continue to display the same be-\nhavior and therefore the unreliable metrics proposed\nshould assign a higher value to it.\nFinally, the impact ( IMP) metric combines the be-\nhavior with the in\ufb02uence of an account on Twitter. As\nit was previously mentioned in Section 2, in\ufb02uence\nmetrics on Twitter have been thoroughly proposed in\nsocial network studies. However, recalling the sec-\nond goal for the development of the framework, it is\nimportant that the metrics would give a quick output\nand avoid heavy computation. Therefore, in\ufb02uence\nmetrics that require knowledge on the close network\n(such as the closeness, betweenness, h-index (Razis\nand Anagnostopoulos, 2014) or PageRank (Wang and\nJapkowicz, 2010)) are not feasible for this purpose.\nTherefore, our in\ufb02uence metric relies solely on data\nthat can be derived from the account information pro-\nvided by the API. A metric more suitable for our goals\nis the information diffusion metric (Pal and Counts,\n2011). This metric is used for estimating the in\ufb02u-\nence of an account in a topic by measuring the differ-\nence between the number of friends of an account that\ntweets on a topic before and the number of follow-\ners of the account that tweets on the same topic after.\nThe metric also uses a logarithmic scale due to the\npossible differences between the number of follow-\ners (NFOLLOWS) and friends (NFRIENDS). How-\never, this metric still relies on information from the\nconnections to be computed and thus is subject to the\nlimitations of the Twitter API. Metrics based only on\nthe number of followers and friends (and thus pos-\nsible to compute almost instantaneously) were also\nproposed. For example the Followers Rank (Nag-moti et al., 2010) (presented in equation 3) and Twit-\nter Follower-Followee Ratio (Bigonha et al., 2012).\nThe \ufb01rst measure is the adaptation of the in-degree\nmetric and the second is self-explanatory.\nFollowersRank =NFOLLOW\nNFOLLOW +NFRIENDS(3)\nNevertheless, these metrics have limitations.\nThe \ufb01rst is the disproportion that NFOLLOW and\nNFRIENDS may have. For example, at the time\nof the writing of this paper, the of\ufb01cial Twitter ac-\ncount of the president of the United States ( @real-\nDonaldTrump ) has 82.9 million followers but only 42\nfriends which can highly affect the value of this met-\nric when compared with more balanced accounts.\nFurthermore, we argue that in the speci\ufb01c domain\nof unreliable content, the veri\ufb01cation status of an ac-\ncount can play an important role in the in\ufb02uence of\nthat account, and thus it should be considered. The\nmain reason is that Twitter assigns a veri\ufb01cation sta-\ntus to accounts that are of public interest and authentic\nTwitter (2018b). Therefore, if a veri\ufb01ed account pub-\nlishes unreliable posts could more easily lead users to\nbelieve that the content is reliable due to the authen-\nticity of the account.\nDue to the aforementioned reasons, we present the\n(INFLUENCE a) metric, which can be measured us-\ning the following equation\nINFLUENCE a=log(NFOLLOW a+1)\u0002aV ER a\n(4)\nwhere V ER arefers to the account veri\ufb01ed status (0 if\nit is not veri\ufb01ed and 1 otherwise) and arefers to a\nuser-de\ufb01ned variable that assigns the weight applied\nto the in\ufb02uence of an account when it is veri\ufb01ed. We\nalso restrain NFOLLOW to a logarithmic scale due\nto the large difference in the number of followers in\nTwitter accounts.\nAnother clear distinction between our in\ufb02uence\nmetric and others presented in the literature is the ex-\nclusion of the number of friends (or followees) from\nthe metric. The reason behind this is the speci\ufb01c do-\nmain where we wish to apply these metrics.\nWhen measuring the in\ufb02uence in terms of the\noverall popularity of an account, a ratio between the\nnumber of followers and followees is essential since\nhigh in\ufb02uence accounts (belonging for example to\nmusicians and actors) have a high disparity on these\nvariables due to the fans that follow this particular ac-\ncounts. However, when assessing the impact of an\naccount in spreading unreliable content, it is reason-\nable to assume that the in\ufb02uence it has on its fol-\nlowers should not be reduced by a high number of\nfriends/followees. For instance, if we consider twoWEBIST 2020 - 16th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n344\n\naccounts with the same behavior value but the \ufb01rst ac-\ncount follows many more other accounts than the sec-\nond, it is plausible that both accounts have the same\nreach in their close network since each account feed is\nbased on its followers. Nevertheless, since that high\ndisparity of followers and followees is normally as-\nsociated with accounts of public interest, the veri\ufb01-\ncation status component in our metric can deal with\nthose particular cases.\nFinally, combining in\ufb02uence and behavior, we\ncharacterize the impact of an account on the social\nnetwork using the following equation:\nIMP a;c=BEH a;c\u0002INFLUENCE a (5)\nWe can further complement the metrics based on\nthe information from social feedback such as retweets\nand favorites. Thus, we propose a variation of the be-\nhavior (Equation 6) and impact metric (7) that con-\nsider the social feedback of tweets at the time of the\nretrieval.\nBEH SFa;c=\u00e5na;c\ni=11+log(1+fi;a;c)+log(1+ri;a;c)\nti;a;c\nAGE a(6)\nIMP SFa;c=BEH SFa;c\u0002INFLUENCE a (7)\nBy adding the number of retweets and number of\nfavorites in each post to the behavior function we aim\nat a better characterization of the impact on the net-\nwork. We use the number of retweets and number of\nfavorites in individual logarithmic functions to high-\nlight the difference between posts with a large number\nof only one type of social feedback from the ones that\nhave a large number of both favorites and retweets.\nThe value is smoothed by the age of the post and the\nage of the account due to the reasons mentioned ear-\nlier.\nHowever, there is also a limitation on the applica-\ntion of social feedback. Since we are trying to build a\nknowledge-based metric that relies on information al-\nready presented in our database and we want to avoid\ncalls to APIs or computationally expensive processes\nat classi\ufb01cation time, we rely solely on the social\nfeedback at the time of the extraction. In other words,\nas time passes, the number of retweets and favorites\nof each tweet can increase.\nIt is important to mention that some measures\nhave been taken to minimize the dynamic effect of\nsome of these variables. First, we update the values\neach time a duplicated tweet is found and since we are\nusing the Twitter Search API, in the best case scenario\nwe can update a tweet upon 7 days of its publication.\nSecond, when looking for tweets, we specify that the\nsearch should be constituted from a mix of popular\nand recent tweets by using the mixed parameter fromthe Twitter API (Twitter, 2018a). This trade-off al-\nlows the capture of recent tweets that eventually may\nnot be engaging (and thus not posing an impact on the\nnetwork but still relevant for a broad characterization\nof Twitter accounts) as well as tweets that have al-\nready gained some traction on Twitter (and therefore\nare considered popular for the API).\nNevertheless, these measures are not enough to\nensure that all accounts have their reliability metrics\ncomputed based on the most recent data. Due to the\nmain goals of the framework, updating mechanisms\nare out of the scope of this work. Some hypotheses\non updating each accounts\u2019 metrics based on the most\nrecent data are suggested in Section 5.\nIn the next section, we apply these metrics to the\naccounts captured. In addition, we compare the re-\nsults obtained with a state of the art bot detection sys-\ntem and provide some reasoning on the usefulness of\nthese metrics.\n4 CASE STUDIES\nIn this section, we present two case studies to evalu-\nate the usefulness of our metrics. First, we analyze the\ntop reliable and unreliable accounts captured (subsec-\ntion 4.1). Second, we study how the metrics compare\nwith a state of the art bot detection method (subsec-\ntion 4.2). The data used was extracted between July,\n2019 and July 2020. It includes over 4M tweets with\nmore than 750k distinct accounts.\nIn previous work (Guimar \u02dcaes et al., 2018;\nGuimaraes et al., 2020) when analyzing a sample of\nunreliable accounts, we found that only a small per-\ncentage (\u00191%) were veri\ufb01ed. In addition, veri\ufb01ed ac-\ncounts often have a large number of followers. There-\nfore, in these case studies, the value of alpha was set\nto 2 to avoid that veri\ufb01ed accounts were treated as out-\nliers in our IMP SFmetric but on the other hand, can\nbe distinguished from non-veri\ufb01ed accounts. De\ufb01n-\ninga=2 means that if an account is veri\ufb01ed, its in-\n\ufb02uence value doubles.\n4.1 Top Unreliable and Reliable\nAccounts\nWe select the 5000 accounts with the highest\nPCOUNT value for both classes (reliable and unreli-\nable). We opt for this metric since it allow us to eval-\nuate the difference on the more complete metrics pro-\nposed ( BEH andIMP) and how they differ between\nthem and PCOUNT . If one of the other metrics was\nselected, other characteristics (like number of follow-\ners or age of the account) could be less propitious toKnowledge-based Reliability Metrics for Social Media Accounts\n345\n\nchange and thus making the accounts extracted more\nsimilar to each other.\n4.1.1 Unreliable Accounts\nWhen looking at the unreliable accounts, there were\n44 accounts veri\ufb01ed in our sample. The majority of\nthese were Twitter accounts of the websites anno-\ntated in OpenSources or entities associated with those\nwebsites (such as reporters or commentators). The\nnon-veri\ufb01ed accounts that present the highest IMP SF\nandBEH SFare bots that publish and disseminate ex-\ntremely biased content. We select the top 5 for a more\nin depth analysis. However, one of the these accounts\nhad been already suspended at the time of this anal-\nysis. Screenshots from the remaining 4 are presented\nin Figure 1.\nThe similarity of the accounts presented in Fig-\nure 1 as well as the absence of a personal pro\ufb01le pic-\nture/banner and lack of original publications, shows\nclear signals of bot accounts. Three out of the four\naccounts present a high number of followers (between\n13000 and 25.8K). In addition, they have a recent reg-\nistration date with the oldest account being registered\nless than two years earlier to the writing of this article,\nand the other three being registered approximately a\nyear ago. These factors combined with the number of\nposts captured justify the score they achieved. Fur-\nthermore, we argue that the score assigned to these\naccounts is fair in the sense that these accounts dis-\nplay bot behavior and present a threat to the upcom-\ning 2020 United States elections due to the impact of\ntheir content in the social network. The last account\nshowed in Figure 1 presents a lower number of fol-\nlowers by comparison. However, its IMP SFscore is\nseverely affected by the high number of posts cap-\ntured and it is the account with the highest BEH SF\nvalue in this sample. Hence, although its number of\nconnections is low, it was recently created and sys-\ntematically propagates unreliable content, making it\nalso a potential problem in the network. When com-\npared with the other accounts analyzed, this account\nhas 2076 posts captured in our database while in the\nremaining one the number of posts is situated between\n407 and 737.\nWe proceed to manually analyze some random ex-\namples of accounts that score a IMP SFvalue between\n2000 and 4000 and BEH SFbetween 250 and 500. In\nthe 20 accounts manually analyzed, there was a mix\nof bot and human-operated accounts. Although there\nis still a large presence of bots, it is clear that some ac-\ncounts present human behavior. In some cases, these\naccounts feeds have a large percentage of retweets\nwith a small percentage of original posts. On others,\nthey present a large volume of original publicationsand a small set of publications linking to unreliable\nwebsites.\nFinally, we manually analyzed some of the ac-\ncounts with low unreliable scores in our metrics. We\nselected accounts with a BEH SFscore between 10 and\n150 and IMP SFbetween 40 and 100. Once again there\nis a mixture of human-operated and bot accounts but\nwith less in\ufb02uence and older registration date than\nthe previous tier. A curious example is an account\nthat at the time of extraction had a BEH SFvalue of\n121.93 and an IMP SFof 0 (since it had no followers).\nThis case perfectly illustrates that even when some ac-\ncounts have a high propagation of unreliable content,\ntheir impact on the network might be limited.\nSummarising, by manually sampling some of the\naccounts captured we can provide some con\ufb01dence on\nthe effectiveness of the metrics to annotate high im-\npact accounts that frequently spread unreliable con-\ntent (such as bots), as well as human-operated ac-\ncounts (whose propagation frequency is lower). In\naddition, we can argue that the metrics clearly dis-\ntinguish the ones that can have a high impact on the\nsocial network from the ones that do not.\n4.1.2 Reliable Accounts\nWe shift our analysis towards the reliable accounts\nand proceed to inspect some of the accounts that\nachieve high IMP SFvalues in this class. First, the\nnumber of veri\ufb01ed accounts is higher than in the un-\nreliable domain with 221 of the accounts achieving\nthis status. Once again, a large number of these ver-\ni\ufb01ed accounts are the of\ufb01cial Twitter accounts of the\nwebsites presented in MBFC. Second, the values ob-\ntained in IMP SFandBEH SFmetrics are lower than\nin unreliable accounts. We hypothesize that due to\nthe highest number of human-operated accounts, the\nfeed of these accounts is more diversi\ufb01ed with con-\nversational threads and fewer publications with links\nto reliable websites.\nWe proceed to analyze some of the accounts\nmanually. One of the \ufb01rst observations that illus-\ntrates the necessity of these metrics to complement\nthe current bot detection systems is that the ac-\ncount with the highest behavior score is a bot ac-\ncount that retweets news from several reliable sources\n(@world news eng). This account is recent (created\nin January 2020) and thus does not present a high\nnumber of followers (consequently not having a high\nIMP SFvalue). It is also important to mention that\nsimilar to unreliable accounts, there are some ac-\ncounts that were removed at the time of this analy-\nsis. Furthermore, some accounts manually analyzed\npresent moderated bias opinions. However, their in-\nformation and opinions are based on information fromWEBIST 2020 - 16th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n346\n\nFigure 1: Characteristics of the accounts with the highest IMP SF. The similarities of the accounts is visible and present all\nthe indicators of bot accounts.\nreliable websites/sources and thus they are included in\nthese category.\nNevertheless, comparing the metrics in both\nclasses, it is clear that the impact that the accounts\nspreading unreliable information on Twitter surpasses\nthe ones the impact of accounts spreading reliable\ncontent.\n4.2 Botometer Vs Reputation Metrics\nTo understand how the metrics developed compare\nto the traditional bot detection systems presented in\nthe state of the art, we analyzed and evaluate the ac-\ncounts extracted using Botometer. This tool, previ-\nously known as BotOrNot, is one of the state of the\nart systems for bot detection (Varol et al., 2017a). Al-\nthough the metrics presented in this paper aim to de-\ntect unreliable accounts (bots and human-operated),\nwe compare the scores assigned by Botometer with\nthe ones computed by our metrics to 1) understand the\nsimilarities/differences between both scores 2) evalu-ate the necessity (or not) of our metrics.\nFor this experiment, we used Botometer \u201duniver-\nsal\u201d score to identify if an account is a bot. This\nscore was used since it relies solely on language-\nindependent features and some of the accounts cap-\ntured do not write in English. The reliability metric\nused was the IMP score metric. We opt by this par-\nticular metric for a fair comparison since Botometer\nscores are more account and content-focus and do not\nuse social feedback features (Varol et al., 2017a). In\naddition, we also normalize the reliability score since\nBotometer provides scores between 0 and 1.\nWe compute the universal bot score in a large sam-\nple of unreliable accounts (n \u001950000). The percent-\nage of bots identi\ufb01ed is approximately 11% of this\nsample since that, according to the authors, accounts\nare only considered bot if they achieve a score supe-\nrior to 0.5. Figure 2 presents the contrast between the\nuniversal score obtained by each account and the IMP\nmetric.\nWe also evaluate if there is a signi\ufb01cant correla-Knowledge-based Reliability Metrics for Social Media Accounts\n347\n\nFigure 2: Comparison between IMP and Botometer score\nfor the accounts retrieved. The red trace indicates the sepa-\nration between human-operated and bot accounts according\nto Botometer. Above that value (Botometer score >0.5),\naccounts are considered to be bots.\nTable 1: Accounts with the highest Botometer score\n(BScore) and their respective reputation score (IMP), num-\nber of followers (NFOLLOWERS) and posts (P Count),\nand date of creation.\nID BScore IMP NFOLLOWERS PCount Creation Date\nBot1 0.965 0.041 305 6.0k Mar 2017\nBot2 0.958 0.001 175 259 Jan 2019\nBot3 0.952 0.006 3114 11.7k May 2012\nBot4 0.952\u00190 4180 1971 Dec 2016\nBot5 0.948 0.001 253 5.7k Jun 2017\nBot6 0.948 0.1 27 3 Aug 2014\nBot7 0.944\u00190 1275 6 Feb 2019\nBot8 0.944 0.001 44 70 Mar 2014\nBot9 0.942\u00190 1 3 Feb 2019\nBot10 0.942\u00190 12 1 Dec 2013\ntion between the scores from Botometer and the relia-\nbility scores. The hypothesis is that bots have a higher\nimpact on the network (and thus achieve a higher\nscore on our metrics) than human-operated accounts.\nSince the distribution is not normal, we evaluate\nthe correlation between the IMP total score and the\nBotometer universal score using Spearman correla-\ntion. The value obtained was 0.191 ( p-value <0.0001)\nwhich indicates a lack of correlation between bot and\nreliability scores.\nWe further investigate some of the accounts sam-\npled to understand the relation between bots and un-\nreliable accounts. Thus, we manually analyzed the\naccounts with the highest botometer score and the\nnormalized reliability metric. Table 1 provides some\ncharacteristics on the 10 highest Botometer score ac-\ncounts while Table 2 refers to the top 10 accounts ac-\ncording to our metric.\nThere are several observations that are important\nto highlight from Table 1 and 2. First, the bottom half\nof the top accounts with the highest bot score have a\nbelow-average number of posts ( \u001470) and a low num-\nber of followers (with the exception of Bot7). Fur-\nthermore, some accounts are classi\ufb01ed as bots with\nhigh con\ufb01dence but whose number of posts and fol-\nlowers is below 10.

Shifting our analysis towards Table 2\nwe can see that none of the unreliable accounts with\nthe highest scores were classi\ufb01ed as bots (bot score >\n0.5) by the Botometer metric. This fact highlights the\nimportance of these metrics since accounts which are\noften discarded as bots can still pose a threat to the\nTwitter ecosystem. By manually inspecting the ac-\ncounts, we can conclude that Unr10 and Unr9 publish\nfalse information and present human-operated behav-\nior since they contain original tweets, original pro\ufb01le\nimages (not found on other websites by using reverse\nimage search) and personal information. Un2, Unr4,\nUnr6 and Unr7 also present human behavior although\nthey do not have an original pro\ufb01le picture. Unr5 is\na non-English account whose unreliable tweets cap-\ntured are English retweets. Finally, accounts Unr1\nand Unr3 are the exceptions since they are social me-\ndia accounts for two of the websites included in Open-\nSources (thus reaching a high unreliable score). Two\nmain conclusions can be derived from this analysis.\nThe \ufb01rst is that state of the art bot detection systems\nare insuf\ufb01cient to detect unreliable accounts since the\ngoal of these systems is to detect accounts that are op-\nerated automatically. Also, some of the top accounts\nlabeled as bots do not have a signi\ufb01cant impact on\nthe network due to their low number of connections\nand publications. On the other hand, Table 2 high-\nlights the importance of the development of frame-\nworks and metrics to detect unreliable accounts since\nthese are often undetected by bot/spam detection sys-\ntems. Also, human-operated unreliable accounts rep-\nresent a large portion of the unreliable accounts an-\nalyzed (\u001989%), which reinforces that bot detection\nsystems are not enough to prevent the detection of un-\nreliable accounts.WEBIST 2020 - 16th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies\n348\n\n5 CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we proposed a framework to extract and\nclassify the reliability of an account. We develop met-\nrics that can measure the impact that an account has\nin a social network environment. By analysing some\nof the accounts with the larger values and comparing\nthe metrics with a bot detection system we can con-\nclude that 1) the framework and metrics are able to\ncapture and classify unreliable accounts that can pose\na threat to the Twitter ecosystem and 2) the metrics\nproposed are useful because they can capture unreli-\nable accounts that bot detection systems like (botome-\nter) failed to capture.\nHowever, as it was previously mentioned, there\nare some limitations with the methodology presented\nin this work. First, the limitations in the Twitter API\nforce us to restrain the number of tweets extracted per\nday. This can have an impact on the number of un-\nreliable posts captured and thus may affect the score\nfor each account. An ideal scenario would be the cap-\nture of all daily tweets that refer a link to a unreliable\nwebsite. However, this would require the access to a\nmore restrictive API and could potentially escalate the\nresources and computation costs. The second limita-\ntion (that is also related to the limitations of the Twit-\nter API) is the lack of an update mechanism for each\naccount score. Due to the dynamics of some posts\u2019\nfeatures (such as number of favourites and retweets),\nat the time of the capture, the posts may still have low\nnumber of favorites/retweets thus not representing the\nreal impact that they can have on the network. Up-\ndates on these posts may require some time due to the\nlimited calls to the Twitter API. In future work, we in-\ntend to tackle that problem by implementing updating\n(i.e. when should an account\u2019s score be updated) and\nforgetting (i.e. when should an account be removed\nfrom the database) mechanisms that respect the goals\nproposed in this work. Finally, we will also aim to\ntackle with more precision the time require to possi-\nbly extract additional information to complement the\nmetrics and how they affect the overall performance\nof the system.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work is partially \ufb01nanced by National Funds\nthrough the Portuguese funding agency, FCT -\nFundac \u00b8 \u02dcao para a Ci \u02c6encia e a Tecnologia, within\nproject UIDB/50014/2020.\u201d Nuno Guimaraes thanks\nthe Fundac \u00b8 \u02dcao para a Ci \u02c6encia e Tecnologia (FCT), Por-\ntugal for the Ph.D. Grant (SFRH/BD/129708/2017).REFERENCES\nAl-Khalifa, H.

Its usage has steadily \nincreased over the years to a reported number of active monthly users of 400 million in \nApril 20201. Telegram offers end-to-end encryption of messages, voice and video calls \nand of \u201csecret\u201d chats. It also allows its users to create and use freely accessible public \ngroup chats and broadcasting channels. The platform is popular in fringe groups and \nfor illegal activities that often take refuge on Telegram after having been banned on less Abstract \nThe instant messaging platform Telegram has become popular among the far-right \nmovements in the US and UK in recent years. These groups use public Telegram chan-\nnels and group chats to disseminate hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theo -\nries. Recent works revealed that the far-right Telegram network structure is decentral-\nized and formed of several communities divided mostly along ideological and national \nlines. Here, we investigated the UK far-right network on Telegram and are interested \nin understanding the different roles of different channels and their influence relations. \nWe apply a community detection method, based on the clustering of a flow of random \nwalkers, that allows us to uncover the organization of the Telegram network in commu-\nnities with different roles. We find three types of communities: (1) upstream communi-\nties contain mostly group chats that comment on content from channels in the rest of \nthe network; (2) core communities contain broadcast channels tightly connected to \neach other and can be seen as forming echo chambers; (3) downstream communities \ncontain popular channels that are highly referenced by other channels. We find that \nthe network is composed of two main sub-networks: one containing mainly channels \nrelated to the English-speaking far-right movements and one with channels in Russian. \nWe analyze the dynamics of the different communities and the most shared external \nlinks in the different types of communities over a period going from 2015 to 2020. We \nfind that different types of communities have different dynamics and share links to dif-\nferent types of websites. We finish by discussing several directions for further work.\nKeywords: Social network, Communication, Social media, Community detection, \nDirected network, Extremism, Organization, EvolutionOpen Access\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

For example, until a \njoined operation by Europol and Telegram in November 2019 that removed 43,000 ter -\nrorist-related bots and channels, the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIS) recommended Telegram to its supporters and members and used it to promote \nradicalism and to coordinate operations (Prucha 2016)2. In particular, Telegram gained \npopularity among the far-right movements in the US, UK and Europe (Urman and Katz \n2022; Walther and McCoy 2021). These groups make use of public Telegram channels \nand group chats to disseminate hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories \n(Walther and McCoy 2021).\nSeveral works have investigated Telegram in relation to the effect of de-platforming of \nextreme Internet celebrities (Rogers 2020), the growth of channels supporting hateful \nideologies (Walther and McCoy 2021), the dissemination of misinformation (Knuutila \net\u00a0al. 2020) or the toxicity of the language used in the groups/channels related to the far-\nright conspiracy theory of QAnon (Hoseini et\u00a0al. 2021). However, little work has been \ndone to understand the organization of the far-right network of channels and group \nchats. Urman and Katz (2022) investigated the structure and evolution of the network \nof far-right channels using standard community detection (Modularity optimization) \nand found communities divided mostly along the ideological and national lines, with \nthe communities related to 4chan imageboard and Donald Trump\u2019s supporters being the \nmost influential. Their analysis of the network\u2019s evolution suggests that the start of its \nexplosive growth is due to the mass bans of far-right actors on mainstream social media \nplatforms.\nHere, we use the novel community detection method flow stability for temporal net -\nworks based on the clustering of a flow of random walkers diffusing along its edges \n(Bovet et\u00a0 al. 2022)\u00a0 adapted to static directed network. This framework allows us to \nuncover the organization and the influence relations of the different Telegram communi -\nties. Compared to classical community detection (Urman and Katz 2022), our approach \nnot only reveals tightly connected clusters but also groups together channels that play \nsimilar roles in the system. Channels/groups that influence the same set of channels \n(i.e. that have similar outgoing flows) or that are influenced by the same set of channels/\ngroups (i.e. that have similar ingoing flows) are clustered together. In this way, we can \nclassify communities in a directed core-periphery model as either: periphery commu -\nnities (upstream or downstream) or core communities. Compared to standard directed \ncore-periphery detection methods (Elliott et\u00a0al. 2020), our method can find several com -\nmunities in the periphery or in the core. Upstream communities contain channels that \nmostly have outgoing links (pointing to the same channels), i.e. that are mostly com -\nmentators of channels from other communities. Channels/groups inside core communi -\nties have strong links with each other, actively participate in discussions across channels, \nand can be seen as forming echo\u00a0chambers. Downstream communities contain popular \nchannels/groups that are highly referenced by other similar channels.\nWe identify the most important channels in the main communities and the domain \nnames of the most shared external links. We also investigate the evolution and dynamics \nof the different communities. These analyses reveal that upstream, core and downstream \n2 https:// www. europ  ol. europa. eu/ newsr  oom/ news/ europ  ol- and-  teleg  ram-  take-  terro rist-  propa ganda- online.\nPage 3 of 27\n Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \n \ncommunities play different roles in the system as they contain different types of chan -\nnels, link to different types of external websites and have different dynamics. We find \nthat channels and group chats related to the far-right are grouped into three main com -\nmunities: an upstream community with the main group chats that, a core community \nwith the main broadcast channels of far-right groups and activists and a downstream \ncommunity with the main channels influencing discussions in the two other communi -\nties. We also find a parallel sub-network of channels that are mostly in the Russian lan -\nguage. We finish by discussing several directions for further work.\nResults\nDataset and\u00a0network reconstruction\nTo build our dataset, we first used a large open dataset of Telegram messages contain -\ning over 27.8K channels and 317M messages from 2.2M unique users (Baumgartner \net\u00a0al. 2020). We refer to this dataset as the Pushshift dataset. This dataset covers mes -\nsages from September 2015 until November 2019 and was collected using a snowball \nsampling approach starting from a seed list of 250 primarily English-language public \nbroadcast channels and public group chats, among which 124 channels focus on right-\nwing extremist politics. All the available messages from each of those channels were col -\nlected and new channels are discovered each time content forwarded from a channel \nthat is not already in the dataset is found. The messages from the new channels were \nthen collected and the procedure was repeated using the forwarded content of the newly \ndiscovered channels (Baumgartner et\u00a0al. 2020). To find messages relevant to the UK far-\nright, we selected all Telegram messages from the Pushshift dataset containing the term \nbritainfirst in their content. This includes messages containing links to the Britain First \nTelegram channel and URLs using the term in their address, such as URLs pointing to \nBritain First\u2019s website. We choose to focus on Britain First because it is a central organi -\nzation in the UK far-right movement3 and because a manual inspection of the Pushshift \ndataset revealed that the official Britain First Telegram channel was a prominent chan -\nnel for keywords related to the far-right in the UK and that other active British far-right \norganizations (e.g., British National Party, National Front or Sonnenkrieg Division4) did \nnot have an active presence in the Pushshift dataset. Among all the URLs in the mes -\nsages we found, 98.6% are URLs linking to the Britain First channel or to other Telegram \nchannels (in the form t.me/channel_name). These come from messages containing a list \nof links pointing to several related channels that are frequently observed in Telegram. \nThe other URLs are linking to secret Telegram chats (0.8%) and external websites (0.6%). \nThis results in a seed set of 2729 posts from April 6th, 2019 to October 14th, 2019 from \n258 channels/groups. We then expanded our dataset by collecting (using the Telegram \nAPI) all existing messages from all the public channels/groups that appeared in our ini -\ntial seed set, i.e. all the messages of the 258 channels from the Pushshift dataset and \nadditional channels we found through forwarded content, links to join them or men -\ntions. As Telegram users are free to delete their messages, we were only able to collect \n3 https:// en. wikip  edia. org/ wiki/ Brita in_ First .\n4 https:// en. wikip  edia. org/ wiki/ Far- right_ polit ics_ in_ the_ United_ Kingd om.\nPage 4 of 27 Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \nmessages that had not been deleted. The resulting dataset contains 7 million messages \nfrom 12,564 channels posted between September 2015 and January 2021.\nWe build a directed weighted network where nodes represent channels/groups and \nedges represent the potential flow of users between channels: an edge from node A to \nnode B can represent a mention of node B in node A, a URL link pointing to node B \nposted in node A or message from node B forwarded in node A. With this convention, \nrelations of potential influence between channels follow the opposite direction of edges. \nFigure\u00a0 1 shows the evolution of the network size and of the weekly number of edges and \nunique nodes.\nFigure\u00a0 1C shows the number of edges, counting multi-edges between the same two \nnodes. It is therefore a measure of the weekly activity between channels in the network. \nWe observe two significant rapid increases in the number of weekly edges: the first in \nmid-2019 and the second in early 2020, corresponding to the start of the COVID-19 \npandemic. The first increase in 2019 has also been observed by Urman and Katz (2022). \nThey identified it as being connected to British far-right actors joining Telegram after \nbeing banned from Facebook and Instagram at that time. We use these two instants to \nseparate our dataset into three networks. The first network spans the interval from Sep -\ntember 2015 until June 30th, 2019 and corresponds to the early phase of the network \nthat see a constant and slow increase in the number of channels and activity. The second \none spans the interval from July 1st, 2019 until February 29th, 2020 and corresponds to \na time of marked increase in\u00a0activity in the network. The last one covers the first year of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and corresponds to an additional increase in activity. It starts \non March 1st, 2020 and finished at the end of the collection period, December 31st, \n2020.Fig. 1 Evolution of the network of Telegram public channels/groups related to the far-right movement.

In each network, forwarding \nis the dominating type of activity between channels. For the remainder of the analysis, \nwe represent the three networks as weighted directed networks where the weight of each \nedge is given by the total number of interactions, in the same direction, between two \nchannels.\nNetwork clustering\nIn order to understand the organization of the telegram channels we employ a clustering \nmethod that allows us to take into account the direction of the edges in the networks. As \nedges represent the potential flow of users in this network, this approach allows us to \nreveal the asymmetrical relations between clusters, or communities, in terms of influ -\nence and flow of users. We use the flow stability method (Bovet et\u00a0al. 2022) that clusters \nnodes together based on the similarity of a diffusive flow starting on them. This method \ngeneralizes the Markov stability (Delvenne et\u00a0al. 2010; Lambiotte et\u00a0al. 2014) method to \nnon-stationary dynamics and is therefore well suited to directed networks that are not \nstrongly connected, i.e. where a diffusive flow does not reach a non-trivial stationary \nstate. The clustering yields two partitions obtained by clustering the covariance matrix \nof the diffusive process in forward and backward time. Here, we adapt the method for \nstatic directed networks by considering two transition matrices for two continuous time \nrandom walk processes: one following the edges (forward) and one going in the reverse \ndirection of the edges (backward). The two transition matrices are given by T(t)f=e\u2212tLf \nand T(t)b=e\u2212tLb , respectively. The forward and backward Laplacians are given by \nLf=I\u2212D\u22121\noutAf and Lb=I\u2212D\u22121\ninAT\nb , where Af is the forward adjacency matrix of size \nNf\u00d7Nf , obtained by iteratively removing nodes that have an out-degree equal to zero, \nAb is the backward adjacency matrix of size Nb\u00d7Nb , obtained by iteratively removing \nnodes that have an in-degree equal to zero, Dout=diag (Af1) and Din=diag (AT\nb1) . \nUsing uniform initial conditions, pf(0)=1\nNf1 and pb(0)=1\nNb1 , the covariance matrices \nof both processes are given by  (Bovet et\u00a0al.\u00a02022)\nand(1) Sforw (t)=Pf(0)Tf(t)Tinv\nf(t)\u2212pf(0)Tpf(0)\n(2) =1\nNfTf(t)Tinv\nf(t)\u22121\nN2\nf\u2190\u21921Table 1 Statistics of the telegram networks corresponding to the three periods we consider\nWe report the numbers for the three types of interactions between channels: mention of another channel, forwarding a \nmessage from another channel and posting a link to another channel.

They are given by Bayes\u2019 Theorem as Tinv\nf(t)=P(t)\u22121TT\nf(t)P(0) and \nTinv\nf(t)=P(t)\u22121TT\nf(t)P(0) . The element ( i,\u00a0j) of the covariances encodes the probability \nfor two random walkers starting on nodes i and j to be on the same node at time t minus \nthe same probability for two independent random walkers. The two partitions found \nby clustering the two covariance matrices in diagonal blocks, therefore, group together \nnodes in communities of nodes that act as similar \u201csources\u201d , for the forward covariance, \nor \u201csinks\u201d for the backward covariance, of the flow. The forward and backward qual -\nity functions are given by the traces of the clustered forward and backward covariance \nmatrices (Delvenne et\u00a0 al. 2010 ) and allow one to find the best forward and backward \npartitions with a range of optimization algorithms such as the Louvain algorithm. As \nin the Markov stability framework (Delvenne et\u00a0al. 2010 ), the time t plays the role of a \nresolution parameter. As time increases, the random walk covers larger distances in the \nnetwork and larger communities are found.\nWe then combine the forward and backward partitions in one partition. Nodes that \nare only in Af are clustered according to their forward communities, nodes that are \nonly in Ab are clustered according to their backward communities and nodes that \nare in both networks are clustered according to the intersection of the forward and \nbackward partitions. We note that some nodes of the original network may have been \nremoved in both Af and Ab and therefore absent from the forward and backward \npartitions. In practice, they represent a very small number of nodes. We consider an \nadditional community containing those nodes that have, by construction, little impor -\ntance in terms of source or sinks in the network.\nWe vary the time parameter and perform the optimization 50 times at each time \npoint with the Louvain algorithm. The average normalized variation of information \n(NVI) of the ensemble of 50 partitions found at each time measures the stability of \nthe solutions and allows one to find natural scales of the system corresponding to \nminima of the NVI (Lambiotte et\u00a0al. 2014 ). Figure\u00a0 2 shows the average and standard \ndeviation of the NVI taken across the three networks. We choose the value t=4.8 as \nour resolution as it corresponds to a minimum for the forward and backward NVI \n(indicated by a vertical line in Fig.\u00a0 2).\nIn order to classify clusters as being upstream, downstream or core clusters we \ncharacterize how many nodes in each cluster tend to rather have incoming or outgo -\ning edges by measuring the average proportion of incoming edges of each cluster. For \na cluster C this gives IC=1\n|C| i\u2208Csin\ni\nsin\ni+sout\ni , where sin\ni and sout\ni are the in- and out-\nstrengths of node i, respectively. Figure\u00a0 3 shows the sorted values of IC for the three \nnetworks. Three plateaus of low, middle, and high values are visible. We choose to \nclassify clusters with IC values higher than 0.8 as downstream , the clusters with IC (3) Sback (t)=Pb(0)Tb(t)Tinv\nb(t)\u2212pb(0)Tpb(0)\n(4) =1\nNbTb(t)Tinv\nb(b)\u22121\nN2\nb\u2190\u21921\nPage 7 of 27\n Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \n \nvalues smaller than 0.2 as upstream clusters and the clusters with IC values between \nthose two thresholds as core clusters.\nFigures\u00a0 4,\u00a05 and 6 show the results of the flow stability clustering applied to the three \nTelegram networks. Each community is displayed as a node with a size proportional to \nthe size of the community. Edges represent the number of links between the communi -\nties, with self-loops representing the number of internal links. Core communities tend \nto have the largest self-loops. The structure of the three networks is characterized by \nthe presence of two main core communities and two main downstream communities \nlabeled CF,CR,DF,&DR , respectively. The rank, in terms of size, is shown in parenthe -\nses on each community together with its size. The two main core and two main down -\nstream communities are arranged in two pairs.

The downstream communities are \nrather the object of the discussions. The upstream communities are comparatively small \nwhich may\u00a0be due in part to the collection method that necessarily follows downstream \nlinks between channels.\nChannels\nWe identify the most important channels by ranking them using their Katz centrality \n(Katz 1953). The Katz centrality of node i is the weighted sum of all walks emanating \nfrom i, with the count for walks of length \u2113 weighted by a factor \u03b1\u2113 where 0 <\u03b1<  1. A \nwalk in a network is an alternating sequence of nodes and edges in which every node \nis incident to both the edges that come before and after it in the sequence (Bovet and \nMakse 2021). Here, walks represent the\u00a0potential trajectories of users in the Telegram \nnetwork. The Katz centrality captures long-range structures in the network, but the \nimportance of longer walks is diminished compared to shorter walks. Here we choose \n\u03b1=0.99\u00b71//afii9838 1 where /afii98381 is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix.\nFig. 4 Flow stability clustering of the telegram channels network G1 (Sep. 2015 to June 2019).

In the upstream communities, we are interested to find channels that serve as \nentry points to the network and we, therefore, use their out-Katz centrality, i.e. highly \nranked channels are channels that are the starting point of many walks in the network. \nWe display the names of channels belonging to organizations, news commentators and \npublic figures. Channels with names potentially corresponding to private individuals are \nreplaced by ### to respect privacy (we count only two such channels in the top ranks).\nTable\u00a0 2 shows the top channels for the first network covering Sep. 2015 to June 2019. \nThe top channels in the largest downstream community ( DR ) are mainly Russian-lan -\nguage broadcast channels about Russian political and business news.

The third largest core community is a relatively \nsmall community (137 channels, see Fig.\u00a0 5) with an assortment of diverse broadcast \nchannels with unofficial commentary on local news, cryptocurrencies or football. Simi -\nlarly to the core communities, the two largest upstream communities share several top \nchannels with the two largest upstream communities of the first network (Table\u00a0 2). The \ncommunity with many group chats related to the far-right is now the largest and we see \nseveral new group chats. One of the group chats is named nomorelockdown referring to \nthe lockdowns imposed during the COVID19 pandemic that started after the time range \nused to construct this network. This could be explained by the fact that this channel \nchanged its name when the pandemic started.\nTable\u00a0 4 shows the top channels in the main communities for the period of March 2020 \nto December 2020. The lists of top channels in the three largest downstream commu -\nnities have a large overlap with the same communities of the previous network. In the \nDF community, we see the addition of new alternative news channels (e.g. newspanopti -\ncon, eQsynews) and channels related to right-wing personalities such as SidneyPowell1, \nassociated with the American attorney, former federal prosecutor, and conspiracy theo -\nrist Sidney Katherine Powell21 or JoleneBuntingUK, linked to Jolene Bunting, a former Table 4 Most important channels in the main downstream, core and upstream clusters for the \nnetwork G3 in Fig. 6 corresponding to the period March 2020 to Dec. 2020\nWe give the top channels ranked by their in\u2011Katz centrality for channels in the downstream and core clusters and ranked \nby their out \u2011Katz centrality in the upstream clusters.

The community \ncontaining U.K. and U.S. far-right channels ( CF ) is now larger than the one containing \nRussian channels. New addition includes a channel linked to the 2020 U.S. presidential \nelections (usvoterfraud) and a group chat that was previously in the upstream commu -\nnity (trrchat linked to \u201cThe Reality Report\u201d). Three group chats are now present in the \ntop 20 channels of the largest core community indicating that they not only link to other \nchannels, i.e. comment on the content of other channels, but are also linked to by other \nchannels of the core community. This reveals their more central role compared to group \nchats in the downstream communities. The channel sputniklive appears in the top chan -\nnels of the second largest core community ( CR ). The Russian state-owned news agency \nSputnik News, together with RT (channel rt_russian) have been described as part of the Fig. 7 Alluvial diagram of the evolution of the communities across the three periods. Flows represent the \nmovement of channels from community to community across time. New channels entering and existing \nin the system are represented as arriving from \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d groups, respectively. The upstream, core and \ndownstream communities are grouped in three different bundles and shown in different colors\n22 https:// www. bbc. com/ news/ uk- north ern- irela nd- 45562 784.\n23 https:// www. bbc. co. uk/ news/ elect ion-  us- 2020- 54359 993.\nPage 16 of 27 Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \npropaganda apparatus of the Russian government and frequent sources of pro-Kremlin \ndisinformation (Karlsen 2016; Benkler et\u00a0al. 2018; I\u017eak 2019). The top channels in the \ntwo largest upstream communities show a large turnover. In the largest community, 15 \nchannels appear in the top 20 for the first time. Several new group chats are linked to \nDonald Trump (donaldtrumpchat, FuckYourFeels, magafirstnews).\nNetwork evolution\nFigure\u00a0 7 shows the evolution of the communities from network to network as an allu -\nvial diagram. The flows in the figure represent the movement of channels from the \ncommunities of one network to the following. The incoming and outgoing flows repre -\nsent the number of new channels entering the system and channels exiting the system \nbetween the different time windows. We label with a CR the flow corresponding to the \ncore community containing the most top channels linked to the far-right movements \nEnglish-speaking countries (see also Figs.\u00a0 4, 5, 6). We see that, across time, this com -\nmunity is persistent and continuously growing, going from 6th to 3rd in terms of size, \nwith 319 channels in G1 , 845 in G2 and 1252 in G3 . We also notice that the channels \njoining this community are majoritarily coming from the exterior, meaning that they are \neither new or coming from outside the system. We also see very few channels going out \nof the system, which happens when a channel closes, stops showing activity or becomes \nprivate. Between G1 and G2 , 13 channels from this community exit the system and 438 \njoin the community from outside the system. Between G2 and G3 , the same analysis gives \n54 channels exiting and 465 entering. The core community with top channels including \nRussian news media and commentary is labeled as CR . As for the far-right community \n( CF ), this community is growing with mostly new channels joining it and only a small \nfraction leaving it during each period.\nThe downstream community having top channels in Russian language is labeled with \na DR in Fig.\u00a0 7. The downstream community containing right-wing news channels and \nfar-right related channels is labeled with a DF . We see that, contrary to the situation \nwith the core communities, a large fraction of the channels in these communities change \nbetween each period. Between G1 and G2 , 988 channels from DR and 1187 channels from \nDF exit the system while 593 new channels join DR and 928 new channels join DF . Mean -\nwhile, DR shrank from 3080 to 2691 channels and DF grew from 2519 to 2691 channels. \nBetween G2 and G3 , 539 channels from DR and 722 channels from DF exit the system Table 5 Movement of channels across upstream, core and downstream communities between the \nnetworks corresponding to different time periods\nThe fraction moving to the exterior corresponds to the fraction of channels exiting the systemG1 to G2 Upstream (%) Core (%) Downstream (%) Exterior (%)\nUpstream 13 66 13 8\nCore 2 83 11 4\nDownstream 0.1 3 56 41\nG2 to G3 Upstream (%) Core (%) Downstream (%) Exterior (%)\nUpstream 17 68 6 9\nCore 3 78 13 6\nDownstream 0.2 7 69 24\nPage 17 of 27\n Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \n \nwhile 336 new channels join DR and 737 new channels join DF . In G3 , DR has 2452 chan -\nnels and DF has 2516 channels.\nFigure\u00a0 7 also reveals that only a limited number of channels move between the \nupstream, core and downstream groups. We report the fraction of channels mov -\ning across community types and exiting the system in Table\u00a0 5. We see that, apart for \nupstream channels that, for the most part, move to the core, channels in the core and in \nthe downstream communities remain, for the most part, in the same category of com -\nmunity. The exchanges between core and downstream are limited (maximum of 13% \nfrom core to downstream and 7% from downstream to core).\nThese differences in dynamics between upstream, core and downstream communi -\nties indicate that channels in different groups play different roles in this system. The \nlarge renewal of channels in the downstream communities suggests that these chan -\nnels change according to the change of focus of the discussions happening in the core \nand upstream communities. The core communities represent the center of the network \nwhich slowly grows with time. They contain channels that refer to each other and pro -\nvide commentary about channels in the downstream networks. The upstream commu -\nnities seem to be entry points in the network where most discussions between users \nhappen. A large fraction of these channels eventually moves to the core as they become \nmore popular and are\u00a0also referred to by other channels in the core.\nRelations to\u00a0external websites\nIn order to better understand how channels in different communities relate to exter -\nnal websites, we extract all the URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) that are shared in \nthe main communities of each network. We resolve URLs that use a URL shortening \nservice (i.e. bitly.com) (Yin 2018) and match popular custom-shortened URLs to their \nfull domain name (i.e. nyti.ms to nytimes.com) to extract the domain name of each link. \nTables\u00a0 6,\u00a07 and\u00a0 8 list the top 20 domain names shared in the main communities of the \nthree networks.\nTo evaluate the change in the ranked domain lists across networks, we compute the \nRank-Biased Overlap similarity (RBO) (Webber et\u00a0al. 2010) between the lists obtained \nin the first, second and third networks (see Table\u00a0 9). The RBO measures of the similarity \nbetween incomplete rankings, handles non-conjointness and weights high ranks more \nheavily than low ones. Such properties are desirable here because the lists of domains \nare extensive but we are mostly interested in the variation in of most popular domains \nand because domain names can appear or disappear from one time frame to the next. \nWe chose the weighting parameter p=0.91 , giving 95% of the weight to the top 20 ele -\nments of the lists.\nThe top domain names in the Russian downstream community ( DR ) for the period \nof Sep. 2015 to June 2019 include several news websites (Table\u00a0 6). The top one, with \napproximately 4.5 times more counts than the second one, is the Russian news website \nrossaprimavera.ru. Its description on its Twitter page,24 reads \u201cOur movement fights \nfor #Humanity #Communism\u201d .

of \nits website. The second and third domain names are both related to the website Hacker \nNews which is a social news website, in English, focusing on computer science and \nentrepreneurship. In the remaining top 20 domain names, we see mainly Russian and \nUkrainian news websites. The only social media website, Twitter, is in the last position. \nThe domain name vk.cc is related to the Russian social media VKontakte, but is linked \nto their URL shortening service and appears here due to a number of shortened URLs \nthat we were not able to resolve.\nThe top domains in the far-right related downstream cluster ( DF ) also contain a large \nproportion of news websites, but mainly from the US and UK. The exception is the Ira -\nnian news website iribnews.ir. We see a mix of well-known center/left-leaning \nnews outlets (e.g. nytimes.com, bbc.co.uk, whasingtonpost.com) and newer \nright-wing/far-right news outlets (e.g. zerohedge.com, dailycaller.com, bre-\nitbart.com, infowars.com). We also see two websites that have been classified \nas sources with low factual reporting, diffusing conspiracy theories and Russian propa -\nganda by MBFC: southfront.org26 and russia-insider.com.27 Social media \nwebsites are also present in the top domain names: Twitter, Youtube, Whatsapp, Reddit.\nIn the Russian core community ( CR ), we see different websites than in the Russian \ndownstream community. The two most popular websites are the Russian online newspa -\nper lenta.ru and the British newspaper telegraph.co.uk. Other websites in the \ntop 20 include meduza.io, a news website founded by former employees of lenta.\nru which is based in Lativa in order to escape censorship from the Russian govern -\nment,28 ntv.ru a television channel controlled by GazProm Media since 2001,29 and \nseveral news outlets that have been flagged as spreading pro-Russian disinformation \nby EuvsDisinfo:30 riafan.ru, ria.ru, rt.com, znak.com, kp.ru, kommer-\nsant.ru, vz.ru, rbc.ru, iz.ru,  govoritmoskva.ru.

We also see far-right news outlets such as Voice of Europe, Zero Hedge31 \nand The Daily Stormer.32 The international Kremlin-controlled news outlets sput -\nniknews.com and rt.com are also present.\nThe branch antenna of the Sputnik News online website, in Russian, is the most \nshared domain name in the Russian upstream community. Other top domain names in \nthis community include local television channels and news outlets, blogs, a Ukrainian \npolitical think tank (uiamp.org.ua) and social media websites (Twitter, YouTube and \nReddit).\nIn the far-right upstream community ( UF ) social media YouTube and Twitter are the \nmost shared websites by a large margin. Other top websites include American far-right \nnews websites and more traditional American center news outlets (usatoday.com \nand cnn.com). The blog hosting website medium.com is also present.\nThe top domains for in the main communities of the second network (July. 2019 to \nFeb. 2020) are displayed in Table\u00a0 7. In the Russian downstream cluster of the second net -\nwork, the top domain name is still rossaprimavera.ru as in the first network, but it \nis now accompanied by Russian news websites that were in the core Russian community \nbefore (e.g. lenta.ru, meduza.io, rt.com). A new domain, tasnimnews.com, is \nthe website of a private news agency in Iran that publishes in Persian and English and \nis classified as a questionable source diffusing state propaganda by MBFC.33 The RBO \nvalue between the ranked lists of the first and second networks of this community is 0.36 \nindicating an important change of domain name usage (Table\u00a09).\nIn the far-right downstream community, we see many of the same websites that were \nin the first network including popular center/left news outlets (e.g. nytimes.com, \nbbc.co.uk), US far-right news outlets (e.g. breitbart.com, dailycaller.com, \nzerohedge.com, infowars.com) and social media websites such as twitter.\ncom, reddit.com, nitter.pro (an alternative Twitter front-end focused on privacy) \nand youtube.com.

The most \nshared domains are the social media websites Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and 4chan. We \nalso see the Russian propaganda outlets Sputnik News and RT, as well as\u00a0far-right US \nand EU news outlets such as Info Wars, Zero Hedge, Voice of Europe and Epoch Times \n(in German). Domain names that appear for the first time include yna.kr, from the \nSouth Korean Yonhap News Agency, bitchute.com, an \u201calt-tech\u201d video hosting ser -\nvice that plays the role of an alternative to YouTube for the far-right and where hate \nspeech is highly prevalent (Trujillo et\u00a0al. 2020; Freelon et\u00a0al. 2020).\nIn the far-right upstream cluster, the social media YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are \namong the most shared domain names, as they were in the first network. The RBO value \nbetween the first and second networks is 0.60 (Table\u00a0 9). BitChute is now also present in \nthe list. Three South African news outlets also appeared on the list (businesstech.\nco.za, iol.co.za and ewn.co.za).\nThe top domain names in the Russian upstream community are mainly different \nthan the ones in the same community for the first network (RBO of 0.14). The websites \nremaining in the top 20 include social media (YouTube, Twitter) and the blog hosting \nwebsite Medium. Other top 20 websites include telegraph.co.uk and Russian news \noutlets.\nIn the third network (from March 2020 to Dec. 2020, Table\u00a0 8), the two top domains \nin the far-right downstream community are still twitter.com and nytimes.com, \nbut twitter.com has now more than four times more counts than nytimes.com. \nThe rest of the top domain names are very similar to the domains list from the second \nnetwork with an RBO value of 0.71 (Table\u00a0 9). The Russian downstream and the Russian \nand far-right core communities also have very similar top domains than in the second \nnetwork with RBO values of 0.78, 0.67 and 0.64, respectively.\nThe top domains in the far-right upstream community are also very similar to the \ndomains in the second network (RBO of 0.65). We see the appearance of the new domain \nnames parler.com, the American alt-tech social media service associated with Don -\nald Trump supporters and far-right extremists,38 and britishfreedomparty.com \nwhich is a political party associated with the British far-right activist Jayda Fransen.39\n38 https:// en. wikip  edia. org/ wiki/ Parler .\n39 https:// en. wikip  edia. org/ wiki/ Jayda_ Frans  en.37 https:// euvsd isinfo. eu/ disin forma  tion- cases/? text= fort- russ. com.\nPage 24 of 27 Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \nDiscussion\nWe applied a community detection method that cluster flows of random walkers on the \nnetworks. Our community detection analysis reveals the existence of communities of \nchannels with different roles. We find that the far-right sub-network in our Telegram \ndataset can be described by an upstream, a core and a downstream community. We also \nfind a parallel sub-network mainly comprised of channels in the Russian language with a \nsimilar structure.\nThe upstream far-right community contains between 44 and 78 channels whose most \nimportant ones are mainly group chats, where users can all post messages and have dis -\ncussions. Upstream communities are defined as a group of nodes from which the flow \nof random walkers tends to stay together and move to similar other channels, i.e. by fol -\nlowing the link emanating from these channels, one ends up in the same channels, dif -\nferent than the starting group of channels. As the network evolves, only a small fraction \nof these channels remain in the upstream community, the majority moving to the core \ncommunities. The main links to external websites shared in the far-right upstream com -\nmunity point to social media (Twitter and Youtube are the most shared), indicating that \ncontent shared on these more traditional platforms is greatly discussed in the upstream \ngroup chats. The upstream community can be seen as being a place for users to discuss  \nthe content shared on external websites as well as the the content shared on broadcast \nchannels in the core and the downstream communities. It can be seen as an entry point \nfor users to learn about and access channels in these other part of the network.\nThe core far-right community grew considerably in size during our collection period \n(from 319 to 1252 channels). Core communities are defined by groups of channels from \nwhich the flow of random walker tend to stay inside the group, implying that they have \nreciprocal interactions and form a tight cluster. The most important channels in this \ncommunity are mainly broadcast channels, i.e. channels where a small selected number \nof users (administrators) make posts that are read by the members of the channel. We \nfind channels linked to far-right organizations and personalities in the UK and US as \nwell as channels related to the anonymous message board 4Chan. Several channels in \nthis community have been observed in other works investigating the far-right movement \non Telegram (Urman and Katz 2022; Walther and McCoy 2021). As the network evolves, \na large majority of channels remain in the core community and only a small fraction exit \nthe system. The most shared domains in these communities are relatively stable across \ntime and consist of social media websites (e.g. Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and 4chan) as \nwell as Russian propaganda outlets (e.g. Sputnik News and RT) and far-right US and EU \nnews outlets such as Info Wars, Zero Hedge, Voice of Europe and Epoch Times (in Ger -\nman). This community can be seen as made of a tight group of central channels that \nstrongly interact with each other, share and comment on content from social media plat -\nforms and far-right news outlets.\nThe downstream far-right community has a stable size of around 2500 channels in the \nthree networks corresponding to the different time periods. Downstream communities \nare defined as the opposite of upstream communities. When following the link start -\ning from a downstream community in the reversed direction, one ends up on a similar \ngroup of channels that is different from the starting group, i.e. downstream communities \nare the ones linked by other channels in a non-reciprocal way. The most shared domain \nPage 25 of 27\n Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \n \nnames in this community are well-known US and UK center and left-leaning traditional \nnews outlets and US right-wing and far-right news outlets as well as news outlets hav -\ning been flagged for propagating pro-Russian propaganda. Social media websites are also \npresent in the top domain names. The channels in the downstream far-right community \ncan be seen as representing the source of information and object of discussions of the \nfar-right core and upstream channels.\nOur investigation also revealed the presence of a Russian sub-network also organized \nin a main upstream, core and downstream community, with channels from Russian news \noutlets, most of them having been identified as spreading pro-Russian propaganda, and \nchannels from Russian political figures and independent commentators. In the most \nshared domain name, we find many news outlets flagged by EUvsDisinfo for sharing \ndisinformation but also some news outlets diffusing independent reporting about Rus -\nsia (e.g. meduza.io). This suggests that discussions between pro-Russian government \nchannels and channels critical of the government happen on Telegram. Investigating \nthe extent and the evolution of such disputes on Telegram would be interesting. Moreo -\nver, investigating the relations between the Russian and US/UK far-right sub-networks \nwould also be interesting. We have seen that pro-Russian news outlets in English were \npresent in the most shared domains in the far-right sub-network.\nThe far-right core community we discovered can be seen as an \u201cecho chamber\u201d , i.e. an \nenvironment in which the opinion, political leaning, or belief of users about a topic gets \nreinforced due to repeated circular or reciprocated interactions with peers or sources \nhaving similar tendencies and attitudes (Cinelli et\u00a0 al. 2021). However, echo chambers \ntake different forms depending on the medium in which interactions happen (Jamieson \nand Cappella 2008; Garrett 2009; Garimella et\u00a0 al. 2018; Cota et\u00a0 al. 2019; Cinelli et\u00a0 al. \n2021). For a user navigating the network following links from channel to channel, the \ncore communities, as we defined them, play indeed the role of echo chambers, however, \nwe note that our network is defined at the level of channels and group chats and that \nthe main far-right core community is mainly made of broadcast channels. In broadcast \nchannels, users are mostly consuming the content and not actively participating in dis -\ncussions. On the other hand, in group chats, users can discuss with each other and it \nis likely that opinion-reinforcing processes also take place in group chats. Interestingly, \nwe found many group chats in the far-right upstream community, indicating that these \ngroup chats link more frequently to the core community than between themselves. This \nsuggests two different levels of echo chambers: a participative one inside group chats \nand a more passive one made of the channels of the core community. In our case, an \ninteresting line of research would also be to better understand the structure of the echo \nchamber in the core community. Indeed, the core community is made of a large num -\nber of channels that may focus on different topics and have different objectives. When \ninvestigating the far-right network on Telegram, Urman and Katz found several com -\nmunities divided mainly along ideological and national lines (Urman and Katz 2022). A \npossibility would be to define finer echo chambers as graph cycles, i.e. directed paths \nacross channels in which all edges are distinct and that start and end on the same chan -\nnel. They would capture the reinforcing effect of echo chambers. One could then decom -\npose the core community into individual cycles and characterize their overlap, possible \nindependence, and evolution.\nPage 26 of 27 Bovet\u00a0and Grindrod  Applied Network Science            (2022) 7:76 \nOur approach allowed us to provide a novel insight onto the organization of the far-\nright network in Telegram revealing the different roles that have different types of chan -\nnels. Our method could be applied to uncover the organization of interactions between \ndifferent actors in other social media platforms where interactions take place between \nuser groups (e.g. subreddits, Facebook groups) or directly between users (e.g. Twitter). \nFurther work could focus on better characterizing the echo chambers in the core com -\nmunity and also better understanding the limitations inherent to the method of collec -\ntion. For example, following links posted on a seed set of channels could explain why we \nfind more channels in the downstream communities than in the upstream communities. \nAnother aspect of Telegram data collection is the fact that users often delete their mes -\nsages and that channel can also be deleted. Modeling these processes to better under -\nstand their effect on the inferred structure of the network would be an interesting line of \nresearch.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge useful discussions with Renaud Lambiotte.\nAuthor contributions\nAB and PG designed the study.
