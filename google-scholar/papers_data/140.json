Homepage layouts serve as a tangi-\nble proxy for this prioritization. In this work,\nwe present NewsHomepages, a large dataset\nof over 3,000 new website homepages (includ-\ning local, national and topic-specific outlets)\ncaptured twice daily over a three-year period.\nWe develop models to perform pairwise com-\nparisons between news items to infer their rel-\native significance. To illustrate that modeling\norganizational hierarchies has broader implica-\ntions, we applied our models to rank-order a\ncollection of local city council policies passed\nover a ten-year period in San Francisco, assess-\ning their \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d. Our findings lay\nthe groundwork for leveraging implicit organi-\nzational cues to deepen our understanding of\ninformation prioritization.\n1 Introduction\nThe way humans prioritize and organize informa-\ntion is central to attention and understanding. Prior\nwork has explored the need for effective priori-\ntization to manage information overload (Miller,\n1956) and including case-studies of prioritization\napproaches (Rosenfeld, 2002; Hays, 2018). How-\never, larger scale analyses, specifically with an aim\ntowards predictive modeling, are often limited by\nlack of available data and methods.\nIn this work, we seek to rectify this by focus-\ning on a prominent source of publicly available,\nhighly curated examples of prioritization decisions.\nNews organizations\u2019 homepages are meticulously\ncrafted by professional human editors: their lay-\nouts offer manifestations of the news organization\u2019s\nprioritization principles (Boukes et al., 2022). We\nuse homepage layouts to study information orga-\nnization at scale. We present NewsHomepages ,\nto our knowledge the first large-scale homepage\n* indicates co-first authorship\nFigure 1: Two \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d signals that editors\nmake to guide reader attention are shown above. (1)\nPosition (i.e. articles that are placed above, \u2191, and left,\n\u2190relative to other articles are more important Hays\n(2018)). (2) Size (i.e. articles that are larger than other\narticles are more important) (3) Graphics and Font (i.e.\narticles with graphics and images are more important).\nWe release NewsHomepages , a large dataset of over\n3,000 homepages, collected twice-daily over three years,\nstudy information prioritization in this setting. We show\ncan model these decisions at scale and demonstrate the\nusefulness of these models on two downstream tasks.\nlayout dataset, consisting of over 363k full page\nscreenshots, HTML, extract links and other meta-\ndata from over 3,000 websites, which we captured\ntwice daily over a three-year period, from local,\nmagazine, and national news homepages. With this\ndataset, we ask: how well can we model the edito-\nrial decisions behind homepage layout? What do\nthese decisions tell us about the priorities of the\nnewspaper and the world?\nTo answer these questions, we develop models\nto process and learn from our dataset at scale. First,\nwe develop a novel bootstrapping approach to ro-arXiv:2501.00004v1  [cs.IR]  21 Nov 2024\nbustly parse homepage screen captures and deter-\nmine precise spatial positions of news articles on\nhomepages. Then, we train models to perform pair-\nwise comparisons between articles based on their\npositions within layouts. By interpreting positional\ncues as indicators of significance, our models infer\nthe relative importance of information.\nThe ability to learn these decisions with high\naccuracy indicates the robust signal this dataset\ncaptures. We conducted two downstream experi-\nments utilizing these models; in each, we applied\nour pairwise comparison models to rank-order a\nlist of text. In the first experiment, we use models\ntrained on the newsworthy judgments of one news\noutlet to sort the news articles of another. We find\nsurprising nuances: for instance, despite Breitbart\n(a right-leaning outlet) being topically dissimilar\ntoMother Jones (a left-leaning outlet), their news-\nworthy preferences are among the most correlated\nof outlets we studied. In the second analysis, we\nused each outlet\u2019s newsworthiness judgments to\nrank-order local city council policies passed in San\nFrancisco (Spangher et al., 2023a). By assessing\nthese policies\u2019 \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d through the lens\nof organizational prominence, we highlight how\nimplicit cues in information structure can transfer\nbetween domains and serve as useful tools (in this\ncase, to help human journalists find relevant story-\ntopics). Our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022We introduce NewsHomepages, large-scale\ndataset of hompage layouts from over 3,000\nlocal, national and topic-specific news or-\nganizations, and develop a robust, weakly-\nsupervised method to parse articles.\n\u2022We demonstrate that editorial principles be-\nhind information prioritization can be learned,\nby training pairwise comparison models to\npredict article size and positionality.\n\u2022We show via two case-studies \u2013 (1) newswor-\nthiness agreement between outlets, and (2)\ngenerating newsworthiness rankings for non-\nnews corpora \u2013 that such learned principles\ncan generalize beyond the corpora we study\nand provide useful tools for end-users.\nThis work opens new avenues for exploring how\nimplicit cues in digital environments reflect latent\npriorities and organizational principles. By model-\ning these cues, we can gain richer insights into the\nmechanisms that influence human perception.2 Background and Dataset\nVisual cues for editorial importance on homepages\nhave a deep history in the design principles of phys-\nical newspapers (Barnhurst and Nerone, 2001) and\nresult from deliberate editorial processes. At The\nNew York Times , for example, top editors and de-\nsigners convened daily in the renowned Page One\nmeeting (Usher, 2014) to determine the most im-\nportant articles for the print newspaper the next day.\nIn the digital era, meetings like this evolved into\nHomepage Meetings (Sullivan, 2016), influencing\nthe design and content placement on the website\u2019s\nhomepage for the upcoming day. As such, home-\npages continue to be distillations of professional\njudgement and priorities.\nOne visual cue editors use is positional place-\nment , with articles positioned towards the top and\nleft of a page considered more important (Nielsen,\n2006). This stems from observations that read-\ners naturally begin scanning from the top-left cor-\nner (Bucher and Schumacher, 2006). Secondly,\nthespace articles occupy is considered: larger ar-\nticles or headlines are perceived as more impor-\ntant (Garc\u00eda, 1987). In print media, prominence\nis conveyed through more column space; in digi-\ntal media, longer headlines, featured images, and\nextended summaries. Finally, graphics and de-\nsign also play a pivotal role in signaling the im-\nportance of news stories. Articles accompanied by\nphotographs, videos, or other multimedia elements\nare often deemed more significant (Zillmann et al.,\n2001). The use of capital letters, bold fonts, and\ncolor further enhances a story\u2019s prominence.\nWe find few large-scale computational analyses\nstudying these attributes. To enable a more precise\nstudy of editorial judgement, we construct a large\ncorpus of news homepage layouts, over which we\ncan track these indicators of relative importance.\n2.1 Compilation of News Homepages\nWe compiled a list of 3,489 news homepages, as\nof the time of this writing, which we scraped twice\ndaily on an ongoing basis over a period of three\nyears. From 2019-2024, we have collected a total\nof 363,340 total snapshots. Our dataset collection\nis actively maintained and facilitated by a large\ncontributing community of over 35 activists, de-\nvelopers and journalists. We collect homepages\nTerms like \u201cabove the fold\u201d emerged to signal story-\nimportance (i.e. the story is above the point at which the\nnewspaper folds, so it is seen on newsstands)\nfrom national news outlets (e.g., The New York\nTimes ,The Wall Street Journal ), state-level news\noutlets (e.g., San Francisco Chronicle ,Miami Her-\nald), as well as local and subject-matter-specific\nnews sources. Table 1 provides a sample of the\ndifferent categories of news homepages included\nin our dataset, and a full list can be found in the ap-\npendix. Additionally, we collect homepages from\nnews websites of over 32 countries in 17 languages\n(please see Tables 6 and 8 for a more detailed break-\ndown). This is an ongoing and expanding effort:\nwe encourage contributors to add their own news\nhomepages of interest using for our suite of tools\nto scrape. We hope to further diversify the news\nsources in the dataset that we collect.\n2.2 Data Collection Pipeline\nOur dataset collection runs in a chron job twice a\nday, and uploads data to Internet Archive. For each\nsnapshot, we store the following information:\n1.All links on the page: We store a flat-list of\nhyperlinks on every homepage and associated text.\n2.Full-page screenshots: We store JPGs of each\ncomplete homepage as we render it.\n3.Complete HTML snapshots (subset of\npages): For a subset of homepages, we save a\ncompressed version of the webpage, including all\nCSS files and images, using SingleFile.\nIn addition to our Internet Archive storage, we\nalso synchronize with Wayback Machine to store\nthese homepages, providing a secondary backup\nand ensuring long-term preservation.\n3 Dataset Processing\nIn order to robustly extract visual attributes for each\narticle on a homepage (i.e. size, position, presence\nof graphics), we need to determine bounding boxes\nfor all articles on a homepage. Examples of bound-\ning boxes are shown in Figure 1: each bounding\nbox, also referred to as article card , covers all in-\nformation directly associated with that article.\nLayout parsing is a well-researched field (Shen\net al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). However, homepages\nFor more information on how to contribute, please\nsee: https://github.com/palewire/news-homepages .\nFor all code and data associated with this project, see\nhttps://github.com/alex2awesome/homepage-newswor\nthiness-with-internet-archive .\nhttps://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile ,\nincidentally the same software that Zotero uses. In initial\nexperimentation, we observed that capturing complete,\ncompressed HTML snapshots was far more robust than\ncapturing assets\nhttps://archive.org/details/news-homepagespresent unique challenges due to their diverse struc-\ntures: text of varying size, fonts, colors and images\nare easily perceived by humans. However, because\nnone of the largest supervised datasets (Zhong et al.,\n2019) are specific to our task, we find that exist-\ning resources fail for parsing homepages. So, we\nbootstrap a supervised detection task.\n3.1 Bootstrapping a Bounding Box Detector\nFollowing other bootstrapping approaches (Amini\net al., 2022), we: (1) develop a simple deterministic\nalgorithm to generate candidate data, (2) apply a\nfiltering step to exclude low-quality data, (3) use\nour high-precision dataset to train a more robust\nclassifier. Figure 7, in the Appendix, provides an\noverview of the pipeline.\nStep 1: Find Bounding Boxes Deterministically\nWe design a deterministic algorithm, called the\nDOM-Tree algorithm, to start our bootstrapping\nprocess. At a high level, the algorithm traces each\n<a>tag in the Document Object Model (DOM) and\nextracts the largest subtree in the DOM that con-\ntains only a single <a>tag(illustrated in Figure 4,\nAppendix). This method can extract the maximal\nbounding box for each article, however it faces ro-\nbustness challenges, for example, if a link exists\nwithin an article card (e.g. a link to an authors page,\nas shown in Figure 4b, Appendix.)\nWe apply this algorithm to a subset of the New-\nsHomepages dataset, combining 15 homepages\neach from all outlets for which we have HTML\nfiles, JPEG snapshots, and hyperlink json files (ap-\nproximately 15,000 homepages). Since each out-\nlet typically maintains a consistent layout on their\nhomepages across samples, we include more out-\nlets for generalizability.\nStep 2: Filter Low-Quality Bounding Box Ex-\ntractions We take several filtering steps to pre-\nvent \u201cdrift\u201d (Amini et al., 2022). (1) First, we\nexclude non-news article links (e.g. log-in pages)\nby training simple text classifier to distinguish be-\ntween URLs to news articles and others. We manu-\nally labeled over 2,000 URLs. The model achieves\nan accuracy of 96%. (2) Then, we exclude bound-\ning boxes that did not overlap highly with link text.\nWe determine this by first rendering the HTML\npages as images and overlaying bounding boxes,\nthen running OCR to extract the bounding-box text.\n(3) Finally, we exclude bounding boxes with im-\nCategory Example Outlets\nNational The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, NPR, Bloomberg\nState-level San Francisco Chronicle, Miami Herald, Chicago Tribune\nLocal Sturgis-Journal, The Daily Jeffersonian, LAist, The Desert Sun\nSubject-specific The Weather Channel, Chessbase, ESPN\nInternational India Today, Ukrinform, BBC, Prensa Grafica, Japan Times\nTable 1: Sample of News Homepages by Category\nFP#1 FP #2 FN #1 FN #2 Total Errors % Correct\nChallenge datasetDOM-Tree algorithm 117 137 127 265 646 61.3%\nDetectron2 Model 25 23 27 87 162 90.3%\nClean datasetDOM-Tree algorithm 12 20 0 13 45 97.1%\nDetectron2 Model 15 24 0 18 57 96.3%\nTable 2: Error analysis of bounding box detection methods comparing the DOM-Tree algorithm and a Detectron2\nmodel across two datasets: the challenge dataset and the clean dataset. The challenge dataset is formed by selecting\nthe bottom 10% of articles based on the match between OCR-extracted text and retrieved link text (described in\nSection 3 Step 2), while the clean dataset contains well-matched articles. Error types are divided into false positives\n(FP #1: multiple articles in one box, FP #2: no articles in a box) and false negatives (FN #1: partially captured\narticles, FN #2: articles not captured). As can be seen, the our trained model performs at par on the DOM-Tree\nalgorithm in the clean settings and is far more robust in noisy settings.\nproperly rendered images. To address this, we\nagain rendered HTML pages as an image and em-\nployed the YOLO object detection model (Redmon\nand Farhadi, 2018) to compare these images to\nthe JPEGs in our archive. If a screenshot was not\nwithin 80% of the detection count of the archived\nsnapshot, we discarded the snapshot. Overall, this\nmulti-stage filtering process significantly reduced\nthe number of boxes that did not correspond to\nactual articles and removed many websites that\ncontained broken or corrupt data, enhancing the\nquality of the training data.\nStep 3: Train a More Robust Classifier Now\nwith our dataset in hand, we trained a Detectron2\nmodel (Wu et al., 2019). Our model uses ResNet-\n101 as a backbone with a Feature Pyramid Net-\nwork (FPN) for extracting multi-scale features and\nSmooth L1 loss for bounding box regression. Dur-\ning training, we used a base learning rate of 0.02\nwith a linear warmup over the first 1000 steps. We\ntrained the model for 10,000 steps in total, with\nlearning rate reductions after 5000 steps. A weight\ndecay of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.9 were also\nemployed. The training ran on 4 \u00d7A40 GPUs for\n24 hours.\n3.2 Evaluation and Results\nTo evaluate the quality of our bounding box detec-\ntion, we conducted manual validation for four types\nLikely due to errors in HTML extraction or dead linksof errors: 1) bounding boxes that contain multiple\narticles, 2) bounding boxes that contain no articles,\n3) bounding boxes missing parts of an article, and\n4) articles that are note captured.\nWe used the OCR text-matching method, as de-\nscribed in Section 3, to identify particularly chal-\nlenging homepages. We compared errors on the\ncleanest 10% of homepages (Clean) and the least-\nclean 10% (Challenge). As shown in Table 2, our\ncomputer vision model (Detectron2) significantly\nimproved the accuracy of bounding box detection\nin contexts where the DOM-Tree algorithm strug-\ngles (the Detectron2 model had an Card Correct %\nscore of 90.3% while the DOM-Tree had a score\nof 61.3%). For Clean pages, the Detectron2 model\nperformed similarly to the DOM-Tree algorithm,\nwith error differences being minimal and both mod-\nels achieving high accuracy (above 96%). The\ncombination of deterministic algorithms and ma-\nchine learning techniques allow us to achieve a\nmore robust extraction of article attributes from\ndiverse homepage layouts.\n4 Homepage Modeling\nGiven precise layout information for the 363k\nhomepages in our dataset, we arrive again at the\ncore question of this research: how regular and pre-\ndictable is an outlet\u2019s layout decisions?

As shown in Figures 3, 5, 6\nand described by (Ang\u00e8le, 2020), certain areas of\nmany homepages lack clear editorial consistency.\nThis introduces noise and makes it difficult to learn\na uniform policy guiding article placement deci-\nsions. Further, learning a single set of policies is\nchallenged by the changing news cycle; some days\nhave lots of news while others have less.\n4.1 Modeling Approach\nA homepage is intended to present a collection of\narticles as a cohesive bundle; individual articles do\nnot exist in isolation (Tufte, 1990). Predicting the\nplacement of a single article without considering\nthe context of other articles would be overly noisy\nand potentially ineffective (Salganik et al., 2006).\nConversely, attempting to predict the placement of\nall articles simultaneously poses a combinatorial\nchallenge that is computationally infeasible.\nTo address this issue, we formulate our modeling\ntask as a pairwise preference problem. Specifically,\nwe consider pairs of articles (a1, a2)and train mod-\nels to predict a binary preference variable p, where\npo(a1> a 2) = 1 if article a1is preferred over arti-\nclea2for outlet o, andpo(a1> a 2) = 0 otherwise.\nIn Appendix BWe explore three variations of preference criteria\nfor the preference variable, p:\n1.Size-based Preference : We define po(a1>\na2) = 1 if article a1occupies more surface\narea on the homepage than article a2, assum-\ning that prominent articles are given more\nspace (Lambert and Brock, 2005).\n2.Position-based Preference : We set po(a1>\na2) = 1 if article a1is placed in a more favor-\nable location on the homepage than article a2,\nsuch as higher up or more to the left, based\non common reading patterns (Nielsen and Per-\nnice, 2009).\n3.Combined Size and Position Preference :\nHere, po(a1> a 2) = 1 if article a1either\noccupies more surface area or is in a more\nfavorable position than article a2, particularly\nfocusing on articles that are in the top 10\nTo model these preference variables, p, we\ntrain a simple Transformer-based binary classifier,\ndistilbert-base(X) , which classifies a text se-\nquence X. Our model concatenates the input ar-\nticles: X=a 1<sep>a 2as input; the model learns to\nrecognize the <sep> token as a boundary between\nthe first and the second articles.\n4.2 Modeling Variations\nWe explored different modeling variations on the\nNew York Times homepages, as they have a vari-\nety of content, shares and functionalities on their\nsite (Spangher, 2015). We test 5 different models:\n{distilbert-base-uncased, flan-t5-base, flan-t5-large,\nroberta-base, roberta-large} and constructed a train-\ning dataset of 74,857 article-pairs and a test dataset\nconsisting of 18,715 datapoints consisting of pairs\nof NYTimes articles from same homepages.\nWe experienced exploding gradients in the flan-\nt5-large and RoBERTa-large models, motivating\nus to use a learning rate limit of 5e-5 for all\nthe models, for the sake of equal comparison.\nWe applied Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning (Man-\ngrulkar et al., 2022) on flan-t5-base, flan-t5-large,\nroberta-base, roberta-large models to minimize\noverfitting, as we had limited of datapoints.\nThe distilbert-base-uncased model outperforms\nother models (Table 3). We trained on 4xA40 GPUs\nand 16xA100 GPUs, and implemented gradient\nclipping after observing gradient explosion.\n4.3 Dataset Selection and Processing\nFrom our list of 3,000 outlets, we select 31 out-\nlets for detailed analysis. We selected well-known\noutlets in various categories, including different\npolitical leanings (left-leaning vs. right-leaning),\nlocal and national levels, and varied subject mat-\nters such as science, chess and aviation. For each\noutlet, we collected between 200 and 300 home-\npage snapshots, resulting in 1,000 to 50,000 pairs\nof articles. We created an 80/20 train/test split and\ntrained distilbert-base-uncased models for each out-\nlet. We trained each model with 5e-5 learning rate\nlimit, 3 epochs, 0.01 weight decay.\nEach article in our dataset includes its textual\nrepresentation as it appeared on the homepage. To\nenhance the reliability of our models, we undertake\nseveral data processing steps informed by prelimi-\nnary experiments: (1) we only sample pairs of ar-\nticles that are adjacent on the homepage, to curate\npreference pairs that are more likely to be challeng-\ning and topically similar. Secondly, we clean the\ntextual representations by stripping out any times,\ndates, and formatting elements. We also remove\nauthor names to prevent the models from learning\nbiases based on authors who might be favored by\nthe organization. Please refer to Appendix A for\na detailed list of the outlets used and the specific\nnumber of data points associated with each.\n4.4 Results\nWe show our results in Table 4. While some models\n(e.g. Breitbart ) perform noticeably poorly, we\nnote that the majority of our models score above\nf1> .6. We do not find a significant correlation\nbetween model performance and training set size.\nWe were surprised to observe the tractability of this\ntask; this indicates that many of the concerns we\nhad about noise were either handled by our prepro-\ncessing steps, or not as important as we believed.\nAs classified by MediaBiasFactCheck.com5 Demonstrations\nTo evaluate the practical utility of our models, we\ndesign two downstream tasks: (1) analyzing news-\nworthiness agreement between publishers, and (2)\nusing newsworthiness models to rank corpora of\ninterest to journalists.\n5.1 Task 1: Newsworthiness Agreement\nBetween Publishers\nIn this task, we aim to rank-order lists of news items\ndrawn from a larger pool of articles to calculate\nthe agreement rates for newsworthiness decisions\nbetween different news outlets. Previous research\nhas observed surprising overlaps in sentiment and\npreferences between right-leaning and left-leaning\noutlets (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010), and we wish\nto quantitatively test this phenomenon using our\npreference models.\nWe selected 9 of the 31 outlets for which we\ntrained preference models in the previous section.\nFrom each outlet, we sampled 1,000 articles, match-\ning on variables such as topic, length, publication\ndate, and other potential confounders. These 9 out-\nlets were chosen because they represent a range of\npolitical viewpoints.\nFor each model noi(corresponding to outlet\noi), we used it to sort lists of 1,000 articles\n{a1, a2, . . . , a 1000}9\nj=1from outlets {o}9\nj=1. In\nother words, the output of applying model noito\nthe article list from outlet ojis a fully sorted list\nnoi(Aj). We used the size \u00d7position model for\nthis experiment, as performance was similar to the\nsize-only model, and we believed that the multi-\nvariable models capture more newsworthiness in-\nformation than the single-variable models.\nWe calculated Kendall\u2019s \u03c4, a correlation measure\nfor ordinal data, between each pair of sorted lists\n(noi(Ak), noj(Ak))for all i, j, k , and averaged the\ncorrelations across j. The resulting correlation ma-\ntrix is displayed in Figure 2a. Some surprising\ninsights emerge from this analysis. Notably, Bre-\nitbart , a right-leaning outlet, and Mother Jones , a\nleft-leaning outlet, have one of the highest rates of\nagreement.\nTo establish a baseline and ensure we are not\nmerely capturing topic overlap (despite matching\non topics), we conducted a simple SBERT embed-\nding experiment (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019).\nWe sampled a set of 100 articles per outlet, gener-\nated embeddings using SBERT, and averaged these\nembeddings to create single outlet-level embed-\n(a) Kendall\u2019s \u03c4correlation between the newsworthiness pref-\nerences expressed by preference models trained on different\nnews outlets.\n(b) Cosine distance of average SBERT similarity between\narticles sampled from each outlet.\nFigure 2: Comparison of Kendall\u2019s \u03c4rank correlation\n(on newsworthiness judgements) and SBERT cosine\nsimilarity (on articles) across news outlets.\ndings, as shown in Figure 2b. These embedding-\nlevel similarities align more closely with topical\noverlaps, indicating distinct right-wing and left-\nwing clusters with some overlap in between.\nTaken together, these results suggest that news-\nworthiness preference is a compelling and orthogo-\nnal variable for study beyond topical similarity.\n5.2 Task 2: Surfacing Potentially Newsworthy\nLeads\nIn this task, we explore how well these newsworthi-\nness judgments transfer outside of the news domain.\nIn this task, we build on the work of Spangher\net al. (2023a). The authors introduced the task of\nnewsworthiness prediction as a detection and alert-\ning system for journalists: utilizing a list of San\nFrancisco Board of Supervisors\u2019 policies (a typical\nsource of stories for journalists), they attempted\nto detect which policies were more newsworthy in\norder to alert journalists.\nHere, we suspect that editorial cues from dif-ferent homepages will help us surface especially\nnewsworthy content based on the preferences of\neach outlet. We applied the models from each out-\nlet to sort the list of Board of Supervisors\u2019 policies.\nThen, we selected the top 10 items from the ordered\nlistsnoiand used a large language model (LLM)\nto summarize the key points raised in each policy.\nThe LLM\u2019s summarization results and examples\nare shown in Table 5. Themes emerge, with subject-\nspecific outlets like The Weather Channel highlight-\ning policies related to environmental issues. We\npresented these results to a group of journalists,\nand 81% of respondents indicated they were im-\npressed and would consider using such a system\nin their workflow. These findings demonstrate the\npotential of our models to assist journalists in iden-\ntifying newsworthy leads from large corpora of\ndocuments, thereby supporting investigative jour-\nnalism and timely reporting.\n6 Discussion\nOur demonstrations show two core findings: first,\neditorial priorities and decision-making can be in-\nferred simply by examining the layout decisions\nmade on homepages. This decision-making is dis-\ntinct from simple topic preferences, as we show. In\nfact, commonalities about decision-making can be\nobserved between outlets that appear distinct top-\nically. Second, newsworthiness judgements have\npotential to be used in tools for reporting.\nStepping back, these results indicate that home-\npage editorial cues provide an interesting, novel\nangle for news analysis, as well as a tantalizing\ndirection in newsworthiness detection (Spangher\net al., 2023a; Diakopoulos et al., 2010). Both of\nthese applications are premised by the assumption\nthat editorial cues learned from one outlet\u2019s home-\npage can be transferred to other domains, be it\nanother outlet\u2019s articles, or non-news content. This\nis an important assumption: the intuitive findings\nthat we have made in our demonstrations provide\nsome degree of proof that this transfer is robust.\nWe experimented with different ways of mak-\ning this transfer even more robust. We at-\ntempted to train additional models to serve as in-\ndomain and out-of-domain classifiers, and then\nmultiplied the probabilities: \u02c6Po(a1> a 2) =\npo(in_domain |a1, a2)\u00d7po(a1> a 2), where for\noutlet o,po(in_domain |a1, a2) = 1 ifa1belongs\ntoowhile a2does not.

Ultimately, without any \u201cgold\ntruth\u201d about how an editor from outlet owould\nrank an arbitrary list of strings, we will not have a\nconclusive measurement about our ability to repli-\ncate these measurements. In order to fully validate\nour observations, this appears necessary. Our re-\nsults have to be taken with some important further\ncaveats. While some newsworthiness models were\nimpressively well-performing, many were not. Fur-\nther exploration is needed to determine the causes.\nAdditionally, despite the presence of non-English\nhomepages in our dataset, we only tested with U.S.-\nbased websites. We look forward to continuing to\nexpand this work to address these concerns.\nWith these caveats in mind, we hesitate to draw\nfirm conclusions. However, we feel the results of\nour modeling are encouraging enough to continue\nto address these concerns and run further manual\nexperiments with editors. We imagine a future\nwhere editorial preferences made by professional\neditors can be used to routinely study importance\nand organization of content. We imagine insights\nbeing applied more broadly to build tools for jour-\nnalists, improve webpage layouts that are currently\nautomated, and even understand more fundamental\ncomponents of the human psyche.\n7 Related Work\nUnderstanding how information is prioritized and\npresented in news media has long been a subject of\nscholarly interest. This section situates our work\nwithin the broader literature on information priori-\ntization, visual cues in editorial decision-making,layout parsing, modeling editorial judgments, and\ndata-driven studies of news content and bias.\nInformation Prioritization and Newsworthiness\nThe concept of newsworthiness is central to jour-\nnalism studies and media sociology. Classic works\nby Galtung and Ruge (1965) introduced a set of\nnews values that determine the selection and pre-\nsentation of news stories. These news values have\nbeen revisited and updated by scholars such as Har-\ncup and O\u2019Neill (2001) and Harcup and O\u2019Neill\n(2017), who identified factors like relevance, time-\nliness, and unexpectedness as key determinants\nof newsworthiness. Prior research has explored\nthe cognitive and organizational processes behind\nnews selection. Shoemaker (1991) examined the\ngatekeeping role of editors and journalists in filter-\ning news content. Herman and Chomsky (2021)\ndiscussed how media organizations\u2019 structures in-\nfluence news production and prioritization.\nOur work contributes to this literature by provid-\ning a computational approach to inferring newswor-\nthiness judgments from homepage layouts, offering\na large-scale empirical perspective on editorial pri-\noritization decisions.\nVisual Cues and Editorial Decision-Making\nVisual presentation plays a crucial role in shaping\nreaders\u2019 perceptions of news importance. Studies\nhave shown that elements such as headline size,\narticle position, and the use of images significantly\naffect reader attention and recall (Brooks and Pin-\nson, 2022; Nass and Mason, 1990).\nEye-tracking research has provided insights into\nhow users interact with news websites. Nielsen\nand Pernice (2009) found that users\u2019 viewing pat-\nterns are influenced by the layout and design of\nwebpages, with a tendency to focus on content\npositioned at the top and left areas of the screen.\nSimilarly, Bucher and Schumacher (2006) demon-\nstrated that visual cues guide readers\u2019 attention and\nare integral to the perceived relevance of news sto-\nries. Our study builds on these findings by quantita-\ntively modeling how spatial attributes of articles on\nhomepages reflect editorial judgments about their\nsignificance.\nModeling Editorial Decisions Computational\nmodeling of editorial decisions and news selec-\ntion processes has been explored in prior research.\nArya and Dwivedi (2016) proposed methods to\nlearn news selection patterns from data, aiming to\npredict which news stories editors might choose to\npublish. Additionally, Diakopoulos et al. (2010)\ninvestigated computational tools to assist journal-\nists in identifying newsworthy data points within\nlarge datasets, emphasizing the role of algorithms\nin supporting editorial judgment.\nOur approach differs by focusing on inferring ed-\nitorial prioritization from the spatial arrangement\nof articles on homepages, rather than predicting\ncontent selection from textual features alone. By\nmodeling pairwise preferences based on layout at-\ntributes, we provide a novel perspective on editorial\ndecision-making.\nData-Driven Studies of News Content and Bias\nLarge-scale analyses of news content have pro-\nvided insights into media bias, framing, and agenda-\nsetting. Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) examined\nthe factors influencing media slant in U.S. daily\nnewspapers, using textual analysis to measure ide-\nological positioning. Multiple research projects\nhave aggregating and analyzing vast amounts of\nnews content, enabling researchers to explore pat-\nterns in news coverage and discourse (Roberts et al.,\n2021; Misra, 2022; Silcock et al., 2024; Leetaru\nand Schrodt, 2013; Spangher et al., 2022b).\nOur dataset, NewsHomepages, contributes to\nthis line of research by offering a rich source of data\non how news organizations present and prioritize\ninformation on their homepages, complementing\ntextual analyses with spatial and visual dimensions.\nApplications in Journalism and News Recom-\nmendation The intersection of computational\nmodels and journalism has led to the development\nof tools for news recommendation and contentpersonalization. TalebiFard and Leung (2014) ex-\nplored context-aware news recommendation sys-\ntems that adapt to users\u2019 interests and reading be-\nhaviors. Moreover, computational approaches have\nbeen proposed to assist journalists in investigative\nwork. Spangher et al. (2023a,b, 2022a) developed\nmethods to detect newsworthy events in local gov-\nernment proceedings, identify sources, and struc-\nture news articles.\nOur work extends these applications by demon-\nstrating that models trained on editorial cues from\nnews homepages can be applied to rank a variety\nof corpora, possibly aiding in the design of future\nrecommendation systems.\nVisual Salience and Information Design The\nprinciples of information design and visual salience\nare relevant to our study. Tufte (1990) emphasized\nthe impact of visual arrangement in effectively con-\nveying information. In the context of web design,\nJiang et al. (2016) discussed how layout aesthetics\naffect user engagement and perception.\nOur findings align with these principles, high-\nlighting how the spatial arrangement of content on\nnews homepages serves as an implicit signal of\nimportance, guiding reader attention and shaping\ninformation consumption.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this work, we introduced NewsHomepages, a\ncomprehensive dataset capturing editorial prioriti-\nzation decisions through the lens of homepage lay-\nouts across thousands of news organizations. By\napplying weakly-supervised models, we demon-\nstrated the ability to robustly infer editorial judg-\nments through pairwise comparisons of article po-\nsitioning.\n9 Contributions\nCo-first author contributions : Ben Welsh\nfounded the News-Homepages Internet Archive\nProject , built and maintained the pipelines to\nperform data collection over a period of 8 years.\nAlexander Spangher was the primary writer, he\nwas the advisor for Arda and Michael, and he per-\nformed the analysis in Section 5. Arda Kaz did\nthe modeling in Section 4. Secondary author\ncontributions: Michael Vu did most of Section\n3. Naitian performed initial exploration in Section\n5 and editing.\n10 Limitations\nThis work, while advancing the study of editorial\nprioritization on homepages, comes with several\nlimitations. First, the dataset, although large and di-\nverse, predominantly focuses on English-language\nnews outlets from the U.S., which may limit the\ngeneralizability of our models to international or\nnon-English outlets. Despite the inclusion of some\nnon-U.S. and non-English homepages, the mod-\nels have not been explicitly evaluated on a broader\nrange of languages or cultural contexts. This fo-\ncus may overlook regional editorial conventions\nand biases that differ significantly from the U.S.\ncontext.\nAnother limitation is that the study focuses pri-\nmarily on visual cues of newsworthiness, such as\nsize, position, and graphical elements. While these\ncues are significant, they are not the only factors\nthat influence editorial decisions. The models do\nnot account for less visible but equally critical con-\nsiderations, such as journalistic ethics, editorial\nmandates, or audience engagement metrics, which\nmay influence homepage layouts but remain un-\nquantified in this dataset.\nAdditionally, the weakly-supervised learning\nmethods employed for layout parsing may struggle\nwith more complex or irregular homepage designs.\nAs described, the model had trouble generalizing\nto homepages with obscure HTML structures, lead-\ning to imperfect bounding box detections in some\ncases. This could result in misinterpretations of\neditorial significance, especially for websites with\nnon-traditional or highly dynamic layouts.\nLastly, the results may have some bias due to\nthe reliance on pairwise article comparisons. This\nmethod, while efficient, reduces the complexity\nof editorial decision-making into binary relation-\nships, potentially overlooking more nuanced or\nmultifaceted prioritization strategies that editors\nuse in practice.\n10.1 Computational Budget\nThe computational resources required for this\nproject were substantial. The model training\ninvolved 4 \u00d7A40 GPUs for initial phases and\n16\u00d7A100 GPUs for more extensive model fine-\ntuning and deployment. Training the custom Detec-\ntron2 model alone took 24 hours, with additional\ntime required for fine-tuning and model testing\nacross multiple outlets. While the experiments\ncould be completed within this budget, more exten-sive experiments across all 3,000 outlets would re-\nquire significantly more resources, especially when\nscaling to different languages and regional varia-\ntions.\n10.2 Use of Annotators\nThe dataset used in this work was primarily com-\npiled automatically through web scraping, with\nminimal manual annotation. However, annota-\ntors were employed to manually label URLs to\ndistinguish between news articles and non-news\narticles during the preprocessing phase. A set of\n2,000 URLs was manually labeled, contributing to\na more refined and accurate dataset. The authors\nperformed this task themselves. However, beyond\nthis, no human annotators were used to manually\nassess newsworthiness, as the models relied on po-\nsition and size as proxies for editorial decisions.\nReferences\nMassih-Reza Amini, Vasilii Feofanov, Loic Pauletto,\nLies Hadjadj, Emilie Devijver, and Yury Maximov.\n2022.

By \nthat summer, the policy and resultant family separations had generated a media storm \nthat swept up the public. In early June, the government announced its consideration of \nDNA testing to aid in the detection of human trafficking in immigration contexts. Later \nthat month, as the government retracted the child separation policy, the public began \nquestioning how children and adults would be reunited and discussing the potential \nusefulness of DNA testing for those reunifications. Then in early July, the government \nannounced that DNA testing was indeed being used, and by mid-month the public\u2019s \noutrage over the use of DNA was strong. We set out to examine the public dialogue on \nDNA testing\u2014including misunderstandings and miscommunications\u2014both in newspaper \ncoverage and on Twitter in the 2-month summer period of 2018, at the height of public \ndiscussion of migrant family separations and then reunifications. We performed database \nsearches identifying 263 newspaper articles and used Twitter\u2019s advanced search function \nidentifying 153 Tweets containing discussion of the use of DNA for migrant family \nreunification. Upon the resulting sources, we performed content analysis, analyzing for \nslant on the immigration policy and the use of DNA tests using a combination of open \nand closed codes. Our analysis showed that perspectives on the use of DNA diverged \nin connection with perspectives on the immigration policy, and that there was a contrast \namong the cohorts in the stated utility of DNA testing. These findings offer insight into \na) how DNA testing in a highly politicized immigration context was represented in media \ncoverage and b) the public\u2019s understanding of the role that DNA testing could or should \nplay in immigration. By detailing the role that comments from experts, stakeholders, and \nthe public played in these discussions, we hope to provide lessons for communications \nwith the public about future non-medical applications of genetic technologies.\nKeywords: public understanding of science, science communication, social media, kinship analysis, DNA testing, \nforensic DNA, immigration, border policy\nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232ORigiNAl ReSeARCh\ndoi: 10.3389/fgene.2019.01232published: 13 December 2019\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n2iNTRODUCTiON\nThe first DNA test using PCR of short tandem repeats (STRs) was \nfor a case published by Alec Jeffreys in 1984 to prove parentage \nbetween a Ghanaian child and his parents for immigration \npurposes ( Jeffreys et al., 1985 ). Since the 1980s, most Western \ncountries have expanded the use of DNA testing in immigration \ncontexts ( Weiss, 2011 ). Over 30 years later, in the summer of \n2018, the DNA testing of families at the United States-Mexico \nborder became one of the focal points of an international public \ndebate over the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that criminalizes crossing \nthe border and resulted in the separation of children from adult \nfamily members. Journalists and reporters from a wide range of \nmedia covered the story, contacting scientists and experts for \ninput\u2014including two of us authors ( Molteni, 2018 ; Ray, 2018 ). \nThe apparent misconceptions in the media prompted us to pen \nan opinion editorial just prior to the declared retraction of the \nfamily separation policy ( Katsanis and Wagner, 2018 ). Interested \nin the role of DNA testing as perceived in the public sphere, we \nwere motivated to perform an autopsy of the cascade of events in \nJune and July 2018 ( Farahany et al., 2019 ). Because use of DNA \ntesting in immigration is not new, we wanted to understand \nhow the public was talking about the use of genetic information \nduring this timeframe and examine the accuracy of the public \ndialogue in the news and social media.\nFor years the United States immigration system has \npermitted the voluntary use of DNA tests as evidence for family \nrelationships that might lack substantial paper or electronic \ndocumentation ( USCIS, 2000 ). In 2008 the federal government \nexpanded the collection of DNA for the federal criminal database \n(CODIS, Combined DNA Index System, FBI, Quantico, V A) to \ninclude persons detained upon entry to the United States ( 73 \nFederal Register 74932, 2008 ). Refugees and asylum seekers \npetitioning under the Priority-3 (P-3) segment of the U.S. \nRefugee Admissions Program have been required for more than \n5 years ( 75 Federal Register 54690, 2010 ) to provide a DNA \ntest to verify claimed familial relationships, when the DS-7656 \nAffidavit of Relationship was modified before the P-3 program \nwas relaunched following a 4-year hiatus ( 78 Federal Register \n70313, 2013 ). This model was applied to the now-defunct \n(82 Federal Register 38926, 2017 ) Central American Minors \nRefugee/Parole (CAM) program ( 79 Federal Register 68343, \n2014 ), requiring DNA testing to verify parentage of children \nin El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras seeking to join their \nparents in the United States ( Bureau of Population, Refugees and \nMigration, 2014 ; U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, 2017 ).\nThe zero-tolerance policy announced by the U.S. government \non April 6, 2018 put in place procedures to detain and prosecute \nall migrants that crossed the southwest United States border \nillegally ( U.S. Department of Justice, 2018 ). Justifications for the \npolicy included the purported need \u201cto restore legality to the \nsystem, \u201d ( Sessions, 2018a ) to treat everyone who crosses without \nauthorization at an official port of entry the same\u2014without \nexception ( Blitzer, 2018 ), and ultimately to deter future illegal \nborder crossers ( Hirschfield Davis and Shear, 2018 ; Sessions, \n2018a ; Congressional Research Service, 2019 ). Alongside the policy was a motion to separate children from the adults who \nbrought them over the border, including parents and other \nrelatives. There is no evidence that this policy requiring separation \nof children from their accompanying adults was applied to the \nnorthern border with Canada or to other ports of entry (such \nas airports) ( Sessions, 2018b ). The separation of children from \naccompanying adults continued as a part of the order until June \n20, 2018, when President Donald J. Trump signed an executive \norder declaring an end to the practice ( Trump, 2018 ).\nShortly following the executive order, companies publicly \noffered DNA testing services, equipment, and reagents to help \nwith family reunification ( Brandom and Becker, 2018 ). For \nexample, 23andMe and MyHeritage both offered use of their \npersonal genome services ( Staff, 2018a ; Brandom and Becker, \n2018 ; Peters, 2018 ). Thermo Fisher Scientific offered access \nto their equipment and/or reagents ( Staff, 2018b ). To our \nknowledge and by all public accounts, neither the government \nnor non-governmental organizations (NGOs) accepted these \noffers. Nevertheless, on July 5, 2018, U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar announced \nin a conference call with the press that the Office of Refugee \nResettlement (a branch of HHS) would be using DNA tests to \nreunify families who had been separated at the border ( Brown, \n2018 ; Flores, 2018 ).\nThe family separation crisis that began in 2018 is ongoing, \nwith many children still separated from their families ( Lind, \n2019 ), new families reportedly being separated ( Hoffman, 2019 ; \nJordan and Dickerson, 2019 ), several claims of abuse of children \nwhilst in custody ( Gonzales, 2019 ; Haag, 2019 ), and even reports \nof separated children being placed for adoptions ( Raff, 2018 ). The \nTrump administration appears to be holding fast to its desire to \ndetain and deport unaccompanied children more easily ( Lanard, \n2017 ) by seeking additional authority from Congress to lengthen \nallowable detention periods, make it easier to deport migrant \nunaccompanied children from countries not sharing a border \nwith the United States, and require asylum seekers to apply for \nprotection from within their home country ( Feuerherd, 2019 ; \nMadan, 2019 ). The consequences of the zero-tolerance policy \nthat separated families will reverberate in the coming years, and \nit is important for geneticists to reflect upon the role of DNA \ntesting in contributing to and/or alleviating the crisis.\nNews media and social media were key public fora in which \nthese events were described and debated, shaping the public\u2019s \nunderstanding of not only the zero-tolerance policy specifically \nbut also the role of DNA testing in immigration generally. The \nnews media is influential in determining which issues receive \npublic attention and conveys opinions that members of the \npublic might adopt on an issue ( McCombs and Shaw, 1972 ). \nMost adults use news media as their main source of information; \nthis is especially true for information in the scientific realm, \nwhere Americans tend to rely on news coverage of important \nscientific issues and discoveries ( National Science Board, 2016 ). \nHowever, a great proportion of Americans lack scientific literacy \n(Maienschein, 1999 ), making it a challenge for many to synthesize \nscientific information and leading to a disconnect between the \nscientific community and the general public ( Weigold, 2001 ). \nAn analysis of media coverage can provide scientists and \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n3administrators insight into how science is understood by the \njournalists and reporters who cover their areas of interest and \nthen communicated to the broader public ( Geary et al., 2016 ).\nSocial media also has come to play an important and \nincreasingly acknowledged role in news consumption and public \npolicy discussion; two-thirds of American adults report that they \nfollow news on social media at least occasionally ( Matsa and \nShearer, 2018 ). Twitter, Inc. (San Francisco, CA), as one of the \nlargest social networks, provides about 12% of Americans with \nnews, and 71% of its users read news on the platform ( Matsa and \nShearer, 2018 ). While news inaccuracy on social media platforms \nis a common concern ( Mitchell and Barthel, 2017 ), most users \nstill see advantages to consuming news through this medium \n(Matsa and Shearer, 2018 ). Not only do journalists, news outlets, \norganizations, and private users share and discuss news items \non Twitter, it is also the most popular social media platform \namong both United Nation member states ( L\u00fcfkens, 2018 ) and \ngovernment agencies within the United States. President Donald \nJ. Trump in particular has harnessed the platform to broadcast \nnew policies as well as his stances on government matters, \nwhich in turn has given credence to Twitter as an appropriate \ncommunication tool for public policy dialogue. Twitter\u2014with its \nimmediacy, interactivity, and diverse plurality of voices\u2014is a rich \ncomplement to news articles and provides further insight into \nthe generation of, consumption of, and reception of science and \nscience policy-related news.\nFollowing the summer 2018 international conversations on \nthe use of DNA in this discrete non-medical context, we were \ninterested in observing how the public discussion played out, \nspecifically with regard to the use of DNA testing for family \nreunification in the U.S. immigration system. We sought to \ncapture the news media and a sampling of Twitter conversations between June 1 and July 31 of 2018 and to evaluate biases in the \ndialogue, the scope of the conversations around the DNA testing \nprocesses, and the accuracy of the information being conveyed. \nOur initial aim was to capture a snapshot of 1) what the scientific \ncommunity was communicating to the news media about DNA \ntesting and 2) how the public was responding to this information \nthrough social media.\nMATeRiAlS AND MeThODS\nNews Articles and Tweets as \nComplementary Source Material\nAnalysis of data gathered from the social media platform Twitter \nwas conducted parallel to analysis of newspaper articles. While \nthe same methodology was applied to both research venues, \ndifferences in accessibility and format of materials required \ndifferent approaches to data collection and analysis. The \ncontrasts and connections between our chosen venues allowed us \nto capture a broad snapshot of public dialogue around the zero-\ntolerance policy and DNA testing in summer 2018. We opted \nto examine news articles, as long-form pieces with journalistic \nauthority, to capture static dialogue from a traditional venue. \nTwitter, on the other hand, is a newer form of media. With its \nself-published, short-form missives (Tweets are limited to 280 \ncharacters), Twitter is both a popular social media platform \nand an increasingly acknowledged forum for public policy \ndialogue. Tweets thus provide a rich contrast to our captured \nnews items (see Figure 1 ). The potential connections between \nthe two venues\u2014as journalists and news outlets use Twitter \nand as Twitter users read and share news articles\u2014linked the \noverlapping analyses.\nFigURe 1 |  Anatomy of a Tweet.

The blue verified badge is applied by Twitter to indicate that accounts of public \nfigures and organizations are authentic. The direct message function allows Twitter users to send each other private messages. The re-Tweet function allows users \nto re-post their own or another user\u2019s Tweets, sometimes with additional commentary, while a reply is a direct response to a Tweet. In addition to being a reply or \na re-Tweet, a Tweet might also be part of a thread, as indicated here by \u201cShow this thread.\u201d A thread is created when a user connects a series of their Tweets. \nHashtags\u2014a word or phrase marked by the # symbol\u2014are often key words or topics in a Tweet that can be used to locate Tweets from different users covering the \nsame topic.

In efforts to \nexpand the search results, a trio of systematic searches were \nperformed by JW on August 10, 2018 using ProQuest, Westlaw \nNext (Thomson Reuters; querying \u201call U.S. newspapers\u201d), and \nNexis Uni (Lexis Nexis; querying the \u201cU.S. news\u201d option materials \nin English language) and relying upon the same search string \nand temporal restrictions as the earlier search of ProQuest. The \nnewspaper items identified systematically were combined with an \nad hoc  set of items known to JW and SK at that time.\nPreliminary Content Analysis\nRelevant and unique news items were screened by three \ninvestigators (SK, DM, and JW) for scope of content to \nexamine to what extent DNA testing was covered as a topic. \nArticles that simply mentioned that DNA testing was being \nused were screened out from further analysis, and a codebook \nwas developed to aid in the screening of the news content (see \nSupplemental File  \u201cCodebook for News \u201d,  Data Sheet 1 ). The \ncoders read for key words to indicate some coverage not just that \nDNA testing was being considered or used but whether DNA \ntesting should be considered or used (for example, one article \nstated, \u201c Azar said Thursday morning that an army of government \nworkers had been dispatched to review files and conduct DNA \ntesting to match parents with their children\u201d ( Sacchetti, 2018a ). \nThis text was insufficient to evaluate whether DNA testing would \nbe useful, ethical, or legal, so this article was excluded. The same \nauthor in another article stated, \u201cSabraw had earlier ordered \nthe government to forgo DNA testing of all adults and to skip \nbackground and fingerprint checks of all residents in the homes \nwhere the children will live, unless there was a safety concern\u201d \n(Sacchetti, 2018b ). This text was sufficient to be included.). \nArticles that had some context for DNA testing were further \ncoded by two investigators (JW and SK) for slant of the article \n(pro- or anti-) with regard to immigration, zero-tolerance policy, \nand DNA testing. Key words were documented to substantiate \nthe identified slant. These articles were further coded for what \ncategory of experts were consulted on the DNA testing aspect \nof the article and what DNA testing-related topics were covered. \nFinally, the articles were coded for whether they addressed any \ntopics regarding the science of DNA testing, the legal authority \nfor DNA testing, or the ethical considerations for DNA testing. \nThese articles comprised the set of news items for in-depth \ncontent analysis.\nIn-Depth Content Analysis\nWe developed a set of codes that would be used for content \nanalysis based on observing important topics of interest (see \nSupplemental File  \u201cCodebook for News  and Twitter Content \u201d,  Data Sheet 3 ). These topics were broadly categorized into ethical issues, \nscientific processes, legality, and other considerations. Codes were \ndevised in most cases on a yes-no basis as to presence of the topical \ncontent in the article. Other codes were more specific, such as \nthe topic on method of DNA collection for which the specified \ntypes of collection mentioned in each article were recorded. Two \ncoders (SK and VO) independently coded each article utilizing \nthe codebook and resolved any discrepancies found between their \nanalyses. Some codes underwent minor adjustments in order to \nprovide clarity as comparisons were made between the two code \nsets during this reconciliation process. Content analyses were \ninserted into Microsoft Excel and tabulated based on the devised \ncodes. A set of research questions and hypotheses were formulated \nbased on the data to extrapolate news content trends.\nUse of Bias Assessors\nGiven the potential bias of news sources ( Iyengar and Massey, \n2018 ; Pennycook and Rand, 2019 ), we sought to include third-\nparty evaluation of the news sources to gauge bias. Because there \nis no standard news source bias checking resource ( Pingree \net al., 2018 ; Pennycook and Rand, 2019 ), we reviewed the \nmethodologies and funding sources of several bias-checking \nresources and selected three of the most prevalent, on-going \nresources aimed at offering a comprehensive overview of media \nbias in North America. The metrics of each resource to evaluate \nthe news sources were incorporated where possible into our data \nanalysis (see Supplemental File  \u201cMedia Bias Assessors\u201d , Data \nSheet 4 ). The sites selected were 1) AllSides ( www.allsides.com ); \n2) Media Bias/Fact Check ( mediabiasfactcheck.com ); and 3) Ad \nFontes Media, Inc. ( www.adfontesmedia.com ). We compared \nbias ratings across all three sources where possible.\nTwitter Analysis\nData Access and Collection\nBoth prospective and retrospective searches of Twitter present \nchallenges, but barriers to access are higher for historical data \n(i.e., Tweets already published), which was what our study \nnecessitated. A comprehensive dataset drawn from a search run \nagainst the full archive of Tweets for a timeframe of interest would \nbe accessible only through a third-party Twitter service provider \nor through paid-access to the Twitter application programming \ninterface (API); both of these services are cost-prohibitive and \ngenerally are designed for commercial market research, not social \nscience research. More importantly for our research, Twitter\u2019s \nfree standard API searches result in outputs of an unspecified \nproportion of all Tweets published in the prior seven days. This \napproach was not useful for our purposes since we wanted to \ncapture the discussion during a particular 2-month time period.\nWe opted to gather our data using Twitter\u2019s \u201c Advanced Search\u201d \nuser interface, which is freely accessible to anyone with a Twitter \naccount. The Advanced Search user interface pulls Tweets for \nany time period or range of time; however, the search algorithm \nis proprietary so the details on how the search captures data is \nunclear. Like the standard search API, the user interface searches \nfor relevance of the results to the search terms, not completeness \n(meaning some Tweets might be missing from search results) \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n5and Twitter does not detail how precisely results are generated \n(Twitter, 2019 ). Nevertheless, an Advanced Search that is specific \nenough will provide a snapshot of the Twitter dialogues for a \nparticular time period around a particular topic; however, it is \nnot necessarily identical to the Twitter traffic of that time period \nhad it been collected in real time. This is due, for example, to the \nfrequency of Twitter users changing their own profiles or deleting \ncontent, such that the results might be altered at a later date. For \nour purposes, we settled on carefully refining our Advanced \nSearch parameters and performing two one-time searches to \ngenerate a sampling of Tweets indicative of the Twitter dialogues \non our topic of interest.\nSearch queries were developed by running string searches \nfor relevant key words. Once the refined searches demonstrated \ntheir capacity to provide relevant content, we compiled a \nlist of frequently used hashtags from the results. The most \ncommon and topically relevant of these were selected for the \nfinal searches. Two final one-time searches of Twitter were \nconducted by SK on August 17, 2018 using the Advanced Search \nuser interface: 1) a search of \u201cDNA \u201d plus any of 17 trending \nhashtags (#keepfamiliestogether; #familiesbelongtogether; \n#reunitefamilies; #reunitethefamilies; #reunitefamiliesnow; \n#reunification; #separationoffamilies; #childrenincages; \n#familyseparation; #reuniteeverychild; #returnthechildren; \n#bordercrisis; #childrensconcentrationcamps; #childtrafficking; \n#humantrafficking; #illegalimmigration; and #buildthewallnow) \nand 2) a search of \u201cDNA \u201d plus any of five terms relevant to \nmigration (\u201cillegals, \u201d \u201cimmigrant, \u201d \u201cimmigration, \u201d \u201cmigrant, \u201d and \n\u201crefugee\u201d). Parameters were set to search Twitter posts between \nJune 1 and July 31, 2018; the language filter was set to English; \nand the quality filter (a feature that filters out what Twitter calls \n\u201clower quality content, \u201d including duplicate Tweets or seemingly \nautomated content) was turned on. Each search yielded a set of \nTweets in chronological order, which we then saved as portable \ndocument formats (PDFs). This method of capturing search \nresults successfully pulled all results simultaneously; preserved \nhyperlinks within Tweets as well as hyperlinks embedded in the \nTwitter users\u2019 profiles, hashtags, direct mentions, threads, and \nre-Tweets; and preserved hyperlinks to each Tweet embedded \nin the date. One drawback was that the PDF archive failed to \ncapture emojis and images consistently.\nThe text of each Tweet was subsequently entered manually \ninto a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Tweets were coded for a set \nof closed codes focused on set characteristics of Twitter data \n(e.g., Twitter name, Twitter handle). Two coders (SK and DM) \nscreened for duplicate Tweets and irrelevant Tweets to eliminate \nthem on the basis of the text of the Tweets alone. Tweets that did \nnot address the use of DNA testing in the context of immigration \nwere considered irrelevant. Tweets from public figures or \norganizations were not excluded.\nContent Analysis\nCodebook\nAn initial codebook consisting of a mix of closed and open codes \nwas developed on the basis of research interests in slant and use \nof DNA testing, the infrastructure of Twitter, and quantitative \nmetrics for Twitter from the methodological literature (see Supplemental File  \u201cCodebook for Twitter \u201d,  Data Sheet, 2 ) \n(Murthy, 2016 ). Throughout the coding process, the codebook \nwas adapted to accommodate shifts in data interest and to \nparse details not considered by investigators at the outset. Set \ncharacteristics of Tweets comprised our closed codes, with the \nonly alterations to these codes being the removal or addition \nof categories. For qualifying users as individuals or as \u201cbots\u201d \n(automatic robotic Twitter users rather than human interfacing \nusers), we made some efforts to screen each account to determine \nif it might be a bot. After extensive research on Twitter bots and \nhow to determine if a user was a bot, we opted to depend on \nTwitter\u2019s quality filter to weed out the majority of bots rather than \nsystematically evaluating each user. Codes for Tweet content \ncomprised our open codes, including codes for Tweet purpose \nand slant. All coding was completed by two independent coders \n(SK and DM) and then reconciled through comparison and \ndiscussion. After an initial round of coding, we turned to deeper \ncontent analysis of the Tweets by establishing total counts for the \nuse of hashtags and directed mentions; listing the terms used to \nrefer to migrants; listing the actors and organizations mentioned; \nand applying codes for concepts covered developed for news \ncoverage to Tweets for comparison.\nRulebook\nIn addition to developing a Twitter codebook, we also developed \na rulebook as a guide to the Twitter coding process. We borrowed \nthe concept of a rulebook from Brubaker et al ., who describe \nthe process of developing \u201ccodebook rules\u201d to aid them in \ndetermining whether to code MySpace comments as containing \nemotional distress ( Brubaker et al., 2012 ). The Twitter rulebook \ncontains both a guide to the coding process and rules designed \nto prevent biased coding (see Supplemental File  \u201cCodebook \nfor Twitter\u201d , Data Sheet 2 ). Several unique features of Twitter \ndata necessitated the creation of the rulebook. Firstly, a Tweet is \nnever purely textual data. The text of a Tweet is embedded in the \ninfrastructure of Twitter (see Figure 1  for a detailed explanation \nof the elements that Tweets contain). Every Tweet contains both \nnon-textual data as well as hyperlinks to contextualizing data \n(e.g., Twitter user profile, news items, other Tweets). The guide \nto the coding process not only lays out the order in which codes \nshould be addressed, it also sets the order in which the elements \nof a Tweet should be examined and how much weight should be \ngiven to each. The rules give further instruction on how to treat \nvarious Tweet elements. Furthermore, Tweets, with their short \nlength, lack of immediately available textual context, and casual \ntone ( Puschmann et al., 2013 ; Osmond, 2017 ) force researchers \nto confront ambiguities during the coding process. This is \nespecially true when researchers are coding for complex and \nslippery concepts such as political bias or views on immigration \nissues (what we call slant, more below). The rulebook is a tool to \nprevent coders from unconsciously relying on their own biases to \ndetermine codes where evidence to support a code is ambiguous \nor scarce. It also served as a place for coders to concretize a \nconsistent approach to Twitter data by documenting the coding \nstrategies that emerged through discussion. The rulebook was \nfirst developed once the codebook was drafted and codes were \ngiven initial definitions. Following Brubaker et al. \u2019s lead, we pulled \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n6Tweets with the most explicit expressions of views on politics, \nthe zero-tolerance policy, and DNA testing. Their characteristics \nwere described to generate the first draft of the rulebook, which \nwas refined and expanded through code reconciliation and \ndiscussion throughout the process.\nTweet Interpretation\nTwitter\u2019s format requires innovative approaches to content \nanalysis. Not only are Tweets short (currently limited to 280 \ncharacters), but also, they are often difficult to decipher due \nto their casual tone; misuse of punctuation; use of incomplete \nsentences, use of slang; use of acronyms and short-hand; and \nuse of Twitter conventions, including hashtags, direct mentions, \nand emojis. The lack of textual data within individual Tweets \nis contrasted with a relative wealth of non-textual data in the \nform of images, emojis, memes, photographs, and hyperlinks, \nas well as quantitative metrics (e.g., the number of re-Tweets, \nlikes, and replies for each Tweet). The infrastructure of Twitter \nalso provides context: each Tweet in our dataset was linked to a \nprofile and might itself be a re-Tweet, a reply, or part of a thread; \na response to an ongoing discussion on Twitter or in the media \nat large; or a pointed comment directed at another Twitter user.\nWe drew on non-textual and contextualizing data to develop \nan interpretation of the text of each Tweet into full sentences \nthat clarified and encapsulated the intention and message of \nthe Tweet. This process allowed the researchers to review two \nitems of text for analyses: 1) the original Tweet text for analysis \nof slant and use of certain words, hashtags, or direct mentions \nand 2) the interpreted Tweet text for analysis of intended content \nand purpose, viewed without the potentially divisive rhetoric. \nTwo independent coders (SK and DM) reviewed each Tweet for \nset characteristics in order to familiarize themselves with the \nimmediate context. If the Tweet contained images, was a reply, a \nre-Tweet, part of a thread, or hyperlinked to an article, the images \nand hyperlinked Tweets or content were examined. Finally, key \nwords as well as slang terms, abbreviations, hashtags, or direct \nmentions requiring clarification were identified and punctuation \nwas examined. The Tweet was then rendered into full sentences \nin neutral language, with each sentence beginning with verbs that \nindicated the purpose of the Tweet (e.g., comments, questions, or \nshares). The two sets of interpretations were then reconciled and \nany discrepancies discussed to ensure that both coders agreed on \nthe final interpretation of the Tweet. While effective, this method \nwas not foolproof. We were careful to note Tweets where multiple \ninterpretations were possible. The list of verbs generated by the \nfinal interpretations was refined and became the list of \u201cpurpose\u201d \ncodes for Tweets.\nAnalysis of Slant\nAs in the news article analysis of slant, each Tweet was coded \nby two coders (SK and DM) for slant including pro-/anti-zero \ntolerance policy and pro-/anti-DNA testing. Additionally, Tweets \nwere evaluated for political bias. Codes for slant and political \nbias were not conceptualized as absolute pronouncements of \nTwitter user\u2019s views, but as useful analytical categories to bin \ngroups of Tweets for analysis. Tweets and Twitter user profiles \nrepresent only a slice of time, and as our research showed us, Twitter user\u2019s expressed views as well as the content they choose \nto display on Twitter shift over time. Furthermore, users rarely \nexplicitly expressed their views on all or even any of the slant \nand bias-related categories for which we coded. The codes and \nassociated rulebook were designed to allow coders to evaluate \nthe ambiguities of Twitter in a consistent, evidence-based, and \nuseful way.\nPolitical Slant, Zero-Tolerance Policy Slant, and DNA \nTesting Slant\nFor all three categories of slant (named above), a neutral code \nindicated either an explicitly neutral stance or a lack of evidence \nto support a code. Key words as well as the source of the code \n(e.g. text of the Tweet, Twitter user profile) were documented \nto substantiate any ascribed slant. For political bias, the text \nof the original Tweet was examined for bias as Democrat, \nRepublican, anti-Democrat, anti-Republican, or neutral. We \ndefine anti-Democrat/Republican as any Tweet or Tweeter that \n\u201cexpresses disapproval for the Democratic/Republican party, its \nhead, or multiple members thereof without explicitly expressing \napproval of another party;\u201d this allowed us to assign slant to a \nlarger number of Tweets and Tweeters without imposing the \ntitle of Democrat or Republican where evidence was lacking (see \nCodebook ). In addition to the potential slant of the Tweets, the \npotential bias of the Twitter user was evaluated using these same \ncategories with the addition of the categories of conservative, \nliberal/progressive, or independent, which were terms used by \nTwitter users to explicitly express political affiliation. U.S. political \nterms were used as the events under consideration took place \nin the geographical and political context of the United States. \nDetermination of a Twitter user\u2019s bias relied upon the profile \nof the Twitter user and/or prior Tweets by that user. Additional \nTweets drawn on to support codes were listed by date under the \nsource code. During reconciliation, coders reviewed each other\u2019s \nevidence and ran additional searches to finalize decisions on \nslant and bias data.\nCombined Coding of Political Slant\nAfter coding both the Tweets and the Twitter users for political \nslant, we combined the categories for an overall political slant to \nsimplify our analysis. For political slant of the Twitter users, we \nanalyzed the categories separately (i.e., Democrat, Republican, \nanti-Democrat, anti-Republican, or neutral) and as combined \nDemocrat with anti-Republican and Republican with anti-\nDemocrat. We categorize each Tweet as \u201cneutral\u201d if both the \nTweet and the Twitter user codes were neutral. When the Tweet \nand the Twitter user were coded similarly, we coded them as \neither \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cliberal, \u201d as appropriate. For Twitter users \nthat were coded as Independent, we relied upon the code of the \nTweet to determine the combined code (see Supplemental File  \n\u201cCodebook for Twitter\u201d , Data Sheet 2 ).\nhuman Subjects Consideration\nNo human subjects review was necessary for this research. \nGreat care and thought was given into whether a human \nsubjects exemption was necessary for the online data research, \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n7as social media research is still in its early phases ( Williams \net al., 2017 ). Given that the retrospective study of published \ncomments (whether in news media or social media) does not \ninvolve any intervention, interaction, or observation of public \nbehavior as it was occurring, this research falls outside of \n\u00a7:_104(d)(2) requirements for human subjects research. The \nrevised 2018 Common Rule deems scholarly and journalistic \nactivities (including the collection and use of information that \nfocuses directly on specific individuals) not to be research ( U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 2018 ).\nStudy limitations\nMany challenges accompany research analyzing media\u2014and \nespecially bias in the news media. We focused on traditional \nnewspaper sources for the systematic searches and, when they \nrevealed little substantive content for further analysis, we included \na set of articles from non-traditional newspaper locations in an \nad hoc  manner. The resulting news articles seemed to represent \na sampling of the types of news media covering the topics of \ninterest. In addition, while we excluded our authored opinion \neditorial on the topic, we did not exclude news articles for which \nthe authors were consulted or quoted; this could introduce \nanother layer of bias in examining the content, which was why \nwe opted to have a second reader and coder (VO) that was not \nquoted in any news articles.\nAnalyzing social media presented a whole other set of \nchallenges. Selecting Twitter as opposed to other social \nmedia platforms seemed reasonable and justifiable given the \ninfluence of the platform in current politics. The challenge \nof developing an approach to Twitter data analysis was \ncompounded by the lack of consistent prior approaches for \nsocial science research. Our research encompassed evaluation \nof a niche topic in a specific timeframe, necessitating a novel \napproach to capture a finite set of Tweets using a set of \nsearch strings and criteria, and using these data as a subset \nexample of the Twitter conversations on the topic. Twitter, \nInc. faced accusations of exhibiting left-leaning bias due to the \ndisappearance of select conservative Twitter users\u2019 accounts \nfrom search suggestions in the summer of 2018 ( Selyukh, \n2016 ; Stack, 2018 ). Since none of the accusing users were in \nour dataset, and our dataset was relatively small, it is unlikely \nthis affected our data analysis.\nTwitter data analysis has specific challenges that we had to \naddress, such as the use of vernacular and casual terms, use of \nrhetoric and sarcasm, use of political code word or phrases or \nhashtags, and use of non-textual symbols, images, and emojis. \nDevelopment of a rulebook and codebook was immensely \nhelpful in evaluating these. We also developed a novel approach \nof an \u201cinterpretation\u201d of each Tweet in order to read each for \ncontent without the distraction of the rhetoric and sarcasm that \ncould affect our coding (e.g., \u201cObama apparently handed out \nMexican kids to pedophile traffickers\u201d was interpreted as \u201cObama \nadministration contributed to trafficking of children\u201d). The \ninterpretation was a successful approach to examine the purpose \nof each Tweet\u2014for example, to inform versus  to influence other \nTwitter users.ReSUl TS\nNews Analysis\nCompilation of Sources Covering DNA in Family \nReunification\nPrior to initiating our research, we were aware of 39 news articles \ndiscussing some aspect of DNA and migrant family reunification. \nWe first conducted a search of the five major dailies (ProQuest \nsearch); however, after locating scant coverage, we expanded the \nsearch to include other U.S. newspapers (Westlaw Next search) \nand other news sources (Nexis Uni search) to capture as many \nrelevant news articles as feasible. The three searches for articles \nusing the terms \u201cDNA \u201d and \u201cfamily reunification\u201d revealed a total \nof 526 news items, 263 of which were unique (not duplicate) \nand, of these, 203 of which were relevant to the use of DNA for \nmigrant family reunification (see Table S1 ). Only five of the \n39 articles known to the study team were captured in the three \nsearches, so the additional 34 articles were analyzed along with \nthose captured with the systematic searches, resulting in a total \nof 237 items for consideration. These articles were further refined \nfor eligibility criteria, eliminating 29 items that were TV news \ntranscripts, 21 press releases, 3 articles that were not accessible \nonline, and the opinion editorial authored by the study team (see \nTable S2 ). This refinement left us with 183 articles from 90 media \noutlets to read and analyze for depth of coverage.\nThe potential political slant or bias of the media outlet was \nassessed in addition to the content analysis of the 183 articles. \nThree bias assessors were used, and no bias assessor had evaluated \nthe sources of all 183 articles. As shown in Table 1 , allsides.\ncom had assessed bias on 102 articles at the time of our analysis, \nrevealing six as right-biased, 59 as left-biased, and 37 as center; \nmediabiasfactcheck.com had assessed bias on 150 articles, revealing \n30 as right-biased, 90 left-biased, and 30 as center (termed \u201cleast \nbias\u201d by the mediabiasfactcheck.com); and adfontesmedia.com had \nassessed bias on 85 articles, revealing 14 as right-biased, 35 as left-\nbiased, and 36 as center (termed \u201cneutral\u201d by adfontesmedia.com) \nand also revealing 65 as fact reporting, 18 as fair analysis, and two \nas unfair analysis. As a whole, the majority of media outlets were \nrated by at least one of the bias assessors as having a left-leaning bias \n(52.5%, 96/183) (see Table S3 ).\nThe 183 news items were read by two members of the study \nteam for depth of coverage of the use of DNA. News articles were \npublished sporadically in early June and then nearly every day \nthrough July 20 (see Figure 2A ). There were two dramatic peaks \nof coverage from July 5 to 7 and again July 10\u201312 and a minor \npeak between June 20 and 22. The majority of the 183 articles \nonly mentioned that DNA was being used in the context of \nfamily reunification. This refinement for depth of coverage left  \nus with 70 news articles to read and analyze for content and slant \n(see Table S4 ). These 70 articles covered the period from June \n21 to July 28 ranging from 294 to 1,995 words (|equ_0001.eps| = \n819, \u00b5 = 847) (see Table S5 ).\nNews Slant\nIn addition to examining the news sources for slant on DNA \ntesting, we examined the articles for their slant on immigration \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n8and also on the zero-tolerance policy. Our leading hypothesis for \nslant coding was that an article could be for strong immigration \npolicies but simultaneously against  the family separation policy \nthat was the by-product of the zero-tolerance policy. Within our dataset, however, we did not find any such instances, so we report \nhere only on the slant regarding the zero-tolerance policy.\nIn evaluating the news sources for slant on the zero-tolerance \npolicy, we found that the majority of articles were either against TABle 1 |  Media sources and bias.\nSource Number articles \nmentioning \nuse of DNA \n(N\u00a0=\u00a0183)Number articles \ncovering DNA \nwith context \n(N\u00a0= 70)Number articles \naddressing \nscience, legality, \nor ethics ( N\u00a0=\u00a027)Allsides.\ncom bias \nratingMediabiasfactcheck.\ncom bias ratingAdfontesmedia.com\nThe Washington Post 16 5 1 Left Left-center Skews left + fact reporting\nThe New York Times 10 2 \u2013 Left Left-center Neutral + fact reporting\nNPR News 8 \u2013 \u2013 Center Left-center Neutral + fact reporting\nTexas Tribune 8 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Least biased \u2013\nThe Wall Street \nJournal7 1 \u2013 Center Right-center Skews right + fact reporting\nAssociated Press 6 3 2 Center Least biased \u2013\nLos Angeles Times 6 \u2013 \u2013 Left Left-center Skews left + fact reporting\nChicago Tribune 5 1 \u2013 Center Right-center \u2013\nPolitico 5 2 \u2013 Left Least biased Neutral + fact reporting\nArkansas Democrat \nGazette4 1 \u2013 \u2013 Right-center \u2013\nHuffington Post 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Left Hyper-partisan left + fair \nanalysis\nUSA Today 4 3 2 Center Left-center Neutral + fact reporting\nWashington Times 4 2 \u2013 Right Right-center Hyper-partisan right + fair \nanalysis\nBaltimore Sun 3 2 1 \u2013 Left-center \u2013\nBoston Globe 3 1 1 Left Left-center \u2013\nCongressional \nQuarterly News3 2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nState Capitol News \nFeed3 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nVoice of America 3 1 1 \u2013 Least biased \u2013\nAlbuquerque Journal 2 1 \u2013 \u2013 Least biased \u2013\nArizona Republic 2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Right-center \u2013\nAtlantic Online 2 1 1 Left Left-center Hyper-partisan left + fair \nanalysis\nCNN 2 2 \u2013 Left Left Skews left + fair analysis\nGenomeWeb 2 2 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nHouston Chronicle 2 1 \u2013 \u2013 Left-center \u2013\nNBC News 2 1 1 Left Left-center Neutral + fact reporting\nNew York Post 2 1 \u2013 Very right Right-center Skews right + unfair analysis\nSlate 2 1 1 Very left Left Hyper-partisan left + fair \nanalysis\nLeft-leaning sources \nwith one articlea27 21 9 Center Left \nVery leftLeft Left-center Skews right + fair analysis\nSkews left + fact reporting\nHyper-partisan left + fair \nanalysis\nNeutral + fact reporting\nRight-leaning sources \nwith one articleb6 2 2 Center Right-center Neutral + fact reporting\nLeast biased sources \nwith one articlec5 4 3 \u2013 Least biased Neutral + fact reporting\nOther sources with \none articled25 6 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\naABC News, Albany Times Union, Arizona Daily Star, BBC News, BuzzFeed, CBS News, CNBC, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fast Company, Independent, Intercept, \nNewsday, NY Magazine, Politifact, San Antonio Express-News, San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury News, Seattle Times, St Paul Pioneer Press, Star Tribune, \nThe Daily Beast, The Hill, The New Republic, The Philadelphia Tribune, The Verge, Time, Wired.\nbDaily Herald, Forbes, Fortune, Fort Worth Star Telegram, The Dallas Morning News, The Desert Sun.\ncNational Geographic, Reuters, Roll Call, San Diego Union Tribune, Scientific American.\ndAZ Central, Bucks County Courier Times, Courier Post, Daily Post, Denton Record Chronicle, Federal News Feed, Indy Star, Island Packet, mySA, New Hampshire \nUnion Leader, NewsGram, NorthJersey.com, Salina Journal, Targeted News Service, The Acorn (Drew Univ), The Daily Citizen, The Gainesville Sun, The Joplin Globe, \nThe Keene Sentinel, The Record Herald, The Slot, The Stamford Advocate, US Official News, WGRZ, WorldNet Daily.\nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n9the policy (45.7%, 32/70) or neutral (47.1%, 33/70), with only five \narticles (7.1%, 5/70) containing language demonstrating support \nfor the policy (see Table S6 ). In examining the slant for or against \nthe use of DNA testing in migrant family reunification, we found \n10 articles (14.3%, 10/70) to be for the use, 21 (30.0%, 21/70) \nagainst, and the majority neutral (55.7%, 39/70) (see Table S7 ). \nFurther examination of the articles with slant on both DNA testing \nand the zero-tolerance policy shows that half of the 10 articles that \nwere for DNA testing were for the zero-tolerance policy and half \nagainst (see Table 2 ). On the other hand, all of the anti-DNA testing \narticles were either anti-zero-tolerance policy (61.9%, 13/21) or \nneutral (38.1%, 8/21). All 27 news articles that contained in-depth \ndiscussion of science or legal authority were either anti-zero-\ntolerance policy (44.4%, 12/27) or neutral and either anti-DNA \ntesting (48.1%, 13/27) or neutral. News articles that presented a \nneutral perspective on both the zero-tolerance policy and on the \nuse of DNA represented 37.1% (26/70) of the total articles. Eight of these articles were included in our list of 27 news articles with more \nin-depth coverage of science and discussion of legal authority.\nNews Content\nWhile the 70 selected articles covered DNA testing beyond \nsimply mentioning that DNA tests were being conducted, the \narticles ranged broadly in their scope of coverage. We found \nthat of these 70 articles, only 22 (31.4%, 22/70) mentioned \nexpert consultants in academia (21.4%, 15/70), forensics (2.8%, \n2/70), government (17.1%, 12/70), industry (24.3%, 17/70), or a \nnongovernmental organization (21.4%, 15/70) (see Table S8 ). No \nlaw or immigration enforcement authorities were referenced.\nThe articles covered a range of topics and varying depths with \nregard to the DNA test application. For instance, many (35.7%, \n25/70) specifically covered the use of DNA tests to reunify \nmigrant families following the separation that ended on June 20 \n(see Table S9 ). Some articles also covered the use of rapid DNA \nFigURe 2 |  Whole numbers of news articles and Tweets published were binned for 6-day periods to display the trends in publications over the time period of June \n1 to July 31, 2018.

The majority (64.3%, 45/70) \nwere not specific as to how the DNA tests would be applied.\nWe further examined these 70 news articles for depth of \ncoverage of the science of DNA testing and the legal authority \nfor the DNA testing. We noted that 19 of the articles (27.1%, \n19/70) discussed the science enough to warrant further analysis \ninto content and accuracy and that nine (12.9%, 9/70) discussed \nthe legal authority of DNA testing; seven of the articles covered \nboth. An additional six articles did not discuss the science or \nlegal authority for DNA testing; the sole focus of these articles \nwas the ethics of DNA testing. This refinement led to 27 news \narticles with discussion of DNA testing that warranted further \nanalysis for content. These 27 news articles represent 14.8% of \nthe 183 articles originally identified and eligible for analysis, \nmeaning 85.2% of the news articles covering the use of DNA \ntests for migrant family reunification did not contain any depth \nof discussion of the science or legal authority for doing so.\nIn-Depth Analysis of News Content\nThe 27 news articles were further analyzed for coverage \nregarding the ethics, science, process, and legality of DNA testing \nin this context (see Table 3 ). In general, of the 27 news articles \nundergoing in-depth analysis, 13 (48.1%, 13/27) had a slant \nagainst DNA testing, and the rest were neutral. Of the 38 topics \nwe assessed, the number covered by news articles ranged from \nonly four topics within the 1,325-word article on July 8 in The \nWashington Post  (Sacchetti, 2018c ) to 20 topics each in a 1,995-\nword article on July 5 in GenomeWeb  (Ray, 2018 ) and a 1,362-\nword article on July 10 in USA Today  (Weise et al., 2018 ). The \nnumber of topics is, of course, less interesting than the scope, \ndepth, and accuracy of coverage, as well as what was not covered \nby the articles. Our analysis, though not exhaustive, enabled an \nimportant glimpse into the substantive quality of the articles \nwhen it came to discussion of DNA testing in this realm.\nCoverage of Science and Processes\nWith 183 articles mentioning the use of DNA tests, we expected \nsome portion to describe what DNA was or how DNA testing \nmight be applied, and some descriptions of how DNA testing \nfor immigration might differ from other types of DNA tests \nwith which the article\u2019s readers might be familiar (such as DNA \nancestry tests). However, only three articles (1.6%, 3/183) had a \nstatement describing DNA, although an additional six mentioned \nthe use of STRs for identity testing. We present examples of \nquotations from these sources in Table S10  to demonstrate how \ngenetic concepts was described to the public. Of note, seven \narticles mentioned the potential use of rapid DNA technologies, \nalbeit with varying depth of coverage.\nThe articles lacked consistency in describing the DNA \ntesting processes that were being proposed. This lack of clarity \nwas manifested in the articles as inconsistencies in the type \nof DNA collection that was supposedly performed and also \nin the anticipated results of the DNA tests. While a majority \n(55.6%, 15/27) of the articles that mentioned some form of DNA collection by the government indicated that cheek swabs \nwould be performed, some articles instead mentioned the use \nof saliva (eight articles) or blood samples (two articles). All 13 \narticles prior to the HHS announcement on July 5 mentioned by \nname at least one commercial DNA testing service.

Given the \nknown processes of the named ancestry companies, the reference \nto cheek swabs and/or blood was likely an error on the part of the \nreporters. None of the 13 articles addressed how samples would \nbe retrieved and whether chain-of-custody would be maintained.\nThe articles discussing DNA testing in June tended to center \naround the potential use of commercial genetic services and \ntechnologies for the reunification of families, whereas the articles \nin July primarily were focused on the announcement on July 5 \nthat the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) would be \nusing genetic tests as a reunification tool. Seven (3.8%, 7/183) \nof the articles from July 5 to 31 addressed the uncertainty of \nwhat type of DNA testing would be conducted and under what \norganization or authority the testing would occur. Of the 11 \narticles that mentioned that the government was conducting \nDNA tests, only three mentioned who would retrieve the sample \nand only one article mentioned who would receive the DNA \ntest\u00a0report.\nCoverage of Legality\nThe lack of clarity regarding how DNA testing might be \nconducted as instructed by the U.S. government was apparent in \nour analysis of coverage of the legal authority of DNA testing. \nMany of the articles that expressed concern for the uncertainty \nof how DNA testing would be conducted also speculated on \nthe legal authority for DNA testing (see Table S11 ). That said, \nfew articles overall (7.1%, 13/183) questioned or considered \nthe legal authority for DNA testing, and these articles were in \ndisagreement as to whether the U.S. government has authority \nto do so or not. Most of the articles did not mention the need for \noversight of genetic testing in this context. Those that did (2.2%, \n4/183) did not directly address the need for oversight of DNA \ntesting for immigration or acknowledge the existing oversight \nmechanisms for relationship testing (see Table S12 ).\nGiven that the summer 2018 application was not the first time \nthat genetic tests were being used for immigration purposes, \nwe were interested in what the articles covered regarding the \nprior immigration applications of DNA tests. However, only \nnine (4.9%, 9/183) news articles mentioned some prior form \nof government-sponsored DNA testing. Five of these articles \nhad a negative slant on DNA testing, and the rest were neutral. \nFour of the articles mentioned the voluntary use of DNA tests \nfor verification of family members petitioning to join relatives \nin the United States; two mentioned the collection of DNA \nfrom immigrant detainees as a requirement for CODIS; two \nmentioned the requirement for DNA tests as part of the affidavit \nof relationship for Priority-3 refugees joining family members \nin the United States; two mentioned the use of DNA to screen \nfor claimed relationships of unaccompanied minors coming to \nthe United States to join family members; and one mentioned \nthe DNA-ProKids program that uses DNA tests to detect child \ntrafficking (see Table S13 ).\nCoverage of Ethics\nSeveral ethics topics of interest were not well represented in \nthe news articles, both in terms of the potentially positive and \nthe potentially negative uses of DNA. For instance, none of the articles addressed the use of DNA for public safety, in as far as \nthe collection of DNA from migrants might be used to protect \ncitizens and legal residents and for future crime solving. Ten \n(5.5%, 10/183) of the articles did mention the use of DNA for \nfuture arrests but only as a negative aspect or as a potential \nintrusion on the rights of the migrants. Along that vein of \npotential intrusions, only two (1.1%, 2/183) of the articles \nmentioned the potential use of DNA to identify other relatives \nwho might be undocumented. Most of the 27 articles addressed \nat least some of the privacy issues of DNA (20 articles) and/or the \nconcerns for security of the DNA specimen and resulting genetic \ndata (24 articles); however, the 25 articles addressing one or both \nof these topics only reflects a 13.7% portion of the 183 articles \ncovering DNA testing.\nOverall, the articles addressing ethical issues tended to focus \non ethical issues commonly associated with health-related \ngenetic testing (e.g., privacy, consent, and storage of information), \nrather than non-health-related testing (e.g., unexpected kinship, \nlanguage barriers, differing cultural definitions of family). \nMore articles mentioned consent (10.4%, 19/183), privacy \n(10.9%, 20/183), or DNA data storage (13.1%, 24/183) than \nother non-health-related topics. Quite surprisingly, only two \narticles (1.1%, 2/183) mentioned the risk that migrants could \nhave a language barrier or an inability to comprehend the DNA \ntesting process. Only one article ( Richards, 2018 ) mentioned \nthe potential differences in cultural perspectives on the use of \ngenetic information. Four articles (2.2%, 4/183) mentioned the \nrisk of uncovering or revealing health-related information. How \nthe articles addressed the risks in kinship testing was interesting \nas well. We compared analysis of coverage of the risk that DNA \ntesting might reveal an unknown biological relationship\u2014or lack \nthereof (mentioned in 11 articles, 6.0%, 11/183)\u2014to coverage of \nthe interpretation challenge of applying a DNA test to families \nthat are non-biological (mentioned in 12 articles, 6.6%, 12/183). \nWe expected that a news article covering one topic would cover \nthe other, but in fact, only five articles mentioned both.\nWe found a general lack of discussion of the rights of migrants \nwho could potentially be DNA tested for reunification purposes. \nFurther, of the few articles with some mention of the human \nrights of the person undergoing the DNA test, six of them (66.7%, \n6/9) had a negative slant on DNA, broadly discussing how DNA \ntesting of migrants could be a violation of their human rights. \nNone of the articles addressed whether migrants might have a \nright to access DNA data in support of their refugee petitions. \nOn a similar note, half of the eight articles that mentioned that \nmigrant communities were vulnerable populations at high risk \nof being taken advantage of in the DNA testing process had a \nnegative slant on DNA.\nOf the 27 news articles, only three lacked any mention of the \nactor involved in DNA testing (e.g., HHS, commercial genome \nservice provider); offers of commercial DNA tests garnered the \nmost attention, appearing in 20 articles. Articles that mentioned \nthe HHS announcement of DNA testing (following the July 5, 2018 \nannouncement) and those mentioning commercial DNA testing \nseemed to address ethical topics, covering about 5.3 ethics issues \nper article (see Table S14 ). Both categories of articles also brought \nup legality issues\u2014although with less frequency than ethics \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n12issues\u2014covering about 3.3 and 2 topics per article, respectively. \nWithin the 13 articles that mentioned commercial DNA testing, \nsome mentioned the method of collection (61.5%, 8/13) and some \nmentioned who would pay for testing (69.2%, 9/13). In contrast, \nthe four articles that mentioned only the HHS announcement of \nDNA testing contained no mention of the issue of who would \npay for testing. All seven articles that mentioned both the HHS \nannouncement of DNA testing and commercial DNA testing \nmentioned method of collection, but surprisingly, only one article \n(14.3%, 1/7) mentioned the issue of who would pay for testing.\nAnother theme among the 27 news articles was discussion of \npotential secondary uses of genetic data collected from migrants, \nmentioned in 18 news articles. These topics include using DNA \n(either DNA testing or DNA collection) for detecting human \ntrafficking, apprehending wanted criminals, solving future \ncrimes, and identifying undocumented relatives. Using DNA \nfor trafficking detection was mentioned in 12 articles, and using \nDNA for future arrests was mentioned in 10 articles. No trends \nwere seen in slant for or against DNA testing in these two sets of \narticles. However, only two articles mentioned using DNA testing \nfor identifying undocumented relatives, both of which were \ncoded as negatively slanted against DNA. No articles mentioned \nthe use of DNA to apprehend wanted criminals among the \nmigrating population.\nFinally, we were interested in examining the relevancy of other \ntopics mentioned in the course of the news articles focusing \non DNA testing, as we anticipated the potential for irrelevant \ntopics to be included as sensationalism (whether intentionally or \nunintentionally). One topic we tested as a measure of this was \nthe recent use of familial searching of genealogical databases \nfor crime investigations, as was used in the Golden State Killer \ncase in April 2018. This case was mentioned in four of the news \narticles, all of which had a neutral stance on DNA testing for \nfamily reunification.\nTwitter Analysis\nSearches for Coverage of DNA in Family \nReunification\nThe search for \u201cDNA \u201d with trending hashtags yielded 59 Tweets \nand the search of \u201cDNA \u201d with key words yielded 164 Tweets (see \nTable S15 ); four of the Tweets were in both searches. One Tweet \nin each search were duplicates, so only the older Tweet was kept \nfor data analysis. While the PDF used to capture Tweets during \nour one-time search contained hyperlinks to the source Tweets \n(allowing us to view images and other data such as exact time of \nposting and geolocation), we found over time that some Tweets \nbecame later inaccessible; we encountered problems such as the \nsuspension of accounts and changes in display or usernames. \nWe found that conducting searches for specific Tweets using the \nuser interface did not consistently return relevant results. The \nTweets were refined for relevancy to the topic of migrant family \nreunification resulting in 153 Tweets for further analysis. The \ntrends in timing of Tweets parallels those trends observed in the \nnews coverage, again with two peaks in conversation from July 5 \nto 6 and again July 10\u201311, and a minor peak between June 20 and \n22 (see Figure 2A ).Of the all of the Tweets in our dataset, 133 (86.9%, 133/153) \nwere original Tweets and 20 (13.1%, 20/153) were re-Tweets. In \n24 Tweets (15.7%, 24/153) other Twitter handles were directly \nmentioned (e.g., @POTUS, @DHS), and 84 Tweets (54.9%, \n84/153) contained hyperlinks to news articles (see Table S16 ). \nIn 26 Tweets (31.0%, 26/84), the news articles were 12 of those \nincluded in our news source analysis (two Nexis Uni + Westlaw \nNext; one Nexis Uni + ProQuest; nine ad hoc ). The other news \narticles hyperlinked to Tweets were articles not specifically \ndiscussing DNA testing but rather the border crisis in general. \nImagery was used in many of the Tweets, not only through the \nhyperlinked articles but also with in the form of memes, statistics, \nor videos in 15 Tweets (9.8%, 15/153) and in the form of emojis \nin 10 Tweets (6.5%, 10/153).\nHashtags and Direct Mentions in Tweets\nSeasoned Twitter users use hashtags (#) and direct mentions (@) \nin their Tweets to target specific topics or other Twitter users, \nrespectively. Among our 153 Tweets, 60 (39.2%, 60/153) used \nhashtags, and 26 Tweets (17.0%, 26/153) used direct mentions. \nWe grouped the hashtags into themes and tabulated the number \nof Tweets and re-Tweets of these themes to assess the effects of \nthe hashtags on the spread of conversations (see Table S17 ). One \nof our two searches to capture data for analysis used hashtags \nas part of the search string, so it was unsurprising that these \n17 hashtags were detected. Nevertheless, these and the other \nresulting hashtags were useful in qualitatively examining the \neffects of different hashtag terms on re-Tweets. Direct mentions \nin our data set were similarly evaluated and grouped by category \nof the user. These data show the intended audience for at least \nsome of the ongoing Twitter conversations (see Table S18 ).\nPurpose of Tweets and Common Language\nAs a novel approach to analyzing the content of the Tweets, we \ndeveloped an interpretation of each Tweet as outlined in the \nMaterials and Methods  section. Using these interpretations, \nwe were able to break down the Tweet to code for its intended \npurpose using the verbs selected for the interpretation, including \nTweets that advocate, announce, call upon, comment, express, \nhint, question, report, share, solicit, or suggest. Some Tweets \nhave multiple purposes (see Table S19 ). While interpreting the \nTweets allowed us to clarify content and check our own biases \nin interpreting the message of a Tweet, the rhetoric used in the \noriginal Tweet was key for coding for slant.\nTweet Slant\nSupport for the zero-tolerance policy, not always explicitly \nnamed by Twitter users, was associated with support for stricter \nenforcement of immigration laws. Support for family separation \nwas associated with support for the zero-tolerance policy, but \nan anti-family separation stance was not assumed to indicate \nan anti-zero tolerance policy stance. Coding for DNA testing \nslant was relatively unproblematic as long as coders had a rubric \nto distinguish between factual reporting and expressions of \nsupport. Political biases of Tweet and Twitter users depended \non expressions of support for or affiliation with a party, its \nhead, or multiple party members; this could be in the form of \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n13text, including hashtags and direct mentions, as well as images \n(especially emojis associated with particular parties, such as the \n\u201cblue wave\u201d emoji). Where Twitter users explicitly identified \nthemselves as belonging to a particular political group (e.g., \nconservative, independent), we adopted their terminology so as \nnot to impose an over-simplified coding scheme on the complex \npolitical landscape visible on Twitter.\nThe Twitter traffic on the zero-tolerance policy and DNA \ntesting contrasted with the news articles to some degree. Like \nthe news articles, we presumed a Twitter user could, in theory, \nbe supportive of strong immigration policies but opposed to \nthe family separation policy that results from the zero-tolerance \npolicy. Given the brevity of Tweets, though, it was impossible to \ncode for stance on immigration in general as we had done in the \nanalysis of news articles. However, we could code for political \nleanings of the Tweet itself and the Twitter user, in addition to a \nTweet\u2019s stance on the zero-tolerance policy. We found just over \nhalf of Tweets were neutral (51.0%, 78/153), 45 (29.4%, 45/153) \nhad a Democrat or anti-Republican slant, and 30 (19.6%, 30/153) \nhad a Republican or anti-Democrat slant (see Table 4 ).\nThe combined analysis of political slant of Tweets and Twitter \nusers was fairly consistent in the codes, with only one coded as \n\u201cambiguous\u201d (wherein the Tweet was coded as anti-Republican \nbut the Twitter user coded as Republican). In addition to \nexamining the whole counts of each political category, we \ncalculated the number of re-Tweets for each Tweet as a proxy \nfor impact of the Tweet. Ultimately, a combined analysis of the \npolitical slant of the Tweet and Twitter user together showed no \nparticular weight of any political grouping (see Table 4 , Figure \n3A). We found that the levels of engagement across Tweets as \nmeasured by re-Tweets were similar regardless of partisanship \n(see Supplemental File  \u201cSupplemental Tables \u201d).\nThe positions on zero-tolerance policy were generally \nconsistent with the expectation that conservatives would support \nthe policy and liberals would oppose the policy. We found that 46 (88.5%, 46/52) conservative Tweets were pro-zero-tolerance \npolicy, with the other six being neutral (see Table S20 , Figure \n3B). The liberal Tweets also were consistent, with 69 (86.3%, \n69/80) being anti-zero-tolerance policy and the remaining 11 \nneutral. The majority of neutral Tweets were also neutral on the \nzero-tolerance policy (65.0%, 13/20).\nThe slant on DNA testing also showed some interesting bias. \nOf the conservatives, 42 (80.8%, 42/52) were pro-DNA testing, \nwith the remaining 10 being neutral (see Table S21 , Figure 3C ). \nThe liberal Tweets, however, were diverse with regard to slant \ntoward DNA testing, with 21 (26.3%, 21/80) pro-DNA testing, 24 \n(30.0%, 24/80) anti-DNA testing, and 35 (43.8%, 35/80) neutral. \nHalf of the politically neutral Tweets (in the combined analysis) \nwere neutral on DNA testing. Of particular note, all of the pro-\nzero-tolerance policy Tweets were also either pro-DNA testing or \nneutral, whereas the anti-zero-tolerance policy Tweets were split \namong the three categories (see Table 2 ).\nTweet Content and Concepts Covered\nIn contrast to the 27 news articles evaluated for content from \njournalists\u2019 perspectives, the set of 153 Tweets reflect the real-\ntime public dialogue as the news was emerging. The content of \nthe Tweets, therefore, overlapped with that of the 27 news articles, \nbut the themes were slightly different (see Table 3 ). Many of the \nTweets directly referenced a public figure or organization within \nthe text or through a direct mention (see Table S22 ).\nThe Tweets ranged in content, but some clear themes emerged, \nincluding direct reference to or understanding of what DNA tests \nwould demonstrate, which was apparent in 131 Tweets (85.6%, \n131/153). A total of 90 Tweets (58.8%, 90/153) referenced the use \nof DNA tests to demonstrate parent-child relationships, and an \nadditional 39 Tweets (25.5%, 39/153) referenced use of DNA for \ngeneral relationship testing. The use of DNA tests for ancestry \ncame up in seven Tweets (4.6%, 7/153), five of which had already \nmentioned the use for testing kinship or parentage. No Tweets \nmentioned the potential detection of health-related information. \nAnother emergent theme was concerns about costs of DNA tests \nand who would bear the financial burdens. Forty-eight Tweets \n(31.4%, 48/153) mentioned one or both of these related topics. \nThis particular topic (the burden of cost of DNA tests) was a point \nof discussion almost entirely among politically slanted liberal or \nneutral Twitter users, with only one Tweet on this point from a \npolitically conservative Twitter user. The majority were against \nthe zero-tolerance policy, while perspectives on DNA testing were \nmore evenly spread. Twitter conversations regarding cost ranged \nfrom issues of families reportedly having to pay for their own DNA \ntests, offers of free DNA testing services, and potential costs to the \ngovernment and taxpayers. Cost in terms of specific dollar amounts \nwas covered in 12 (7.8%, 12/153) Tweets and offers of free services \n(including pro bono work or reimbursement for migrant families) \nwere discussed in 6 (3.9%, 6/153) Tweets. Two (1.3%, 2/153) Tweets \nasserted that the government should pay for DNA tests and one \n(0.7%, 1/153) asserted that an NGO should pay, while 12 (7.8%, \n12/153) asserted that a company (e.g., 23andMe) could pay. Thirty \nTweets (19.6%, 30/153) discussed that migrant families had to pay \nfor DNA tests and 26 (17.0%, 26/153) Tweets framed the cost of \nDNA testing as a burden on migrant families (see Table S23 ).TABle 4 |  Political slant on Twitter and impact as measured by re-Tweets.\nNumber Tweets Total re-Tweets\nPolitical slant of Tweets\nRepublican 21 (13.7%) 8,318 (26.0%)\nAnti-Democrat 9 (5.9%) 1,382 (4.3%)\nDemocrat 3 (2.0%) 85 (0.3%)\nAnti-Republican 42 (27.5%) 7,813 (24.4%)\nNeutral 78 (51.0%) 14,378 (45.0%)\nPolitical slant of Twitter users\nRepublican 40 (26.1%) 11,045 (34.5%)\nAnti-Democrat \u2013 \u2013\nConservative 13 (8.5%) 1,762 (5.5%)\nDemocrat 39 (25.5%) 3,841 (21.2%)\nAnti-Republican 28 (18.3%) 4,468 (14.0%)\nLiberal/progressive 8 (5.2%) 570 (1.8%)\nIndependent 6 (3.9%) 3,520 (11.0%)\nNeutral 19 (12.4%) 3,841 (12.0%)\nCombined political slant of Tweet and Twitter users\nConservative 52 (34.0%) 12,807 (40.1%)\nLiberal 80 (52.3%) 16,508 (51.6%)\nAmbiguous 1 (0.7%) \u2013\nNeutral 20 (13.1%) 2,661 (8.3%)\nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n14Unlike the news articles, in which human trafficking was rarely \nmentioned in 6.6% (12/183) of the articles, 44% (68/153) of the \nTweets acknowledged the use of DNA testing to detect human \ntrafficking (see Table S24 ). All but one of these Tweets were \nfrom conservative or neutral Twitter users that were supportive \nof the zero-tolerance policy and the use of DNA testing for \nreunification. While the overwhelming majority of Tweets that \naddressed applications of DNA tests beyond family reunification \ndiscussed human trafficking, the use of DNA samples or DNA test \nresults, or access to DNA data through a database (e.g., CODIS) \nfor future arrests was addressed in only two (1.3%, 2/153) Tweets, \nboth with an anti-DNA testing slant. Two Tweets also covered the \nuse of DNA samples or DNA test results for detecting unwanted \ncriminals among migrants (one was neutral on DNA testing, the \nother pro-DNA testing). Discussion of the use of DNA to detect \nundocumented relatives of migrants was conspicuously absent.\nTimeline of Slant in News and Twitter Coverage\nBecause the majority of news articles did not contain enough \nsubstance on DNA testing to determine whether there was slant, \nthe timeline of the slant on the news articles was unremarkable. \nThe pro-, anti-, and neutral DNA testing coverage in the news \narticles was sporadic across the time period (see Figure 2B ). \nHowever, the trend seen in the Twitter timeline differed from the news article trends (see Figure 2C ). We found that the Tweets \npublished in June were primarily pro-DNA testing, whereas the \nTweets in July (following the HHS announcement on July 5, \n2018), were neutral, anti-DNA testing and pro-DNA testing.\nDiSCUSSiON\nNews on the zero-tolerance policy did not gain a great amount \nof public attention until the end of May 2018. By mid-June, the \npublic media sphere was largely focused on the policy as an \nimmigration deterrence tool, the ethics of family separations, \nand backlash rhetoric aimed at the policymakers. It was during \nthis news spiral that DNA testing emerged as a human rights \ntool for detecting human trafficking at the border, as a reparative \ntool for reunifying families, and as a screening tool for ensuring \nchildren were returned to their rightful relatives. In real time, and \nanecdotally, the media conversations at large seemed confused \nin facts and rife with hyperbole. Given the prominent rhetoric \nand partisanship, we took this opportunity to examine the \nmicrocosm of conversations around DNA testing in this context \nto assess the accuracy of the information being conveyed and \nbias of the opinions espoused. Our analysis of a subset of news \narticles and Tweets cannot provide a generalizable understanding \nFigURe 3 |  Political slant of Tweets.

We hoped that our examination \nof this current event might be useful for understanding part of \nwhat was conveyed and understood about DNA testing in the \nmedia to inform future science communication on similar topics \nof interest and import to the broader public.\nWhile we captured few inaccuracies in either media \ntype, we did note a few examples of misconceptions and \nmisunderstandings of how DNA testing works, especially in the \nproposed contexts (immigration as opposed to medical testing). \nFor instance, in news coverage we noted two articles discussing \nthe use of blood for DNA tests as well as occasional conflation \nof saliva samples versus  buccal swabs for HHS DNA tests and \ncommercial DNA tests. Alarmingly, most of the articles covering \nDNA testing in family reunification seemed unaware that DNA \ntesting was a routine (sometimes recommended) voluntary \nmetric for immigration petitions, required in certain refugee \ncases, and routinely collected by law from federal immigrant \ndetainees for the federal criminal database, CODIS. Because of \nthis, the rhetoric that was used in a majority of news articles \nmade it appear that government-mandated DNA tests was a \nnew phenomenon instead of a method that had been previously \napplied in other similar situations. This can affect the public\u2019s \nformation of opinions on DNA testing and can lead to inaccurate \nunderstandings of how DNA testing had already been used and \nits previously acknowledged benefits for immigration use.\nMost alarming was the fact that the majority of news articles \nhad to be excluded from our content analysis entirely because \nthey omitted any coverage of the purpose of a DNA test, the \nscience behind a DNA test, or what a DNA test might reveal in \nthis non-medical context. Given the persistent misconceptions \namong the public regarding how DNA tests were conducted and \nthe risks and benefits of a DNA test, adequate coverage of basic \nscience facts (such as defining DNA testing or distinguishing \ntypes of testing) is essential for the public to grasp and appreciate \nthe social and policy issues at hand.\nSurprisingly, when it came to the purpose of DNA tests, the \nTweets contained more nuance than the news articles. While \nthe character count is limited in a Tweet, the majority of the \nTweets mentioned in some form that the DNA tests were for \nparentage. The Twitter conversations also had far more coverage \nof the potential costs of DNA testing to the government and to \nthe families being tested. While cost and payment were covered \nin 2.2 and 5.5% of news articles, respectively, these were points \nmade in 24.8 and 29.4% of Tweets, respectively.\nWe also noticed that the few news articles examining the \nethical issues with DNA testing a migrant population\u2014including \nmigrant minors\u2014selectively covered certain potential ethical \nissues. None of the 10 news articles coded as pro-DNA testing \ncovered these topics. In the anti-DNA and neutral articles, \ncoverage was lacking and inconsistent for two particular topics: \n1) the risk of detecting misattributed parentage; and 2) the \nfalse equivalency of biological family with the social construct \nof family ( Lee and Voigt, 2019 ). We were surprised that only 5 \nof the news articles discussing the former also mentioned the latter and that 11 articles mentioned one topic and not the other. \nFurthermore, except for covering issues of costs and burden of \nDNA tests, few of the Tweets referenced ethical issues.\nThere was no conversation in our dataset about the use of \ngenetic information potentially being an empowering tool for \nmigrants, especially as a means to reunify with their families. \nThe positive discussions around DNA testing were more skewed \ntoward the tool as a means to screen bad actors (i.e., human \ntraffickers) rather than a tool to expedite the reunification \nprocesses. While several articles implied that the use of DNA tests \nmight be a ruse to collect DNA from migrants for a database\u2014\nsuch as a database for detecting recidivism in illegal crossings or \nfor identifying future criminals\u2014this was not discussed explicitly \nin any of the articles. The potential use of DNA tests to screen \nfor fraudulent relationship claims (potentially to detect cases of \nhuman trafficking) was sparsely mentioned in 6.6% of the news \narticles but mentioned in 24.2% of the Tweets.\nThere are dangers in transferring general notions about \ninformed consent in a medical setting, for example with this \nspecific non-medical application of DNA testing. Wholly absent \nfrom the public discourse in these news articles and Tweets was \na weighing of risks and benefits. While contextual vulnerabilities \nof the detained migrants now separated from family members \nshould be considered an essential aspect of the ethical and \npolicy inquiry as to whether DNA testing is appropriate (e.g., \nadequacy of consent, consideration of privacy measures), so too \nis consideration of the potential direct benefits to those specific \nindividuals (i.e., mitigation of the psychological trauma that \ncould result from indefinite delays in familial reunifications). We \nagree that genetic information might reveal private information \n(Katsanis et al., 2018 ), and that the use of DNA data should be \nrestricted ( Lee and Voigt, 2019 ), but the informational risks need \nto be balanced with the risks to the families in this context in \norder to prioritize the reunification of children with their family \nmembers expeditiously.\nIt is critical for genetic professionals and the public to keep \ndistinct conversations on social implications for different types of \nDNA testing. For instance, DNA testing is not equivalent to DNA \ncollection, since the former might or might not involve database \ndevelopment and the latter might or might not involve a DNA \ntest report. These different uses of DNA have very different social \nimplications. In summer 2018, conversations on DNA testing \nfor family reunification were conflated with conversations about \ninvestigative genetic genealogy. It so happened that the timing of \nthe first cases of the use of genetic genealogy to investigate cold \ncases was a news highlight parallel to the use of DNA for migrant \nfamily reunifications. Y et again, the social implications of the two \ntopics barely overlap, except that they both involve DNA and \ngovernmental actors. But 4 of the 27 articles in our substantive \ndataset mentioned the \u201cGolden State Killer. \u201d We assert that \nthese mentions are demonstrative of a) the conflation of discrete \nnonmedical DNA test issues among the public; and b) the intent \nof the news media to sensationalize the use of nonmedical DNA \ntests. Each application has its own implications deserving of \npublic scrutiny and debate.\nThe greatest challenge to detangling the public dialogue \naround the use of DNA tests by ORR was the lack of facts and \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n16information regarding how DNA testing was being conducted, \nwhether DNA testing was being done, whether DNA was being \ncollected for future use, and what actors were involved in the \nDNA testing processes. The ORR was emphatically silent on \nnaming the contract laboratory that would supposedly perform \nthe DNA tests, so experts consulted by the media had no choice \nbut to speculate and rightfully raised more questions than \nanswers. This lack of transparency served to spark controversy \nwhere facts otherwise might have pacified readers regarding \noversight measures for quality, best practice restrictions on \nsecondary uses, or requirements for informed consent. As a \nresult, our data exemplifies the confusion in the media reports \nand the multitude of questions from the public appearing on \nsocial media. Whereas on Twitter we might expect confusion \n(because information is essentially crowdsourced), the news \nmedia has a professional responsibility to provide the public \nwith reliable information. Scientists, too, have a responsibility to \nshare their expertise with the public and a responsibility to foster \npublic understanding. Genetics experts have a responsibility to \n\u201cclaim expertise only in fields where they have the necessary \ndepth of knowledge, especially when interacting with patients, \nor contributing to public discussion or policy debate\u201d ( ASHG, \n2017 ) and to \u201cserve as a source of reliable information and \nexpert opinion\u201d ( NSGC, 2017 ). In summer 2018, the genetics \ncommunity did not adequately clarify to the public how the \nscience could by appropriately applied\u2014especially in this case of \nthe endangerment of a person\u2019s well-being or a violation of their \nhuman rights.\nNearly three dozen members of Congress, led by \nRepresentative Jackie Speier (D-CA-14), to write HHS Secretary \nAzar seeking answers to eight questions surrounding the DNA \ntesting and use of the resulting genetic information. Separately, \nan amendment introduced by Representatives Clark and Kaptur \nwas adopted in committee markup for the Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations minibus bill to impose restrictions on use and \nprotect the privacy of the genetic information obtained in this \ncontext. This amendment was included in the final version of the \nappropriations bill (H.R. 6157) that became law (the Department \nof Defense and Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations \nAct, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019; Pub. L. \n115\u2013245) on September 28, 2018. However, as of April 2019, \nHHS Secretary Azar had not yet submitted a response to the \nCongressional letter.\nPolitical slant is expected in any democratic public dialogue, \nand our data reflected the opinions, innovations, and freedom \nof thought and press that we expect in a democracy. What \nwas unexpected was to see the political slant (conservative vs. \nliberal) correlating to the slant in opposition to the use of DNA \ntesting. Moreover, we were struck by how the dialogue shifted \namong liberals in our data set after the announcement that HHS \nwould be using DNA tests for reunification. In fact, we noted \nthree different conversations in the media and on social media: \n1) use DNA to detect child trafficking; 2) use DNA to reunify \nfamilies; and 3) don\u2019t use DNA tests because it is a privacy risk. \nConversation #1 was absent from discussion among liberals \nin our data, and conversations #2 and #3 were absent among \nconservatives in our data. Interestingly, conversation #2 occurred in regard to commercial DNA tests and conversation #3 occurred \nin regard to ORR-directed DNA tests. The contrasts and political \nleanings among these three different conversations exemplify the \ndivisiveness of the public\u2019s conversations about immigration and \ntheir understanding of how genetic tools might apply.\nOur study of news and social media highlights the gaps in \nunderstanding of the public and of the genetics community \nin how genetic information is routinely used in immigration \nalready. Professional organizations have an important \nrole in communicating with and translating for the public \nadvancements in science and their limits, possibilities, benefits, \nand risks. American College of Medical Genetics, American \nSociety of Human Genetics, and the American College of \nPhysicians were among the numerous professional organizations \nrightfully responsive to the summer 2018 crisis, stating their \npositions in opposition to government-sanctioned activities \nand recommendations for improvements in policies ( American \nCollege of Physicians, 2018 , American College of Medical \nGenetics and Genomics, 2018 ; Nelson, 2018a ; Nelson, 2018b ). \nHowever, the nuances with regard to the prior use of DNA tests \nin immigration and the existing oversight mechanisms were \nabsent from these statements. So too was a nuanced perspective \non the ethics regarding DNA testing given the crisis scenario at \nthat time. We have learned through our research with human \ntrafficking victims and other vulnerable populations ( Katsanis \net al., 2017 ) that perspectives on the risks of the use of genetic \ninformation is heavily dependent on the context and urgency of \nthat use. Professional organizations should take a proactive role \nin developing resources applicable in times of crisis to manage \nmisinformation with regard to what genetic information can and \ncannot convey, and how genetic information might be used and \nprotected. As part of this preparedness, professional organizations \nshould be the point resource for the public in providing relevant \nexpertise so that disseminated content is responsibly responsive.\nCONClUSiON\nThe confusion of the news media and reflected in social media on \nhow DNA tests work and the different contexts for applying DNA \ntesting exemplifies A) the lack of transparency in use of genetic \ninformation; B) the ineffectiveness of inclusion of genetics \nexperts in the public conversations; and C) the ill-preparedness \nof the genetics community in reacting to public confusion and \noutcry. Responsible use of genetic information as a tool in human \nrights crisis has the potential to garner broader public support \nfor genetic testing in other spaces, but the lack of transparency \nin how the DNA testing was applied only undermines the \ntrustworthiness of HHS as an institution and HHS-funded \ngenetic research more broadly.\nOne clear need is improved science communication among \nour genetics trainees and opportunities for journalists to gain a \nfoundational training in genetics. Such training could improve \nthe overall communication efforts and misunderstandings when \nit comes to genetic testing. Professional organizations also could \ndevelop repositories of information briefs and contacts for \nrelevant experts, so that they are available for news reporters \nFrontiers in Genetics  | www.frontiersin.org December 2019  | Volume 10 |  Article 1232\nConversations on Migrant Testing Wagner et al.\n17who need rapid and consistent answers when unexpected uses of \ngenetic information emerge.\nIn general, this study serves as a reminder that the content \nof genetic experts\u2019 conversations in public spaces are essential \nin formulating public opinion and communicating the risks and \nbenefits of DNA testing.\nDATA AVAilABiliTY STATeMeNT\nRaw data containing identifiers (e.g., Twitter user names) are \nnot available for public review.

We are awash in disinformation consisting of\nlies, conspiracies, and general nonsense, all with real-world impli-\ncations ranging from horrific humans rights violations to threats\nto our democracy and global public health. Although the internet\nis vast, the peddlers of disinformation appear to be more localized.\nTo this end, we describe a domain-level analysis for predicting if a\ndomain is complicit in distributing or amplifying disinformation.\nThis process analyzes the underlying domain content and the hy-\nperlinking connectivity between domains to predict if a domain\nis peddling in disinformation. These basic insights extend to an\nanalysis of disinformation on Telegram and Twitter. From these\ninsights, we propose that search engines and social-media recom-\nmendation algorithms can systematically discover and demote the\nworst disinformation offenders, returning some trust and sanity to\nour online communities.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n\u2022Information systems \u2192World Wide Web ;\nKEYWORDS\ndisinformation; misinformation\n1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the midst of the global pandemic, 20%of the public believed Bill\nGates was planning to use COVID-19 to implement a mandatory\nvaccine program with tracking microchips [ 28]. Around the same\ntime in mid-2020, the QAnon conspiracy ripped through social\nmedia, contending that a cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibalistic\npedophiles and child sex-traffickers plotted against Donald Trump\nduring his term as US President. A recent poll found 37%of Ameri-\ncans are unsure whether the far-reaching QAnon is true or false,\nand 17%believe it to be true [27].\nThe common thread in Bill Gates\u2019 COVID-microchips, QAnon\u2019s\nSatan-worshipping cannibals, and the long litany of conspiracies,\nlies, and general nonsense polluting the internet is the ease with\nwhich billions of online users can create and distribute content, the\nfavoring by social-media\u2019s recommendation algorithms of the most\noutrageous and salacious content that drives user engagement, and\nthe seemingly endless appetite of the general public for this content.\nToday\u2019s disinformation campaigns are leading to real-world\nharms from vaccine hesitancy to the denial of the scientific consen-\nsus of the catastrophic effects of global climate change, denial of\nhuman-rights violations in Ukraine, and a lack of confidence in our\nelectoral system.Tackling disinformation on a per-post/image/video basis (e.g., [ 1\u2013\n3,10,11,14,16,18,21\u201325,32,33,38\u201343,47]) is leading to a mad-\ndeningly massive game of online whack-a-mole. At the same time,\nrecent studies have found that a relatively small number of users\nare responsible for the majority of online COVID [ 34] and climate\nchange [ 30] disinformation, suggesting that tackling disinforma-\ntion at a higher-level based on specific users, groups, or domains\nmay be more effective.\nBy way of nomenclature, we refer to \u201cdisinfo domains\u201d as those\nconsisting of a broad category of domains that traffic in conspiracies,\ndistortions, lies, disinformation, and more generally do not follow\naccepted journalistic standards, whether they are maintained by a\nstate-sponsored actor, a private or public entity, or an individual.\nAll other domains will be referred to as \u201cinfo domains.\u201d We describe\nin more detail in Section 3.1 how domains are characterized as one\nor the other.\nIn this work, we describe a domain-level predictor of disinforma-\ntion peddlers that classifies an entire domain (e.g., www.rt.com ) as\nan unreliable news source. This classifier relies on three signals: (1)\nhyperlinks (similar to [ 35]); (2) meta tags specified by the domain\nowners and used primarily for search-engine optimization; and (3)\ncontent in the form of the visible text on the landing and internally\nlinked pages. Our primary contributions include:\n(1)Analyzing a large set of 2500 domains identified as traffick-\ning in disinformation.\n(2)Revealing a distinct and predictive patterns of hyperlink-\ning, meta tag construction, and underlying content among\ndisinformation peddlers in the form of accurate classifiers\n(F1= 94.1%) able to distinguish between disinfo and info\ndomains.\n(3)Building a hyperlink graph to reveal coordinated disinfor-\nmation efforts.\n(4)Extending our analysis to Telegram to discover the most\nprolific channels and users trafficking in disinformation,\nand using these identified channels to expand our disinfo\ndomain data set.\n(5)Extending our analysis to Twitter to discover the most\nprolific accounts trafficking in disinformation, and using\nthese identified channels to expand our disinfo domain\ndata set.\n2 RELATED WORK\nAccording to a 2020 poll, slightly more than half of Americans\nrely on social media for at least some of their news [ 37]. Given\nthe growing flood of misinformation, lies, and conspiracies found\non social media, recent efforts have focused on understanding the\npromotion and spread of misinformation on social media. Vosoughi\net al. [ 44], for example, analyzed the spread of misinformation\non Twitter and found that misinformation spreads faster than the\ntruth, and that misinformation is more novel than the truth and is\ndesigned to inspire a strong response of fear, disgust, and surprise,\n1arXiv:2205.03338v1  [cs.CY]  6 May 2022\nAnonymous submission #262 to ACM CCS 2022\nand hence more engagement in terms of likes, share, and retweets.\nBecause of this, social media\u2019s recommendation algorithm tend\nto favor misinformation. Faddoul et al. [ 9] and Tang et al. [ 42],\nfor example, showed that YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm\ncontribute to the spreading of conspiracies and misinformation.\nAnd, automated tools, such as Hoaxy [ 36], reveal in real time how\nmisinformation spreads on Twitter.\nRelated efforts have also analyzed the infrastructure support\nbehind disinformation. Han et al. [ 12], for example, studied the\nservice providers that power hundreds of disinformation and hate\nsites and found that disinformation sites disproportionately rely\non several popular ad networks and payment processors, including\nRevContent and Google DoubleClick. In related work, by analyz-\ning ads placed on over a thousand disinformation domains, Zeng\net al. [ 46] discovered that 42.5%of the ads on these domains are\npolitical ads with a significant portion ( 26.0%) being left-leaning.\nDesigned to inspire a strong response, the distinct linguistic\ncharacteristics of text-based misinformation have been used for\nautomatic detection. A plethora of techniques have been proposed\nto automatically classify individual posts as misinformation or not.\nThese range from leveraging classic machine learning techniques\n(SVM, LR, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, k-NN) to more modern\nmachine learning (CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, C-LSTM, HAN, Conv-\nHAN) models to automatically detect misinformation (see [ 19] for\na comparative study of detection approaches). Having a large and\naccurately labeled list of misinformation, however, is difficult to\nobtain, which is why most of these studies use relatively small\ndatasets.\nRetroactive fact checking, however, is unlikely to stem the flow\nof misinformation. It has been shown, for example, that the effect\nof misinformation may persist even after false claims have been\ndebunked [ 5,20]. In contrast, we focus our analysis at a higher\nlevel of determining if specific domains (e.g., www.rt.com ), Tele-\ngram channels, or Twitter users, are complicit in the spreading of\nmisinformation. Detection at this level lends itself to earlier inter-\nventions in the form of demotion, demonetizing, and \u2013 in the most\nextreme cases \u2013 de-platforming.\nWe analyze the content of and the interconnection (through\nhyperlinking) of 2500 disinfo domains \u2013 identified by independent\nand nonpartisan sources \u2013 to build a domain-level classifier of\ndisinformation peddlers.\nThis type of hyperlink analysis has previously been examined.\nBy analyzing 89news outlets, for example, Pak et al. [ 29] found that\npartisan media outlets are more likely to link to nonpartisan media,\nbut that liberal media link to liberal and neutral outlets whereas\nconservative media link more exclusively to conservative outlets.\nIn analyzing hyperlinks between news media between 1999 to 2006,\nWeber et al. [ 45] found that establishing hyperlinks with other,\nyounger news outlets strengthens the position of that organization\nin the network thus boosting traffic. Hanley et al. [ 13] observed a\nsmall-world phenomenon in QAnon domains in which only 22%of\nauthentic news websites hyperlink to a QAnon sites, as compared\nto40%of known disinformation domains.While these previous studies were not focused broadly on disin-\nformation, the recent work of [ 35] analyzed patterns of hyperlink-\ning to classify domains as trustworthy or not. One crucial obser-\nvation from this work is that disinformation domains are heavily\nconnected to one another and loosely connected to authentic news\ndomains. We expand on this work by analyzing more than twice as\nmany domains, collated \u2013 unlike in this earlier work \u2013 from objec-\ntive sources using standard metrics of journalistic standards. We\nalso, unlike this earlier work, look at both the underlying HTML-\nbased content as well as the hyperlinking connectivity. And, we\nexpand our analysis of domain-level disinformation to Telegram\nand Twitter.\n3 METHODS\n3.1 Domains\nWe obtained two commercially available, manually annotated disin-\nformation domain data sets. The first, from the Global Disinforma-\ntion Index (GDI), is a monthly-updated list of global domains deter-\nmined, using established journalistic standards, as being purveyors\nof disinformation. Our list, from Oct 2021, contains 1276 disinfo\ndomains. The second, from NewsGuard, is also a monthly-updated\nlist of global domains rated and reviewed by trained journalists.\nOur list, from Oct 2021, contains 3403 disinfo domains. Each site in\nthis list is rated using nine basic, apolitical criteria of journalistic\npractice, from which each domain is scored on a scale of 0 (generally\nnot trustworthy) to 100 (generally trustworthy). We labeled any\nsite with NewsGuard\u2019s criteria that a score below 60is classified as\na disinfo domain. The top 10,000Alexa-rated sites \u2013 sans domains\nin our disinfo data set \u2013 constitute our informational domains. This\ninfo data set is, of course, a relatively crude comparison data set,\nbut was selected because of their popularity and therefore overall\nonline impact.\nFor each domain in our dataset, OpenWPM1was used to scrape\nthe contents of the top-level domain (level 1), and to scrape internal\npages linked by the top-level domain (level 2), etc., up to a max-\nimum of 100pages. Any domain that returned a 404error were\nexcluded from our analysis, yielding 2499/3689 disinfo domains\nand 7888/10000 info domains. These domains were further nar-\nrowed because of scraping blocks or primarily non-English content,\nyielding a final domain count of 2435 disinfo domains and 5396 info\ndomains.\n3.2 Hyperlinks\nThe HTML hyperlink tag ( <a href=\"...\" </a> ) is used to link to\nan internal or external page. From the domains described above, we\nextracted all hyperlinks to external pages. An unweighted, directed\ngraph of hyperlinks was then constructed in which the graph nodes\nare the top-level domains and a directed edge connects one domain\nthat hyperlinked to another. The tldextract library2was used to\nextract the top-level domain name from the URL. For example, if\nrt.com hyperlinks to www.inforwars.com/posts/<...> , then the\ngraph contains a directed edge from rt.com toinfowars.com .\n1https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM\n2https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract\n2\nAnonymous submission #262 to ACM CCS 2022\nEach domain is then featurized into a 3-D vector consisting of\nthe following ratios:\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56=# incoming disinfo\n# total incoming\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c=# outgoing disinfo\n# total outgoing\n\ud835\udc61=# total incoming\n# total outgoing,\nwhere # incoming disinfo is the sum of all unique disinfo domains\nlinking to a specific domain (regardless of how many individual\npages are linked), # outgoing disinfo is the sum of all unique disinfo\ndomains a specific domain links to, and the total incoming count is\nonly measured from our combined info and disinfo domains. Any\nfeature for which the denominator is 0is reassigned a value of \u22120.5.\n3.3 Meta tags\nMeta tags are text-based HTML elements present in a web page\u2019s\nsource code describing the page\u2019s content. These tags are mostly\ninvisible to the user, as their purpose is to guide search engines.\nWhen a web architect creates a website, they take on the task of\nsummarizing its content in meta tags to situate it among other\nrelevant pages. Well crafted meta tags lead to better search engine\noptimization and user click through, motivating the architect to\nconsider their meta tags carefully. Because of its importance in\nsurfacing a web page, it is reasonable to assume that a peddler\nof disinformation will pay careful attention to this aspect of their\npage.\nFrom the the set of up to 100pages per domain, we scraped\nthe content associated with seven meta tags: (1) keywords , (2)\ndescription , (3)og:title , (4)og:keywords , (5)og:description ,\n(6)twitter:description , and (7) twitter:title . These meta\ntags were selected because they tend to be descriptive of the underly-\ning domain content, and because, unlike some other meta tags, were\nmore likely to be specified in our domains ( 61.6%the domains in our\ndataset specified keywords ,92.9%specified description ,86.1%\nspecified og:title ,0.3%specified og:keywords ,84.3%specified\nog:description ,59.1%specified twitter:description ,60.3%\nspecified twitter:title , and 96.9%of domains specified at least\none of these meta tags).\nEach scraped domain yields a single string of concatenated words\npre-processed to remove capitalization, punctuation, numbers, and\nstop words (e.g., a, the, is, are , etc.), and then stemmed using the\nPorter Stemmer algorithm [ 31], and lemmatized using the Word-\nNet Lemmatizer [ 26] (both of which are are implemented in the\nPython Natural Language Toolkit3). In order to reduce feature-\nvector dimensionality and focus on discriminatory features, any\nunder-represented words (present in fewer than 10% of our do-\nmains) or over-represented words (present in more than 90%of our\ndomains) are eliminated from consideration.\nFrom the pre-processed meta-tag words, a unigram bag of words\n(BOW) [ 15] is weighted with each word\u2019s inverse document fre-\nquency [ 17] to yield a 12244 -D meta-tag feature vector for each\ndomain. As described in Section 3.5, this feature vector is then\npruned down to the top 500most diagnostic words.\n3https://www.nltk.org3.4 Content\nWe define content as any visible text on a web page. This includes\nheaders, footers, article titles, article content, link texts, button texts,\netc. A website\u2019s visible text is likely to contain the majority of the\nlinguistic information a user might engage with upon visiting a\nsite.\nFrom the the set of up to 100pages per domain, the visible text is\nextracted from the raw HTML by parsing out all text wrapped in any\nHTML tag, except for head ,meta ,title ,script , and style . The\nextracted content from all scraped pages within a domain is then\nconcatenated into a single string and, as described in Section 3.3,\npre-processed to remove capitalization, punctuation, numbers, and\nstop words, then stemmed, and lemmatized. As before, any under-\nrepresented tokens or over-represented tokens are eliminated from\nconsideration.\nFrom the pre-processed words, a unigram bag of words (BOW) is\nweighted with each token\u2019s inverse document frequency to yield the\nfinal 80386 -D content-based feature of each domain. As described\nin Section 3.5, and as with the meta-tag features, this feature vector\nis then pruned down to the top 500most diagnostic words.\n3.5 Classification\nOur classification objective is to distinguish between info and dis-\ninfo domains based on the domain-specific meta tag, content, and\nhyperlink features described in the previous sections, as well as\nfrom a combination of all three features. For the meta tag and\ncontent-based classifiers, we begin by reducing the original feature\ndimensionality of 12244 -D and 80386 -D to 500-D. This is accom-\nplished by training a logistic-regression classifier (using Python\u2019s\nscikit-learn library) and extracting the top 500most predictive\ndistinguishing words from, separately, the original meta tag and\ncontent bag-of-words.\nFor each feature, a separate linear support vector machine (SVM)\nis then trained (using Python\u2019s scikit-learn library) on a random 90%\nof the info and disinfo domains, and tested on the remaining 10%\nof the domains. A single combined classifier is also trained on all\nthree features. Each component of the 500-D meta-tag and content\nfeatures are specified in the range [0,1]. Each component of the 3-D\nhyperlink feature is normalized into the range [0,1](by subtracting\nthe minimum possible value of \u22120.5[see Section 3.2] and dividing\nby the maximum value of 10.5). The SVM is optimized using a 5-fold\ncross validation grid search across kernel functions, regularization\nparameter\ud835\udc36, and\ud835\udc591and\ud835\udc592penalty functions, yielding a classifier\nwith a linear kernel, an \ud835\udc592penalty function, and \ud835\udc36=29.76for the\n500-D text-based features, and \ud835\udc36=10000 for the 3-D hyperlinking\nfeatures.\n4 RESULTS\n4.1 Meta tags\nShown in Table 1 is the testing SVM (Section 3.5) performance aver-\naged over 100random 90%/10%dataset training/testing splits using\nonly the 500-D representation of a domain\u2019s meta tags (Section 3.3).\nWith an average accuracy of 94.4%, and a minimum and maximum\naccuracy of 93.9%and 94.9%, it would appear the meta tags are a\nreasonably good predictor of domain trustworthiness.\n3\nAnonymous submission #262 to ACM CCS 2022\nmeasure meta tags content hyperlinks amalgamated\naccuracy 94.4 95.7 95.1 96.3\nprecision 96.1 96.1 97.4 94.5\nrecall 85.5 89.8 86.6 93.7\nF1 90.5 92.8 90.7 94.1\nTable 1: Classifier performance (reported as percentages) for\ndistinguishing info from disinfo domains, using individual\nfeatures (meta tags, content, and hyperlinks) and these fea-\ntures combined into a single classifier (amalgamated). The\nbold-faced values correspond to the best performing classi-\nfier per measure.\nWith an average (min/max) precision \u2013 ratio of correctly clas-\nsified disinfo domains to all classified disinfo domains \u2013 of 96.1%\n(95.3%/97.0%) and an average recall \u2013 ratio of correctly classified\ndisinfo domains to the total number of disinfo domains \u2013 of 85.5%\n(84.0%/87.0%), the classifier is somewhat biased. We hypothesize\nthat this bias is due to more diversity in the info domains, as com-\npared to the disinfo domains.\nThe top-ten most predictive (stemmed and lemmatized) words\nfor classifying a domain as disinfo are:\nprank, archiv, conserv, gadget, ha, trump,\nfreedom, polit, forb, russian\nwhere archiv is the prefix for such words as archive, archives,\narchiving ,hais a prefix for, among others, ha-ha ,polit is the\nprefix for such words as politic, political, politician , and\nforb is a prefix for, among others, forbes .\nOne benefit of the somewhat simplistic logistic regression classi-\nfier is it is interpretable allowing us to see that the classifier seems\nto be picking up on words that are intuitively related to disinfor-\nmation.\n4.2 Content\nShown in Table 1 is the testing SVM (Section 3.5) performance\naveraged over 100random 90%/10%dataset training/testing splits\nusing only the 500-D representation of a domain\u2019s content (Sec-\ntion 3.4). With an average accuracy of 95.7%, and a minimum and\nmaximum accuracy of 95.3%and 96.1%, the content is a slightly\nbetter predictor of domain trustworthiness than the meta tags. It is\na little surprising that this classifier is only slightly more accurate\nthan the classifier using only the meta tags ( 95.7%vs.94.4%). We\nposit this is because the meta tags \u2013 designed to drive search engine\noptimization \u2013 consist of the most descriptive parts of a webpage\u2019s\ncontent.\nWith an average (min/max) precision of 96.1%(95.3%/96.9%) and\nan average recall of 89.8%(88.7%/90.9%), the classifier is slightly\nless biased than the meta tag classifier.\nThe top-ten most predictive (stemmed and lemmatized) words\nfor classifying a domain as disinfo are:\nprank, donat, petit, drudg, trunew, wordpress,\nimmigr, post, freedom, would\nwhere donat is the prefix for such words as donation, donate,\ndonating ,petit is the prefix for such words as petition ,\npetitioning ,petitioned ,immigr is the prefix for such words\nFigure 1: The hyperlinking adjacency matrix for the 7831-\nnode graph consisting of 5396 info domains and 2435 disinfo\ndomains reveals a strong disinfo-disinfo (top right corner)\nand weak info-disinfo hyperlinking (top left corner).\nasimmigration ,immigrant ,immigrating .

There is a connection (blue dot) from one\ndomain (horizontal axis) to another domain (vertical axis) if the\nfrom-domain contains at least one hyperlink to the to-domain. In\nthis visualization, we can see that there are many hyperlinks from\ndisinfo domains to other disinfo domains (upper right corner of the\nadjacency matrix). At the same time, info domains infrequently link\nto disinfo domains (upper left), and both info an disinfo domains\nlink to info domains with similar frequency (lower left, and lower\nright corners of the adjacency matrix). The info domains on the\nhorizontal axis are ranked \u2013 from bottom to top \u2013 in order of\ndecreasing popularity (as determined by Alexa rankings), hence the\ngradient in hyperlinks with more links evident to the more popular\ndomains.\nShown in Table 1 is the testing SVM (Section 3.5) performance\naveraged over 100random 90%/10%dataset training/testing splits\nusing only the 3-D representation of a domain\u2019s hyperlinking pat-\nterns (Section 3.2).

The small compact\nclusters each correspond to purportedly regional news sites. The\nseven, fully-connected domains in Figure 2(a), for example, consistof the Connecticut-based sites4. Similarly, the seven domains in\nthe fully-connected Figure 2(b) consist of Oklahoma-based sites5,\nand the eight fully-connected domains in Figure 2(c) correspond to\nAlabama-based sites6.\nShown in Figure 3(a)-(c) are thumbnails of these regional do-\nmains, revealing a similar layout, ads, and stories within and across\nthe clusters. According to NewsGuard, all of these domains are\ncontrolled by Metric Media News which Media Bias/Fact check\ndescribes as:\n\u201cOverall, we rate Metric Media LLC right-center\nbiased and Questionable based on a lack of trans-\nparency, the publication of false information, and\nnondisclosure of over 1000 imposter websites that\nare designed to look like local news sources.\u201d\nExcept for the larger cluster at the bottom of the graph in Figure 2,\neach of the other tightly-coupled clusters belong to a local news\nsources controlled by Metric Media News.\nOur analysis is capable not only of predicting if a domain is a\nlikely peddler of disinformation, but also to reveal these types of\nsub-structures in the disinfo ecosystem. Of particular interest are\nthese types of highly linked-to domains, but also the fully connected\ncliques revealing potentially coordinated disinformation efforts.\n4www.seconnnews.com , www.swconnnews.com , www.scconnnews.com ,\nwww.neconnnews.com , www.bridgeporttimes.com, www.hartfordreporter.com , and\nwww.housatonicvalleynews.com\n5www.neoklahomanews.com ,www.seoklahomanews.com ,www.northokcnews.com ,\nwww.eastokcnews.com ,www.southokcnews.com ,www.tulsastandard.com , and\nwww.fredericksburgleader.com\n6www.wcalabamanews.com ,www.baldwintimes.com ,www.huntsvilleleader.com ,\nwww.shoalstoday.com ,www.tuscaloosaleader.com ,www.mobilecourant.com ,\nwww.southbirminghamtimes.com , and www.wiregrasstimes.com\n6\nAnonymous submission #262 to ACM CCS 2022\nFigure 4: A subgraph of 860Telegram channels extracted from the full Telegram graph of 11,127channels constructed by con-\nsidering only the channels with degree greater than 20. An edge is added between nodes AandBifAforwarded a message from\nB. The size of the nodes represent the in-degree of the nodes (number of times the channel is mentioned by other channels).\nThe nodes are color-coded according to their general category, revealing a striking relationship between Russian-based sites,\nQAnon, and US-based far-right groups.\nBecause Metric Media\u2019s imposter sites are so numerous, account-\ning for 36.1%of our disinfo domains, we worried that their domi-\nnance skewed our classifier (Table 1). We, therefore, retrained our\nclassifier using only one domain from Metric Media\u2019s vast network,\nand only one domain from any other identified (by NewsGuard or\nGDI) similar type of network. This yielded a total of 1061 disinfo\ndomains and a classification accuracy of 94.3%(as compared to the\nprevious 96.3%accuracy), but a significantly reduced F1 score of\n81.0%(as compared to 94.5%). Although the precision remained rel-\natively high at 89.1%(as compared to 93.7%), the recall reduced sig-\nnificantly to 74.4%(as compared to 94.1%). We hypothesize that this\nreduction in overall performance is due to a significantly smaller\nand more diverse dataset. We expect, however, that as we grow and\ndiversify our disinfo data set, classification will further improve.\n5.2 Telegram\nDisinformation, of course, travels in many different forms and cir-\ncles, from imposter news sites to social-media posts, public and\nprivate groups, and individual text messages. We wondered if our\ndomain-level hyperlink analysis would generalize to some of these\nother mediums. We next describe a hyperlink analysis of disinfor-\nmation networks on public Telegram channels.The telegram channel Donbass Insider has previously been\nimplicated in advancing pro-Russian propaganda7Given its pop-\nularity and impact on the current disinformation landscape, we\nbegan our analysis with this channel and recursively scraped all\nchannels discovered through the forwarded messages feature. The\nopen-source Python library Telethon8was used to scrape these\nchannels.\nAs with the domain-level graph in Figure 2, a graph was con-\nstructed in which each node is a telegram channel, and a directed\nedge connects node Ato node Bif channel Aforwarded a message\nto channel B. This recursive scraping of 1,802channels yielded a\ntotal of 11,127channels. From these channels, a total of 1,013,034\nmessages were collected from which 147,584contained a shared\ndomain URL, 834of which were contained in our disinfo data set.\nTo understand who shares misinformation on Telegram and their\nrelationship to each other, the graph was partitioned \u2013 using the\nLouvain method [ 4] into communities based on channel-to-channel\nconnectivity. This process yielded two broad communities shown\nin Figure 4: (1) Russian, constituting 59.8%of all channels; and (2)\nthe US Far Right, constituting 40.2%of all channels. The Russian\ncommunity are further composed of two communities consisting\n7The perceived threat of this and related channels led to Telegram co-founder Nikolai\nDurov to issues the warning \u201cTelegram channels are increasingly becoming a source\nof unverified information related to the Ukrainian events. We do not have the physical\nability to check all the publications of the channels for reliability. I urge users from\nRussia and Ukraine to doubt any data that is distributed in Telegram at this time. We do\nnot want Telegram to be used as a tool to exacerbate conflicts and incite ethnic hatred.\nIn the event of an escalation of the situation, we will consider the possibility of partially\nor completely limiting the work of Telegram channels in the countries involved for\nthe duration of the conflict.\u201d Shortly after posting this message on Telegram, however,\nDurov, walked back his threat to limit access to channels.\n8https://pypi.org/project/Telethon\n7\nAnonymous submission #262 to ACM CCS 2022\nFigure 5: The mutual Twitter-sharing graph of disinfo domains. Each node is a disinfo domain and has an undirected edge if\nthe Jaccard index of users sharing the respective domains is at least 3%(nodes without connections are excluded). The insets\nare the results of a community detection algorithm highlighting domains having a disproportionately high overlap in the\nusers sharing them.\nof Russian media channels and Russian influencers. The US Far-\nRight community contains notable QAnon followers such as Sidney\nPowell (best known as an avid conspiracy theorist and for her part\nin trying to overturn the 2020 US presidential election) and QAnon\nenthusiast Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green.\nWe find that the channel SidneyPowell is the most prolific\nsharer of content found in our disinfo data set. A total of 61new\ndomains were scraped from 1,000recent posts from this Telegram\nchannel. Of these 61domains, 21domains not in our original data set\nare classified by our amalgamated classifier (Section 4.4) as disinfo,\nand manually verified by us to be clear disinfo domains. These do-\nmains include: independentside.com ,dailynewsbreak.org , and\nfreeworldnews.tv (Media Bias/Fact rates this cite as \u201cExtreme\nRight Biased and a Tin-Foil Hat Conspiracy and Quackery level\nPseudoscience source based on the routine publication of disin-\nformation and outright fake news.\u201d One site, madison.com , was\nincorrectly flagged as disinfo.\nAfter the SidneyPowell channel, the next four most prolific dis-\ninfo channels are worlddoctorsalliance ,RealGenFlynn ,\nRealEMichaelJones , and DrLynnFynn .\nBy searching public Telegram channels for identified disinfo\ndomains, and then performing a connectivity analysis similar to\nour earlier hyperlink analysis, we can identify prolific pushers\nof disinformation (and their relationship to each other) not justat the domain level, but also at the Telegram channel level. This\nanalysis also allows us to grow our disinfo domain list by collating\nand classifying previously unseen domains from these problematic\nchannels. Private channels, of course, would not be amenable to\nthis type of analysis.\n5.3 Twitter\nWe next investigate the ability to generalize our methods to identify\ndisinfo domains by tracking the hyperlinks shared by certain social-\nmedia users. Because of the relative ease of access, we focus on\nTwitter\u2019s publicly available user data using two of Twitter\u2019s APIs\n(using Python\u2019s Tweepy Library9).\nFirst, the Search Tweets API10allows for curating a set of recent\ntweets (up to 9days old), which can be filtered by the keywords,\nhashtags or the URLs they contain. Starting with 2500 NewsGuard\ndisinfo domains (this is an updated version of the database as com-\npared to that used in the main analysis), we collected up to a max-\nimum of 1000 tweets per domain, surfacing which Twitter users\nwere sharing these disinfo domains.\n9https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/\n10https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/search/guides/\nstandard-operators\n8\nAnonymous submission #262 to ACM CCS 2022\nSecond, the Get Tweet Timelines API11allows for curating up\nto3200 most recent tweets posted by a queried Twitter user. Using\nthis API, we collect the recent domains shared by users surfaced in\nthe first step. The data returned by both APIs contains additional\nuser attributes such as geo-location and tweet attributes such as\ntimestamp and replied-to, that could be leveraged in the future.\nWe found 569of the 2500 disinfo domains had been shared at least\nonce on Twitter. The top five most shared domains and [number of\nunique tweeters] are:\n(1)organicconsumers.org [984]\n(2)aflds.org [981]\n(3)newspunch.com [979]\n(4)mintpressnews.com [941]\n(5)icandecide.org [934]\nAn undirected domain-level graph was constructed (Figure 5)\nin which each node is a disinfo domain, and an undirected edge\nconnects node \ud835\udc34to node\ud835\udc35if atleast 3%of the users sharing either\ndomain also share both domains (i.e., the Jaccard similarity \u22653%).\nThe resulting graph contains 194nodes and 211edges. A community\ndetection algorithm [ 6] was employed with the aim of finding\nif clusters of domains shared by the same users would reveal a\ncommon theme in the content being shared.\nThis community analysis revealed some interesting clusters.\nEight of the total 11domains from Community Aare part of the Nat-\nural News Network, included in the NewsGuard disinfo dataset, and\nwhose articles have failed fact checks by fact-checking organiza-\ntions and are described by Wikipedia as \u201cfake news website\u201d spread-\ning pseudoscience and disinformation. Community Bis dominated\nby health pseudoscience spreaders, of which naturalnewsblogs.com\nis also part of the Natural News Network. Community Ccontains\nsome Chinese state-controlled media, which have been accused of\nspreading Russian disinformation in the Ukraine war.\nTo find what other domains are shared by prolific disinformation\nspreaders, we scraped the Twitter activity of the top- 1000 users\nsharing the most number of unique disinfo domains. Outside of\ntwitter.com , the top-five most shared domains and [number of\nunique tweeters] are:\n(1)youtube.com [106]\n(2)foxnews.com [74]\n(3)breitbart.com [69]\n(4)rumble.com [68]\n(5)nypost.com [64]\nAlong with online video platforms like youtube.com andrumble.com ,\nhyperlinks to particularly partisan news websites also feature promi-\nnently in their tweets.\n6 DISCUSSION\nWe should begin our discussion with an acknowledgement that the\ntopic of disinformation can and has become highly political. This\ncan make research into and proposals to mitigate disinformation\nhighly volatile. The political right may accuse us of bias because\nright-leaning organizations may be more implicated in spreading\nelection-related misinformation, and the political left may accuse us\n11https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/timelines/\napi-reference/get-statuses-user_timelineof bias because left-leaning organizations may be more implicated\nin spreading others forms of misinformation. We have, throughout,\ntried to remain politically neutral. From the very beginning of our\nresearch, we relied on established and independent organizations to\nseed our analysis in the form of the initial disinfo domains supplied\nby NewsGuard and GDI. Throughout our research and analysis, we\nthen allowed the data to drive the results and conclusions.\nWith some 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute,\nand over a billion posts to Facebook each day, the massive scale\nof social media makes tackling misinformation (the unintentional\nspreading of false or misleading information) an enormous chal-\nlenge. Tackling disinformation (the intentional spreading of false\nor misleading information), however, may be more tractable.\nPrevious studies, for example, have found that a relatively small\nnumber of users are responsible for the majority of COVID and\nclimate-change misinformation [30, 34]. We propose that tackling\ndisinformation at the domain-level similarly narrows the scope of\nproblematic content to a more manageable number. In particular,\nwe propose that search engines and recommendation algorithms\ncan simply demote content that contains links to previously docu-\nmented (and periodically reviewed) domains. Similarly, Telegram,\nTwitter, TikTok, etc. channels that predominantly share problem-\natic content can be demoted, possibly demonetized, and only in\nextreme cases deplatformed.\nWe understand and appreciate the need to balance an open and\nfree internet, where ideas can be debated, with the need to pro-\ntect individuals, societies, and democracies. Social media, however,\ncannot hide behind the facade they are creating a neutral market-\nplace of ideas where good and bad ideas compete equally. They\ndo not. It is well established that social media\u2019s recommendation\nalgorithms favor the divisive, outrageous, and conspiratorial be-\ncause it increases engagement and profit [ 7]. As a result, Brandies\u2019\nconcept [ 8] that the best remedy for falsehoods is more speech, not\nless, simply doesn\u2019t apply in the era of algorithmic curation and\namplification. By demoting disinformation peddlers, we can create\na more fair and balanced marketplace of ideas where Brandeis\u2019\nprinciple can, in fact, flourish.\nAs with any inherently adversarial relationship, all approaches to\naddressing disinformation \u2013 including ours \u2013 will have to adapt to\nnew and emerging threats. In our case, disinformation peddlers may\nadd decoy hyperlinks to external trustworthy domains to escape\nbeing classified based on their hyperlinks to other disinformation\ndomains. This, in turn, will require techniques to root out such\ndecoy links. And so on, and on, and on. While such a cat and mouse\ngame can be frustrating, the end game will be that it will become\nincreasingly more difficult and time consuming to intentionally cre-\nate and spread false and misleading information, with the eventual\ngoal of discouraging most, leaving us to contend with the die-hard\nadversary. While this is not a complete success, it will mitigate the\nrisk of disinformation and, hopefully, return some civility and trust\nto our online ecosystems.\nDATA AND CODE\nAll of the code associated with this research is available in an anony-\nmous repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/disinfo_detection-96BA/\nREADME.md\n9\nAnonymous submission #262 to ACM CCS 2022\nThe data, consisting of the disinfo domains, are licensed from\nNewsGuard and GDI and we therefore cannot make this data pub-\nlicly available per the licensing agreement terms.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Shruti Agarwal, Hany Farid, Yuming Gu, Mingming He, Koki Nagano, and Hao\nLi. 2019.

Finally, we show how\nwe transform these insights into publicly avail-\nable information to increase transparency.\n1 Introduction\nWith the increasing presence of algorithmic deci-\nsion making, transparency in Machine Learning\nhas become a topic of major social interest. In-\nsight into models decisions is vital for preventing\nalgorithmic bias (Gilpin et al., 2018) that can re-\nsult in discrimination. For example, the predic-\ntion of a criminal risk assessment tool was found\nto be racially biased (Angwin et al., 2016). Fur-\nthermore, in the industry, unexpected results and\nseemingly black box predictions from ML systems\nmight result in losing the trust of potential clients\nand users. Therefore, a clear understanding of the\nlimitations of the ML models, and being transpar-\nent about them, is crucial for businesses.\nThe issue of algorithmic fairness is strongly\nrelated to the data used for model train-\ning (Kamishima et al., 2018). Therefore, data ex-\nploration plays an important role in understanding\nmodels\u2019 predictions and biases.\nIn this paper, we describe our application of\ndata exploration methods to hate speech and hy-\nperpartisan datasets. Firstly, we introduce the\ndatasets. Next, we outline a set of well-known\ndata exploration methods and how they can be em-\nployed to get valuable model insights. We thenpresent the results and insights obtained from ap-\nplying those methods to our datasets. Finally, we\ndiscuss how we utilise those results to improve the\nmodels as well as to provide users of our products\nwith an understanding of our technology.\n2 Datasets\nThe current study concerns datasets used for train-\ning our models for hate speech and hyperparti-\nsanship detection. Despite the focus on a limited\nset of datasets, the data exploration methods de-\nscribed in the following section are equally appli-\ncable to any dataset for training an ML systems.\nHate speech refers here to derogatory state-\nments based on the individual or groups iden-\ntity. We use a public hate speech dataset (Waseem\nand Hovy, 2016), which consists of 16,907 manu-\nally annotated tweets. The samples were initially\nbootstrapped using hashtags that occur in hateful\ntweets. The tweets were then annotated manually\nwith one the following labels: \u2019racist\u2019, \u2019sexist\u2019 and\n\u2019none.\u2019 For the current study, we aggregate the\nformer two labels under an umbrella label \u2019hate\nspeech.\u2019\nHyperpartisanship indicates content which is\npolitically biased (Entman, 2007). Our propri-\netary hyperpartisanship dataset consists of arti-\ncles gathered using seed domains from www.\nmediabiasfactcheck.com . Articles from\nthe extreme right and extreme left websites were\nused as positive samples, whereas the negative\nsamples consist of articles from reputed news\nwebsites (NewYork Times, Guardian, etc.). The\n\ufb01nal dataset encompasses 40k articles labelled as\neither \u2019hyperpartisan\u2019 or \u2019not hyperpartisan.\u2019\n3 Data exploration methods\nTo obtain a better understanding of the datasets to\nbe used for modelling, we employ a number of\nwell-known data exploration methods. The trian-\ngulation of these methods leads to a more compre-\nhensive understanding of the data, as each method\nprovides additional insights.\nManual analysis: Qualitative analysis of the\ndataset and predictions helps in getting a general\nidea of the data and the model, including an ap-\nproximation of the quality as well as potential ex-\nplanations of false positives and negatives. Man-\nual analysis is complemented by statistical meth-\nods, which provide robust results in an ef\ufb01cient\nmanner.\nLatent Semantic Indexing: LSI is a method\nfor extracting the context-dependent meaning of\nwords using statistical analysis of corpora (Lan-\ndauer et al., 1998). LSI provides the most fre-\nquently co-occurring word groups in a dataset.\nThis method enables us to obtain insights beyond\nbasic word frequencies and individual tokens by\nproviding co-occurrences of words in similar con-\ntexts.\nLocal Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explana-\ntions: LIME trains a linear model on locally mod-\ni\ufb01ed data points by perturbing the original dataset\n(Tulio Ribeiro et al., 2016). It helps in understand-\ning the contribution weights of individual tokens\nto a prediction. By exploring the predictions in-\nstead of the datasets directly, LIME complements\nthe previous methods, while providing latent in-\nsights about the over\ufb01tting of the models towards\ncertain features.\n4 Results\nWe applied the above-mentioned methods to the\nhate speech and hyperpartisanship datasets and the\ntrained models. The data exploration methods pro-\nvided us with the following insights:\nReporting vs expressing content: Some arti-\ncles do not express hateful/hyperpartisan views\nbut merely report on them. That is, they report on a\nhateful incident or quote biased language, often to\nrebuke them. Manual analysis of the models\u2019 pre-\ndictions have indicated that the models can\u2019t dif-\nferentiate between reported and expressed content.\nThis results in false positives for texts reporting on\nhate speech/hyperpartisanship.\nTargets: LSI have helped us in identifying demo-\ngraphic bias in the hyperpartisan dataset. The re-\nsults demonstrated a bias towards American con-\ntext, i.e. the dominance of political terms from\nUS elections. In the hate speech dataset, most ofthe data samples focused on explicit Islamopho-\nbic remarks and sexist language against women.\nAs a result, the models trained on these datasets\ncouldn\u2019t generalise well to other demographies\n(e.g. UK politics) and other targets of hate\nspeech (e.g. LGBT community). Furthermore,\nLSI showed frequent co-occurrences of sexist and\nprofane language in the same contexts. In the\nhyperpartisanship dataset, we have found a co-\noccurrence of token Trump with fraud and Mus-\nlims in as many as 10% of the clusters, which sug-\ngests a lack of diversity in the training data.\nOver\ufb01tting: LIME results have indicated over-\n\ufb01tting of both hate speech and hyperpartisanship\nmodels. Bias towards certain words like muslims,\ngirl, Trump, conservatives, etc. always resulted\ninto a positive class prediction.\n5 Discussion\nTo account for the difference between expressing\nand reporting hateful/hyperpartisan content, we\nincluded a quote detection feature as a \ufb01lter in our\nmodels1as a result of which we could differenti-\nate between expressed politically bias2and a fact-\ncheck analysis of the same incident.3\nTo counter the geographical bias, we have\nstarted collecting hyperpartisan data from English\nnews outlets around the world. For hate speech,\nwe gathered anti-semitic comments, hateful sam-\nples against LGBT community and black people.\nFinally, we have transformed the insights from\nthe above analyses into information suitable for\nnon-experts, providing transparency to users,\nclients and the general public.

Just as with\nNELA-GT-2018 (N\u00f8rregaard, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2019) and\nNELA-GT-2019 , these sources come from a wide range of\nmainstream news sources and alternative news sources. In-\ncluded in the dataset are source-level ground truth labels from\nMedia Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) covering multiple dimen-\nsions of veracity. Additionally, new in the 2020 dataset are\nthe Tweets embedded in the collected news articles, adding an\nextra layer of information to the data. The NELA-GT-2020\ndataset can be found at: https://doi.org/10.7910/\nDVN/CHMUYZ .\n1 Introduction\nThe study of news production behavior of both high ve-\nracity and low veracity outlets continues to be a salient re-\nsearch topic. One of the continued challenges in this inter-\ndisciplinary research area is having broadly labeled datasets\nover extended periods of time. For example, mixed-methods\nwork on a variety of news-related research questions re-\nquire data surrounding speci\ufb01c events (An and Gower 2009;\nHorne et al. 2020), which are often dif\ufb01cult to get post-event.\nAnother example is machine learning research, which re-\nquires large, diverse, labeled datasets to train and test mod-\nels (Baly et al. 2018; Baly et al. 2020; Horne, N\u00f8rregaard,\nand Adali 2019b).\nThere has been numerous efforts to collect news arti-\ncle data to \ufb01ll this need. These include the previous ver-\nsions of the NELA dataset (Gruppi, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2020;\nN\u00f8rregaard, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2019; Horne, Khedr, and\nAdal\u0131 2018), the FA-KES dataset (Salem et al. 2019), and\nthe Golbeck et al. dataset (Golbeck et al. 2018). The vast\nmajority of datasets focused on information veracity have\nbeen social media posts rather than news articles, including\ndatasets such as the FakeNewsNet dataset (Shu et al. 2018),\nand the LIAR dataset (Wang 2017).\nMore recently, there has been a signi\ufb01cant effort in creat-\ning COVID-19 information datasets, both for news articles\nData at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CHMUYZand social media posts. Some of these datasets have verac-\nity labels, others do not. For example, (Shahi and Nandini\n2020) created a news article dataset with fact-check labels,\n(Patwa et al. 2020) manually annotated a set of social media\nposts and articles, and (Memon and Carley 2020) created an\nannotated set of Tweets focused on COVID-19.\nIn this paper, we present the latest version of the NELA-\nGT datasets, NELA-GT-2020 .NELA-GT-2020 \ufb01lls both\nneeds described above, as it contains labeled news sources\nthat covered a broad set of events, including the COVID-\n19 pandemic and the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. More\nprecisely, we have collected 1,779,127 news articles from\n519 sources between January 1st, 2020 and December\n31st, 2020 . Additionally, we include source-level veracity\nlabels from Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) and embedded\nTweets found in the news articles.\nIn this short paper, we describe the differences be-\ntween the previous versions of the NELA-GT datasets and\nNELA-GT-2020 . We also describe in detail the data col-\nlection method, ground truth collection method, embedded\ntweet collection, and publicly available data formats. Lastly,\nwe provide some metadata and a discussion of potential use\ncases.\n2 What\u2019s New in NELA-GT-2020?\nIn addition to the updated time frame, there are several new\nadditions to NELA-GT-2020 :\n1.More data : The NELA-GT-2020 dataset contains\n1,779,127 news articles from 519 sources published in the\nyear 2020, up from 261 sources in NELA-GT-2019 . The\nsources added to the collection are mostly fringe, unreli-\nable news outlets. Moreover, past versions of the NELA\ndataset focused on political news content. This time we\nhave expanded our news collection to a broader range of\ntopics, by collecting health-related news articles as well\nas general news feeds provided by the sources.\n2.Embedded Tweets : A new piece of information avail-\nable in NELA-GT-2020 are the embedded tweets. These\nconsist of tweets featured in news articles. We provide\nthe tweet content, author, date, and URL. We collected\n410,432 embedded tweets across all of the news articles.\n3.Ground Truth change : In the 2020 dataset, we aggre-\ngated the ground truth information as provided by MediaarXiv:2102.04567v1  [cs.CY]  8 Feb 2021\nBias Fact Check (MBFC). Concretely, we assigned relia-\nbility labels to news sources based on MBFC\u2019s Factuality\nScore. The labels are one of unreliable ,mixed , orreliable .\n3 Data Collection\nThe data collection process follows what was described\nin (N\u00f8rregaard, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2019). Speci\ufb01cally, we\nscraped the RSS feeds of each source in our source collec-\ntion list twice a day starting on 01/01/2020 using the Python\nlibraries feedparser and goose. Our list of sources to collect\nwas carried over from (N\u00f8rregaard, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2019),\nwith an additional 258 sources added to this list. These ad-\nditional sources are mostly conspiracy-driven and pseudo-\nscience media sites from the Media Bias Fact Check list1.\nJust as in the 2018 and 2019 versions, these sources come\nfrom a variety of countries (or the country of origin is not\nknown), but are all articles are in English.\n3.1 Data outage\nDespite having signi\ufb01cantly improved the robustness\nof our collection in comparison to previous years,\nNELA-GT-2020 suffered from data outage during a few\nweeks due to technical issues. Speci\ufb01cally, our collection is\nmissing articles in weeks 13, 14, and 15, which corresponds\nto the the period within March 25ththrough April 8th. Us-\ning linear interpolation on the data, we estimate that approx-\nimately 15,000 articles across this period were missed, this\naccounts for 0.8% of the dataset. Figure 1 shows the col-\nlection activity in each week. The estimated missing data is\nshown as a gray shaded area.\n4 Format of Data\nJust as in NELA-GT-2019, the dataset has been released in\ntwo formats: (1) a SQLite database, (2) a JSON dictionary\nper news source. Details about the structure of each of these\nformats is below. We provide Python code to read both data\nformats at: https://github.com/MELALab/nela-\ngt.\n4.1 SQLite Database Format\nThe SQLite 3 database schema consists of twi tables:\nnewsdata andtweet . The newsdata table contains, in\neach row, data about an article. Column idis set as primary\nkey to avoid duplicated entries on the database. We normal-\nized source names by converting them to lower case, and\nremoving spaces, punctuation, and hyphens. For example,\nthe source The New York Times appears as thenewyorktimes ,\nTables 1 and 2 give information about data columns.\n4.2 JSON Format\nWe also provide the dataset in JSON format. Speci\ufb01cally,\neach source has one JSON \ufb01le containing the list of all of its\narticles. The \ufb01elds follow the same structure of the database\ncolumns (Tables 1 and 2).\n1https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/4.3 Ground Truth Data Format\nJust as in NELA-GT-2019 and NELA-GT-2018 ,\nwe include multiple types of source-level labels. In\nNELA-GT-2020 , we collect source-level labels from\nMedia Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) that contain the following\ndimensions of veracity:\n1. Media Bias Fact Check factuality score - on a scale from\n0 to 5 (low to high credibility).\n2. Media Bias Fact Check Conspiracy/Pseudoscience and\nquestionable sources - low credibility if a source belongs\nto these categories.\nUnlike previous versions of this dataset, we only in-\nclude veracity labels from MBFC. We choose to only in-\nclude these veracity labels for several reasons: 1. From our\nknowledge, MBFC is the most complete and most updated\nset of source-level veracity labels that are openly avail-\nable. 2. Other external rating services, such as NewsGuard\n(www.newsguardtech.com/ ), are not freely available.\nWe encourage researchers to corroborate the ratings from\nMBFC with other journalistic services if they are available.\n5 Use Cases\n5.1 COVID-19\nOne salient use case for this dataset is the study of COVID-\n19 media coverage. We provide a subset of the database that\nincludes only COVID-19 related articles. This subset was\ngenerated via a simple keyword search on article title and\nbody text. If an article had one or more keywords from our\nset featured in the title or body text, it was included in the\nCOVID-19 subset. Figure 3a shows the number of news sto-\nries related to COVID-19 compared to all articles collected\nin each week of 2020.\n5.2 2020 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother salient use case for this dataset, is the study of nar-\nratives and coverage surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential\nElection. Using another simple keyword search on the arti-\ncle title and body text, we provide a subset of the database\nthat only includes 2020 U.S. Election related articles. We ob-\nserved that a total of 294,504 articles contained at least one\nelection-related term, across 403 sources. Figure 3b shows\nthe distribution of election-related articles in each week of\n2020.\n5.3 Embedded Tweets\nEmbedded tweets are tweets that news publishers decided\nto incorporate in their articles. A tweet may be the motiva-\ntion of a news story, or used as evidence in the story, or may\nbe itself the topic of the news story. We collected embed-\nded tweets on the article page using the Goose3 library2.\nThe raw HTML code of the embedded tweet is stored in the\ndatabase table tweet , along with the id of the article from\nwhich it was collected.\nIn total, our dataset contains over 400,000 embedded\ntweets collected from the news articles. A single article\n2https://github.com/grangier/python-goose\nreliable\nmixedunreliable unlabeled Missing data\n0 4 812 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52\nWeek050001000015000200002500030000Articles(a) Number of articles per reliability class.\n0 4 812 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52\nWeek0200040006000800010000120001400016000Embedded Tweets (b) Number of embedded tweets per reliability class.\n0 4 812 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52\nWeek05000100001500020000Articles\n(c) Number of articles per MBFC factuality score.\n0 4 812 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52\nWeek020004000600080001000012000Embedded Tweets (d) Number of embedded tweets per MBFC factuality score.\nvery-low\nlowmixed\nhighvery-high\nunlabeledMissing data\nFigure 1: Number of articles (a, c) and embedded tweets (b, d) collected during each week of 2020.\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140\nSourcesreliablemixedunreliableunlabeled\n(a) Number of sources per reliability class.\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140\nSourcesvery-lowlowmixedhighvery-highunlabeled (b) Number of sources per MBFC factuality score.\nFigure 2: Distribution of sources per reliability class (a) and factuality (b) score.\nColumn Type Description\nid text (primary key) Article identi\ufb01er.\ndate text Publication date string in YYYY-MM-DD format.\nsource text Name of the source from which the article was collected.\ntitle text Headline of the article.\ncontent text Body text of the article.\nauthor text Author of the article (if available).\npublished text Publication date time string as provided by source (inconsistent formatting).\npublished utc integer Publication time as unix time stamp.\ncollection utc integer Collection time as unix time stamp.\nurl Text URL of the article.\nTable 1: Structure of NELA-GT-2020 article data.

This may be used\nto construct a structured network of articles and tweets,\nwhich might prove, along with other signals, to be helpful in\nidentifying signals of source reliability (Horne, N\u00f8rregaard,\nand Adal\u0131 2019a; Rozemberczki, Allen, and Sarkar 2019;\nGruppi, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2021; Starbird et al. 2018).\n5.4 Long-Term Use Cases\nJust as discussed in (Gruppi, Horne, and Adal\u0131 2020), one\nof our goals with the continued release of the NELA-GT\ndatasets is to support long-term news research. When com-\nbining all of the NELA datasets, we provide over 3.5 years\nof news data. There are multiple research avenues that this\ndata, both in part and as a whole, supports:\n\u2022 Robust machine learning: A signi\ufb01cant amount of work\nhas been done in automated news veracity detection. This\ndataset allows for continued work in this area, particu-\nlarly in robustness checks of current work. These robust-\nness checks include examining prediction accuracy over\ntime, over events, and over mixed veracity labels. Ad-\nditionally, a wide variety of methods outside of super-\nvised machine learning can be tested on this dataset, such\nas semi-supervised news veracity detection and unsuper-\nvised news veracity detection.\n\u2022 Exploring event-driven dynamics of and narratives in\nnews media: Quantitative and qualitative analyses of nar-\nrative themes before, during, and after major events con-\ntinues to be a useful methodology in interdisciplinary me-\ndia studies. This dataset supports these works by main-\ntaining consistent data collection across events.\n\u2022 Examining media manipulation: Using the veracity labels\nin this dataset, research can examine tactics used by pur-\nposely false news outlets. Additionally, with knowledge\nof media manipulation campaigns, such as those outlinedin the Media Manipulation Casebook3, researchers can\nexamine how media manipulation is spread through ma-\nlicious news outlets. While there has been a substantial\nfocus on \u201cfake news\u201d detection methods by researchers,\nthere continues to be room in understanding and char-\nacterizing media manipulation and disinformation cam-\npaign tactics.\n6 Conclusion\nWith several highly controversial events, such as the many\nrumors about the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. pres-\nidential elections, 2020 was a year with plenty of oppor-\ntunities for better understanding misinformation and for\nthe development of misinformation \ufb01ghting tools. We pre-\nsented NELA-GT-2020 , a large scale dataset of news ar-\nticles in English with source-level reliability labels. This\ndataset features several improvements on its predecessors\nNELA-GT-2019 andNELA-GT-2018 . First, it utilizes a\nmore robust scraper, which is less susceptible to failures\nand sporadic data outages. The collection activity shows a\nmuch more smooth trajectory, as seen in Figure 1, with no\ndips apart from the reported data outage in late March/early\nApril. Furthermore, NELA-GT-2020 introduces a novel\nfeature to the collection: embedded tweets. We believe that\nthis additional piece of information may be useful in mod-\neling relationships between news articles and/or sources, as\nwell as better understanding the relationship between news\nmedia and social media. The dataset is available in SQLite\nand JSON formats, minimal working examples can be found\nin our code repository.\nReferences\n[An and Gower 2009] An, S.-K., and Gower, K.

This has changed the dynamics of po-\nlitical communication that were previously dominated by traditional corporate news media.\nHaving hundreds of millions of tweets collected over the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential\nelections gave us a unique opportunity to measure the change in polarization and the dif-\nfusion of political information. We analyze the diffusion of political information among\nTwitter users and investigate the change of polarization between these elections and how\nthis change affected the composition and polarization of in\ufb02uencers and their retweeters.\nWe identify \u201cin\ufb02uencers\u201d by their ability to spread information and classify them into those\naf\ufb01liated with a media organization, a political organization, or unaf\ufb01liated. Most of the\ntop in\ufb02uencers were af\ufb01liated with media organizations during both elections. We found\na clear increase from 2016 to 2020 in polarization among in\ufb02uencers and among those\nwhom they in\ufb02uence. Moreover, 75% of the top in\ufb02uencers in 2020 were not present in\n2016, demonstrating that such status is dif\ufb01cult to retain. Between 2016 and 2020, 10%\n1arXiv:2111.02505v1  [cs.SI]  3 Nov 2021\nof in\ufb02uencers af\ufb01liated with media were replaced by center- or right-orientated in\ufb02uencers\naf\ufb01liated with political organizations and unaf\ufb01liated in\ufb02uencers.\nIntroduction\nA growing number of studies have documented increasing political polarization in the U.S. that\nis deeper than at any time since the American Civil War [1, 2, 3]. Partisan division over issues\nhas increased among those af\ufb01liated with political and news media organizations \u2013 elected rep-\nresentatives, party of\ufb01cials, and political pundits \u2013 alongside an alarming increase in affective\npolarization among voters. This two-level pattern \u2013 issue polarization among political elites\nand affective polarization among voters \u2013 invites further research on the diffusion of polarized\npolitical information between those in positions of political in\ufb02uence and the larger population.\nThis diffusion of political information is dif\ufb01cult to track with traditional survey and roll\ncall voting data that lack relational measures. Increasing reliance on social media for political\ncommunication is opening up unprecedented opportunities to study the diffusion of political in-\nformation and misinformation [4] over communication networks [5]. Our study leverages social\nmedia data from Twitter to better understand the diffusion dynamics of news media information\nduring the two most recent U.S. election cycles.\nTwitter users are embedded in relatively stable communication networks created by the\nexchange of \u201cretweets.\u201d A 2015 study by Metaxas et al. [6] found that \u201cretweeting indicates\nnot only interest in a message, but also trust in the message and the originator, and agreement\nwith the message contents.\u201d The content of retweets makes it possible to identify information\nthat is highly biased, as well as the ideological direction of the bias. Using retweet data we\nalso can identify \u201cin\ufb02uencers\u201d who are the users with the greatest ability to broadly propagate\nnew information over the retweet network. Typically, in\ufb02uencer tweets are highly likely to\nbe retweeted, not only by their followers, but also by their followers\u2019 followers, and so on.\nWe classify Twitter in\ufb02uencers into two categories. The \ufb01rst includes the \u201caf\ufb01liated\u201d who are\nassociated with media or political organizations, and the other consists of the \u201cunaf\ufb01liated\u201d who\ndo not have such associations, so most likely represent themselves or informal groups.\nOur study also aims to better understand how polarization unfolds on social media. To clar-\nify, political scientists distinguish multiple types and levels of polarization [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]:\npolicy polarization (extreme differences of opinion on highly salient issues), partisan polariza-\ntion (alignment of opinions with opposing political parties), ideological polarization (alignment\nof opinions with liberal vs. conservative world views), and geographic polarization (regional\nalignment of opinions, e.g., \u201cred state/blue state\u201d). Each of these four types of polarization\ncan in turn be classi\ufb01ed by level: elite polarization among political of\ufb01cials and pundits, me-\ndia polarization among news organizations, and polarization among the underlying popula-\ntion as usually measured by exit polls and opinion surveys. In this paper, we use data from\nsocial media to study ideological polarization among the political elite, news organizations,\nand Twitter users more broadly. Over the past decade, the rapid growth of Twitter, Face-\n2\nbook, Reddit and other social media have transformed the communications and information\npropagation landscape. Alongside traditional broadcast media and face-to-face communica-\ntion, people now have the ability to search for and exchange information with billions of other\nusers in a global network. Recent studies have examined the impact of new technologies like\nTwitter and YouTube on election outcomes [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], includ-\ning the effects of disinformation [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Other studies have documented\nhow social media platforms contribute to polarization through the creation of echo cham-\nbers [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. In contrast, our study focuses on the diffusion\nof news media information between in\ufb02uencers and those whom they in\ufb02uence, as well as the\nchange in composition, popularity, and polarization among in\ufb02uencers and their retweeters in\nthe months leading up to the 2016 to 2020 U.S. presidential elections.\nTo maintain the consistency between the results from 2016 and 2020 elections, we follow\nthe methodology of Ref. [25] to identify and classify the in\ufb02uences and their retweeters in the\n2020 U.S. election data. We classify tweets containing a link to a news outlet into several\nnews media categories corresponding to their different political orientations. We observe that\nthe volume of tweets and users with a center orientation decreased from the 2016 election to\nthe 2020 election. For each news media category, we reconstruct the corresponding retweet\nnetwork and identify the most important news media in\ufb02uencers of the category by \ufb01nding\nthe most important nodes in terms of their ability to spread information in the network. The\ntop 25 in\ufb02uencers in each news media category are then classi\ufb01ed as af\ufb01liated with a media\nor with a political organization or unaf\ufb01liated. We \ufb01nd that the proportion of top in\ufb02uencers\naf\ufb01liated with news media organizations decreased in 2020, while the proportion who were\npolitically linked increased. This may indicate a shift in the sources of in\ufb02uence over political\nagenda setting. Simultaneously, the proportion of media af\ufb01liated in\ufb02uencers increased in 2020\nin the categories containing disinformation, indicating a shift in the sources of disinformation\nfrom informal to formal organizations. Finally, we measure the strength of the polarization\nof the in\ufb02uencers and of their retweeters, de\ufb01ned as the level of separation of the in\ufb02uencers\u2019\nretweeters in two opposite clusters and \ufb01nd a clear, signi\ufb01cant increase of the polarization from\n2016 to 2020.\nResults\nNews media on Twitter in 2016 and 2020\nWe tracked the spread of political news on Twitter in 2016 and 2020 by analyzing two datasets\ncontaining tweets posted between June 1stand election day (November 8thin 2016 and Novem-\nber2ndin 2020). The data were collected continuously using the Twitter Search API with the\nnames of the two presidential candidates in each of the presidential elections in 2016 and 2020\nas keywords. (Had we used more keywords targeting speci\ufb01c media outlets or hashtags con-\ncerning speci\ufb01c news events we would risk missing election-related tweets that did not contain\n3\nreferences to the list of outlets or events.) The 2016 dataset contains 171 million tweets sent\nby 11 million users and was used in Refs. [17, 25] to assess the in\ufb02uence of disinformation on\nTwitter in 2016. The 2020 dataset contains 702 million tweets sent by 20 million users. Hence,\nwe observe a signi\ufb01cant increase in Twitter involvement in distributing election polarization,\nsince in four years the number of Twitter users nearly double and number of tweets per user\nmore than double, increasing the total number of tweets more than fourfold.\nThe classi\ufb01cations of news media websites presented below and used in this paper, including\n\u201cfake\u201d, \u201cextremely biased\u201d, \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and especially the boundaries between categories,\nare a matter of opinion, rather than a statement of fact. The categorizations and labels as-\nsigned to the corresponding classes used here originated in publicly available datasets from\nfact-checking and bias rating organizations credited below. The political views and conclusions\ncontained in this article should not be interpreted as representing those of the authors or their\nfunders.\nFor each tweet containing a URL link, we extracted the domain name of the URL (e.g.\nwww.cnn.com ) and classi\ufb01ed each link directing to a news media outlet according to this\noutlet\u2019s political bias. The 2016 and 2020 classi\ufb01cations rely on the website allsides.com\n(AS), followed by the bias classi\ufb01cation from mediabiasfactcheck.com (MBFC) for\noutlets not present in AS (both taken as of January 7 2021 for the 2020 classi\ufb01cation). We\nclassi\ufb01ed URL links in \ufb01ve news media categories for outlets that mostly conform to profes-\nsional standards of fact-based journalism: right ,right-leaning ,center ,left-leaning andleft. We\nalso include three additional news media categories to include outlets that tend to disseminate\ndisinformation: extreme-right bias ,extreme-left bias andfake news . Websites in the fake news\ncategory have been \ufb02agged by fact-checking organizations as spreading fabricated news or con-\nspiracy theories, while websites in the extremely biased category have been \ufb02agged for report-\ning controversial information that distorts facts and may rely on propaganda, decontextualized\ninformation, or opinions misrepresented as facts. A detailed explanation of the methodologies\nused by AS and MBFC for rating news outlets and of the differences in classi\ufb01cation between\n2016 and 2020 is given in the Methods section. The full lists of outlets in each category in 2016\nand 2020 are given in SM Tabs. S1 and S2. In the 2016 dataset, 30.7 million tweets, sent by 2.3\nmillion users, contain a URL directed to a media outlet website. The 2020 dataset contained\n72.7 million tweets with news links sent by 3.7 million users. This number reveals remarkable\ndrop of fraction of \ufb02ow of tweets from users associated with media form 18% in 2016 to 10%\nso nearly half lower. This came from mainly from smaller growth of productivity of media\naf\ufb01liated users.\nThe fractions of tweets and users who sent a tweet in each of the news media categories\nare shown in Fig. 1 A and B (the numbers are reported in SM Tab. S3) along with other\nstatistics about the activity of users in each category. Between 2016 and 2020, these fractions\ndecreased most in the center category and increased most in the left-leaning category, with a\nsmaller increase in the fractions in the right-leaning category. The shift away from the center\nmay indicate the increasing polarization, both among users as well as media outlets.

Distribution of news media links in 2016 and 2020, by news media category. Panels\nA and B show the fractions of tweets and users that sent tweets with a URL pointing to a website\nbelonging to one of the categories. Users are classi\ufb01ed in the category in which they posted the\nmost links. For the users that have at least two links classi\ufb01ed, panels C and D report the fraction\nof links across categories as a function of the users\u2019 main categories.\nwhich was categorized by AS as center in 2016 and as left-leaning in 2020, combined with\nCNN accumulating more than twice the number of tweets in 2020 than the top outlet of the\ncenter category ( thehill.com ) (SM Tab. S2).\nThe fraction of tweets in the fake and extremely biased category, representing outlets that\nwere most susceptible to sharing disinformation, decreased from 10% to 6% for fake news and\nfrom 13% to 6% for extremely right-bias news. The number of users who shared those tweets\nalso decreased for extremely right-biased news (from 6% to 3%) but not for fake news (which\nremained at 3%) (SM Tab. S3). The fraction of tweets in the extremely-left bias category is\nvery small (2% in 2016 and even less, 0.05% in 2020).\nFig. 1 C and D shows the fraction of URLs across categories as a function of a user\u2019s\nmodal category for users that posted at least two links in our datasets. The analysis reveals\ntwo clusters in 2016 and 2020, one with categories from the right and fake news (fake news,\nextreme-right bias news, right news and right-leaning news) and the second one with categories\nfrom the center and left (center news, left-leaning news, left news, extreme-left bias news).\nThese two clusters can be interpreted as two echo chambers. Asymmetrical patterns in Fig. 1\nC and D reveal that users in the right wing echo chamber also link to a very limited number of\nleft wing media outlets, but that the opposite relation does not occur. This is consistent with\nasymmetry between left-leaning and right-leaning users in social media observed in previous\nstudies [38, 25, 39].\nIn order to estimate the volume of tweets sent from automated accounts such as bots, we\ncounted the number of tweets sent from unof\ufb01cial Twitter clients, e.g., Twitter clients other\nthan the Twitter Web client, Android client, IPhone client or other of\ufb01cial clients. Unof\ufb01cial\nTwitter clients include a variety of different applications used to automate all or part of an\naccount activity, such as third party applications used typically by brands and professionals\n(e.g. SocialFlow or Hootsuite) or bots created with malicious intentions [17].\nThe overall fraction of tweets sent from unof\ufb01cial clients was 8% in 2016 and 1% in 2020.\n5\nA similar drop over the same period was observed in the average activity of these users (see\nSM Tab. S3). This decrease could be attributed in part to measures taken by Twitter to limit\nthe virality of disinformation. Our results show that while the relative volume of tweets linking\nto disinformation websites dropped approximately by a half in 2020 compared to 2016, the\nfraction of users sharing fake news decreased signi\ufb01cantly (Fig. 1 A and B and Tab. S3).\nFig. 2. Shifts of users across news media categories from 2016 to 2020. The size of each\ncategory in 2016 corresponds to the number of unique users in the category in 2016 (Fig. 1).\nThe shift from one category to another is proportional to the fraction of users that were classi\ufb01ed\nin 2016 and in 2020 in the two respective categories.\nTo understand how users shifted between categories from 2016 to 2020, we track users that\nare present in both election datasets and in both years are classi\ufb01ed into the category in which\nthey posted the most tweets in each year. Fig. 2 shows the resulting shifts. The two largest\nof them are of users that were in the center and left news category in 2016 and shifted to the\nleft-leaning category in 2020. This re\ufb02ects the consolidation of the left-leaning category as the\nlargest in 2020, with the three most widely shared outlets: New York Times ,Washington Post\nandCNN (SM Tab. S2). We also observe a large fraction of users in the fake and extremely\nbiased news category in 2016 that moved to the right news category in 2020. However, these\nuser shifts also re\ufb02ect the change in the classi\ufb01cation of media outlets from 2016 to 2020. We\ninfer the ideological position of Twitter users without relying on the news outlet classi\ufb01cation\n6\nin section , and show that the resulting positions are highly correlated with the user positions\ncomputed using the news categories in which they posted.\nInstead, we use directed edges to track the \ufb02ow of the information contained in the tweet\nfrom the node that originated the information to those who retweet it.\nNews media in\ufb02uencers\nTo capture the dynamics of information diffusion, we reconstruct retweet networks correspond-\ning to each news media category. We add a link, or directed edge, going from node vto node\nuin the news network when user uretweets the tweet of user vthat contains a URL linking to\na website belonging to one of the news media categories. With this convention, the direction\nof the link represents the direction of the in\ufb02uence between Twitter users. We do not include\nmultiple links with the same direction between the same two users or self-links (when a user\nretweets their own tweets). The in-degree of a node is the number of links that point inward to\nthe node and its out-degree is the number of links that originate at a node and point outward to\nother nodes. With our convention, the in-degree of a user is equal to the number of users they\nretweeted at least once and their out-degree is the number of users who have retweeted them at\nleast once. The higher a node\u2019s out-degree, the greater its local in\ufb02uence. The characteristics of\nthe retweet networks are given in SM Tab. S4.\nIn each retweet network, we use the Collective In\ufb02uence (CI) algorithm [40] to \ufb01nd the\nbest spreaders of information, i.e. the in\ufb02uencers of the corresponding news media category.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, the CI algorithm \ufb01nds the minimal set of nodes that can collectively reach the\nentire network when information diffuses according to a linear threshold model. The CI algo-\nrithm considers in\ufb02uence as an emergent collective property, not as a local property such as\nthe node\u2019s out-degree. It does this by \ufb01nding the smallest set of nodes needed for global cas-\ncades. Accordingly, the CI algorithm is able to rank super-spreaders of information in social\nnetworks [41, 42, 25].\nHere, we use a directed version of the algorithm to identify the super-spreaders of informa-\ntion as the nodes with the highest CI outto be able to compare results from both elections [25].\nThe 2016 in\ufb02uencers\u2019 rankings are shown in the upper panel in Fig. 3 for the top \ufb01ve in\ufb02uencers,\nand in SM Tab. S5 for the top 25 in\ufb02uencers. Analysis of these results reveals that traditional\nnews in\ufb02uencers were mostly journalists with veri\ufb01ed Twitter accounts linked to traditional\nnews media outlets. In contrast, fake and extremely biased news are sent mainly by in\ufb02uencers\nwhose accounts are unveri\ufb01ed or deleted, with deceptive pro\ufb01les and much shorter life-span on\nTwitter than traditional media in\ufb02uencers. However, some of these in\ufb02uencers, despite their\nunknown, non-public nature, still played a major role in the diffusion of disinformation and\ninformation on Twitter [25].\nThe results from analysis of 2020 data are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. For in\ufb02u-\nencers that persisted from 2016, their previous position in 2016 is listed in purple parentheses\n(see also SM, Tab. S6). Those in\ufb02uencers are often highly ranked in both the 2016 and the 2020\nanalyses. Among the union of top 100 in\ufb02uencers from each category in 2020 (representing 598\n7\n20202016Fig. 3. Retweet networks formed by the top 30 in\ufb02uencers within each media category,\nby year. The 2016 network (upper panel) was generated from 2016 data using the same algo-\nrithm as used in [25] but with different parameters to ease its comparison with the bottom panel\ngenerated from 2020 data. The arrows show the directions of links between users, from the\nsource of in\ufb02uence (the original poster) to the recipient (the retweeter). The size of a node is\nproportional to its out-degree in the complete combined network, i.e., the number of different\nusers that have retweeted the node at least once with a URL directing to a media outlet. The\ncolor of a node indicates the news media category with which the node is af\ufb01liated. Nodes\nranked in the top 30 of multiple categories are represented by pie charts where the size of each\nslice is proportional to their CI outranking (i.e. the node\u2019s collective in\ufb02uence). Both networks\nare visualized using a force-directed graph layout. The tables on either side of the networks\nshow the top \ufb01ve users in each news media category. The number in green to the left of each\nuser is their unique index, used to label the user\u2019s node in the network. Users ranked in the top\n30 for multiple news media categories have colored superscripts, indicating the rank and media\nclassi\ufb01cation of their other top \ufb01ve positions. Veri\ufb01ed users are indicated by a checkmark /check. In\nthe 2020 tables, a user\u2019s 2016 rank is displayed with the purple number to the left of their 2020\nrank. Three usernames in the top 10 changed between 2016 and 2020: @DRUDGE REPORT be-\ncame @NEWS MAKER ,@HuffingtonPost became @HuffPost , and @TruthFeedNews\nbecame @TAftermath2020 . Those users will have their new handle displayed in the 2016\ntables for consistency (as well as in Figs. 5 and 6).\n8\nunique users) 150 were already in the top 100 of one category in 2016. Yet, this means that 75%\nof the top 100 in\ufb02uencers in 2020 are new to such high ranking.\nThe CI algorithm operates on the unweighted retweet networks. To verify that a ranking\ncomputed on the weighted networks would not produce signi\ufb01cantly different results, we com-\npare the CI ranking with the ranking obtained from the PageRank algorithm applied to the\nweighted networks. The comparison reveals a strong agreement, especially for highly-ranked\nusers (SM Fig. S1).\nFig. 3 shows the retweet networks for each news media category in 2016 and 2020, among\ncommunities formed by the union of the top 30 in\ufb02uencers for each category. The two force\ndirected network layouts are computed using the same parameters and show two main clusters,\nwith the right-biased and fake news in\ufb02uencers in one cluster and the left-biased in\ufb02uencers\nin the other. The increased separation in 2020 is notable. In 2016 the center in\ufb02uencers are\nmostly between the two clusters; in 2020 the separation between the two clusters increased and\nonly a few in\ufb02uencers remain within a central position (e.g. @thehill ). We quantify the\npolarization of the full set of top 100 in\ufb02uencers and of their retweeters, using all the retweets\nbetween them, in detail in the next section.\nFake and extremely biased news are sent mostly by in\ufb02uencers whose accounts are unveri-\n\ufb01ed or deleted, with fake news seeing a signi\ufb01cant increase in deleted in\ufb02uencer accounts from\ntwo in the top 25 in 2016 to eight in 2020 (see SM Tabs. S5 and S6). Conversely, the extreme\nright-biased news in 2020 consisted primarily of veri\ufb01ed in\ufb02uencers that grew from 15 veri\ufb01ed\nin the top 25 in 2016 to 23 in 2020.\nUsing a manual labeling process (see Methods), we classify the top 25 in\ufb02uencers of each\nnews media category for 2016 and 2020 as af\ufb01liated with media or political organizations, or\nunaf\ufb01liated, in order to observe the makeup of in\ufb02uencer types for these categories. An in\ufb02u-\nencer af\ufb01liated with a media organization could be a media company or of\ufb01cial media outlet\n(e.g. @FoxNews ), or a writer, reporter, consultant, or other individual who has directly cor-\nresponded with a media outlet in an of\ufb01cially recognized capacity (e.g. @joelpollak ). An\nin\ufb02uencer af\ufb01liated with a political party could be a politician (e.g. @JoeBiden ), a political\ncampaign platform or an af\ufb01liate of the platform, or someone who of\ufb01cially represents an as-\npect of U.S. politics (e.g. @joncoopertweets ). We also split the unaf\ufb01liated category into\ntwo subcategories: independent and \u201cother.\u201d An independent in\ufb02uencer is an in\ufb02uencer not\nof\ufb01cially af\ufb01liated with any media or political platforms (e.g. @amberofmanyhats ). The\n\u201cother\u201d category represents in\ufb02uencers whose accounts have no descriptions or context that\ncould be used to identify them.\nThe fractions of in\ufb02uencers in these categories are shown in Fig. 4. It reveals that unaf-\n\ufb01liated in\ufb02uencers are more common in the fake and extreme-bias categories, while af\ufb01liated\nin\ufb02uencers are more common in the other news categories. A similar trend is evident in the frac-\ntions of veri\ufb01ed and unveri\ufb01ed in\ufb02uencers found in these categories (SM Tab. S6), as fake and\nextreme-bias news categories generally contain fewer veri\ufb01ed in\ufb02uencers. In addition, media-\naf\ufb01liated in\ufb02uencers seem to have a greater presence in the left, left-leaning, and center news\ncategories compared to their counterparts. Interestingly, the number of media-af\ufb01liated in\ufb02u-\n9\nFig. 4. Reshuf\ufb02ing of distribution of the top 25 in\ufb02uencer types from 2016 to 2020, by news\nmedia category. In\ufb02uencers are classi\ufb01ed as af\ufb01liated with a media organization, political\norganization, independent, or other (e.g. unidenti\ufb01ed).\nencers within most of the categories actually decreases from 2016 to 2020. The exceptions are\nthe extreme-right bias and fake news categories, which actually increased in media-af\ufb01liated in-\n\ufb02uencers, while the extreme-right bias category also increased in politically-linked in\ufb02uencers.\nThis indicates a shift in polarization of in\ufb02uencers af\ufb01liated with right-biased political and me-\ndia organizations toward the extreme-right bias and fake news, as well as the emergence of new\nmedia-af\ufb01liated in\ufb02uencers in these categories. We discuss these changes in more detail below.\nIn addition to changes in user types and veri\ufb01ed users from 2016 to 2020, we observe a signif-\nicant reshuf\ufb02e of the ranking of in\ufb02uencers. Fig. 5 shows the change in rankings of the top 10\nin\ufb02uencers in left and left-leaning, right and right-leaning and extreme-right bias and fake news\ncategories. The ranking reshuf\ufb02e in the center news category is shown in SM Fig. S2.\nThe comparison reveals several interesting changes between 2016 and 2020. First, we\nsee that highly in\ufb02uential users rise from obscurity. Across all categories, a set of previ-\nously unranked or very low-ranked users break in to the top-10 rankings. These users in-\nclude, for example, @TeaPainUSA ,@svdate ,@kylegriffin1 ,@marklevinshow ,\n@DavidHarrisJr , etc. Considering all unique users in the top 25 in\ufb02uential users (across\nall categories of news media), we see that 58% came from outside the top 100 in\ufb02uential users\nin 2016. However, most of these newly in\ufb02uential users are related in some way to media or\npolitical organizations, while 28% of these new in\ufb02uencers are independent.\nObserving the change in rankings by news media category, we see that right/right-leaning\nand extreme-right bias/fake news categories have a signi\ufb01cantly higher fraction of top 10 in\ufb02u-\nencers who were previously outside the top 50, compared to the change in rankings among the\n10\nIcon Legend\nLinked to media organization\nLinked to political organization\nOtherIndependentRank 2016 User Rank 2020\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n12\n3119\nrank > 50Rank 2016 User Rank 2020\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n14\n19\n32\nrank > 50Rank 2016 User Rank 2020\nFoxNews\nWSJ\nrealDonaldTrump\nDailyCaller\nWashTimes\nRT_com\ndcexaminer\nNEWS_MAKER\nRT_America\nnypost\nFoxNewsInsider\nWSJPolitics\nDailyMail\nAllenWest\nKellyannePolls\nRealJamesWoods\nTeamTrump\nLouDobbs\nfoxandfriends\nDonaldJTrumpJr\nmarklevinshow\nEricTrump\nbrithume\nMZHemingway\nKimStrassel\nSaraCarterDC\nTrumpWarRoom\njsolomonReports1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n31\n37\nrank > 50\nPrisonPlanet\nrealDonaldTrump\nDailyCaller\nRealAlexJones\nBreitbartNews\nzerohedge\nNEWS_MAKER\nwikileaks\nmitchellvii\nseanhannity\nDailyMail\nWayneDupreeShow\nLindaSuhler\nTAftermath2020\nRealJamesWoods\nRickRWells\nLouDobbs\ngatewaypundit\nDonaldJTrumpJr\nJudicialWatch\nmarklevinshow\nThomas1774Paine\nTomFitton\njoelpollak\nRaheemKassam\ndbongino\nnewsmax\nOANN\nDavidJHarrisJr\ncatturd21\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n13\n16\n27\n37\nrank > 501\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n910\n13\n19273250\nrank > 50\nCNN\nHuffPost\nnytimes\nTIME\nwashingtonpost\nABC\npolitico\nthedailybeast\nCNNPolitics\nNBCNews\nRawStory\nHuffPostPol\nSlate\nNewYorker\nPolitiFact\nCBSNews\nMotherJones\nTPM\nvoxdotcom\nABCPolitics\nSalon\nezraklein\nthinkprogress\nMSNBC\nDavidCornDC\nNPR\nkylegriffin1\nNoahShachtman\nTeaPainUSA\nsvdate1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n14\n22\n25\n50\nrank > 50\nColor Legend\nCenter\nLeft Leaning\nLeft\nExtreme LeftExtreme Right\nRight\nRight LeaningFakeFig. 5. Change in in\ufb02uencers rankings from 2016 to 2020. In\ufb02uencers ranked in the top 10 in\nat least one news media category in 2016 or 2020 are shown. The 2016 rankings are displayed\nto the left of the username, with 2020 rankings on the right. For each user only one shift is\nshown. Its color changes from the user\u2019s highest ranked news media category in 2016 to such\ncolor for 2020. Each panel shows the change over time between two news media categories.\ngroups in left/left-leaning news categories. All categories show a large number of in\ufb02uencers\nfalling out of the top 50 from 2016 to 2020, and in the case of the left news in\ufb02uencers, we see\ntheir former positions \ufb01lled by users who were much less in\ufb02uential in 2016. The in\ufb02uencers\nwith extreme right bias and fake news af\ufb01liations show the most volatility with regards to re-\ntaining top-10 in\ufb02uencer positions, with many top-10 in\ufb02uencers in 2016 ranked below 50 in\n2020 (or were even banned from Twitter, like @RealAlexJones ).\nThe change of classi\ufb01cation of some news media outlets is also re\ufb02ected in the category\nshifts of their Twitter accounts. In particular, @CNN and@politico \u2013 previously the \ufb01rst and\nthird highest ranked in\ufb02uencers in the center category in 2016 \u2013 shifted to left-leaning. Such\nshifts of large and in\ufb02uential media in\ufb02uencers across news categories indicates the increased\ncontent polarization on Twitter. A shift of media-af\ufb01liated in\ufb02uencers from the right to the ex-\ntreme right is also visible (e.g. @DailyMail ,@JudicialWatch ,@marklevinshow ), as\n11\nwell as the emergence of new-media af\ufb01liated in\ufb02uencers in these categories (e.g. @newsmax ,\n@OANN or@RaheemKassam ). In contrast to the shift to the extremes among large media in-\n\ufb02uencers, the center rankings remained fairly consistent between 2016 and 2020 (SM Fig. S2).\nSome new users rose from low ranks to \ufb01ll in the gaps, including @JoeBiden , but only one\nuser dropped out of the top 50 entirely, and the remaining shifts are internal to these top-ranked\nusers.\nPolarization among Twitter users\nThe evolution of in\ufb02uencers across different news media categories (Figs. 1 and 2) suggests\nan increased polarization in the relations among in\ufb02uencers between 2016 and 2020. Here we\nbroaden the scope of polarization analysis to the Twitter users who are consuming and retweet-\ning the in\ufb02uencers\u2019 content. For the 2016 and 2020 data, we consider the union of the top 100\nin\ufb02uencers of each news media category as a single set representing the most in\ufb02uential users\ncovering the entire news media ideological spectrum for the target year. For this analysis we\nuse all the retweets in our datasets, not only those containing a link to a news outlet, and remove\nthe ones sent from unof\ufb01cial Twitter clients to capture only tweets sent by humans. Using these\nin\ufb02uencers as nodes, we create two fully connected similarity networks derived from the 2016\nand 2020 Twitter network, respectively. An edge between any two in\ufb02uencers in the created\nnetworks represents similarity of the number of retweets of these two in\ufb02uencers for every user\nin the corresponding Twitter network (see Methods for more details). In both similarity net-\nworks, a community detection algorithm found two communities. One contained in\ufb02uencers\naf\ufb01liated with news media in the center, left-leaning and left news categories, while the other\ncontained those af\ufb01liated with news media in the right-leaning, right and fake news categories.\nThis indicates that in\ufb02uencers separate their user bases according to the content they generate.\nWe illustrate this separation in SM Fig. S3 that shows a sample of the 2020 similarity network.\nTo quantify the difference in community separation and, subsequently, polarization, between\nthe two networks, we measured the modularity and normalized cut between communities (see\nMethods for details).\nThe modularity for the 2020 network was 0.39 with a standard error (SE) of 0.01, versus\n0.365 (SE = 0.007) in 2016, indicating more closely knit communities in 2020, with stronger\nin-community ties and weaker between-community ties. Consistent with the increase of com-\nmunity modularity, the average normalized cut of 0.36 (SE = 0.04) in 2016 decreased to 0.128\n(SE = 0.005) in 2020. To interpret this change, we note that on average, each node in the 2016\nsimilarity network had 64% of in-community edges and 36% of across-community edges. The\nlatter fraction decreased to 13% in 2020, dropping nearly three times lower than it was in 2016.\nThis indicates much stronger separation of these communities in the later election. We also\ncomputed the above metrics on networks generated from user quote similarity in order to show\nthat retweets are the strongest form of endorsement of in\ufb02uencer content, and subsequently the\nbest approach for our analysis (see SM Tab. S7).\nTo quantify and compare the polarization not only among Twitter in\ufb02uencers but also among\n12\nthe users, we infer the ideology of Twitter users based on the ideological alignment of political\nactors they follow [43, 32]. The bipartite network of followers is then projected on a one\ndimensional scale using correspondence analysis [44, 45], which applies a SVD decomposition\nof the adjacency matrix standardized to account for the differences in popularity and activity\nof the in\ufb02uencers and their followers (see Methods for details). Two users are close on the\nresulting latent ideology scale if they follow similar in\ufb02uencers. This method has been shown\nto produce ideological estimates of the members of the U.S. Congress highly correlated with\nideological estimates based on roll call voting similarity such as DW-NOMINATE [43].\nFor 2016 and 2020, the data for the analysis consists of the union of the top 100 in\ufb02uencers\nof each news media category and the sets of users that retweeted at least three different in\ufb02u-\nencers (considering all tweets in our datasets, not only the ones with URLs). Following the\n\ufb01nding in [6] that \u201cretweeting indicates not only interest in a message, but also trust in the mes-\nsage and the originator, and agreement with the message contents,\u201d we interpret retweeting a\nform of endorsement of the content being retweeted. Twitter offers other types of interactions\nallowing users to comment on the content, such as quote tweets and replies. The ratio of quotes\nto retweets of users to in\ufb02uencers was very stable and small ( <5%) in 2016 and 2020, for users\non the left and right sides of the latent ideology (SM Tab. S8A), which motivated our focus on\nretweets to infer the ideology of users. We note that the ratio of quotes to retweets from users of\none side of the ideology spectrum to in\ufb02uencers of the other side increased from 2016 to 2020,\nindicating an increased usage of quotes to comment on tweets from in\ufb02uencers of the opposite\nside. However, the overall usage of quotes over retweets remained small (SM Tab. S8B). We\nextract the coordinates of each user on the \ufb01rst dimension of the results of the correspondence\nanalysis applied to the weighted network of retweets between the users and the in\ufb02uencers (see\nMethods for the details and robustness checks that we performed). Finally, for 2016 and 2020,\nthe coordinates of all users are standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\nTwo users are close together on the latent ideology scale if they tend to retweet similar in\ufb02u-\nencers. The in\ufb02uencers\u2019 latent ideological positions are then computed as the median of their\nretweeters\u2019 positions.\nFig. 6 shows the result of this analysis. The latent ideology of the top \ufb01ve in\ufb02uencers of\neach category is shown as a box plot representing the distribution of the ideology of the users\nwho retweeted them. The distribution of ideology positions of the users and of the in\ufb02uencers,\ndisplayed in green and purple, respectively, shows that polarization increased between 2016 and\n2020. This is con\ufb01rmed by a Hartigans\u2019 dip test (HDT) for unimodality, which measures multi-\nmodality in a sample by the maximum difference, over all sample points, between the empirical\ndistribution function, and the unimodal distribution function that minimizes that maximum dif-\nference [46]. For the user distribution, the test statistics is D= 0.1086 (95% CI: [0.108,0.109])\nin 2016 and D= 0.1474 (95% CI: [0.1471,0.1477]) in 2020. For the in\ufb02uencer distribution, the\ntest statistics is D= 0.17(95% CI: [0.16,0.20]) in 2016 and D= 0.21(95% CI: [0.19,0.23]) in\n2020.

Pie charts next to the in\ufb02uencers\u2019 names represent the\nnews categories to which they belong (weighted by their respective CI ranks in each category).\ncreasingly deviate from a unimodal distribution, corroborating the growing division found in\nthe similarity networks.\nTo understand if the measured increase in polarization is due to the arrival of new users and\nin\ufb02uencers in 2020, we repeat this analysis including only users (shown in SM Fig. S4), only\nin\ufb02uencers (Fig. S5) or only users and in\ufb02uencers (Fig. S6) that were active during both elec-\ntions. In all cases we observe an increase of the Hartigans\u2019 dip test (HDT) statistics (see SM\nFig. S7 and Tab. S9) indicating that the increased polarization is not only due to the departure\nand arrival of new users between elections but also to a change of behavior of the users that\nremained. The largest increase in HDT for the user distribution is obtained when all users of\n2016 and 2020 and only in\ufb02uencers that were present during both years are considered ( +0.08).\nThis setting also corresponds to the smallest increase of the dip test of the in\ufb02uencer distribu-\ntion ( +0.01, within 95% CI), suggesting that the new in\ufb02uencers of 2020 have more polarized\nideologies than the in\ufb02uencers who remained from 2016 and that the increased polarization of\nthe users is due in large part to the arrival and departure of users between elections (SM Fig. S7\nand SM Tab. S9).\n14\nFigure 6 reveals a clear increase in polarization of the users and in\ufb02uencers in 2020 com-\npared to 2016 and an alignment of their latent ideologies in two distinct groups, mirroring the\nnews media classi\ufb01cation groupings seen in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3. The box plots show that the\ndistributions of users retweeting in\ufb02uencers became more concentrated in 2020, with two clear\nopposite poles and fewer in\ufb02uencers having a user base bridging opposite ideologies. These\nresults independently con\ufb01rm the shift of news outlets and in\ufb02uencers from the center to the\nright and left observed using the news media classi\ufb01cations by external sources. Indeed, we\n\ufb01nd an extremely high correlation (above 0.90for 2016 and 2020) between the users\u2019 latent\nideology position and their left- or right-leaning distribution computed using the news media\ncategories in which they posted (see Methods). This high correlation indicates that the shift in\nbias observed at the level of the media outlets is also present at the level of the users\u2019 retweeting\npattern and serves as an independent validation of the media outlet classi\ufb01cation.\nDiscussion\nThis paper uses Twitter retweets to study polarization among in\ufb02uencers and those they in\ufb02u-\nence in the months leading up the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Presidential elections. Multiple analyses\ncon\ufb01rm a robust pattern of increasing division into opposing echo chambers, largely due to the\narrival of new, more polarized in\ufb02uencers and users in 2020.\nOur study also provides unique insights on the rapidly evolving news media landscape on\nTwitter. Among the top 100 in\ufb02uencers aggregated across all news media categories in 2020,\nseventy-\ufb01ve percent were not present in 2016, demonstrating how dif\ufb01cult it is to retain in\ufb02u-\nencer status. Most of the in\ufb02uencers who appeared in 2020 were associated with prominent\nmedia or political party organizations. The number of in\ufb02uencers af\ufb01liated with media organi-\nzations declined by 10% between 2016 and 2020, replaced mostly by in\ufb02uencers af\ufb01liated with\ncenter and right-leaning political organizations. This change in the news media landscape on\nTwitter from 2016 to 2020 indicates a shift in the relative in\ufb02uence of journalists and political\norganizations. On the other hand, in the extremely right biased and fake news categories, new\nprofessional media have emerged and taken the place of mostly independent in\ufb02uencers.\nFuture research should build on this structural analysis by examining the content of the\nmessages. Content analysis is needed to distinguish between tweets that are positively and\nnegatively quoted and to develop measures of in\ufb02uence that go beyond the ability to attract\nattention from retweeters. For example, an urgent question to answer is whether the in\ufb02uence\nof unaf\ufb01liated Twitter in\ufb02uencers goes beyond being news spreaders: do they also have the\nability to set the issue agenda? Our study is limited to describing what happened on Twitter.\nFuture research should analyze message content for clues about the ability of in\ufb02uencers to\nmobilize voters and social movements of\ufb02ine. We also focused on the \ufb02ow of information from\nin\ufb02uencers to those who retweet them. Future research should investigate how the actions of\nthe retweeters and followers affect the in\ufb02uencers, how in\ufb02uencers form networks across types\nof media, and what are the of\ufb02ine consequences of polarization of Twitter in\ufb02uencers and users,\n15\nincluding the impact on voting. It should also be possible to monitor interactions on other social\nmedia and during non-election periods to permit \ufb01ner grained analysis of the new entrants.\nMethods\nNews media URL classi\ufb01cation\nThe website www.allsides.com (AS) rates media bias using a combination of several\nmethods such as blind surveys, editorial review, third party analysis (e.g. academic research),\nindependent review and community feedbacks (see www.allsides.com/media-bias/\nmedia-bias-\\rating-methods for a detailed explanation of their methodology). The\nwebsite mediabiasfact\\check.com (MBFC) scores media bias by evaluating wording,\nsourcing, and story choices as well as political endorsement (see mediabiasfactcheck.\ncom/methodology ). MBFC is maintained by a small independent team of researchers\nand journalists, offers the largest set of biased and inaccurate news sources among \ufb01ve fact\nchecking datasets [47], and is widely used for labeling bias and veracity of news sources (e.g.,\nin [48, 49, 50]).\nTo be consistent with the results from 2016 [25], we discard as insigni\ufb01cant outlets that\naccumulate less than 1%of the cumulative number of tweets of the more popular outlets in\neach category. Removing uniformly insigni\ufb01cant outlets from all categories also ensures that\nthe tweet volume in each category is independent of the number of outlets classi\ufb01ed in this\ncategory by AS and MBFC. The full lists of outlets in each category in 2016 and 2020 are given\nin SM Tabs. S1 and S2. AS and MBFC updated their bias classi\ufb01cation for several outlets\nbetween 2016 and 2020, changing the classi\ufb01cation used in our analyses as well. For example,\nCNN Web News was classi\ufb01ed in the center category in 2016 by AS and then in the left-leaning\ncategory in 2020, re\ufb02ecting a bias shift occurring during this time (see www.allsides.com/\nblog/yes-cnns-media-\\bias-has-shifted-left ).\nIn Ref. [25], the fake news and extreme-bias categories were based on the classi\ufb01cation\nof a team of media experts (available at github.com/alexbovet/opensources ) and\nwas cross-checked using the factual reporting scores from MBFC. As the classi\ufb01cation source\nfrom 2016 was not updated in 2020, we use the list of outlets classi\ufb01ed as \u201cquestionable\nsources\u201d from MBFC as a reference for 2020. MBFC describes a questionable source as\none \u201cthat exhibits one or more of the following: extreme bias, consistent promotion of pro-\npaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a complete lack of trans-\nparency and/or is fake news.\u201d MBFC rates the factual reporting of each source on a scale from\n0 (very high) to 10 (very low) based on their history of reporting factually and backing up\nclaims with well-sourced evidence. Outlets with a level of \u201clow\u201d (score of 7, 8 or 9) or \u201cvery\nlow\u201d (score of 10) are classi\ufb01ed in the fake news category while outlets with a \u201cmixed\u201d level\n(score of 5 or 6) are classi\ufb01ed in the extremely biased category. No outlets in the disinfor-\nmation categories have a level higher than \u201cmixed.\u201d A \u201clow\u201d or \u201cvery low\u201d factual reporting\n16\nlevel on MBCF corresponds to sources that rarely, or almost never use credible sources and\n\u201cneed to be checked for intentional fake news, conspiracy, and propaganda.\u201d A \u201cmixed\u201d level\nis assigned to sources that \u201cdo not always use proper sourcing or source to other biased/mixed\nfactual sources.\u201d We also verify that all outlets in the extremely biased category have a \u201cbias\u201d\nreported on MBFC of \u201cright\u201d, \u201cextreme right\u201d, \u201cleft\u201c or \u201cextreme left.\u201d\nWe identify in our datasets (we give the top hostname as an example in parenthesis) for the\nfake news category: 16 hostnames in 2016 (top: thegatewaypundit.com ) and 20 host-\nnames in 2020 (top: thegatewaypundit.com ), for the extremely biased (right) category:\n17 hostnames in 2016 (top: breitbart.com ) and 10 hostnames in 2020 (top: breitbart.\ncom), for the extremely biased (left) category: 7 hostnames in 2016 (top: dailynewsbin.\ncom) and 7 hostnames in 2020 (top: occupydemocrats.com ), for the left news cate-\ngory: 18 hostnames in 2016 (top: huffingtonpost.com ) and 18 hostnames in 2020 (top:\nrawstory.com ), for the left-leaning news category: 19 hostnames in 2016 (top: nytimes.\ncom) and 19 hostnames in 2020 (top: nytimes.com ), for the center news category: 13 host-\nnames in 2016 (top: cnn.com ) and 13 hostnames in 2020 (top: thehill.com ), for the\nright-leaning news category: 7 hostnames in 2016 (top: wsj.com ) and 13 hostnames in 2020\n(top: nypost.com ), for right news category: 20 hostnames in 2016 (top: foxnews.com )\nand 19 hostnames in 2020 (top: foxnews.com ). The full lists of outlets in each category in\n2016 and 2020 are given in SM Tabs. S1 and S2.\nIn\ufb02uencer type classi\ufb01cation\nFor each of the years 2016 and 2020, we manually classi\ufb01ed the top-25 in\ufb02uencers in each news\nmedia category as af\ufb01liated to a media organization or a political organization, or unaf\ufb01liated\n(classi\ufb01ed either as an independent user or as an unidenti\ufb01ed \u201cother\u201d user). The manual labeling\nprocedure was as follows: Eight of the authors were randomly assigned a subset of the union of\nthe top-25 in\ufb02uencers in these category lists to independently classify, such that each subset was\nexamined by three different authors. Each author was shown the account name of the in\ufb02uencer\nalong with descriptions, posts, and all available non-Twitter information such as their Wikipedia\nentry. Each in\ufb02uencer was then assigned their category based on the majority vote of the three\nindependent classi\ufb01cations.\nSimilarity network analysis\nWe start by creating for each in\ufb02uencer ia vector /vectorSiof size U, which stands for the number\nof users in our dataset. We used a set of 588in\ufb02uencers for the 2016 dataset, and a set of 661\nin\ufb02uencers for the 2020 dataset. An index uis assigned to the speci\ufb01c user. The vector element\nsi\nude\ufb01nes the number of times user uhas retweeted in\ufb02uencer i. Then, we create the adjacency\nmatrix Aof size I\u00d7Ifor our similarity networks by setting ai1,i2to the cosine similarity\nbetween vectors /vectorSi1and/vectorSi2. It follows that the higher the cosine similarity, the more users have\nthe similar number of retweets for in\ufb02uencers i1, i2.\n17\nWe detect communities in the similarity network using the Louvain algorithm [51]. In the\nsimilarity networks for both election years, we found two communities. Using the accounts\nof in\ufb02uencers in each community, we found that both election years one community contains\nin\ufb02uencers primarily associated with fake and right-biased news categories, while the other\ncontains in\ufb02uencers from center and left-biased news categories. This split coincides with an\nunderlying division among the Twitter user bases in the content they propagate.\nWe quantify the severity of this split using two measures of separation between commu-\nnities. First is modularity that computes the sum of difference between the fraction of edges\nwithin each community and such fraction expected within this community in a random network\nwith the same number of nodes and edges. This metric has a range of [\u22120.5,1][52]. A pos-\nitive value indicates the presence of communities separated from each other. The closer the\nmodularity is to 1, the stronger communities are separated.\nThe second measure uses the normalized cut, which is the sum of the weights of every edge\nthat links a pair communities divided by the sum of the weights of all edges. The result has a\nrange of [0,1]where the smaller the value, the stronger the separation among communities.\nLatent ideology estimation\nThe latent ideology estimation follows the method developed in [43, 32] adapted to using\nretweet interactions instead of following relations. As in [32], we use correspondence anal-\nysis [44] (CA) to infer ideological positions of Twitter users.\nThe adjacency matrix, A, of the retweet network between the in\ufb02uencers and their retweet-\ners is the matrix with element aijequal to the number of times user iretweeted in\ufb02uencer j.\nWe only select tweets that have been sent from the of\ufb01cial Twitter client in order to limit the\npresence of bots and professional accounts and we also remove users that show a low interest in\nthe U.S. elections by removing users that retweeted less than three different in\ufb02uencers. For the\n2016 data, the matrix Ahas 751,311 rows corresponding to distinct users, 593 columns corre-\nsponding to in\ufb02uencers and the total number of retweets equal to 39,385,772. For the 2020 data,\nthe matrix Ahas 2,034,970 rows corresponding to distinct users, 591 columns corresponding\nto in\ufb02uencers and the total number of retweets equal to 153,463,788.\nThe CA method is executed in the following steps [45]. The matrix of standardized residuals\nof the adjacency matrix is computed as S=D\u22121/2\nr(P\u2212rc)D\u22121/2\nc, where P=A(/summationtext\nijaij)\u22121\nis the adjacency matrix normalized by the total number of retweets, r=P1is the vector of\nrow sums, c=1TPis the vector of column sums, Dr=diag(r)andDc=diag(c). Using\nthe standardized residuals allows the inference to account for the variation of popularity and\nactivity of the in\ufb02uencers and the users, respectively [32]. Then, a SVD is computed such that\nS=UD\u03b1VTwithUUT=VVT=IandD\u03b1being a diagonal matrix with the singular values\non its diagonal. The positions of the users are given by the standard row coordinates: X=\nD\u22121/2\nrUwhere we only consider the \ufb01rst dimension, corresponding to the largest singular value.\nFinally, the ideological positions of the users are found by standardizing the row coordinates to\nhave a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The ideological position of the in\ufb02uencers\n18\nis given by the median of the weighted positions of their retweeters.\nWe tested the robustness of our method by varying the way we construct matrix Aas follow:\n1) removing entries with weight 1 to discard relations showing a weak ideological alignment;\n2) considering the logarithm of the number of retweets as weight for in\ufb02uencer for a sublinear\nrelation between the number of retweets and the strength of ideology alignment; 3) considering\na random subsample of the 2020 retweet data of the same size than the 2016 retweet data\nto control for a potential effect of the difference in sizes of the two datasets. All of these\nrobustness tests match the results of our initial method with correlation coef\ufb01cients between\nthe user position distributions in the robustness tests and in the initial con\ufb01guration at above\n0.995. We also compare the users\u2019 latent ideology distribution with the users average leaning\ndistribution and \ufb01nd a correlation above 0.90 for 2016 and 2020. The average leaning of users is\ncomputed for all users having at least three tweets classi\ufb01ed in at least one news media category\nand estimated as the weighted average of the news media category positions, given as: fake\nnews = 4/3, extreme-right bias = 1, right = 2/3, right-leaning = 1/3, center = 0, left-leaning =\n-1/3, left = -2/3, extreme-left bias = -1.\nReferences\n[1] D.

Comparison of top 100 rankings generated by the PageRank algorithm and by\nthe Collective In\ufb02uence (CI) algorithm using the 2016 and 2020 retweet networks. Ranked\nBias Overlap (RBO) [1] and Jaccard Similarity are computed over the two top 100 lists, shown\nbelow their respective news category labels. For this analysis, RBO\u2019s weight parameter pis\nset to 0.98. The RBO values are generally above 0.7 indicating a high agreement of the two\nranking, especially for the top ranked users. The only network that show a poor agreement\nbetween the rankings is the extreme bias left network of 2020. This may be explained by the\nsmall size and low average degree of the network compared to networks of other categories (see\nTab.

Each \ufb02ow connects\nthe best ranking for a user in 2016, whose rank is displayed to the left of the user handle, to\ntheir rank in 2020.

Note user @kylegrif\ufb01n1 is\nmore highly ranked in the left leaning bias (rank 3) but we chose to show its center ranking for\nthis center bias plot, as the difference in rank is small and it keeps the \ufb01gure focused on the\ncenter bias.\n26\nFig. S3.

In recent years, the rise of social media\nhas opened additional avenues for hate groups to profess ex-\ntreme ideologies, champion their cause, recruit members, and\nspread hateful content. According to the Southern Poverty\nLaw Center (SPLC)\u2014an organization dedicated to monitoring\nhate group activity in the United States\u2014the number of ac-\ntive hate groups has been increasing for the last few years [4].\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the \ufb01rst page.

Cross-platform research uncov-\nering their online practices is also rare; works by O\u2019Callaghan\n[45] and Johnson [31] are the exceptions, where they argue the\nneed to move away from single platform investigations. This\nstudy responds to that need by investigating the deeper content\nand information sharing practices of hate groups on Facebook\nand Twitter\u2014two of the popularly used platforms by them.\nStarting with the public Twitter and Facebook page pro\ufb01les\nof 72 SPLC designated U.S based hate groups, spanning \ufb01ve\nhate ideologies, we collect and analyze three months of public\nposts sent by them.We shed light on the following questions:\nRQ1: How do hate groups frame content across platforms?\nRQ2: How do hate groups share information across platforms?\nRQ3: How do the framing and information sharing efforts\ndiffer across multiple ideologies of hate across platforms?\nWe draw upon the scholarship of Social Movement Organiza-\ntions (SMO) and position hate groups as SMOs [54]. SMOs\nuse social media for various purposes, such as knowledge shar-\ning, recruitment, collective action and political advocacy [2, 8,\n28, 44]. Hate groups do the same, but with the purpose of di-\nrecting degrading attitudes toward a targeted out-group, while\nglorifying the identity of their own group\u2014the in-group. De-\nspite such parallels to SMOs, the Social Computing research\ncommunity has not yet positioned hate group operations under\nthe SMO perspective. Moreover, while scholars have studied\nwhat behaviors place people at risk of viewing extremist con-\ntent online [13] and offered ways of countering hate group\nnarratives [29, 43], few have investigated the sophisticated\nonline message framing and information sharing practices em-\nployed by hate groups to target a collective. This lends to\nthe urgency of developing a strong understanding of how hate\ngroups use social media to frame and share information and\nhow do they do so across platforms.\nBy utilizing framing theory from social movement research\n[27, 50] and mixed methods analyses, we compare how hate\ngroups diagnose the problems associated with their out-group,\nwhat solutions they provide, and how they motivate their audi-\nence to act against the out-group. Concurrently, we investigate\nvarious information sources shared by hate groups by exam-\nining the domains of shared URLs. We classify the domain\nby the type of content they host (for e.g. news, opinion) and\nbuild domain co-sharing graphs to understand information\n1\nsharing practices across platforms. We \ufb01nd that hate groups\nuse Facebook to complain about getting oppressed by the out-\ngroup and how the government and the system is failing them.\nWhereas, on Twitter, the majority of messages paint a distorted\npicture of the out-groups, stressing on their immorality and\ninferiority . Their communication on Facebook also reveals\nincreased fear appeals and calls for membership compared to\nTwitter. Additionally, Facebook is used to host more links to\nopinion and issue-speci\ufb01c informational websites, whereas\nTwitter is used more for sharing general news. We ground our\n\ufb01ndings in previous sociology studies [25, 34, 42] to infer that\nhate groups might be leveraging Facebook to directly radical-\nize and recruit the audience, while using Twitter to maintain\npositive self-image, reach a diverse audience, and educate their\nfollowers. Our study makes the following contributions:\n\u000fWe develop a framing theory based annotation framework to\nempirically measure hate group speci\ufb01c framing strategies.\nWe hope that scholars would \ufb01nd our framework useful to\nextend work in this domain.\n\u000fWe offer a cross-platform view of information sharing\necosystem of hate groups and investigate different types\nof information sources shared by them across platforms.\n\u000fWe present nuances of cross-platform communication span-\nning \ufb01ve different hate ideologies representing the 72 hate\ngroups and discuss the implications of social media plat-\nforms\u2019 uneven censorship efforts across these ideologies.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we position\nhate groups as Social Movement Organizations, providing\na background on collective action framing and information\nsharing by SMOs. Then, we explain our framing annotation\nscheme, data collection process, methods for conducting each\nRQs, and present results from each. We conclude with remarks\non the implications of this work.\nContent warning: We include tweets and posts by hate\ngroups. Readers might \ufb01nd them upsetting. However, they are\nnecessary to understand the relevance of the results.\nBACKGROUND\nHate Groups as Social Movement Organizations\nSocial Movement Organizations (SMOs) are purpose-driven\norganizations with societal reconstruction agendas [38]. By\nde\ufb01nition, an SMO exists only when changes in a society are\nmisaligned with an organization\u2019s goals [54]. Thus, when-\never society witnesses increased racial, sexual, or religious\ndiversity, hate groups tend to be more active and aggressive in\ntheir efforts to target the respective marginalized communities,\ne.g., racial, sexual and religious minorities [54]. Following\nthe SMO perspective, scholars investigating online extremism\n[12] and extremist\u2019 group identity [30] consider hate groups\nas \u201cin-groups\u201d\u2014population that is internal to the extremist\nsocial movement and their targets as \u201cout-groups.\u201d We adopt\nthe \u201cin-group,\u201d \u201cout-group\u201d terminology while referring to\nhate groups and their targets.\nUnder the SMO perspective, hate groups need to \u201cframe\u201d their\ncommunication to legitimatize their actions, inspire potential\nrecruits, negotiate a shared understanding of the problematic\nsocietal condition that needs change, offer alternative arrange-\nments to promote change, and \ufb01nally urge others to act so asto affect that change [5]. Yet, we know very little about how\nhate groups frame their communication online to achieve these\ngoals. Moreover, researchers studying online operations of\nSMOs have established that SMOs are adept at leveraging the\naffordances provided by social media to enhance their online\npresence and attract potential recruits [8]. Hate groups, just\nlike any other SMO, utilize various online communication\nchannels to transmit their message to a wider public [17, 31].\nThus, studying their communication practices across platforms\nis crucial to get a deeper understanding of their information\necosystem. Here, we take a step to broaden that understanding\nby investigating hate groups\u2019 information sharing activities\nacross two social media platforms. We also draw upon the\ncollective action framing scholarship to guide our work.\nCollective Action Frames & Hate Group Communication\nFraming refers to portraying an issue from one perspectives,\nemphasizing certain aspects, while de-emphasizing competing\nperspectives to ultimately in\ufb02uence its interpretation [7, 21,\n27]. Snow et. al. [50] characterized collective action frames as\nan extension of the framing process happening and offered a\nwidely used sociological framework to study framing process\nof social movements. The framework is characterized with\nthree core framing tasks: diagnostic , which states the social\nmovement problem, prognostic , that offers a solution, and mo-\ntivational , that serves as a call to action [5, 50]. Starting with\nSnow\u2019s generalized framework for studying social movement,\nwe iteratively re\ufb01ned and built upon the three core framing\ntasks to converge on a scheme that suits the framing practices\nof hate groups\u2014a specialized SMO.\nMoreover, existing approaches to analyzing hate group com-\nmunication fall into two categories: qualitative and quantita-\ntive. Qualitative methods have focused on the cognitive and\nsocial process of radicalization towards extreme hate ideolo-\ngies [6, 15, 26, 33]. Others have highlighted the prominence\nand impact of persuasive messages produced by hate groups\n[3, 19, 20, 41, 53]. However, there is limited quantitative\nresearch exploring deeper narrative structures that hate groups\nemploy. Previous efforts commonly concentrate on speci\ufb01c\nhate cases; for example, investigating LIWC dimensions of\nxenophobic narratives in Swedish alt-media [32] and inferring\nbelief identi\ufb01cation in Islamic extremism [46] through word\nfrequency count in online extremist statements. In this study,\nwe adopt the principles of framing from social movement the-\nory to focus on the constructs of an individual message sent\nout by multiple hate groups spanning \ufb01ve different ideologies.\nHate Groups and Online Information Sharing\nPrior works investigating hate group activities have primarily\nfocused on examining individual hate websites run by these\ngroups. For example, scholars have studied how various hate\ngroups share news, blogs, and opinion pieces on their own\nwebsites [11, 47, 55]. Research on link sharing across extrem-\nist blogs have reported that information communities exist\nacross various hate ideologies [55]. Another study found that\nnearly 72% of the hate group websites contain links to other\nextremist blogs and sites that are primarily used to sell extrem-\nist products online [47]. While these efforts provide valuable\ncontext of hate group operations on their individual websites,\n2\ncurrent trends show that they are increasingly shifting their in-\nformation dissemination operations to social media platforms\n[31, 45]. They have also progressed from being limited to\na dedicated website (a single platform) to spanning multi-\nple social media platforms. These changing trends provide\na motivation for our current work to investigate hate group\ninformation sharing activities across two popular social media\nplatforms\u2014Twitter and Facebook.\nMETHOD\nOur approach comprises of \ufb01ve phases: 1) developing an\nannotation framework based on Snow\u2019s [50] collective action\nframes described earlier, 2) mapping hate group accounts\nacross Facebook and Twitter and collecting the cross platform\ndata, 3) annotating frames in collected data, 4) analyzing URL\ndomains shared on Facebook and Twitter, and 5) analyzing\nframes and URL domain co-shares across the hate ideologies.\nThis section details each phase respectively.\nDeveloping a Framing Annotation Scheme\nOur \ufb01rst research question aims at understanding how hate\ngroups utilize Snow\u2019s collective action frames [50] to diagnose\nthe problems, offer solutions , and provide motivations for\naction. To answer this, we employed a multistage annotation\nscheme development process that is explained below.\nStage 1: Our frame development process started in January\n2018 by \ufb01rst collecting 65 hate groups featured on SPLC\u2019s\nextremist \ufb01les web page, their corresponding Twitter handles,\nand a random sample of 600 public tweets from their pro\ufb01les.\nIn the \ufb01rst stage, we aimed to inductively develop theoretical\ninsights about collective action framing processes undertaken\nby hate groups online. We started with Snow\u2019s three collective\naction frames and extended them through several rounds of\ninductive and deductive testing. We brainstormed with ex-\nperts in social science and researchers who have conducted\nethnographic studies of online hate groups. We adhered to an\niterative, multistage process of cycling back and forth with\ndata, framing theory, and emergent themes. Stage 1 resulted\nin 23 categories spread across three collective action frames.\nStage 2: Next, in order to assess the general applicability\nour stage 1 annotation scheme, we invited seven undergrad-\nuate students, all with background in sociology, to examine\nanother random sample of 250 tweets. To provide background\non framing, we conducted two information sessions that in-\nvolved discussing the meaning of frames along with speci\ufb01c\nexamples. Following the discussions, all seven participants\nindependently applied the initial framework to the random\nsample of tweets. Finally, we discussed their annotation ex-\nperiences and received feedback about potentially ambiguous,\nmisrepresented categories and possible new framing themes.\nStage 3: Based on the feedback received in stage 2, we mod-\ni\ufb01ed, removed, and added a few categories. Next, in order\nto assess the effect of the changes made, the \ufb01rst author of\nthis paper and a sociology expert annotated another sample of\n150 tweets. The disagreements in annotations were resolved\nthrough discussion until consensus was reached. Combined\nefforts in the three stages resulted in 13 categories that are\nexplained in the next subsection.Annotation Scheme Description\nTable 1 contains the de\ufb01nitions for every category alongwith\nthe examples of various messages in the dataset.\nDiagnosis categories: We identify four ways in which the\nhate groups diagnose the situation. While assessing how the\nsituation affects the in-group, they complain about being op-\npressed by their targets and other parts of the society, or claim\nthat larger systems such as government and media are fail-\ningto either correct the problematic situation or protect the\nin-group from the out-group. Hate groups also diagnose the\nsituation by assigning negative attributes to their targets. They\ndescribe the out-group as immoral orinferior based on the\nout-group\u2019s perceived moral, political or biological standing\n(e.g, referring to homosexual people as sinners or claiming\nthat some races are genetically inferior to others).\nPrognosis categories: For prognostic frames, we summa-\nrized \ufb01ve types of solutions proposed by hate groups towards\nchanging the problematic situation. We categorize solutions\nas advocating violence , where hate groups promote violent\nactions or displays of violence against the out-group, hatred ,\nwhere they encourage others to criticize the out-group, and\ndiscrimination , where they advocate for avoidance or social\nsegregation of the out-group. Further, hate groups also call\nforpolicy changes (e.g, immigration reforms) and direct asso-\nciations by membership requests (e.g, participation in rallies,\nonline events and meetings).\nMotivation categories: Our motivation frame has four cat-\negories: fear,ef\ufb01cacy ,moral ,status . While fear provides a\nnegative motivation by insinuating existential threats to the\nin-group, the remaining categories use positive aspects such as\nef\ufb01ciency of the solution provided, moral propriety, or status\nassociated with the out-group to motivate the audience.\nChallenges in Frame Development\nOur expert-informed, data-driven framework development pro-\ncess was met with several challenges. The three stages spanned\nover a year and included feedbacks from over eleven people.\nWe especially struggled to \ufb01rst, recruit participants with sig-\nni\ufb01cant basic social science background and then sustain their\nparticipation over extended time periods. These challenges\nare typical of any manual annotation process [7]. In addition,\nscholars studying frames in news have indicated the dif\ufb01culty\nin identifying and coding frames in content analysis [37]. Our\nmain focus behind the year long coding scheme development\nprocess was not agreement [40] but, to identify concepts and\nrecurring themes that could represent the three collective ac-\ntion frames in hate groups messages.\nData Preparation\nCollecting and Mapping Hate Groups Across Platforms\nWe start by the hate group list published by SPLC in their Hate\nMap web page [9]. This list contains the names of 367 hate\ngroups along with their ideologies. Next, we manually identify\nand verify the accounts for each of the 367 organizations as\nfollows. First, we conducted web searches with the organiza-\ntion\u2019s name to \ufb01nd their corresponding website. In most cases,\nthe website had direct links to their social media accounts.\nIn other cases, we searched the organization\u2019s name within\nthe search interface of a social media platforms. We checked\n3\nOppression In-group complains about being oppressed through violent or repressive action, infringement on their rights or resources, or through indictment or sanctions\n\u201c...christian school was unjustly raided...\u201d, \u201cforced to abandon biblical principles...\u201d\nFailure In-group assesses that the government, the system or other agencies such as media have failed to protect them from the problems caused by the out-group\n\u201c...government placing americans in danger...\u201d\nImmorality In-group indicates that the out-group demonstrates immorality though unethical, immoral or uncivil behavior or values dissonance.\n\u201c...Islam teaches and Muslims practice deception...\u201d, \u201c...there is no radical Islam, Islam IS radical!...\u201d\nInferiority In-group believes that the out-group is inherently inferior to them based on the political in\ufb02uence, genetics, or the collective failure of the out-groupDiagnostic\n\u201c...anti-border liberals are of inferior intellect than pro-enforcement Americans...\u201d\nViolence In-group promotes violent actions towards the out-group\n\u201c...choose to be a dangerous man for Christ, wear your cross-hat...\u201d\nHatred In-group advocates protests, criticism or the show of disdain towards the out-group\n\u201c...don\u2019t take feminism or the women who support it seriously.

Table displaying our frame annotation scheme. We developed our annotation scheme based on Snow\u2019s [50] three collective action frames\n(vertical labels). The categories in the individual collective action frames (gray cells) are described with examples (in italics).\nwhether an account with similar name exists and whether the\naccount\u2019s bio had a reference to the organization\u2019s website.\nFor every organization, we searched for their Twitter, Face-\nbook, YouTube, Gab, Instagram and Pinterest account pro\ufb01les.\nMajority of the organizations had a public Facebook page and\na Twitter handle\u2014a total of 75 organizations representing \ufb01ve\nextremist ideologies with accounts. This dictated our choice\nof using Facebook and Twitter for our cross-platform analyses\nin this paper. By gathering public tweets and posts from public\nFacebook pro\ufb01le pages of these accounts between 31st March,\n2019 to 1st July 2019, we obtained three months of hate group\nactivities. While all 75 accounts had some activity on Face-\nbook and Twitter, a handful had marginally more messages\nin one of the platforms. For example, one hate group had 73\nFacebook posts and 2,323 tweets. We removed three such\naccounts and ended up with a dataset of 16,963 tweets and\n14,642 Facebook messages across 72 accounts.\nDescription of the Cross-Platform Hate Group Data\nHere, we brie\ufb02y state the ideologies in our dataset. We con-\nsulted with a sociology expert and grouped some ideologies\ninto broader categories based on the overlap in their beliefs as\ndescribed on the SPLC website [10].\nWe combine White nationalist, neo-Nazi and neo-Confederate\ngroups into a White Supremacy categories because of their\noverlapping views on extreme right ideology and hatred for\nother races. Similarly,we group Traditional Catholic and Chris-\ntian Identity groups into Religious Supremacy groups for their\nunderlying antisemitic and fundamentalist ideology. Lastly,\nwe have Anti-Muslim groups that show extreme hostility to-\nwards Muslims and Islamic countries, Anti-LGBT groups that\nconsider homosexuality and pro-choice attitudes to be danger-\nous to the society and Anti-Immigration groups that strongly\nadvocate for strict immigration policies and commonly target\nimmigrants or individuals supporting immigration.\nHow active are the 72 hate groups on Facebook and Twit-\nter? We perform Wilcoxon signed rank sum test\u2014a nonparametric version of paired t-test to statistically compare the\ndistributions of their posting activity across the two platforms.\nWe \ufb01nd that hate groups contribute more tweets compared to\nFacebook posts ( z=1029 ;p<0:05) and have signi\ufb01cantly\nmore Facebook page likes compared to Twitter followers (see\nTable 2). However, the overall distribution of messages per or-\nganization across the two platforms as well as the distribution\ndifferences of posting activity within individual ideologies\nalso are not signi\ufb01cantly different. These tests indicate that\nour \ufb01nal set of hate group accounts consistently used both\nplatforms within that three months time window.\nRQ1 Method: Content Framing Across Platforms\nHow do hate groups frame the content on Facebook and\nTwitter? How do they voice opinions and promote narra-\ntives in their own words? To understand this, we annotate\n1,440 Facebook posts and 1,440 tweets (approximately 10%\nof the dataset) using categories from our developed annotation\nscheme (Table 1). With 72 accounts in each social media plat-\nform, we randomly sampled 20 messages from every account.\nWhile most of the accounts had more than 20 messages in the\ndataset, some had less. To make up for the de\ufb01cit, we again\nrandomly sampled remaining messages from the remaining\nFacebook and Twitter data. While annotating, account names\nwere removed in order to reduce the annotator bias. All anno-\ntations were done by the \ufb01rst author of this paper over a period\nof 3 weeks using a platform created in-house. The results for\nannotation process are summarized in Figures 1-3. Lastly, we\n\ufb01nd it important to mention that the \ufb01rst author has a liberal\nm s.d. total\n/facebookposts 203 263 14K\n/twittertweets 235 274 16K\n/facebookpage likes 92K 55K 6M\n/twitterfollowers 67K 48K 4M\nTable 2. Table summarizing Facebook and Twitter activity.\n4\nbias that might have affected the annotations. While such an-\nnotation practice is previously used by other researchers [51]\nmore diverse group of annotators can be used while creating a\nlarger dataset for computational study.\nRQ2 Method: Information Sharing Across Platforms\nHow do hate groups use social media to share links to ex-\nternal websites? To answer, we \ufb01rst extract URL links from\nmessages, expand shortened URLs to obtain the full domain\nnames and categorize domains by type to investigate how they\nare shared across-platforms. Facebook posts and tweets of-\nten contain links to other posts and tweets. Thus, we remove\nlinks containing self-referential links. We end up with 12,290\nlinks from Twitter and 11,926 links from Facebook comprising\n1,021 distinct domains.\nOrganizing Domains by Type\nIn order to examine the type of information shared, we con-\nducted qualitative content analysis to categorize the nature of\neach domain. We read the \u201cAbout Us\u201d or equivalent page of\neach of the 1,021 domains. Seven of them ended in 404 error\nand \ufb01ve had no information on their website. For the rest,\nwe took a grounded (bottom-up) approach to categorize the\ndomain type based on what information they primarily hosted;\nnoting the provided descriptions of domains and then organiz-\ning them into more meaningful categories (listed below).\nstreaming: audio/video streaming, podcasts, radio shows\npromotion: petition sign-ups, membership forms, merchan-\ndise and links to various social networks\ninformation: issue-speci\ufb01c news, information watchdogs,\nreports and websites of concerned organizations\nopinion: commentaries, opinion pieces and personal blogs\nnews: online newspapers and general news forums\nFor each ideology, we \ufb01nd the distributions of various domain\ntypes across Facebook and Twitter by calculating the propor-\ntion of links containing a particular type of domain. Figure\n4 displays how frequently news, information, opinion, social\nand streaming websites are referred overall across platforms\nand by individual ideologies.\nRQ3 Method: Communication in Individual Ideologies\nRQ1 and RQ2 investigate overlaying patterns of content fram-\ning and information sharing across all 72 accounts. Here, we\ninvestigate the nuances of framing and URL sharing within\nindividual ideologies. To understand this, we consider the\nannotations done in RQ1 and compare Facebook and Twitter\nframes in each ideology. Moreover, to examine their informa-\ntion ecosystems, along with the domain types found in RQ2,\nwe build domain networks: a graph representation of URL\ndomains co-shared within and across platforms.\nDomain Networks\nPrevious studies have utilized \u201cdomain network graphs\u201d to un-\nderstand the ecosystem of alternative news domains on Twitter\n[51]. A domain network is a graph-based representation of\nURL domains, where every domain is a node connected based\non some pre-determined criteria, such as number of common\nusers and frequency of sharing. We leverage the concept of\ndomain networks and modify it to \ufb01t our analysis goals. Weconnect two domains (nodes in a graph) with an edge if they\nare shared by a hate group account, with edge weight repre-\nsenting the number of accounts that share them. Finally for\ntrimming the network graph, we remove edges with weights\nless than two and all nodes that are shared less than 5 times\nand those that are connected with less than two other nodes.\nTo understand cross-platform sharing behavior, we color the\nedges differently based on the platforms they are shared on.\nBlue (Twitter) Edge If a pair of domains ( D1;D2) is shared\ntogether only on Twitter, the edge between them is blue. This\nmeans that no account has co-shared ( D1;D2) on Facebook.\nRed (Facebook) Edge Similar to the blue edge, if a pair of\ndomains ( D1;D2) is shared together only on Facebook and\nnever on Twitter, the edge between them is red.\nGreen (Both) Edge If a pair of domains ( D1;D2) is shared\ntogether on both platforms, the edge between them is green.\nFor example, if hate accounts a1,a2, and a3all share domains\n(D1;D2) but a1anda2share them only on Twitter, whereas\na3 shares them on Facebook, then the edge will be green.\nThis type of network representation allows us to observe at\nonce, the domains that are co-shared on each social media plat-\nform exclusively (surrounded by more blue orrededges)\nand the domains that are shared in common across both plat-\nforms (surrounded by more green edges). Figure 5-7 show\nthe domain networks for various ideologies. We do not show\ndomain networks for Anti-LGBT and Anti-Immigration ac-\ncounts due to space constraints, instead they can be referred\nfrom the supplementary material.\nRESULTS\nRQ1 Results: Content Framing Across Platforms\nWe summarize the annotation results in Figures 1 to 3 using\nSankey diagram representation. The width of path between\nany ideology iand a subframe fis proportional to the number\nof messages from accounts belonging to icontaining sub-\nframe s. For example, in Figure 3, the path width between\n\u201cAnti-LGBT\u201d (Facebook Anti-LGBT groups) and membership\nsubframe is wider than the policy subframe. This suggests that\nAnti-LGBT groups use Facebook to post higher proportion of\nmessages containing \u201ccalls for membership\u201d in the hate group\nin comparison to \u201cdemands for policy changes.\u201d Below we\ndiscuss every main frame in detail and comment about the\noverall differences in frames across platforms.\nHow do Hate Groups Diagnose the Problem?\nDiagnosis categories represent how hate groups provide attri-\nbution to the problematic situation. Figure 1 represents how\ndiagnostic categories are present across the two platforms. On\nFacebook, oppression andfailure are more popularly used than\nin Twitter ( oppression : 22% vs 14% and failure : 15% vs 8%).\nOn the other hand immorality category is more commonly\nused on Twitter to educate the audience about negative stereo-\ntypes associated with the out-groups (27% vs 19%). Studies\nshow that derogating the out-group via immorality frames can\nalso help reinforce the hate group\u2019s identity [41].\n5\nWhite Supremacy\nWhite Supremacy\nImmoralityInferiorityOppressionFailureDiagnostic\n27%10%14%8%\n15%\n22%\n4%\n19%Anti-Muslim\nAnti-Muslim\nReligious Supremacy\nReligious Supremacy\nAnti-LGBT\nAnti-LGBT\nAnti-Immigration\nAnti-ImmigrationFigure 1.

RQ1: Distribution of prognostic frames. membership is the\nmost prominent solution offered on Facebook (29%), while on Twitter\ndemands for policy change is predominant (25%).\nWhat Prognostic do Hate Groups Offer?\nFigure 2 indicates how solutions of policy change, member-\nship,hatred ,discrimination andviolence are offered across\nFacebook and Twitter. Advocating for hatred ,violence or\ndiscrimination is more extreme and is more likely to get re-\nported because it often involves the use of extreme language.\nThus, it is not surprising that on both, Facebook and Twitter\nhatred ,violence anddiscrimination subframes are less com-\nmon. Looking at the frequent use of policy andmembership\nsubframes, we \ufb01nd that policy is commonly used across Twit-\nter in comparison to Facebook (25% vs. 17%). Policies can\nrange anywhere from demanding a general political action\nfrom the President to signing speci\ufb01c petitions. Membership ,\nhowever, involves calls for direct association with the in-group.\nFacebook has relatively more membership calls compared to\nTwitter (29% vs. 14%), asking the audience to join events,\nmeetings, and web conferences organized by the group.\nHow do Hate Groups Motivate their Audience?\nFear is the most prominent motivator found on Facebook\n(27%) (Figure 3) followed by status enhancement (11%). Fear\nappeals are commonly used to motivate like-minded audience\nusing existential threats [41]. Fear provides negative incentive\nto follow the solution. Whereas, moral ,status enhancement,\nandef\ufb01cacy , all offer positive motivation. Particularly mes-\nsages with status enhancement and ef\ufb01cacy attempt to main-\nWhite Supremacy\nWhite Supremacy\nAnti-Muslim\nAnti-Muslim\nReligious Supremacy\nReligious Supremacy\nAnti-LGBT\nAnti-LGBT\nAnti-Immigration\nAnti-ImmigrationFear\nMoral\nStatusE\ufb03cacy27%12%\n8%\n10%\n9%\n12%\n11%\n15%MotivationFigure 3.

We \ufb01nd that more\nmessages on Twitter contain status enhancement category com-\npared to Facebook. Further, other positive motivators ( ef\ufb01cacy\nandmoral ) are also more frequent on Twitter compared to\nFacebook. Previous research suggests that hate groups often\nstrategically construct messages with self-valorizing views in\norder to strengthen their group identity [19].\nRQ2 Results: Information Sharing Across Platforms\nBy link sharing, social media provides a sizable opportunity\nfor hate groups to redirect their followers towards their own\nwebsites and other extremist blogs. Further, the articles linked\noften contain toxic language and extremist propaganda that is\nharder to present on moderated social media.\nWhat information sources are shared by hate groups?\nHate groups commonly share links to their own accounts on\nboth, Twitter and Facebook. Hence, we remove domains\nbelonging to hate group accounts for analyzing what other\ninforamtion sources are shared across platforms. Figure 4 dis-\nplays the proportion of different types of domains shared on\nFacebook and Twitter. Almost 50% of the links shared on Twit-\nter contain general news whereas less than 20% of Facebook\nlinks do. Instead Facebook hosts more links to focused infor-\nmation websites (37%) and blogs (30%). Often, these domains\nhost extreme views. For example, Facebook\u2019s top cited domain\ndrrichswier.com is a conservative blog stating: \u201cextremism in\nthe defense of liberty is no vice and moderation in the pursuit\nof justice is no virtue. \u201d Similarly, the next popular domains on\nFacebook, theworldview.com and standinthegapradio.com host\nradio and talk shows with extremist attitudes. Further, we refer\ntomediabiasfactcheck.com to infer political leanings of these\nnews domains. We \ufb01nd references to many right biased news\ndomains. For example, breitbart.com and frontpagemag.com\nare extreme right biased and foxnews.com is far right biased.\nAlmost 10% of Facebook links fall under promotion category,\nhosting links to other social media site, petition and member-\nship forums, and promoting online merchandise. Whereas\nlinks to various streaming websites, although present, are less\npopular in both Twitter and Facebook. In summary, we \ufb01nd\nthat news is predominantly shared on Twitter whereas links to\ninformation sources and websites voicing individual or group\nopinions are shared more on Facebook.\n6\nOverall\nWhite Supremacy\nAnti-Muslim\nReligious Supremacy\nAnti-LGBT\nAnti ImmigrationOpinion\nInformation\nPromotion\nStreaming\nNews0.4 1.00.80.60.20.0Figure 4. RQ2 & RQ3: Proportion of different types of domains shared\nacross platforms. News domains are present across both platforms how-\never they are linked more popularly on Twitter. Overall, Facebook hosts\nmore domains containing issue speci\ufb01c information and opinions. White\nSupremacy accounts have the most disparity in their domain sharing\nacross platforms whereas Anti-Immigration accounts have the least.\nRQ3 Results: Communication in Individual Ideologies\nSo far we observed how overall content framing and informa-\ntion sharing differs on Facebook and Twitter. Here we analyze\nevery ideology individually and provide speci\ufb01c examples to\nexplain how these processes vary within every ideology.\nWhite Supremacy:Content Framing\nOn both Facebook and Twitter, White Supremacy groups fre-\nquently discuss racial and political issues. However their\ndiagnostic and prognostic discussions vary. On Facebook they\ncomplain how white culture is being oppressed (17.8%):\n/facebookIf White Genocide is an unfounded conspiracy, why is it so heavily cen-\nsored and suppressed?\nOn Twitter, the messages primarily describe how people of\nother races are immoral (17.64%) and inferior (16.2%). For\nexample, while discussing other races, they write:\n/twitter ..by debasing themselves they are acting entirely within their class interest\nretaining the very privilege they are criticizing..\nBoth platforms contain more messages demanding change\nin policies and calls for membership . However, messages\nadvocating discrimination (4%), hatred (2%) and violence\n(2%) are only observed on Facebook.\n/facebook...Say \u201cno\u201d to their way of dress, \u201cno\u201d to their entertainment, \u201cno\u201d to\ntheir degenerate culture. To love all equally is not to love at all\nFacebook and Twitter also differ in their use of motivational\ncategories. Facebook has more fear appeals (14%):\n/facebookWhen America is no more, future generations are going to want to know\nwho murdered our country..\nTwitter contains more status enhancement (21.5%)\n/twitter Review: On Edward Dutton\u2019s RACE DIFFERENCES IN\nETHNOCENTRISM\u2014And Why White Ethnocentrism Will Return\nWhite Supremacy: Information Sharing\nFigure 5 displays the domain network for the White\nSupremacy accounts. Mix of alternative ( rt.com ,\nbreitbart.com ) and mainstream ( nytimes.com ) news sources\nare prominently shared on Twitter (57%). Whereas on\nFacebook we observe more links to promotion domains\n(35%). Promotion domains consist of various social platforms\n(patreon.com ,subscribestar.com ) (35%). Both Patreon and\nSubscriberstar have been known to house extreme right wing\nFigure 5. RQ3: Domain co-sharing network in White Supremacy ac-\ncounts. Blue links represent exclusive co-sharing on Twitter, red on\nFacebook and green links indicate that the pair of connected domains\nis shared on both platforms. Domain label size corresponds to the num-\nber of times the domain is shared.\nactivists [14]. Interestingly, in promotion domains we also\n\ufb01nd references to a mix of foreign and U.S websites that host\nextremist books and literature ( logik.se ,kirkusreviews.com )\nand talk shows ( thepoliticalcesspool.org ). We also observe\nthat domains referring to other social media ( gab,telegram ,\nbitchute ) are shared commonly across both platforms. We\nsuspect that by diverting followers from Facebook and Twitter\nto more private and less-censored platforms such as Telegram\nand Gab, White Supremacy groups might be diversifying their\nonline presence. Particularly in the light of recent censorship\nof white nationalism on Facebook [22], hate groups might\nbe quickly adapting and moving their online operations in\nalternative platforms championing free speech.\nAnti-Muslim: Content Framing\nUnsurprisingly, religion is the most frequently discussed prob-\nlem in Anti-Muslim accounts on both platforms. Further,\nIslamic oppression is more prominent on Facebook.\n/facebookWow... Muslim prison gangs are forcing inmates to convert and follow\nreligious practices or face violent repercussions\nWe observe more calls for membership on Facebook (30%)\nand more demands for policy changes on Twitter (18%). For\nexample there are several \u201csign the petition\u201d calls on Twitter\ndemanding the resignation of Muslim political leaders.\n/twitter ilhanomar has connections with cair supporting hamasterrorists. Sign\nour petition demanding her resignation and share with everyone!\nOn the other hand, Facebook is used more for advertising\nevents and meet ups for anti-Islamic groups.\n/facebookSave the Date: Thurs., May 23rd, Omaha Monthly Dinner...hear inside\ninfo on current events, news and issues you will not hear anywhere else..\nFear appeals are used prominently on both the platforms\n/facebook... The movement is worse than you think, and it\u2019s entrenched in our\nculture, government, media, our corporations and into our churches..\nAnti-Muslim: Information Sharing\nFigure 6 displays the domain network for the Anti-Muslim\naccounts. Interestingly, there seem to be two main informa-\n7\nFigure 6. RQ3: Domain co-sharing in Anti-Muslim accounts. Anti-\nMuslim information sources ( jihadwatch ), blogs ( drrichswier ) and\nstreaming services ( youtube andbitchute ) are most commonly shared\ntion sources shared by the accounts for anti Islamic news.\njihadwatch.org appears to be popularly co-shared on both plat-\nforms, while drrichswier.com is exclusively co-shared on Face-\nbook. jihadwatch belongs to one of the Anti-Muslim groups\nin our dataset. Even though links containing jihadwatch.com\ndomain were removed from the account belonging to that hate\ngroup, its prominence here suggests that other Anti-Muslim or-\nganizations also heavily refer to that domain. Other news web-\nsites such as breitbart ,foxnews are shared commonly across\nboth platforms, while Facebook remains a place for sharing\ninformational (43%) websites and blogs (16%). Information\nsources shared on Facebook often serve as watchdogs for re-\nporting geopolitical issues related to Islam. On the other hand,\nblogs promote opposition to the fundamentals of Islamic ide-\nologies. This suggests that anti-Islamic hate groups might be\npromoting both religious and political aspects of anti-Islamic\nhate through Facebook. Further, 7% of Facebook links fall un-\nder promotion category with references to other social network\ndomains ( blabber ,tumblr ) and email marketing ( mailchimp ).\nReligious Supremacy: Content Framing\nSeveral messages from Religious Supremacy accounts contain\noppression subframe, discussing religious persecution (17%):\n/facebookDisagree with a Zionist Protestant interpretation of the Gospel, and you\ngo to Jail!..\nWhile on Twitter immorality is more popular (13%).\n/twitter ..\ufb01nd out what pleases the Lord. Do not engage in deeds of darkness, but\nrather expose them. It is shameful what the disobedient do in secret\nBoth policy change and membership calls are used commonly\nacross the platforms. However, fear is the most prominent\nmotivating factor in Facebook (24%), whereas status enhance-\nment is more commonly used on Twitter (17%).\nReligious Supremacy: Information Sharing\nFigure 7 represents the domain network for accounts with\nreligious supremacy ideologies. Twitter hosts more news\nthan Facebook (63% vs 28%) (such as dailymail.co.uk ,\nusatoday.com ). Facebook, on the other hand contains links\ntoopinion domains ( billshade.org ) (42%). Notably in promo-\ntiontype domains, Facebook hosts a number of platforms used\nfor petitions and donations ( change.org ,lifepetitions.com )\n(11%). While change.org observes more diverse user base,\nFigure 7. RQ3: Domain co-sharing in Religious Supremacy accounts.\nPopularly shared domains such as zerohedge.com andrt.com are la-\nbeled as conspiracy promoting sources by mediabiasfactcheck.com\nlifepetitions.com exclusively serves the pro-life and pro-\nfamily communities.\nAnti-LGBT: Content Framing\nOn both platforms, Anti-LGBT groups discuss sexual and\ngender identity the most. However there are notable differ-\nences in their collective action framing processes. We \ufb01nd\nmore discussions based on immorality of LGBT way of life on\nTwitter (34%). On Facebook they discuss how LGBT agenda\nis oppressing people with traditional values (23%).\n/facebookThis legislation is speci\ufb01cally designed to place \u201csexual liberty\u201d\nabove\u201cReligious Liberty\u201d and our First Amendment civil rights!\nSimilarly, there are more calls for membership on Facebook\n(37%) to join Anti-LGBT groups in their rallies and seminars:\n/facebookCome and meet like-minded people that are concerned about our country.\nWe want to restore honor, respect, civility and hope for our children\u2019s future.\nTwitter hosts more demands for change in policy through\ngeneral social action (24%).\n/twitter The work we have to do is clear. We must train people to make them\nactive in establishing a godly society, and that takes work, sweat, sacri\ufb01ce.\nTwitter is also used to promote the ef\ufb01cacy (18%) of Anti-\nLGBT policies and heightened social status (19%) achieved\nby following them.\n/twitter Texas MassResistance pressure causes pro-LGBT church to cancel Drag\nQueen\u201d reading in public library. Antifa backs down! Another big win!\nFacebook however mostly contains messages motivated by\nfear warning about the effects of LGBT lifestyle on child\ndevelopment, religious liberty and society (29%).\n/facebook If the \u201cEquality Act\u201d becomes law, women and girls would instantly\nforfeit equality rights and opportunities gained over decades.\nAnti-LGBT: Information Sharing\nSimilar to other hate ideologies, Anti-LGBT accounts\nalso share more news on Twitter (54%) compared to\nFacebook (34%). However, Facebook has more links\nto blogs (12%) and informational forums (26%) (e.g,\nresources for parenting ( fatherly.com ,dadsguidetowdw.com ,\nchilddevelopmentinfo.com )) compared to Twitter. Simi-\nlar to the Religious Supremacy accounts, we \ufb01nd sev-\n8\neral websites in promotion category that host petitions\n(endbirthdayabortion.com ,focusonthefamily.com ).\nAnti-Immigration: Content Framing\nWe \ufb01nd similar frame representations for Anti-Immigration\naccounts on Facebook and Twitter. Majority of the messages\ncriticize immigration laws, in\ufb02ux of immigrants and demand\nchanges in immigration policies. However, we observe dif-\nferences in how the problem of immigration is diagnosed on\nTwitter compared to Facebook. On Twitter the focus is more\non describing the immorality of the immigrants (32%).\n/twitter illegal immigrants are invaders, many of them do terrorize US citizens\nthrough rape, assault, and murder.\nWhereas on Facebook more messages discuss the failure of\nAmerican immigration laws (33%).\n/facebookSouthern border is being overrun when congress does nothing. Why won\u2019t\nour representatives put politics aside and put American interests \ufb01rst?\nOn both platforms, fear is the primary motivational category.\n/facebookWhy is the government placing Americans in danger? There is no way\nmumps is not being spread outside ICE facilities...\nAnti-Immigration: Information Sharing\nAnti-Immigration accounts share almost 87% of domains\nexclusively on Twitter with only 9% shared exclusively on\nFacebook. Both Twitter and Facebook prominently contain\nnews websites and immigration think tanks ( breitbart.com ,\ntownhall.com ,cis.org ,immigrationreform.com ). In general we\nobserve fewer difference in the types of domains shared across\nplatforms (Figure 4). Anti-Immigration groups tend to dedi-\ncate their efforts into raising general public awareness of the\nsocial consequences of unauthorized immigration [24]. Previ-\nous studies show that greater number of negative immigration\nrelated news reports increase perceived level of threat from\nimmigration [48]. Together with the news shared and fear\nappeals on both platforms we believe that Anti-Immigration\ngroups are effectively broadcasting across both platforms to\noffer in\ufb02uential and educational narratives of hate.\nDISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS\nDo hate groups use Facebook and Twitter Differently?\nWe \ufb01nd that on Facebook, fear is prominently used as a mo-\ntivating agent. Previous literature suggests that fear appeals\nis a common mechanism for hate groups to strategically re-\ncruit like-minded people that are predisposed to the group\u2019s\nideology [41]. Our framing analysis, shows that hate groups\nindeed use more fearappeals on Facebook. This indicates that\non Facebook, hate groups\u2019 might be directing their communi-\ncation towards a more like-minded audience, one that already\naligns with their ideological worldview. Further, hate groups\nclaim to be oppressed and put out calls for membership at a\nhigher rate on Facebook compared to Twitter. Messages that\npose such negative threats to one\u2019s existence and sovereignty\nare particularly persuasive [34]. This might suggest that hate\ngroups use Facebook to not only direct their hateful agenda\nto an ideologically aligned like-minded audience, but they\nare doing it effectively, through clever persuasion strategies.\nWhereas on Twitter, hate groups direct messages to describe\nout-group as immoral orinferior . Scholars suggest that whenfaced with diverse or initially reluctant audience, hate groups\nuse different recruiting strategies than what they would use\nwith a like-minded audience. Speci\ufb01cally, they try to present\ninaccurate or distorted perception of the out-group by stress-\ning on the out-group\u2019s negative stereotypes [41]. This may\nsuggest that hate groups might be using Twitter to speci\ufb01cally\ncater towards a diverse audience and using framing strategies\nto bring initially hesitant users into their core follower base.\nWhat are the Possible Goals Behind Social Media Usage?\nPrevious studies on SMOs show how SMOs use different so-\ncial media platforms for different purposes [2]. In positioning\nhate groups within the SMO perspective, we are interested in\nexamining how hate groups might be using these platforms\nfor their extremist agenda. Here, we identify two possible\ndimensions of hate group activity on the platforms.\nGroup Radicalization and Recruitment on Facebook\nResearchers argue that the in-group\u2019s psychological need to\nsurvive, be signi\ufb01cant and important for their cause can be\nassociated with the radicalization process [33]. Speci\ufb01cally,\nMcCauly et al. [39] carve out factors relevant in group radi-\ncalization. They argue that radicalization can be associated\nwith beliefs like: \u201cwe are a special or chosen group who have\nbeen unfairly treated and betrayed ( oppression ), no one else\ncares about us or the system has failed us ( failure ), and the\nsituation is dire\u2014our group and our cause are in danger of\nextinction ( fear appeals).\u201d In our analysis, we observe that\nthe rhetoric of oppression -failure -fear is more frequent on\nFacebook compared to Twitter. Moreover, Facebook has more\nmembership calls (see Figure 2), links to personal mailing lists\nand recruitment forums (Figure 4). These results suggest that\nthe Facebook audience of hate groups might be more suscep-\ntible to extremist radicalization and successful recruitment,\ncompared to Twitter.\nMass Education and Image Control on Twitter\nCommunication scholars studying hate groups have observed\nthat they often try to \u201ceducate\u201d their audience [41]. Speci\ufb01-\ncally, they attempt to spread negative news that address the\nproblems associated with the out-group and stress positive\naspects of the in-group itself. The efforts to educate a wider\naudience and promote positive self-image are commonly dis-\ncussed together by other researchers as well [18, 25]. We \ufb01nd\nthat hate groups use Twitter to predominantly share news from\nknown news media. They also dehumanize the out-group by\ndescribing them as inferior or immoral while presenting a pos-\nitive self-image through status enhancement and effectiveness\n(ef\ufb01cacy ) of their proposed solution (e.g., \u201c..doing the god\u2019s\nwork in \ufb01ghting the LGBT ma\ufb01a..\u201d or, \u201c..\ufb01ghting the good\n\ufb01ght..\u201d). Presenting positive self-image and ideology-aligning\ninformation can enable hate groups to appeal to the general\npublic. What better way to do that than to use Twitter to gently\ncoax the follower base into a more radical world of hate.\nEffects of the Current Censorship Models\nRecently, Facebook issued a wave of bans on known White\nSupremacists and neo-nazi account holders [22] which re-\nsulted in popularity of alternate platforms such as gab,bitchute\n(also demonstrated in our domain networks, see Figure 5). Par-\nticularly, a deeper look at messages annotated with policy and\n9\nmembership frames and the domains in the promotion category,\ndemonstrate that White Supremacy hate groups are quickly\nadapting and \ufb01nding ways to subvert censorship. Some ac-\ncounts offered detailed guides describing how to get around\ncensorship by installing Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and\nby avoiding using speci\ufb01c terms. We observe that promotion\nof alternate social media and ways to bypass censorship is only\nevident in White Supremacy accounts. Together these results\nsuggest that social media companies are selectively censor-\ning only one type of extreme ideology\u2014White Nationalists\u2014\nwhereas other hate groups are still thriving online and gaining\nfollowers. Should social media companies selectively ban\nspeci\ufb01c hate ideologies or, for that matter, any content that\noriginates from known hate groups? Policy experts have posed\nbilateral arguments around the notions of freedom of speech\nand a platform\u2019s responsibility in restricting and moderating\nhateful communication. For example, Aswad\u2019s work outlines\nseveral challenges associated with deriving meaningful online\ncontent moderation policies while also aligning them with\ninternational human rights law [1]. McDonald et al.\u2019s work\nalso laid out the challenges in online governance of extremist\ncontent, including lack of clear directive and the inability of\nmoderation algorithms to distinguish different types of extrem-\nism [36]. Together, our \ufb01ndings and discussion indicate the\nneed for further research exploring the design of online cen-\nsorship and moderation models\u2014one that carefully balances\nthe arguments around policy, human rights law, and the need\nto make online spaces safer for a diverse population.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR HCI RESEARCH\nTheoretical Implications\nResearchers argue that computer mediated communication\n(CMC) systems foster both positive and negative behavior\n[16]. Hence, understanding the patterns of the darker side of\nCMC is essential in maintaining a safe online experience. It\ncan also lead to meaningful inferences about behavior, speci\ufb01-\ncally behavior that may potentially result in of\ufb02ine violence;\nthe Pittsburgh synagogue, the New Zealand mosque, and the\nCharleston Church shooting are just a few of the many inci-\ndents, where law enforcement agencies found a direct connec-\ntion between online hate group messaging and of\ufb02ine violent\nactions [52]. By offering the annotation framework derived\nfrom Snow\u2019s [49] collective action frames, we hope to stimu-\nlate new research in the HCI and Social Computing community\nthat can further explore the theoretical underpinnings of the\nhate groups\u2019 collective action framing processes. Though our\nframework is iteratively developed, we do not claim that it is\ncomplete or that it can explain all possible dimensions of hate\ngroup communication. However, we hope to start a dialogue\nabout future Social Computing research that can take a framing\ntheory based analysis approach towards better understanding\nof online hate captured via computerized text.\nPractical Implications\nScholars studying collective action framing state that messages\nrich with frames have a strong mobilizing potential [50]. Such\nmessages combined with information from various biased\nnews sources, informational guides, and blogs can make for\nimpactful narratives of online hate. We believe that cross-\nplatform studies of both content and information\u2014such as thiswork\u2014can provide insights for building automated or semi-\nautomated tools to detect potentially mobilizing hate narratives\nonline. For instance, \ufb01nding lexical representations of the\nframing categories in our annotation scheme and situating that\nwith the political leaning and credibility of the domains shared,\ncan add explainability and context to the computational tools.\nNote on Ethics and Privacy\nThe concept of \u201conline hate\u201d has many ethical, social, le-\ngal, and technical layers. Moreover, the perception that all\nmessages by online hate groups are exclusively hateful is er-\nroneous [41]. In this work, we instead focus on analyzing the\noverall pragmatic aspects of online communication by ideo-\nlogically driven organizations that are labeled as hateful by\nSPLC[9]. The initial list of hate groups and all the further\ndata is publicly available, obtained without having to log-in\ninto any of the platforms. While public availability of the\ndata is an important consideration, whether to use the data\nor how to distribute it is open for debate. We consider two\naspects of the public data use: creators of the data and our\nintended use for it [23]. This data is posted by organizations\nthat could potentially contribute to social harm. Moreover we\nuse this data to primarily make observations without revealing\nthe account handles or the organization names. However, we\nacknowledge the need for further discussions to assess the\nethical implications for data driven research on social media.\nLIMITATIONS\nOur data is limited to 72 hate groups, constrained on a three-\nmonths time span and focused on only one source for identi-\nfying hate groups\u2014SPLC. Hence, we do not argue for gen-\neralizability across all possible hate communities in the U.S\nor its representativeness outside of the three months period.\nHowever, we want to note that the three months window was\nrandomly selected and was not marked by any major socio-\npolitical event that could have potentially affected our results.\nCONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK\nIn this work, we presented a cross-platform analysis of con-\ntent framing and information sharing practices of 72 SPLC\ndesignated hate groups spanning \ufb01ve ideologies, while lever-\naging three months of their public Facebook and Twitter posts.\nOur \ufb01ndings indicate that hate groups use the two platforms\ndifferently\u2014Facebook to radicalize already like-minded au-\ndience while Twitter to educate a more ideologically diverse\nset of followers. We see several research avenues that could\nemerge from our work. More advanced versions of framing\ntheory such as frame bridging (linking of framing processes\nacross multiple hate movements) or frame ampli\ufb01cation (trans-\nformation or evolution of framing processes over time) could\nbe used to see how hate groups with different ideologies\u2014but\noverlapping interests\u2014collectively advance shared narratives\nover time. Moreover, future work of developing a large scale\ndataset, annotated with frames and information sources, could\nform the basis of computationally modeling online hate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe want to thank our colleagues Dr. James Hawdon and\nJonathan Lloyd from the Sociology department, for their inputs\nin the initial development phases of the annotation scheme.\n10\nREFERENCES\n[1] Evelyn Mary Aswad. 2018.

This was the closest successful con\frmation to the court since\nthe Stanley Matthews con\frmation in 18811. Political polarization was clearly\nevident in the US Senate between Republicans, who overwhelmingly voted for\nKavanaugh, and Democrats, who overwhelmingly voted against him. In this pa-\nper, we wanted to quantify the political polarization between Twitter users, who\nvoiced their opinion about the nomination. Quanti\fcation involved: a) collecting\ntopically relevant tweets; b) ascertaining the stances of users; and c) properly\nquantifying polarization. For data collection, we collected more than 23 mil-\nlion tweets related to BK's nomination, and we semi-automatically tagged more\nthan 128 thousand Twitter users as supporting or opposing his con\frmation.\nWe initially manually tagged a small set of active users, then performed label\npropagation based on which tweets they retweet, and lastly used supervised clas-\nsi\fcation to tag a greater number of users based on the accounts they retweeted.\n1https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/Nominations.htmarXiv:2001.02125v1  [cs.SI]  5 Jan 2020\n2 K. Darwish\nAs for quanti\fcation, we modi\fed two existing polarization quanti\fcation mea-\nsures, namely Random Walk Controversy (RWC) and Embedding Controversy\n(EC) measures that were shown to be indicative of polarization [6]. Given a\ngraph of connected users, where users are the nodes and the weights of the edges\nare the similarities between users, RWC is computed based on the likelihood\nthat a shorter graph traversal can be made from a random user to a prominent\nuser with the same stance or to a prominent user with a di\u000berent stance. EC\nmaps users into a lower dimensional space and then computes a ratio of dis-\ntances between users with similar stances and users with di\u000berent stances. Due\nto the high computational complexity of the measures, we use user samples, and\nwe estimate the stability of the measures across: multiple samples and di\u000berent\nsample sizes. Further, we modify the original measures reported in the literature\nto make them more robust. We apply the modi\fed measures on the Twitter users\nwho actively discussed BK's nomination. We show strong polarization between\nboth camps particularly in terms of the accounts that users retweet.\nNext, we highlight polarization by bucketing hashtags, retweeted accounts,\nand cited websites according to how strongly they are associated with those\nwho supported or opposed the nomination. We show that the polarization of\nTwitter users caused them to retweet di\u000berent accounts, cite di\u000berent media\nsources, and use di\u000berent hashtags. In doing so, we highlight some of the main\ndi\u000berences between both groups. The contributions of the paper are:\n{We showcase e\u000bective semi-supervised user labeling that combines both mul-\ntiple label propagation iterations and supervised classi\fcation. We show the\ne\u000bectiveness of this combination in tagging more than 128 thousand users\nusing a very small initial set of manually tagged users.\n{We experimented with two reportedly e\u000bective polarization quanti\fcation\nmeasures, namely EC and RWC, elucidate their shortcomings on our dataset,\nand propose modi\fcations to make them more robust.\n{We analyze users who were vocal on Twitter concerning the BK nomination.\nWe characterize them in terms of the hashtags they use, the accounts they\nretweet, and the media sources that they cite.\n2 Background\n2.1 Stance Detection\nGiven the ubiquity of social media use, stance detection, which involves iden-\ntifying the position of a user towards an entity or a person, is emerging as a\nproblem of increasing interest in the literature. We are speci\fcally interested in\nstance detection on Twitter. Stance detection can be performed at user-level or\nat statement-level. For either case, classi\fcation can be performed using a vari-\nety of features such as textual features (e.g. words or hashtags), interaction-level\nfeatures, (e.g. relationships and retweeted accounts), and pro\fle-level features\n(e.g. user location and name) [1,10,11,14]. Typically, interaction-level features\nyield better results [10]. In a supervised setting, an initial set of statements\nQuantifying Polarization on Twitter 3\nand/or users are tagged with their stance, which is used to train a classi\fer\n[1,10]. This is appropriate for user-level and statement-level classi\fcation [12].\nAlternatively, so-called label propagation is used to propagate labels in a net-\nwork based on interactions between users such as follow or retweet relationships\n[1] or the retweeting of identical tweets [9,10]. Label propagation has been shown\nto produce highly accurate results. In this work, we manually tag an initial set\nof users, employ label propagation, and then use the output labels from label\npropagation to perform supervised classi\fcation. More recent work has focused\non unsupervised stance detection that involves creating a user-similarity network\nbased on interaction-level features, and then combines dimensionality reduction,\nsuch as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) or force-\ndirected (FD) graph placement, with clustering, such as mean shift, to identify\nusers who are strongly associated with speci\fc stances [5].\n2.2 Quantifying Polarization\nQuantifying polarization can help ascertain the degree to which users are separa-\nble based on their stances and how far apart they are. Though multiple measures\nhave been suggested for quantifying polarization, research on establishing widely\naccepted e\u000bective measures is still work in progress. Guerra et al. [7] introduced\na polarization measure that relies on identifying popular nodes that lie at the\nboundary between di\u000berent communities, where strong polarization is indicated\nby the absence of such nodes. Morales et al. [13] proposed a metric that measures\nthe relative sizes of groups with opposing views and the distance between their\n\\centers of gravity\". Garimella et al. explored a variety of controversy quan-\nti\fcation measures to ascertain their e\u000ecacy [6]. The measures rely on random\ngraph walks, network betweenness, and distances in embedding spaces. Given\ntheir reported success, we employ so-called Random Walk Controversy (RWC)\nand Embeddings Controversy (EC) measures [6] in this paper. Given the most\nconnected nodes in a graph, RWC uses the maximum likelihood estimates that a\nrandom element in one class would reach one of the most connected nodes in its\nclass \frst or one of the most connected nodes in the other class \frst. EC maps\nusers into a lower dimensional space and then computes a ratio of the inter- and\nintra-class distances between users. We propose modi\fcations to both measures\nto make them more computationally e\u000ecient and more robust. As we show in\nthe paper, aside from direct measures of polarization, the e\u000bects of polarization\ncan be observed in data [1,2,13,14]. For example, projecting users who engage\nin discussing a polarized topic on to a lower dimensional space can help visual-\nize such polarization and improve subsequent clustering [5,6]. Further, polarized\ngroups tend to share content from di\u000berent media sources and in\ruencers on\nsocial media, and often use di\u000berent words and hashtags.\n2.3 Topic Timeline\nOn July 9, 2018, Brett Kavanaugh (BK), a US federal judge, was nominated by\nthe US president Donald Trump to serve as a justice on the US supreme court\n4 K. Darwish\nto replace outgoing Justice Anthony Kennedy2. His nomination was marred by\ncontroversy with Democrats complaining that the White House withheld docu-\nments pertaining to BK's record and later a few women including a University\nof California professor accused him of sexual assault3. The accusations of sexual\nmisconduct led to a public congressional hearing on September 27, 2018 and a\nsubsequent investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The US\nSenate voted to con\frm BK to a seat on the Supreme Court on October 6 with\na 50{48 vote, which mostly aligned with party loyalties. BK was sworn in later\nthe same day.\n3 Data Collection\nWe collected tweets pertaining to the nomination of BK in two di\u000berent time\nepochs, namely September 28-30, which were the three days following the con-\ngressional hearing concerning the sexual assault allegation against BK, and Oc-\ntober 6-9, which included the day the Senate voted to con\frm BK and the\nsubsequent three days. We collected tweets using the twarc toolkit4, where we\nused both the search and \fltering interfaces to \fnd tweets related to the nomi-\nnation. The keywords we used included BK's name ( Kavanaugh ), his main ac-\ncuser ( Ford), the names of the members of the Senate's Judiciary Commit-\ntee (Blasey ,Grassley ,Hatch ,Graham ,Cornyn ,Lee,Cruz,Sasse ,Flake ,Crapo ,\nTillis ,Kennedy ,Feinstein ,Leahy ,Durbin ,Klobuchar ,Coons ,Blumenthal ,Hi-\nrono,Booker , and Harris ), and the words Supreme ,judiciary ,Whitehouse . Though\nsome of these terms are slightly more general (e.g. Ford or Whitehouse), poten-\ntially leading to non-relevant tweets, the public focus on the nomination during\nthe collection period would have minimized such an e\u000bect. The per day break-\ndown of the collected tweets is as follows:\n28-Sep 29-Sep 30-Sep 6-Oct 7-Oct 8-Oct 9-Oct Total\n5,961,549 4,815,160 1,590,522 2,952,581 3,448,315 2,761,036 1,687,433 23,216,596\nIn all, we collected 23 million tweets that were authored by 687,194 users.\nOur \frst step was to accurately label as many users as possible by their stance as\nsupporting (SUPP) or opposing (OPP) BK's con\frmation. The labeling process\nwas done in three steps, namely:\n1.Manual labeling of users. We manually labeled 43 users who had the most\nnumber of tweets in our collection. The labeling was performed by one annota-\ntor who is well-versed in American politics. Of them, the SUPP users were 29\ncompared to 12 OPP users. As for the two remaining users, one was neutral and\nthe other was a spammers.\n2.Label propagation. Label propagation automatically labels users based on\ntheir retweet behavior [3,9,10]. The intuition behind this method is that users\n2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh\n3https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/\nbrett-kavanaugh-accusers-women.html\n4https://github.com/edsu/twarc\nQuantifying Polarization on Twitter 5\nthat retweet the same tweets on a topic most likely share the same stance. Given\nthat many of the tweets in our collection were actually retweets or duplicates\nof other tweets, we labeled users who retweeted 15 or more tweets that were\nauthored or retweeted by the SUPP group or 7 or more times by OPP group\nand no retweets from the other side as SUPP or OPP respectively. We elected to\nincrease the minimum number for the SUPP group as they were over represented\nin the initial manually labeled set. Such manual tweaking is one of the draw-\nbacks of label propagation [5]. We iteratively performed such label propagation\n4 times, which is when label propagation stopped labeling new accounts. After\nthe last iteration, we were able to label 65,917 users of which 26,812 were SUPP\nand 39,105 were OPP. Since we don't have golden labels to compare against, we\nopted to spot check the results. Thus, we randomly selected 10 automatically\nlabeled accounts, and all of them were labeled correctly. We do more thorough\nchecks later. This labeling methodology naturally favors users who are more\nopinionated and vocal about a topic and hence hold strong views.\n3.Retweet-based classi\fcation. We used the labeled users to train a classi-\n\fcation model to guess the stances of users who retweeted at least 20 di\u000berent\naccounts, which were users who were actively tweeting about the topic. For clas-\nsi\fcation, we used the FastText classi\fcation toolkit, which is an e\u000ecient deep\nneural network classi\fer that has been shown to be e\u000bective for text classi\fca-\ntion [8]. We used the Twitter handles of the accounts that each user retweeted\nas features. Strictly using the retweeted accounts has been shown to be e\u000bective\nfor stance classi\fcation [10]. To keep precision high, we only trusted the clas-\nsi\fcation of users where the classi\fer was more than 90% con\fdent. In doing\nso, we increased the number of labeled users to 128,096, where 57,118 belonged\nto the SUPP group and 70,978 belonged to the OPP group. We manually and\nindependently labeled 100 random users, 50 from each class, who were automat-\nically tagged, and manual and automatic labeling agreed for 96 of them. It is\nnoteworthy that the relative number of SUPP to OPP users in not necessarily\nrepresentative of real life.\n4 Quantifying Polarization\nGiven the labeled users, we attempted to quantify the polarization between\nusers given the aforementioned EC and RWC measures. Both measures range\nbetween 0 (no polarization) and 1 (extreme polarization). Due to the compu-\ntational complexity of both measure, we resorted to computing the measures\non random samples of users. We wanted to ascertain: a) the sensitivity of the\nmeasures to the size of the samples; and b) to the stability of the measure across\ndi\u000berent samples.\nGiven a graph of users, as nodes, and edges between them, weighted by the sim-\nilarity between users, RWC is based on the maximum likelihood estimates that\na random element in one class would reach via a graph random walk one of the\nmost connected nodes in its class \frst or one of the most connected nodes in\nthe other class. The formulation of the score is: RWC =PAAPBB\u0000PABPBA,\n6 K. Darwish\nwhere AandBare di\u000berent classes and PXYis the probability that a random\nnode in Xwould reach a highly connected node in Y. We selected the top most\nconnected users in each class and an equal number of random users from each.\nTo compute cosine similarity, each user was represented by a vector of all the\nhashtags that they have used (H) or all the accounts that they have retweeted\n(R). We modi\fed the method of computing RWC in one important way, com-\npared to what is described in [6]. Namely, instead of relying on the minimum\nnumber of hops, traversed edges, required to link two users, for which we would\nhave needed to ascertain a minimum threshold for a link, we opted to use the\nminimum product of the weights of the edges to be traversed to link two users.\nThis is akin to computing the shortest path in a graph, and relieves us from\ntrying to determine appropriate thresholds and, as we show later, leads to more\nconsistent results. We computed the score of a full path as the product of cosine\nsimilarities along all the edges between the random node and one of the highly\nconnected nodes.\nEC on the other hand relies on projecting nodes based on their similarity into\na lower dimensional space, and then computing the average distances between\nmembers of the same class (inter-class) or members of di\u000berent classes (intra-\nclass). EC is computed as: EC= 1\u0000dA+dB\n2dAB, where dAanddBare the average\ninter-class distances and dABis the average intra-class distance. In the work of\n[6], they used force directed graph (FD) placement to perform dimensionality\nreduction. In this work, we use both FD as well as UMAP, which is more aggres-\nsive than FD in projecting similar users closer together while pushing dissimilar\nusers further apart. Once users are projected and hopefully separated in the\nlower dimensional space, we used Euclidean distance between them to measure\naverage inter- and intra-class distances. Due to the large number of users, it\nwas computationally prohibitive to project all users based on their similarity. To\novercome the computational issue, we opted to use a sample of users to compute\nEC. However, we wanted to ascertain the sensitivity of EC to sample size and\nits sensitivity to random user selection. Thus, for every sample size, we sampled\nusers 5 times and we computed the average EC and standard deviation across\nall samples. Table 1 lists the parameters we used for both RWC and EC. For\nsample sizes per class, we experimented with 500, 1,000, 2,610, and 5,000. Given\nthe size of our set of labeled users, roughly 128k, 2,610 is the size of a repre-\nsentative random sample of users with 99% con\fdence and a margin of error\n=\u00062:5.5We compared two sets of labeled users, namely after label propagation\nalone and after both label propagation and supervised classi\fcation.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the values of RWC and EC using di\u000berent parame-\nters respectively. As the graphs show, unlike EC, RWC values were fairly stable\nacross di\u000berent samples sizes and the standard deviation across multiple sam-\nples decreased as sample sizes increased. For RWC and EC and regardless of\nparameters, users showed higher polarization when we used retweeted accounts\nto compute similarity compared to when we used hashtags. This is consistent\nwith prior research which showed that retweets were more indicative of stance\n5Calculated using https://surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm\nQuantifying Polarization on Twitter 7\nTable 1.

Using labels from label propagation only led to higher val-\nues for both RWC and EC. This could be attributed to the tendency of label\npropagation to identify users with more pronounced views. As for EC, UMAP\ngenerally led to higher polarization scores compared to FD. This is an artifact\nof the algorithm as it attempts to push dissimilar nodes further apart. Figure 3\nillustrates this di\u000berence in projecting an identical sets of 5,000 users using FD\nand UMAP. The \fgure also shows how users are more separable when computing\ntheir similarity using retweets as opposed to hashtags. Further, di\u000berent samples\noften led to large standard deviation values for EC. This indicates that using a\nsingle sample to compute EC might not be su\u000ecient.\nTo compare RWC without modi\fcation (using similarities above a threshold\nto constitute a link between users) to our modi\fed version, Table 2 compares\nthe unmodi\fed version of RWC at di\u000berent thresholds with our modi\fed ver-\nsion using a sample of 5,000 users and all user labels for both Retweets and\nHashtags. As the results in the table show, minor modi\fcation to the threshold\ncan dramatically change the value of RWC, which is undesirable. Given all our\nanalysis, RWC seems to be a more consistent than EC, and when using EC, it\nis important to compute an average score across multiple user samples.\nTable 2.

Doing\nso can provide valuable insights into both groups [3,4]. For all three elements,\nwe bucketed them into \fve bins re\recting how strongly they are associated with\nthe SUPP and OPP groups. These bins are: strong SUPP, SUPP, Neutral, OPP,\nand strong OPP. To perform the bucketing, we used the so-called valence score\n[2], which is computed for an element eas follows:\nQuantifying Polarization on Twitter 9\n(a)FD using R\n (b)UMAP using R\n(c)FD using H\n (d)UMAP using H\nFig. 3.

SUPP\nand OPP users are coded with red and blue respectively.\nV(e) = 2tfSUPP\ntotalSUPP\ntfSUPP\ntotalSUPP+tfOPP\ntotalOPP\u00001 (1)\nwhere tfis the frequency of the element in either the SUPP or OPP tweets and\ntotal is the sum of all tfs for either the SUPP or OPP tweets. We accounted\nfor all elements that appeared in at least 100 tweets. Since the value of valence\nvaries between -1 (strong OPP) to +1 (strong SUPP), we divided the range into\n5 equal bins: strong OPP [-1.0 { -0.6), OPP [-0.6 { -0.2), Neutral [-0.2 { 0.2),\nSUPP [0.2 { 0.6), and strong SUPP [0.6 { 1.0].\nFigures 4 (a), (b) and (c) respectively provide the number of di\u000berent hash-\ntags, retweeted accounts, and cited websites that appear for all \fve bins along\nwith the number of tweets in which they are used. As the \fgures show, there\nis strong polarization between both camps. Polarization is most evident in the\naccounts that they retweet and the websites that they share content from, where\n\\strong SUPP\" and \\strong OPP\" groups dominate in terms of the number of\nelements and their frequency. This is consistent with the higher values we com-\nputed earlier for RWC and EC when using hashtags compared to retweets. If\npolarization was low, more neutral sources may have been cited more. Tables 3\nshows the 10 most commonly used hashtags, retweeted accounts, and most cited\nwebsites for each of the valence bands. Since the \\Strong SUPP\" and \\strong\nOPP\" groups are most dominant, we focus here on their main characteristics.\n10 K. Darwish\n(a)Hashtags\n (b)Retweeted Accounts\n (c)Cited Media\nFig. 4. Count of elements and the number of times they are used for di\u000berent valence\nbins\nFor the \\Strong SUPP\" group, the hashtags can be split into the following\ntopics (in order of importance as determined by frequency):\n{ Trump related: #MAGA (Make America Great Again), #Winning.\n{ Pro BK con\frmation: #Con\frmKavanaugh, #Con\frmKavanaughNow,\n#JusticeKavanaugh.\n{ Anti-DNC: #walkAway (from liberalism), #Democrats, #Feinstein\n{ Conspiracy theories: #QAnon (an alleged Trump administration leaker),\n#WWG1WGA (Where We Go One We Go All)\n{ Midterm elections: #TXSen (Texas republican senator Ted Cruz), #Mid-\nterms, #VoteRed2018 (vote Republican)\n{ Conservative media: #FoxNews, #LDTPoll (Lou Dobbs (FoxNews) on\nTwitter poll)\nIt is interesting to see hashtags expressing support for Trump (#MAGA and\n#Wining) feature more prominently than those that indicate support for BK.\nRetweeted accounts for the same group re\rect a similar trend:\n{ Trump related: realDonaldTrump, mitchellvii (Bill Mitchell: social media\npersonality who staunchly supports Trump), RealJack (Jack Murphy: co-\nowner of ILoveMyFreedom.org (pro-Trump website)), DineshDSouza (Di-\nnesh D'Souza: commentator and \flm maker)\n{ Conservative media: dbongino (Dan Bongino: author with podcast), FoxNews,\nFoxAndFriends (Fox News), JackPosobiec (Jack Posobiec: One America News\nNetwork), IngrahamAngle (Laura Ingraham: Fox News)\n{ Conservative/GOP personalities: charliekirk11 (Charlie Kirk: founder\nof Turning Point USA), AnnCoulter (Ann Coulter: author and commenta-\ntor), Thomas1774Paine (Thomas Paine: author), paulsperry (Paul Sperry:\nauthor and media personality), RealCandaceO (Candace Owens: Turning\nPoint USA), McAllisterDen (D.

Darwish\nFor the \\strong OPP\" , the top hashtags can be topically grouped as:\n{ Anti-BK: #DelayTheVote, #StopKavanaugh, #KavaNo (BK no), #voteNo.\n{ Republican Party related: #GOP, #SusanCollins (GOP senator voting\nfor BK).\n{ Sexual assault related: #BelieveSurvivors, #JulieSwetnick (BK accuser).\n{ Media related: #SNLPremiere (satirical show), #SNL, #SmartNews (anti-\nTrump/GOP news)\n{ Anti Trump: #TheResistance, #Resist\n{ Midterms: #vote, #voteBlue (vote democratic)\nAs the list shows, the most prominent hashtags were related to opposition to the\ncon\frmation of BK. Opposition to the Republican Party (#GOP) and Trump\n(#TheResistance) may indicate polarization.\nAs for their retweeted accounts, media related accounts dominated the list.\nThe remaining accounts belonged to prominent Democratic Party o\u000ecials and\nanti-Trump accounts. The details are as follows (in order of importance):\n{ Media related: krassenstein (Brian Krassenstein: HillReporter.com ), kyle-\ngri\u000en1 (Kyle Gri\u000en: MSNBC producer), theHill, EdKrassen (Ed Krassen-\nstein: HillReporter.com ), funder (Scott Dworkin: Dworkin Report and\nDemocratic Coallition), Lawrence (Lawrence O'Donnell: MSNBC), MSNBC,\nJoyceWhiteVance (Joyce Alene: professor and MSNBC contributor), Amy Siskind\n(Amy Siskind: The Weekly List)\n{ DNC: KamalaHarris (Senator), SenFeinstein (Senator Dianne Feinstein),\nTedLieu (Representative)\n{ Anti Kavanaugh: MichaelAvenatti (lawyer of BK accuser)\n{ Anti Trump: SethAbramson (author of \\Proof of Collusion\"), tribelaw\n(Laurence Tribe: Harvard Professor and author of \\To End a Presidency\")\nConcerning the cited media shown in Table 4, they were mostly left or left-\nof-center leaning sources. The credibility of the sources were generally higher\nthan those for the \\strong SUPP\" group.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we characterized the political polarization on Twitter concerning\nthe nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. We used\nthe automatically tagged set of more than 128 thousand Twitter users to as-\ncertain the robustness of two di\u000berent measures of polarization quanti\fcation.\nWe proposed changes to both measures to make them more e\u000ecient and more\ne\u000bective. We showed that those who support and oppose the con\frmation of\nKavanaugh were generally using divergent hashtags and were following di\u000berent\nTwitter accounts and media sources. For future work, we plan to look at di\u000ber-\nent topics with varying levels of polarization, as the Kavanaugh nomination was\na strongly polarizing topic.\nQuantifying Polarization on Twitter 13\nReferences\n1.

F.

To close this gap, we conduct a large-scale audit of\nuser radicalization on YouTube. We analyze 330,925 videos posted\non 349 channels, which we broadly classified into four types: Media,\nthe Alt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W.), and the Alt-right. Ac-\ncording to the aforementioned radicalization hypothesis, channels\nin the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite serve as gateways to fringe far-right\nideology, here represented by Alt-right channels. Processing 72M+\ncomments, we show that the three channel types indeed increas-\ningly share the same user base; that users consistently migrate\nfrom milder to more extreme content; and that a large percentage\nof users who consume Alt-right content now consumed Alt-lite\nand I.D.W. content in the past. We also probe YouTube\u2019s recom-\nmendation algorithm, looking at more than 2M video and channel\nrecommendations between May/July 2019. We find that Alt-lite con-\ntent is easily reachable from I.D.W. channels, while Alt-right videos\nare reachable only through channel recommendations. Overall, we\npaint a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on YouTube.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n\u2022Human-centered computing \u2192Empirical studies in collab-\norative and social computing .\nKEYWORDS\nRadicalization, hate speech, extremism, algorithmic auditing\n\u2217Work done mostly while at UFMG.1 INTRODUCTION\nVideo channels that discuss social, political and cultural subjects\nhave flourished on YouTube. Frequently, the videos posted in such\nchannels focus on highly controversial topics such as race, gender,\nand religion. The users who create and post such videos span a wide\nspectrum of political orientation, from prolific podcast hosts like\nJoe Rogan to outspoken advocates of white supremacy like Richard\nSpencer. These individuals not only share the same platform but\noften publicly engage in debates and conversations with each other\non the website [ 24]. This way, even distant personalities can be\nlinked in chains of pairwise co-appearances. For instance, Joe Rogan\ninterviewed YouTuber Carl Benjamin [ 35], who debated with white\nsupremacist Richard Spencer [6].\nAccording to Lewis [ 24], this proximity may create \u201cradicaliza-\ntion pathways\u201d for audience members and content creators. Exam-\nples of these journeys are plenty, including content creator Roosh\nV\u2019s trajectory from pick-up artist to Alt-right supporter [ 23,37] and\nCaleb Cain\u2019s testimony of his YouTube-driven radicalization [36].\nThe claim that there is a \u201cradicalization pipeline\u201d on YouTube\nshould be considered in the context of decreasing trust in main-\nstream media and increasing influence of social networks. Across\nthe globe, individuals are skeptical of traditional media vehicles\nand growingly consume news and opinion content on social me-\ndia [21,31]. In this setting, recent research has shown that fringe\nwebsites ( e.g.,4chan ) and subreddits ( e.g.,/r/TheDonald ) have great\ninfluence over which memes [ 43] and news [ 44] are shared in large\nsocial networks, such as Twitter. YouTube is extremely popular,\nespecially among children and teenagers [ 5], and if the streaming\nwebsite is actually radicalizing individuals this could push fringe\nideologies like white supremacy further into the mainstream [41].\nA key issue in dealing with topics like radicalization and hate\nspeech is the lack of agreement over what is \u201chateful\u201d or \u201cex-\ntreme\u201d [ 38]. A workaround is to perform analyses based on com-\nmunities , large sets of loosely associated content creators (here\nrepresented by their YouTube channels). For the purpose of this\nwork, we consider three \u201ccommunities\u201d that have been associated\nwith user radicalization [ 24,36,42] and that differ in the extremity\nof their content: the \u201cIntellectual Dark Web\u201d (I.D.W.), the \u201cAlt-lite\u201d\nand the \u201cAlt-right\u201d. While users in the I.D.W. discuss controversial\nsubjects like race and I.Q. [ 42] without necessarily endorsing ex-\ntreme views, members of the Alt-right sponsor fringe ideas like\nthat of a white ethnostate [ 18]. Somewhere in the middle, individ-\nuals of the Alt-lite deny to embrace white supremacist ideology,\nalthough they frequently flirt with concepts associated with it ( e.g.,\nthe \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d, globalist conspiracies).arXiv:1908.08313v4  [cs.CY]  21 Oct 2021\nHorta Ribeiro et al.\nPresent work. In this paper, we audit whether users are indeed\nbecoming radicalized on YouTube and whether the recommenda-\ntion algorithms contribute towards this radicalization. We do so\nby examining three prominent communities: the Intellectual Dark\nWeb, the Alt-lite and the Alt-right. More specifically, considering\nAlt-right content as a proxy for extreme content, we ask:\nRQ1 How have these channels grown on YouTube in the last\ndecade?\nRQ2 To which extent do users systematically gravitate towards\nmore extreme content?\nRQ3 Do algorithmic recommendations steer users towards more\nextreme content?\nWe develop a data collection process where we (i)acquire a large\npool of relevant channels from these communities; (ii)collect meta-\ndata and comments for each of the videos in the channels; (iii)an-\nnotate channels as belonging to several different communities; and\n(iv)collect YouTube video and channel recommendations. We also\ncollect traditional and alternative media channels for additional\ncomparisons. We use these as a sanity check to capture the growth\nof other content on YouTube, rather than trying to obtain similar\nusers in other channels. These efforts resulted in a dataset with\nmore than 72M comments in 330,925 videos of 349 channels and\nwith more than 2M video and 10K channel recommendations. Im-\nportantly, our recommendations do not account for personalization.\nWe analyze this large dataset extensively:\n\u2022We look at the growth of the I.D.W., the Alt-lite and the\nAlt-right throughout the last decade in terms of videos, likes\nand views, finding a steep rise in activity and engagement\nin the communities of interest when compared with the\nmedia channels. Moreover, comments per view seem to be\nparticularly high in more extreme content, reaching near to\n1 comment for every 5 views in Alt-right channels in 2018\n(Sec. 4).\n\u2022We inspect the intersection of commenting users across the\ncommunities, finding they increasingly share the same user\nbase. Analyzing the overlap between the sets of comment-\ning users, we find that approximately half of the users who\ncommented on Alt-right channels in 2018 also comment on\nAlt-lite and on I.D.W. channels (Sec. 5).\n\u2022We also find that the intersection is not only growing due\nto new users but that there is significant user migration\namong the communities being studied. Users that initially\ncomment only on content from the I.D.W. or the Alt-lite\nthroughout the years consistently start to comment on Alt-\nright content. These users are a significant fraction of the\nAlt-right commenting user base. This effect is much stronger\nthan for the large traditional and alternative media channels\nwe collected (Sec. 6).\n\u2022Lastly, we take a look at the impact of YouTube\u2019s recommen-\ndation algorithms, running simulations on recommendation\ngraphs. Our analyses show that, particularly through the\nchannel recommender system, Alt-lite channels are easily\ndiscovered from I.D.W. channels, and that Alt-right channels\nmay be reached from the two other communities (Sec. 7).This is, to our best knowledge, the first large scale quantitative\naudit of user radicalization on YouTube. We find strong evidence\nfor radicalization among YouTube users, and that YouTube\u2019s recom-\nmender system enables Alt-right channels to be discovered, even\nin a scenario without personalization. We discuss our findings and\nour limitations further in Sec. 8. We argue that commenting users\nare a good enough proxy to measure the user radicalization, as\nmore extreme content seems to beget more comments. Moreover,\nregardless of the degree of influence of the recommender system in\nthe process of radicalizing users, there is significant evidence that\nusers are reaching content sponsoring fringe ideologies from the\nAlt-lite and the Intellectual Dark Web.\n2 BACKGROUND\nContrarian communities. We discuss three of YouTube\u2019s promi-\nnent communities: the Intellectual Dark Web, the Alt-lite and the\nAlt-right. We argue that all of them are contrarians , in the sense\nthat they often oppose mainstream views or attitudes. According\nto Nagle, these communities flourished in the wave of \u201canti-PC\u201d\nculture of the 2010s, where social-political movements (e.g. the\ntransgender rights movement, the anti-sexual assault movement)\nwere portrayed as hysterical, and their claims, as absurd [30].\nAccording to the Anti Defamation League [ 3], the Alt-Right is a\nloose segment of the white supremacist movement consisting of\nindividuals who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of politics\nthat embrace racist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist ideology.\nThe Alt-right skews younger than other far-right groups, and has\na big online presence, particularly on fringe web sites like 4chan ,\n8chan and certain corners of Reddit [2].\nThe term Alt-lite was created to differentiate right-wing activists\nwho deny embracing white supremacist ideology. Atkison argues\nthat the Unite the Rally in Charlottesville was deeply related to this\nchange, as participants of the rally revealed the movement\u2019s white\nsupremacist leanings and affiliations [ 8]. Alt-right writer and white\nsupremacist Greg Johnson [ 3] describes the difference between\nAlt-right and Alt-lite by the origin of its nationalism: \"The Alt-\nlite is defined by civic nationalism as opposed to racial nationalism,\nwhich is a defining characteristic of the Alt-right\" . This distinction\nwas also highlighted in [ 28]. Yet it is important to point out that\nthe line between the Alt-right and the Alt-lite is blurry [ 3], as\nmany Alt-liters are accused of dog-whistling: attenuating their real\nbeliefs to appeal to a more general public and to prevent getting\nbanned [ 22,25]. To address this problem, in this paper we take\na conservative approach to our labeling, naming only the most\nextreme content creators as Alt-right.\nThe \u201cIntellectual Dark Web\u201d (I.D.W.) is a term coined by Eric\nWeinstein to refer to a group of academics and podcast hosts [ 42].\nThe neologism was popularized in a New York Times opinion arti-\ncle [42], where it is used to describe \u201ciconoclastic thinkers, academic\nrenegades and media personalities who are having a rolling con-\nversation about all sorts of subjects, [. . . ] touching on controversial\nissues such as abortion, biological differences between men and\nwomen, identity politics, religion, immigration, etc.\u201d\nThe group described in the NYT piece includes, among others,\nSam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, and Joe\nAuditing Radicalization Pathways on YouTube\nRogan, and also mentions a website with an unofficial list of mem-\nbers [ 7]. Members of the so-called I.D.W. have been accused of\nespousing politically incorrect ideas [ 9,15,26]. Moreover, a re-\ncent report by the Data & Society Research Institute has claimed\nthese channels are \u201cpathways to radicalization\u201d [ 24], acting as entry\npoints to more radical channels, such as those in Alt-right. Broadly,\nmembers of this loosely defined movement see these criticisms as\na consequence of discussing controversial subjects [ 42], and some\nhave explicitly dismissed the report [ 40]. Similarly to what happens\nbetween Alt-right and Alt-lite, there are also blurry lines between\nthe I.D.W. and the Alt-lite, especially for non-core members, such\nas those listed on the aforementioned website [ 7]. To break ties, we\nlabel borderline cases as Alt-lite.\nRadicalization. We consider the definition given by McCauley\nand Moskalenko [ 29]: (\u201cFunctionally, political radicalization is in-\ncreased preparation for and commitment to intergroup conflict.\nDescriptively, radicalization means change in beliefs, feelings, and\nbehaviors in directions that increasingly justify intergroup violence\nand demand sacrifice in defense of the ingroup.\u201d) and use increased\nconsumption of Alt-right content as a proxy for radicalization. This\nis reasonable since the Alt-right\u2019s rhetoric has been invoked by the\nperpetrators of some recent terrorist attacks ( e.g.the Christchurch\nmosque shooting [ 27]), and since it champions ideas promoting\nintergroup conflict ( e.g.a white ethnostate [ 18]). Our conserva-\ntive strategy when labeling channels is of particular importance\nhere: Alt-right channels are closely related to these ideas, while the\nAlt-lite/I.D.W. are given the benefit of doubt.\nAuditing the web. As algorithms play an ever-larger role in our\nlives, it is increasingly important for researchers and society at large\nto reverse engineer algorithms\u2019 input-output relationships [ 13]. Pre-\nvious large scale algorithmic auditing include measuring discrimi-\nnation on AirBnB [ 14], personalization on web search [ 19] and price\ndiscrimination on e-commerce web sites [ 20]. We argue this work\nis an audit in the sense that it measures a troublesome phenome-\nnon (user radicalization) in a content-sharing social environment\nheavily influenced by algorithms (YouTube). Unfortunately, it is\nnot possible to obtain the entire history of YouTube recommenda-\ntion, so we must limit the algorithmic analyses to a time slice of\na constantly changing black-box. Although comments may give\nus insight into the past, it is challenging to tease apart the influ-\nence of the algorithm in previous times. Another limitation of our\nauditing is that we do not account for user personalization. De-\nspite these flaws, we argue that: (i)our analyses provide answers\nto important questions related with impactful societal processes\nthat are allegedly happening in YouTube (regardless of the impact\nof the recommender system), and (ii)our framework for auditing\nuser radicalization can be replicated through time and expanded to\nhandle personalization.\nPrevious research from/on YouTube. Previous work by Google\nsheds light into some of the high-level technicalities of YouTube\u2019s\nrecommender system [ 11,12]. Their latest paper indicates they\nuse embeddings for video searches and video histories as inputs\nfor a dense neural network [ 12]. There also exists a large body of\nwork studying violent [ 16], hateful or extremist [ 4,39] and dis-\nturbing content [ 34] on the platform. Much of the existing work\nfocuses on creating detection algorithms for these types of contentusing features of the comments, the commenting users and the\nvideos [ 4,16]. Sureka et al. [ 39] use a seed-expanding methodology\nto track extremist user communities, which yielded high precision\nin including relevant users. This is somewhat analogous to what\nwe do, although we use YouTube\u2019s recommender system while they\nuse user friends, subscriptions and favorites. Ottoni et al. perform\nan in-depth textual analysis of 23 channels (13 broadly defined\nas Alt-right), finding significantly different topics across the two\ngroups [ 32]. O\u2019Callegan et al. [ 33] simulate a recommender sys-\ntem with channels tweeted in an extreme right dataset. They show\nthat a simple non-negative matrix factorization metadata-based\nrecommender system would cluster extreme right topics together.\n3 DATA COLLECTION\nWe are interested in three communities on YouTube: the I.D.W., the\nAlt-lite, and the Alt-right. Identifying such communities and the\nchannels which belong to them is no easy task: the membership of\nchannels to these communities is volatile and fuzzy, and there is\ndisagreement between how members of these communities view\nthemselves, and how they are considered by scholars and the media.\nThese particularities make our challenge multi-faceted: on one hand,\nwe want to study user radicalization, and determine, for example,\nif users who start watching videos by communities like the I.D.W.\neventually go on to consume Alt-right content. On the other, there\nis often no clear agreement on who belongs to which community.\nDue to these nuances, we devise a careful methodology to (a)col-\nlect a large pool of relevant channels; (b)collect data and the rec-\nommendations given by YouTube for these channels; (c)manually\nlabeling these channels according to the communities of interest.\n(a)For each community, we create a pool of channels as follows.\nWe refer to channels obtained in the \ud835\udc56-th step as Type \ud835\udc56channels.\n(1)We choose a set of seed channels . Seeds were extracted from the\nI.D.W. unofficial website [ 7], Anti Defamation League\u2019s report\non the Alt-lite/the Alt-right [ 3] and Data & Society\u2019s report on\nYouTube Radicalization [ 24]. We pick popular channels that\nare representative of the community we are interested in. Each\nseed was independently annotated two times and discarded\nin case there was any disagreement. We further detail the\nannotation process later in this section.\n(2)We choose a set of keywords related to the sub-communities.\nFor each keyword, we use YouTube\u2019s search functionality and\nconsider the first 200results in English. We then add channels\nthat broadly relate in topic to the community in question. For\nexample, for the Alt-right, keywords included both terms asso-\nciated with their narratives, such as The Jewish Question and\nWhite Genocide, as well as the names or nicknames of famous\nAlt-righters, such as weev andChristopher Cantwell.\n(3)We iteratively search the related and featured channels col-\nlected in steps (1) and (2), adding relevant channels (as defined\nin 2). Note that these are two ways channel can link to each\nother. Featured channels may be chosen by YouTube content\ncreators: if your friend has a channel and you want to support\nit, you can put it on your \"Featured Channels\" tab. Related\nchannels are created by YouTube\u2019s recommender system.\n(4)We repeat step (3), iteratively collecting another hop of fea-\ntured/recommended channels from those obtained in (3).\nHorta Ribeiro et al.\nTable 1: Top 16YouTube channels with the most views per each community and for media channels.\nAlt-right Views Alt-lite View Intellectual Dark Web Views Media Views\n1 James Allsup 62M StevenCrowder 727M PowerfulJRE 1B vox 1B\n2 Black Pigeon Speaks 50M Rebel Media 405M JRE Clips 717M gq magazine 1B\n3 ThuleanPerspective 45M Paul Joseph Watson 356M PragerUniversity 635M vice news 1B\n4 Red Ice TV 42M MarkDice 334M The Daily Wire 247M wired magazine 1B\n5 The Golden One 12M SargonofAkkad100 258M The Rubin Report 206M vanity fair 639M\n6 AmRenVideos 9M Stefan Molyneux 193M ReasonTV 138M the verge 636M\n7 NeatoBurrito Productions 7M hOrnsticles3 145M JordanPetersonVideos 90M glamour magazine 620M\n8 The Last Stand 7M MILO 133M Bite-sized Philosophy 62M business insider 523M\n9 MillennialWoes 6M Styxhexenhammer666 132M Owen Benjamin 35M huffington post 329M\n10 Mark Collett 6M OneTruth4Life 112M AgatanFoundation 33M today i found out 328M\n11 AustralianRealist 5M No Bullshit 104M Essential Truth 32M cbc news 324M\n12 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py 5M SJWCentral 90M Ben Shapiro 30M the guardian 300M\n13 Prince of Zimbabwe 5M Computing Forever 87M YAFTV 30M people magazine 287M\n14 The Alternative Hypothesis 5M The Thinkery 86M joerogandotnet 25M big think 258M\n15 Matthew North 4M Bearing 81M TheArchangel911 24M cosmopolitan 256M\n16 Faith J Goldy 4M RobinHoodUKIP 64M Clash of Ideas 24M global news 252M\nThe annotation process done here followed the same instructions as\nthe one explained in detail for data collection step (c). Steps (2)\u2014(4),\nwere done by a co-author with more than 50hours of watch-time\nof the communities of interest. Notice that, in steps (2)\u2014(4), we\nare not labeling the channels, but creating a pool of channels to be\nfurther inspected and labeled in subsequent steps. The complete\nlist of seeds obtained from (1) and of keywords used in (2) may\nbe found in Appendix A. A clear distinction between featured and\nrecommended channels may be found in Appendix B.\n(b)For each channel, we collect the number of subscribers and\nviews, and for their videos, all the comments and captions. Video\nand channel recommendations were collected separately using\ncustom-made crawlers. We collected multiple \"rounds\" of recom-\nmendations, 22for channel recommendations and 19for video\nrecommendations. Each \"round\" consists of collecting all recom-\nmended channels (on the channel web page) and all recommended\nvideos (on the video web page). To circumvent possible location\nbias in the data we collected we used VPNs from 7 different loca-\ntions: 3 in the USA, 2 in Canada, 1 in Switzerland and 1 in Brazil.\nMoreover, channels were always visited in random order, to prevent\nany biases from arising from session-based recommendations. As\nwe extensively discuss throughout the paper, this does not include\npersonalization, as we do not log in into any account.\n(c)Channel labeling was done in multiple steps. All channels are\neither seeds ( Type 1 ) or obtained through YouTube\u2019s recommen-\ndation/search engine ( Types 2 and 3) . Notice that Type 1 channels\nwere assigned labels at the time of their collection. For the others,\nwe had 2 of the authors annotate them carefully. They both had\nsignificant experience with the communities being studied, and\nwere given the following instructions:\nCarefully inspect each one of the channels in this table, tak-\ning a look at the most popular videos, and watching, alto-\ngether, at least 5 minutes of content from that channel. Then\nyou should decide if the channel belongs to the Alt-right, the\nAlt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W.), or whether you\nthink it doesn\u2019t fit any of the communities. To get a grasp\non who belongs to the I.D.W., read [ 42], and check out thewebsite with some of the alleged members of the group [ 7].\nYet, we ask you to consider the label holistically, including\nchannels that have content from these creators and with a\nsimilar spirit to also belong in this category. To distinguish\nbetween the Alt-right and the Alt-lite, read [ 3] and [ 28]. It\nis important to stress the difference between civic national-\nism and racial nationalism in that case. Please consider the\nAlt-right label only to the most extreme content. You are\nencouraged to search on the internet for the name of the\ncontent creator to help you make your decision.\nThe annotation process lasted for 3 weeks. In case they disagreed,\nthey had to discuss the cases individually until a conclusion was\nreached. Interanotator agreement was of 75.57%(95%CI[67.5,82.5]).\nWe ended up with 85I.D.W., 112Alt-lite and 84Alt-right channels.\nMedia. We also collect popular media channels. These were ob-\ntained from the mediabiasfactcheck.com [1]. For each media source\nof the categories on the website ( Left, Left-Center, Center, Right-\nCenter, Right ) we search for its name on YouTube and consider it if\nthere is a match in the first page of results [ 1]. Some of the channels\nwere not considered because they had too many videos ( 15,000+)\nand we were not able to retrieve them all (which is important, be-\ncause our analyses are temporal). In total, we collect 68channels\nthat way. We use these media channels as a sanity check to capture\ngeneral trends among more mainstream YouTube channels.\nWe summarize the dataset collected in the Tab. 2. Data collection\nwas performed during the 19-30th of May 2019, and the collection\nof the recommendations between May-July 2019.\nTable 2: Overview of our dataset.\nChannels 349 Video Recs rounds 19\nVideos 330,925 Video Recs 2,474,044\nComments 72,069,878 Channel Recs Rounds 22\nCommenting users 5,980,709 Channel Recs 14,283\nAuditing Radicalization Pathways on YouTube\n080910111213141516171819050100(a) Active Channels\n080910111213141516171819101K100K(b) Videos Published\n08091011121314151617181910010K1M100M(c) Like CountAlt-right Alt-lite Intellectual Dark Web Media\n08091011121314151617181910K10M10B(d) View Count\n08091011121314151617181910K1M(e) Comment Count\n08091011121314151617181901K2K(f) Likes/Video\n080910111213141516171819050K100K(g) Views/Video\n08091011121314151617181940%60%80%100%(h) CCDF Videos Pub.\n0809101112131415161718190250500750(i) Comments/Video\n0809101112131415161718190.0000.0050.0100.015(j) Comments/View\nFigure 1: On the top row figures (a)\u2014(e), for each community and media channels, we have the cumulative number of active\nchannels (that posted at least one video), of videos published, of likes, views and of comments. In the bottom row, we have\nengagement metrics (accumulated over time), (figures (f), (g), (i) and (j)) and the CCDF of videos published, zoomed in the\nrange[40%,100%]on the y-axis (figure (h)). Notice that for comments, we know only the year when they were published, and\nthus the CDFs granularity is coarser (years rather than seconds). The raw numbers of views, likes, videos published and more\nare shown in Appendix C\n4 THE RISE OF CONTRARIANS\nWe present an overview of the channels in the communities of\ninterest, and show results about their growth in the last years,\nsetting the stage to more in-depth analyses in later sections. Tab. 1\nshows the 16most viewed YouTubers for each of the communities\nand for the media channels, and Figure 1 shows information on\nthe number of videos published, channels created, likes, views, and\ncomments per year, as well as several engagement metrics.\nRecent rise in activity. Figs. 1(a)\u2014(e) show the rise in channel\ncreation, video publishing, likes, views, and comments in the last\ndecade. The four latter are growing exponentially for all the commu-\nnities of interest and for the media channels. Noticeably, the rise in\nthe number of active channels is much more recent for the commu-\nnities of interest than for media channels, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In\nmid 2015, for example, 66out of the 68of the media channels were\nactive (posted their first video), while less than 50%of the Alt-lite,\nAlt-right and I.D.W. channels had done so. This growth in the com-\nmunities of interest during 2015 may also be noted in Fig. 1(i), which\nshows the CDF of number comments per videos, and can also be\nseen between early 2014 and late 2016 in Figs. 1(f)\u2014(g), which show\nthe number of likes and views per video, respectively. Notice that\nthe number of likes and views is obtained during data collection,\nand thus, it might be that older videos from those channels became\npopular later. Altogether, our data corroborates with the narrative\nthat these communities gained traction in (and fortified) Donald\nTrump\u2019s campaign during the 2016 presidential elections [10, 17].\nEngagement. A key difference between the communities of inter-\nest and the media channels is the level of engagement with the\nvideos, as portrayed by the number of likes per video, comments\nper video and comments per view, shown in Figs. 1 (f), (i), and\n(j), respectively. For all these metrics, the communities of interest\nhave more engagement than the media channels: Although mediachannels have more views per video, as shown in Figs. 1(g), these\nviews are less often converted into likes and comments. Notably,\nAlt-right channels have, since 2017, become the ones with the high-\nest number of comments per view, with nearly 1comment per 5\nviews by 2018.\nDormant Alt-right Channels. Although by 2013, approximately\nthe same number of channels of all three communities had become\nactive (\u223c30), as it can be seen in Fig. 1(a), the number of videos\nthey published by the Alt-right was low before 2016. This can be\nseen in the CCDF in Fig. 1(h): while media and Alt-lite channels had\npublished nearly 40%of their content, the Alt-right had published\na bit more than 20%. This is not because the most popular channels\ndid not yet exist: 4 out of the 5 current top Alt-right channels\n(accumulating approximately 150M views) had already been created\nby 2013. Moreover, it is noteworthy that many of the channels now\ndedicated to Alt-right content have initial videos related to other\nsubjects. Take for example the channel \u201cThe Golden One\u201d, number\n5in Tab. 1. Most of the initial videos in the channel are about\nworking out or video-games, with politics related videos becoming\nincreasingly occurring. The growth in engagement metrics such as\nlikes per video and comments per video of the Alt-right succeeds\nthat of the I.D.W. and of the Alt-lite, resonating with the narrative\nthat the rise of Alt-Lite and I.D.W. channels created fertile grounds\nfor individuals with fringe ideas to prosper [24, 30].\nAlthough our data-driven analysis sheds light on existing nar-\nratives on the communities of interest, it is still impossible to de-\ntermine, from these simple CDFs, whether there is a radicalization\npipeline. To do so, in the following two sections, we dig deeper into\nthe relationship between these communities looking closely at the\nusers who commented on them.\nHorta Ribeiro et al.\n080910111213141516171810010K1Mper Year\n(a) Commenting UsersAlt-right Alt-lite I.D.W.

In (b)\u2014(d)we show two similarity metrics (Jaccard and Overlap Coefficient) for\ndifferent pairs of sets of commenting users across the years. In (b)these pairs are the sets of users of each community in\nsubsequent years. In (c)these pairs are the sets of users of each one of the communities of interest. In (d)these pairs are the\nsets of users of the communities compared with the users who commented in media channels.\n5 USER INTERSECTION\nWe begin our in-depth analysis of users who commented on the\nchannels of interest by analysing the intersection between the users\nin different channels and communities. In that context, we use\ntwo set similarity metrics: the Jaccard Similarity|\ud835\udc34\u2229\ud835\udc35|\n|\ud835\udc34\u222a\ud835\udc35|; and the\nOverlap Coefficient|\ud835\udc34\u2229\ud835\udc35|\nmin(|\ud835\udc34|,|\ud835\udc35|). Notice that the overlap coefficient\nis particularly useful to compare communities of different sizes.\nFor example, a small subset of a large set may yield low Jaccard\nSimilarity, but will necessarily yield an Overlap Coefficient of 1.\nColumn (a) of Fig. 2 characterizes commenting users. The top plot\nshows the absolute number of commenting users per year, while\nthe bottom one shows the CDF of the number of comments per user\nper community. It is interesting to compare these plots with that of\nFig. 1(e), as we can see that the communities of interest have many\nmore highly active commenters. This supports the hypothesis that\nusers who consume content in the communities of interest are more\n\"engaged\" than those who consume the content from the media\nchannels. Notice also that, although the Alt-right commenters have,\non average, fewer comments than those in Alt-lite or the I.D.W., the\ncommunity is much younger (as discussed in Sec. 4), and thus it is\nhard to tell whether their users are less engaged.\nIn columns (b)\u2014(d) of Fig. 2 we consider the intersection between\nthe commenting users of the I.D.W., the Alt-lite, the Alt-right and\nmedia channels. The top figure for each column shows the Jaccard\nSimilarity and the bottom one shows the Overlap Coefficient.\nColumn (b) in Fig. 2 shows the similarity measures for a commu-\nnity with itself a year before (which here we name self-similarity).\nWe find that the retention of users among the three communities is\ngrowing with time for both metrics. However, for media channels,\nwe find that the Jaccard similarity is plateauing since 2014 and that\nthe overlap coefficient only recently started to grow, perhaps due\nto the sharp increase in commenting users since 2015. Commentingusers from the communities of interest seem to go back more often\nthan those in media channels.\nColumn (c) in Fig. 2 shows the pairwise similarity between the\nthree communities. Notably, in 2018, the Jaccard Similarity between\nthe Alt-lite and the I.D.W. reached almost 30%, which is more than\nthe self-similarity between the two communities. Moreover, the\nOverlap Coefficient of the Alt-right with the Alt-lite and the I.D.W\nis high: reaching around 50%in 2018. This means around half of\nthe users who commented in Alt-right channels commented in the\nother communities.\nLastly, column (d) in Fig. 2 shows the similarity of the three com-\nmunities with the media channels. We have that the Jaccard simi-\nlarity between the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite and the media channels is\nnot so different from the similarity between these communities and\nthe Alt-right. This is a subtle finding. On one hand, it means that\nindividuals in these communities make up a significant portion of\nthe massive media channels we collected, which gather billions of\nviews. These communities do not exist in a vacuum but are part of\nthe existing online information environment. On the other, it shows\nthat the Alt-right, a group of channels with order of magnitudes\nfewer views, subscribers and comments, are actually on par with\nthese large channels. Inspecting the Overlap Coefficient, however,\nwe get a different view: there we have that the communities overlap\nmore with themselves than with the media channels, particularly\nsince 2015 . However, in 2018 , there is a sharp growth in the simi-\nlarity with media channels. A hypothesis for this is that, as these\nchannels grew more popular (as previously discussed in Sec. 4, they\nbecame more mainstream).\nThese analyses take us one step further in understanding the\ncommunities being studied. We again see that their users are more\nengaged, and, notably, find that the I.D.W, the Alt-lite, and the\nAlt-right increasingly share the same commenting user base.\nAuditing Radicalization Pathways on YouTube\n0%4%8%12%Alt-lite or\nI.D.W.\nStart: 2006-2012\n Start: 2013-2015Exposure: Light Mild Severe\nStart: 2016\n Start: 2017\n0%4%8%12%Alt-lite\n0%4%8%12%I.D.W.\n2006-2012 2013-2015 2016 2017 20180%4%8%12%Media\n2013-2015 2016 2017 2018\n 2016 2017 2018\n 2017 2018\nFigure 3: We show how users migrate towards Alt-right content. For users who consumed only videos in the communities\nindicated by the labels in the rows (Alt-lite or I.D.W., Alt-lite, I.D.W., and Media), we show the chance that they go on to\nconsume Alt-right content. We consider three levels of exposure: light (commented in 1 to 2 Alt-right videos), mild (3 to 5) and\nsevere (6+). Each column tracks users on a different starting date. Initially, their exposure rates are 0 (as they did not consume\nany Alt-right content). As time passes, we show the exposure rates in the y-axis, for each of the years, in the x-axis. Line widths\nrepresent 95%confidence intervals.\n6 USER MIGRATION\nIn the previous section, we showed that the commenting user bases\namong the I.D.W., the Alt-lite, and the Alt-right are increasingly\nsimilar \u2014and the effect is stronger than for media channels. This\nindicates that there is a growing percentage of users consuming ex-\ntreme (Alt-right) content on YouTube while also consuming content\nfrom other milder communities (Alt-lite/I.D.W.). Yet, it does not, per\nse, indicate that there is a radicalization pipeline on the website. It\ncould be, for example, that new users who join the website go on to\nconsume content from all three communities. To better address this\nquestion, we find users who did not comment in Alt-right content\nin a given year and track their subsequent activity. Notice that we\ndo not have the user\u2019s entire activity history, and thus, we track\ntheir activity only in the channels whose videos we collected.\nFor four time brackets [(2006\u22122012),(2013\u22122015),(2016),(2017)]\nwe track four sets of users: those who only commented on videos\nof the Alt-lite or the I.D.W, those who did so only for videos on\nthe Alt-lite, those who did so only for videos on the I.D.W., and\nthose who commented only on videos of the media channels. Then,\nfor subsequent years, we track the same users. Notice that when\nusers are tracked for one year they are not eligible for selection\nin upcoming years. We consider these users to be exposed if they\ncommented on 1-2(light), 3-5(mild) or 6+(severe) Alt-right videos.\nThe results for this analysis are shown in Fig. 3. We show the\npercentage of users we managed to track that were exposed. The\nnumber of users tracked and exposed at each step may be found\nin Appendix C. Consider, for example, users who on 2006\u22122012\ncommented only on I.D.W. or Alt-lite content (227,945 users), asshown in the subplot in the first column and the first row. By\n2018 , around 10%were lightly exposed, and roughly 4%severely\nor mildly so \u2014 which amounts to approximately 9K users in total.\nFrom the ones who in 2017 commented only on Alt-lite or I.D.W.\nvideos (1,251,674 users), as shown in the last column of the first\nrow, approximately 12%of them were exposed \u2014 more than 60K\nusers altogether.\nWe also find that media channels present lower exposure rates, as\ncan be seen in the last row of the figure. The difference is particularly\nlarge for the last three time brackets. Less than 1%of users in media\nchannels were mildly or severely exposed, against 3%to4%for\nAlt-lite or I.D.W. users, and roughly 4%were lightly exposed versus\napproximately 8%for Alt-lite or I.D.W users.\nWhen teasing apart users that commented only on Alt-lite or\nonly on I.D.W. content, we find that, not only users who commented\nonly on I.D.W. get less exposed, but increasingly less so. The same\napplies to the media channels. For example, the exposure rates of\nusers who watched only Alt-lite (second row) or only I.D.W. (third\nrow) content are much more similar for those tracked in 2006\u22122012\n(first column) than for those tracked in 2017 (last column). For users\nwho were tracked in 2006\u22122012, around 15%were exposed in both\nscenarios, while for those tracked in 2017 , this difference grew\nfarther apart (\u223c12%Alt-lite vs.\u223c6%I.D.W.).\nThe previous study suggests that the pipeline effect does exist,\nand that indeed, users systematically go from milder communities to\nthe Alt-right. However, it does not give insight into how expressive\nthe effect is in terms of what part of the Alt-right user base has\ngone through it. We address this question by tracking users exactly\nas we did before, and then analyzing what percentage of exposed\nHorta Ribeiro et al.\n0%10%20%30%Alt-lite or\nI.D.W.\n(0.0%) (5.9%) (20.4%) (33.0%) (37.8%)Light Exposure\n(0.0%) (7.0%) (25.2%) (38.9%) (44.9%)Mild Exposure\nStart: 2006-2012 Start: 2013-2015 Start: 2016 Start: 2017\n(0.0%) (8.1%) (25.1%) (36.1%) (43.0%)Severe Exposure\n0%6%12%18%Alt-lite\n(0.0%) (4.0%) (10.7%) (19.3%) (23.2%)\n (0.0%) (4.7%) (12.1%) (20.9%) (26.3%)\n (0.0%) (5.4%) (11.8%) (17.8%) (23.8%)\n0%1.5%3%4.5%I.D.W.\n(0.0%) (1.1%) (3.8%) (5.2%) (7.0%)\n (0.0%) (1.2%) (4.2%) (5.3%) (6.7%)\n (0.0%) (1.3%) (3.8%) (4.7%) (5.6%)\n2006-2012 2013-2015 2016 2017 20180%1.5%3%4.5%Media\n(0.0%) (2.2%) (4.0%) (4.3%) (5.5%)\n2006-2012 2013-2015 2016 2017 2018\n(0.0%) (2.3%) (3.7%) (4.0%) (4.9%)\n2006-2012 2013-2015 2016 2017 2018\n(0.0%) (2.5%) (3.4%) (3.5%) (4.1%)\nFigure 4: We show how expressive the tracked users are in terms of the Alt-right user base. Each row shows a different condition\nfor tracking users and each column shows a different level of exposure. Each line corresponds to users tracked at a different\nstarting date (in the x-axis), and the y-axis shows the percentage of the total Alt-right commenting users they went to become\n(notice that all lines begin at 0, because initially they did not consume any Alt-right content).\nusers at each year can be traced back to users who initially watched\ncontent from other communities. In other terms, for each year we\ncalculate, of the users who are exposed (i.e. who watched Alt-right\nvideos), which percentage belongs to each one of the sets of tracked\nusers we just described.\nThe results for this analysis are shown in Fig. 4. We find that\nthese users are a considerable fraction of the Alt-right comment-\ning audience. In 2018, for all kinds of exposure, roughly 40% of\ncommenting users can be traced back from cohorts of users that\ncommented only on Alt-lite or I.D.W. videos in the past. This can be\nseen in the first row of the plot. Moreover, we can observe that, con-\nsistently, users who consumed Alt-lite or I.D.W. content in a given\nyear, go on to become a significant fraction of the Alt-right user\nbase in the following year. This number is much more expressive\nthan the number of users which came from media channels \u2014 in\nthe last row \u2014 which never surpasses 6%for any level of exposure.\nLooking at the second and third row of Fig. 4, we find a substan-\ntial difference between the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite. Whereas in Sec. 5\nwe find that the intersection between them both and the Alt-right\nare similar, here we see that users who initially commented only\non I.D.W. channels constitute a much less significant percentage\nof the Alt-right consumer base in upcoming years. For all levels\nof exposure, at all times, the number of exposed users that can\nbe traced back to commenting exclusively on I.D.W. channels is\naround 3 times lower. So, while in 2018,23.3%of users who were\nlightly exposed can be traced back to users who commented on\nAlt-lite channels in previous years, only 7.6%can be traced back\nto I.D.W. channels. Overall, in both analyses, users who consumed\nonly I.D.W. channel seem to behave more similarly to the users\nin the media channels. Yet, as we see in Sec. 5, the intersectionbetween the Alt-lite and the I.D.W. is increasing with time, which\nmeans this population is becoming less significant.\nThe experiments performed show that, not only the commenting\nuser bases are becoming increasingly similar (as shown in Sec. 5),\nbut that, systematically, users who commented only on I.D.W. or\nAlt-lite content go on to comment on Alt-right channels. This phe-\nnomenon is significant both in terms of the percentage of the users\ntracked \u2014 as in Fig. 3 \u2014 and in terms of the total Alt-right comment-\ning user base \u2014 as in Fig. 4. We present the raw numbers associated\nwith these figures in Appendix D.\n7 THE RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM\nIn this section, we inspect the impact of YouTube\u2019s recommendation\nalgorithm. Unfortunately, we have only a snapshot of the recom-\nmender system which does not take into account personalization.\nThus, it is hard to reach significant conclusions on what was the\nrole of the recommender system in the radicalization process we\ndepicted in Sec. 6. Yet, we argue that analyzing these data is rele-\nvant, for it is a blueprint of how the influence of the recommender\nTable 3: Percentage of edges in-between communities in\nthe recommendation graphs (normalized per weight).

We show two metrics, as\ndescribed in the text, the probability of the walker being in a given community at each step (solid line) and the reachability at\neach step for a given community (dashed line). The different columns portray different starting rules for the initial node in\nthe simulations. Error bands are 95%confidence intervals.\nsystem may be measured, and because it allows us to understand\nhow the recommender system is behaving for our scenario.\nWe perform our analysis in a recommendation graph, built using\nthe data collected. The graph is built as follows: for each channel,\nwe join together all recommendations obtained in all rounds of\ndata collection. Each channel is a node, and edges between nodes\nindicate recommendations from a channel to another (for both\nvideo and channel recommendations). Notice that, in case there\nwas a recommendation towards a channel or a video we are not\naware of, we add an edge to a special sink node we name \u201cOther\u201d.\nEach edge is weighted proportionally to the number of times that\nrecommendation appeared in the data collection, and weights are\nnormalized so that outgoing edges of each node sum up to 1.\nThe percentage of edges between communities (normalized by\ntheir weight) is shown in Tab. 3 for channel and video recommenda-\ntions. For channel recommendations, we have that media channels\nare recommended scarcely by the communities of interest. In fact,\nthere are more edges flowing outof media channels towards Alt-\nlite/I.D.W. channels than the other way around. Alt-lite and I.D.W.\nchannels recommend channels from the same community around\n50%of the time, and recommend each other around 14%(Alt-L to\nI.D.W.) and 23% (I.D.W. to Alt-L) of the time. Alt-right channels\nare only recommended by Alt-lite channels ( 3.08%). For video rec-\nommendations, there is a high prevalence of recommendation to\nvideos we were not able to track (more than 75%of outgoing edges\nfrom all communities pointed towards the \u201cOther\u201d node). We also\nfind that media channels are more often recommended in this set-\nting (\u223c3%for all communities), while the Alt-lite and the I.D.W.\nrecommend each other roughly 2%of the time. Lastly, Alt-right\nvideos are not significantly recommended here.Given these graphs, we experiment with random walks. The\nrandom walker begins in a random node, chosen with chance pro-\nportional to the number of subscribers in each channel. Then, the\nrandom walker randomly navigates the graph for 5steps, choosing\nedges at random with probabilities proportional to their weights.\nWe store the random walks and calculate two metrics: (i)the proba-\nbility of it being in a channel from each of the communities, that is,\nthe probability that there is a channel of a given community in the\n\ud835\udc58-th step. (ii)the reachability of each of the communities at step \ud835\udc58.\nThat is, at step \ud835\udc58, the percentage of times that the random walker\nhas found a node of a given community. We run the simulation 10K\ntimes for scenarios where the initial node is restricted to one of the\nthree communities or the media channels.\nImportantly, we consider a small difference in the experimental\nset-up for each of the graphs. In the channel recommendation graph,\nwe allow the random walker to choose the \u201cOther\u201d node. When\nthis happens the walk stops, thus at each step there is a probability\nthis walk is interrupted by this \u2014 or by the fact that there are no\nrecommended channels. In the channel recommendation graph, as\nthe number of edges to the \u201cOther\u201d node is too high, we do not\nallow the random walker to go towards it. Notice that the scenario\nfor the channels is more realistic, and we give more weight to the\nconclusions drawn there. The two aforementioned metrics, at each\nstep, given different starting conditions, are shown in Fig. 5, for\nchannel and video recommendations.\nFor channel recommendations, we have that the reachability@ 5\nof Alt-right channels is of approximately 4%for the simulations\nstarting from Alt-lite 1.5%for I.D.W. channels. Moreover, starting\nfrom an I.D.W. channel, users have approximately 10%of chance of\nbeing in an Alt-lite channel at the next step, and in 5steps, there is\n25%of chance that the user has found at least one Alt-lite channel.\nHorta Ribeiro et al.\nStarting from the media channels, reachability@ 5of I.D.W. channels\nis of 2.5%, and of slightly less than 1%for Alt-lite channels. These\ncan be seen on the bottom row of Fig. 5 (a).\nFor video recommendations, reaching Alt-right channels from\nother communities is less likely. From the Alt-lite, reachability@ 5\nis of around 0.05%. Going from the I.D.W. to the Alt-lite is more\ndifficult: the reachability@ 5is roughly 7%. More relevant, though,\nstarting from media channels, the reachability@ 5of I.D.W. and\nAlt-lite channels is of around 4.5%and1.5%respectively. It is worth\nrecalling that this experiment is less realistic than the former, as\nhere we ignore the possibility of the random walker being in a\nvideo we are not aware of.\nOverall, we find that, in the channel recommender system, it is\neasy to navigate from the I.D.W. to the Alt-lite (and vice-versa), and\nit is possible to find Alt-right channels. From the Alt-lite we follow\nthe recommender system 5times, approximately 1out of each 25\ntimes we will have spotted an Alt-right channel (as seen in Fig. 5\n(a)). In the video recommender system, Alt-right channels are less\nrecommended, but finding Alt-lite channels from the I.D.W. and\nI.D.W. channels from the large media channels in the media group is\nalso feasible. Considering the sheer amount of views the channels in\nthe Alt-lite, the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite, these percentages, although\nlow, may result in a very significant number of views towards\nfringe content. This process may also be amplified when taking\npersonalization into account. Notice that we depict the two graphs\nin which we performed our experiments in Appendix E.\n8 DISCUSSION\nWe performed a through analysis of three YouTube communities\n\u2014 the I.D.W., the Alt-lite, and the Alt-right \u2014 inspecting a large\ndataset with millions of comments and recommendations from\nthousands of videos. In this section, we discuss how the insights of\nour analyses shed light into our research questions. We also talk\nabout the limitations and potential implications of this work.\nRQ1. How have these channels grown on YouTube in the last\ndecade? The three communities studied sky-rocketed in terms of\nviews, likes, videos published and comments, particularly, since\n2015, coinciding with the presidential election of that year, as shown\nin Sec. 4. However, this seems to be the case not only for these\ncommunities, but also for the larger channels in the media group.\nA key difference between the communities and media channels lies\nin the engagement of their users. The number of comments per\nview seems to be particularly high for extreme content (Sec. 4), and\nusers in all three communities are more assiduous commentators\nthan in the media channels (Sec. 5).\nRQ2. To which extent do users systematically gravitate to-\nwards more extreme content? We find that the commenting user\nbases for the three communities are increasingly similar (Sec. 5), and,\nconsidering Alt-right channels as a proxy for extreme content, that\na significant amount of commenting users systematically migrates\nfrom commenting exclusively on milder content to commenting on\nmore extreme content (Sec. 7). We argue that this finding provides\nsignificant evidence that there has been, and there continues to be,\nuser radicalization on YouTube, and our analyses of the activity\nof these communities (Sec. 4) is consistent with the theory that\nmore extreme content \u201cpiggybacked\u201d on the surge in popularityof I.D.W. and Alt-lite content [ 30]. We show that this migration\nphenomenon is not only consistent throughout the years, but also\nthat it is significant in its absolute quantity. Noticeably, the find-\nings related to this research question make the implicit assumption\nthat commenting users are a good enough proxy for radicaliza-\ntion, and that comments in YouTube channels are supportive of\nthe videos they are associated with. We established the validity of\nthese assumptions as follows. First, the sheer number of comments\nand high prevalence of comments per views in Alt-right videos\nsuggest that commenting users are a population worth studying,\nespecially when in Sec. 4 we found that Alt-right channels have\na very high percentage of comments per view. Secondly, during\nthe three week annotation period, it was noted that the number of\nopposing comments is rather small, as we found by manually check-\ning900randomly selected comments ( 300for each community of\ninterest), finding that only 5 could be interpreted as criticisms to\nthe videos they were associated with. Moreover, we note that the\nproportion of likes for the communities of interest is higher for\nthe communities of interest ( >91%mean, >96%median) than for\nthe media channels ( 85%mean, 93%median), which suggests the\npeople interacting with the three communities agree with their\nvideos.\nRQ3. Do algorithmic recommendations steer users towards\nmore extreme content? Our simulations suggest that YouTube\u2019s\nrecommendation algorithms frequently suggest Alt-lite and I.D.W.\ncontent. From these two communities, it is possible to find Alt-right\ncontent from recommended channels, but not from recommended\nvideos. Noticeably, our analysis has several shortcomings which\ndo not allow us to make bold claims about this research question.\nFirstly, we are able to look only at a tiny fraction of actual recom-\nmendations \u2014 it could very well be that Alt-right content was being\nmore widely promoted in the past. Secondly, our analysis does not\ntake into account personalization, which could reveal a completely\ndifferent picture. Still, even without personalization, we were still\nable to find a path in which users could find extreme content from\nlarge media channels.\nLimitations and future work. Our work resonates with the nar-\nrative that there is a radicalization pipeline [ 36,41]. Indeed, we\nmanage to measure traces of user radicalization using commenting\nusers. Although we argue this is strong evidence for the existence\nof radicalization pathways on YouTube, our work provides little\ninsight on why these radicalization pipelines exist. Elucidating the\ncauses of radicalization is an important direction to better under-\nstand user radicalization and the influence of social media in our\nlives. Moreover, in this paper we focused exclusively on basic sta-\ntistics (likes, views and comments) and on the trajectory of users,\nbe they inferred through comments or simulated in the recommen-\ndation graphs. Another interesting direction would be to trace the\nevolution of the speech of content creators and commenting users\nthroughout the years, to study what are the narratives that arose\nand how their tone has changed.\nAcknowledgements.
