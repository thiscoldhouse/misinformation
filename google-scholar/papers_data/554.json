Our annotation\nexperiments, comparing students and experts,\nshow that there is little agreement on basic an-\nnotations even among experts. For this reason,\nwe conclude that we need to accept disagree-\nment as an integral part of such annotations.\n1 Introduction\nIn typical linguistic annotation projects, such as\nfor part of speech tags or for dependency syntax,\nwe assume that there is a single correct analysis,\nwhich can be determined reliably by trained an-\nnotators (e.g. K\u00fcbler and Zinsmeister ,2014). For\nphenomena such as hate speech or conspiracy the-\nories (CTs), we tend to follow the same model\nwithout re\ufb02ecting on the tasks. We assume that\nwe know what hate speech or CTs are, asking our\nannotators to proceed without providing a de\ufb01ni-\ntion of the phenomenon or guidelines. Another\nway of creating corpora of annotated data consists\nof using search terms to \ufb01nd examples of the phe-\nnomenon, where the search term (or the website\nfrom which the example was retrieved) serves as\nan approximation of the gold standard annotation.\nFor example, a research team from the RAND Cor-\nporation, investigating the automatic detection of\n\u201cconspiracy theory language\u201d ( Marcellino et al.,\n2021), used search terms to \ufb01nd examples of CT\ntexts from social media. They created a machine\nlearning classi\ufb01er for which such texts were to be\ndistinguished from \u201ca baseline sample of \u2018normal\u2019\nnon-conspiracy talk\u201d. The CT texts covered alien\nvisitation, vaccine dangers, the origins of COVID-\n19, while the non-CT texts were sampled from top-\nics such as \u2018sports\u2019, \u2018movies\u2019, \u2018holidays\u2019, etc. Sim-\nilarly, Miani et al. (2021) created a large corpus of\nCT texts, LOCO. It provides CTs and mainstreamtexts on the same topics. To gather CT texts, they\nused a list of CT websites based on scores from\nmediabiasfactcheck1. To retrieve mainstream doc-\numents, the authors used Google to search for the\nseeds. Work by Mompelat et al. (2022), who re-\nannotated parts of the LOCO corpus, shows that\nthe original distinction of conspiracy and main-\nstream texts is reasonably reliable, but they also\nfound that in some cases, it was dif\ufb01cult to decide\nwhether a CT was perpetuated in a text. Note that\nany bias introduced by annotation or corpus cre-\nation will automatically be perpetuated into any\nmachine learning model trained on such a corpus.\nIn the work presented here, we delve deeper into\nthe distinction of CT and mainstream texts. In\nthe \ufb01rst experiment, we asked students to anno-\ntate texts to determine how CTs were propagated.\nThey were \ufb01rst trained on a set of texts, after\nhaving been provided with annotation guidelines.\nThe results showed low inter-annotator agreement\n(IAA). In a follow-up study, we decided to redo the\nexperiment with CT experts. These results were\nslightly improved but still did not meet the thresh-\nold of acceptable IAA, which raises the question\nof whether we need better annotation guidelines\nor whether the CT phenomenon is highly subjec-\ntive. After a thorough evaluation of the two sepa-\nrate sets of annotations (students and experts), we\ncome to the conclusion that the latter is the case.\nThis suggests that we cannot expect a single gold\nstandard annotation, and consequently cannot use\nIAA as a measure of the annotation quality. We\n\ufb01nally provide a discussion of the consequences\nof our \ufb01ndings for annotation projects concerned\nwith highly subjective phenomena.\nOur work is closely aligned with other work\non annotator disagreement and perspectivist ap-\nproaches to NLP. Thus, our insights are not novel\nin NLP; we are adding to the discussion by\n1https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/124\nadding\nconspiracy annotation/detection to the list\nof subjective tasks, which require perspectivist ap-\nproaches.\n2 Disagreement in Annotation\nEarly work on disagreement in linguistic anno-\ntations (Passonneau ,2004; Poesio and Artstein,\n2005) introduced Krippendorff\u2019s alpha (Krippen-\ndorff ,2019) as a metric to measure inter-annotator\nagreement and introduced the notion of explicit\nand implicit ambiguity in annotations, the lat-\nter referring to ambiguity revealed through an-\nnotator disagreement. More recent work has\nstarted looking into disagreement in annotations\nbeyond measuring it, instead accepting it as a\nnecessary phenomenon in the annotation of sub-\njective tasks for a range of tasks: for example,\nPOS tagging ( Plank et al. ,2014), textual infer-\nence ( Pavlick and Kwiatkowski ,2019), sexism\n(Almanea and Poesio, 2022), toxicity ( Sap et al.,\n2022), and hate speech detection (Akhtar et al. ,\n2020; Mostafazadeh Davani et al., 2022).\n3 Annotating Conspiracy Theories\nA CT refers to a story or narrative that claims a\nsmall group or \u2018deep state\u2019 has control over the\ngovernment and is involved in harmful activities\naimed at causing widespread harm (e.g. Enders\net al., 2021). This includes doubting scienti\ufb01c ev-\nidence of climate change and vaccinations, believ-\ning that elections are rigged, and fearing that immi-\ngrants, Black individuals, or Jewish people pose a\nthreat to the rights, freedom, and culture of white\npeople (Enders et al., 2021). Empirical evidence-\nbased research from a variety of disciplines seeks\nto explain why people believe in certain CTs (e.g.\nDaniel and Harper, 2022; Lewandowsky et al.,\n2013; Uscinski et al., 2020, 2022).\nNeville-Shepard (2018) and Serazio (2016) as-\nsert that creators of CT text use language famil-\niar to audiences attracted to conspiracism, and\nconspiratorial text is grounded in a small amount\nof \u2018evidence\u2019 that encourages a \u2018leap of faith\u2019 by\nthe audience to reach conclusions. This suggests\nthat conspiratorial discourse caters to people in the\nknow and, therefore, does not explicitly convey a\npremise, rather, the audience completes the argu-\nment based on prior knowledge. Reyes and Smith\n(2014) further assert that creators of CT text de-\npend on audiences already familiar with similar\nideas. This means that these theories tap into abroader culture of belief in conspiracies and act\nas a way for people to \ufb01nd others who share their\nbeliefs and reinforce their convictions. However,\nthis makes it dif\ufb01cult to classify conspiratorial text\nbecause, without an explicit claim, it is up to the\naudience to \u2018leap\u2019 to conclusions based on the fa-\nmiliar tropes presented in the text.\nMompelat et al. (2022) have reannotated parts\nof the LOCO corpus (Miani et al., 2021) to de-\ntermine how reliable the automatic corpus collec-\ntion was. They started with a simple de\ufb01nition\nof what they considered a CT text, namely a text\nthat propagated a conspiracy belief , de\ufb01ned as: \u201cA\nconspiracy belief is the belief that an organization\nmade up of individuals or groups was or is acting\ncovertly to achieve some malevolent end. It de-\npicts causal narratives of an event as a covert plan\norchestrated by a secret cabal of people or organi-\nzations instead of a random or natural happening\u201d\n(Seelig et al. ,2022). Their \ufb01rst round of annota-\ntions showed high IAA for mainstream texts, but\nthe IAA for CT was 0.47. As a consequence, they\nadjusted the guidelines and added that in order for\na text to be considered a CT text, the following had\nto hold: \u201cA document is considered CT if and only\nif such a belief is manifested in the text via spe-\nci\ufb01c expressions\u201d ( Mompelat et al. ,2022). They\nalso identi\ufb01ed a set of textual and verbal cues that\ntriggered a reading of conspiracy, e.g., all caps\ntexts, paraphrases, questions. The revised guide-\nlines resulted in a higher IAA for conspiracy texts\nof 0.70. However, when they used the same anno-\ntation scheme for a different conspiracy theory, the\nresults for CT texts was considerably lower (0.58),\nthus showing that robust annotations are dif\ufb01cult,\neven with trained annotators.\n4 The Annotation Study\nWe conducted an annotation study to determine\nwhich circumstances (in terms of training) we\nneed to reliably annotate a range of phenom-\nena. More speci\ufb01cally, the annotations covered\nidentifying similarities in main themes, structures,\nrhetorical forms, and tropes. For the annotation\nsamples, we revisited the LOCO corpus to draw\na sample of CTs. We only extracted documents\nidenti\ufb01ed as a conspiracy, representing a broad\nrange of topics, using the seeds Covid-19, Pizza-\ngate, Climate change, JFK assassination, 9/11, Il-\nluminati, and Flat Earth. Our non-experts are grad-\nuate students without prior knowledge of the litera-125\nture\non CTs. The experts are researchers who have\nworked on CTs for at least 2 years. We report both\nFleiss\u2019 kappa ( Fleiss, 1971) and Krippendorff\u2019s al-\npha (Krippendorff, 2019).\nThe annotation scheme is based on past research\non hate speech, CT text, and populist rhetoric (Bas-\ntos and Farkas ,2019; Rieger et al., 2021; Seelig\net al., 2022). We used the following questions:\n1. Presence of a CT in the text (e.g., causal nar-\nratives of an event as a covert plan orches-\ntrated by a secret cabal of people/organiza-\ntions).\n2. Main or dominant CT narrative (e.g., Flat\nEarth, Moon Landing, White Genocide, etc.).\n3. Treatment of the CT: document supports, en-\ndorses, and/or reinforces a CT; or refutes or\ndebunks it.\n4. Leap of faith: narrative takes accepted facts\nand makes a leap of faith to reach conclusions\nthat are not supported by the facts.\n5. Type of argument: syllogism (a deductive\nscheme of a formal argument consisting of\na major and a minor premise and a conclu-\nsion) or enthymeme (an argument in which\none premise is not explicitly stated).\n6. Sentiment of narrative (e.g., positive, neutral,\nor negative).\n7. Pathos: appealing to audience\u2019s emotions\n(e.g., humor and sarcasm; inspiration and\nhope; sadness; sympathy and pity; courage\nand strength; hatred; love; fear; anger).\n8. Logos: rational basis for an argument/reason\n(e.g., statistics; recorded evidence; historical\ndata or facts; studies, surveys, or academic\npapers; personal experience/testimony;\nhearsay; or not applicable).\n9. Ethos: the credibility of the speaker or poster\n(e.g., celebrity; authority \ufb01gure; credible or\npublic \ufb01gure; animals; inanimate objects; a\nperson in the street excluding celebrity/ au-\nthority/credible \ufb01gures).\n10. Fearmongering (e.g., mentioning fatalities\ncaused by natural disasters, crime, acts of ter-\nrorism, civil unrest, or accidents).\n11. Emotional spectrum: use of emotional words\n(e.g., afraid, excited, sweet, and jealous), ex-\nclamation marks (e.g., they are crying!), or\nemojis.Non-experts Experts\n\u03ba\n\u03b1 \u03ba\n\u03b1\nCT\npresent 0.10\n0.37 -0.12\n-0.71\nMain\nCT present 0.22\n0.58 0.07\n0.25\nT\nreatment of CT 0.13\n0.46 0.01\n-0.01\nLeap\nof faith 0.09\n0.11 0.10\n0.02\nT\nype of arg. 0.03\n0.34 -0.09\n0.28\nSentiment 0.02\n0.30 -0.05\n0.05\nP\nathos 0.07\n0.33 0.06\n0.51\nLogos 0.03\n0.23 0.01\n0.29\nEthos 0.04\n0.28 0.02\n0.41\nFearmongering 0.15\n0.48 -0.07\n-0.28\nEmotional\nspect. 0.06\n0.34 -0.13\n-0.38\nReal-w\norld 0.13\n0.43 0.03\n-0.10\nT\nable 1: Inter-annotator agreement for CTs comparing\nnon-experts and expert.\n12. Real-world issues (e.g., politics, economy,\nmilitary con\ufb02ict, crime, local affairs, weather,\npublic health, education, protest, ethnocul-\ntural minorities, or terrorism).\nWe \ufb01rst trained the non-expert annotators on\na sample of 11 conspiracy documents selected\nfrom the seven CTs (Covid-19, Pizzagate, Climate\nchange, JFK assassination, 9/11, Illuminati, and\nFlat Earth). After training, they independently an-\nnotated a random sample of 472 CT texts repre-\nsenting the same conspiracy topics. The annota-\ntions were conducted by two MA students and\nthree PhD students without prior knowledge of\nresearch on CTs. The results are shown in Ta-\nble1. The analysis yielded poor IAA, even for the\nmost basic question of whether a CT was present\n(\u03ba= 0.10).\nGiven the low IAA of the non-experts, we con-\nducted a similar, but smaller experiment with a\ngroup of 4 experts as annotators. We used the\nsame annotation scheme on a sub-sample of 25\nCTs from the same sample the students annotated.\nThe results of this experiment are shown in the sec-\nond column in Table 1. We notice that there are\nseveral negative values. Similar to the \ufb01ndings of\nMompelat et al. (2022), the reason for this can be\nfound in the very high expected values. Neither\nmetric is useful for data with very high agreement\nand small sample size ( Zhao et al. ,2013). If we in-\nterpret these values as reasonably high agreement,\nwe see that the experts tend to agree on whether\na CT is present, how the CT is treated, and on\nfearmongering, the emotional spectrum, and real-126\n\u03ba\u03b1\nCT\npresent 0.403\n0.827\nMain\nCT present 0.298\n0.217\nT\nreatment of CT 0.383\n0.795\nT\nable 2: Inter-annotator agreement for CTs for experts\nusing the simpli\ufb01ed annotation scheme.\nworld issues present. The remaining numbers are\nlower in comparison to the non-experts, including\nfor the questions which CT was present and its\ntreatment, thus showing that prior research expe-\nrience on CTs is not helpful.\nAs part of this second round of annotations,\nwe added questions to capture experts\u2019 certainty\nof their annotation for items \ufb02agged controversial\n(e.g., very certain, pretty sure, not sure, I have\nno idea/guessed). The answers show that while\nthe experts never guessed, the majority were only\npretty sure (61-84%) or not sure (3-18%).\nDue to the lack of agreement for non-experts\nand experts, we decided to simplify the coding\nscheme to the \ufb01rst three questions, but to clarify\nand extend the guidelines, to see if more explicit\ninstructions would increase IAA. The modi\ufb01ca-\ntions were based on a discussion of the experts of\nwhich uncertainties they faced during the annota-\ntion process. We used another sub-sample of 10\nCTs from the same sample the students annotated.\nThe results are based on 6 expert annotators and\nare shown in Table 2. We see that these numbers\nare higher than for the previous experiment, but\nthe agreement is still far from what is generally\nconsidered reliable: when asked whether the text\ncontains a CT, we obtained \u03ba= 0.403; for \u201cmain\nconspiracy present?\" \u03ba= 0.298; and for \u201ctreat-\nment of conspiracy\u201d \u03ba= 0.383.\nDuring the last experiment, we also asked the\nlarger group of experts to describe any dif\ufb01culty\nthey had determining the answers. We show sam-\nple responses in Table 3. These responses show\nthat even experts struggle with basic questions\nsuch as whether a CT is present, which we inter-\npret as an indication that there do not exist clear\nboundaries.\n5 Consequences for Annotation Projects\nOur results above show clearly that it is extremely\ndif\ufb01cult to reach high IAA on even basic ques-\ntions such as whether a text contains a CT, even\nwhen experts are used as annotators.

Text numbers refer to Appendix A.\nsible that agreement metrics can be increased by\nfurther extending the instructions for annotations\nand by training annotators to respond in a spe-\nci\ufb01c way to speci\ufb01c texts. However, such a setup\nmay encourage annotators to annotate what exper-\nimenters want to hear instead of annotating what\nthey see as being present in the text. A closer look\nat the texts and the annotations shows that these\ndecisions depend on prior knowledge and on how\nthe text is interpreted. If we streamline the anno-\ntations too rigidly, then we create the possibility\nthat annotators try to guess what the experimenters\nwant to see as answers, thus clouding legitimate in-\nterpretations of the text. For example, the decision\nwhether Text 3 in Appendix Apropagates a CT\nwill depend not only on how much the annotator\nknows about the case, but also on how much they\ntrust the source of this text.\nA closer look at the texts and the annotations al-\nlows us to conclude that the annotations are and\nneed to be subjective. We cannot have a single\ngold standard annotation; rather, we must be pre-\npared to accept a range of answers. This conclu-127\nsion\nleads to several consequences, partly for the\nde\ufb01nition of the problem, and partly for modeling\nthe problem computationally.\n1. Disagreement between annotators is not a\nsign of lack of clarity in the annotation\nscheme but a direct consequence of the phe-\nnomenon to be annotated. One reason is that\nbelief in CTs is not monolithic, but rather\nfaceted, where individuals belief in subsets of\nfactoid of a range of CTs. Another reason is\nthat we need to model the preception of stan-\ndard readers, and their interpretation will de-\npend on prior knowledge as well as prior bias.\n2. We cannot expect a single \u201ccorrect\u201d answer;\nrather, we need to accept ranges of answers.\nThis is in line with other subjective tasks such\nas hate speech annotation or sentiment anno-\ntation.\n3. Metrics such as Fleiss\u2019 kappa and Krippen-\ndorff\u2019s alpha cannot be used to evaluate the\nquality of annotations. More speci\ufb01cally,\nsuch tasks cannot be evaluated based on con-\nsistency.\n4. Machine learning (ML) approaches to model\nthe phenomenon should not de\ufb01ne it as a clas-\nsi\ufb01cation task but instead need to predict the\nrange and distribution of answers.\n5. ML models based on gold standard annota-\ntions may be severely biased.\n6. The lack of agreement requires a shift in\nmachine learning paradigm, taking learning\nfrom disagreement ( Mostafazadeh Davani\net al. ,2022; Uma et al. ,2021) more seriously\nsince the variability in annotations can signif-\nicantly affect the task (classi\ufb01cation vs. pre-\ndicting a distribution). Thus, it needs to be in-\ntegrated more closely in the training regime.\n6 Limitations\nOur comparative annotation study is based on a\nsmall number of annotators since it was supposed\nto serve as a pilot stud for a larger annotation\nproject. However, the students went through a\nthorough training session, and the number of ex-\nperts is naturally limited by availability. All expert\nannotators are also co-authors on this report, our\nexpertise ranges over a wide array of \ufb01elds, which\nensures a wide disciplinary stance.7 Ethical Considerations\nWorking with CTs tends to be dif\ufb01cult for the an-\nnotators. For this reason, we concentrated on a set\nof different CTs that are less prone to explicit ha-\ntred that is often present in CTs targeting speci\ufb01c\nminority groups (e.g., white genocide). However,\ndespite this careful selection, the chosen texts can\ncontain content that may upset annotators.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is based on research supported by\nUS National Science Foundation (NSF) Grants\n#2123635 and #2123618.\nWe are grateful to all our annotators and to\nthe reviewers for their comments, which helped\nstrengthen the paper.\nReferences\nSohail Akhtar, Valerio Basile, and Viviana Patti. 2020.\nModeling annotator perspective and polarized opin-\nions to improve hate speech detection.

The country has\nclosed off its borders to almost all foreigners as the virus spread globally, though most of the imported\ncases involve Chinese nationals returning from overseas.\nThe\nplatinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulations is back in stock!

Rocks of this age are found in northern Yel-\nlowstone and in the hearts of the Teton, Beartooth, Wind River, and Gros Ventre ranges. During\nthe Precambrian and the subsequent Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras (541 to 66 million years ago), the\nwestern United States was covered at times by oceans, sand dunes, tidal \ufb02ats, and vast plains. From\nthe end of the Mesozoic through the early Cenozoic, mountain-building processes formed the Rocky\nMountains.\nDuring\nthe Cenozoic era (approximately the last 66 million years of Earths history), widespread\nmountain-building, volcanism, faulting, and glaciation sculpted the Yellowstone area.\nMagma\n(molten rock from Earth\u2019s mantle) has been close to the surface in Yellowstone for more than\n2 million years. Its heat melted rocks in the crust, creating a magma chamber of partially molten,\npartially solid rock. Heat from this shallow magma caused an area of the upper crust to expand and\nrise. The Yellowstone Plateau became a geomorphic landform shaped by episodes of volcanic activ-\nity. Stress also caused rocks overlying the magma to break, forming faults and causing earthquakes.\nEventually, these faults reached the deep magma chamber. Magma oozed through these cracks, releas-\ning pressure within the chamber and allowing trapped gases to expand rapidly. A massive volcanic\neruption then occurred along vents, spewing volcanic ash and gas into the atmosphere and causing\nfast super-hot debris (pyroclastic) \ufb02ows on the ground. As the underground magma chamber emptied,\nthe ground above it sunk, creating the \ufb01rst of Yellowstones three calderas.\nThis\ndiagram shows the general ideas behind two theories of how magma rises to the surface. Adapted\nwith permission from Windows into the Earth by Robert Smith and Lee J. Siegel, 2000.130\nResearchers\nfound that the changes leading up to an eruption may happen in a matter of decades\nrather than thousands of years in advance as previously thought.\nBased\non minerals from the last major eruption, the Supervolcanoes are characterized as volcanic\ncenters that have had eruptions that covered more than 240 cubic miles. The US has two: one in\nYellowstone and another in Californias Long Valley. An eruption could emit ash that would expand\nover 500 miles. The eruption would likely cover the ground with as much as 4 inches of gray ash,\nwhich could be detrimental to crops growing in the Midwest. Another less worrisome concern is the\n1,000 degree F molten lava that could ooze out. Gases, including sulfur dioxide, which contributes\nto acid rain would be spewed from the supervolcano and the global cooling issues associated with\nre\ufb02ecting sunlight away from the Earth are also concerns.\nBut\nthere are other supervolcanos in the world with sooner predictions than Yellowstones. Campi\nFlegri, a name that aptly translates as burning \ufb01elds, is in a critical state, according to researchers\nin Italy. It consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers that formed hundreds\nof thousands of years ago, stretching from the outskirts of Naples to underneath the Mediterranean\nSea. Though its last eruption was in 1538, its due for an eruption soon. It would be a minor event\ncompared to the 72 cubic miles of molten rock it spewed in its most notorious eruption 39,000 years\nago, called Campanian Ignimbrite, that likely contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals.\nF\nortune website article reported that if the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, it could shoot out more\nthan 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash into the air. Thats 250 cubic miles. Thats more than\nthree times as large as the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy, which created a sulfurous cloud\nthat \ufb02oated more than 1,200 miles away to hang over Russia. Thats 2,500 times more material than\nMount St. Helens expelled in 1980, killing 57 people. An eruption at Yellowstone would result in a\ncloud of ash more than 500 miles wide, stretching across nearly the entire western United States.\nN\nASA has a plan to neutralize supervolcano threats however. They believe the most viable solution\ncould be to drill up to 6 miles down into the supervolcano, and pump down water at high pressure.\nThe circulating water would return at a temperature of around 662F, thus slowly day by day extracting\nheat from the volcano. And while such a project would come at an estimated cost of around $3.46\nbillion, it comes with an enticing catch which could convince politicians to make the investment. It\nwould become a source of geothermal energy. But there are considerable risks, too. It could trigger\nthe eruption its meant to save us from.\nHistorically\n, four types of volcanic events have taken place in Yellowstone (you may click on each\none to learn more):\n1.\nCaldera Forming Eruptions \u2013 2.1 and 1.3 million years ago\n2.\nLava Flows \u2013 about 30 between 640,000 and 70,000 years ago\n3.\nEarthquakes \u2013 1000 to 3000 yearly; last notable quake was in 1959\n4.\nHydrothermal (Steam) Explosions \u2013 small explosions in the 20th century; a dozen or so major\nexplosions between 14,000 and 3,000 years ago\nThe\nlikelihood of an eruption in the near future is still low. However those who instigate such a\nproject will never see it to completion, or even have an idea whether it might be successful within\ntheir lifetime. Cooling Yellowstone in this manner would happen at a rate of 3.2808399 feet a year,\ntaking of the order of tens of thousands of years until just cold rock was left.\nFeatured\nImage: Yellowstone harbours a giant magma chamber that will blow one day if we dont act\n(Credit: iStock)\nT\next 3:\nThe\nvictim was kept in a chemically induced sleep for weeks and subjected to rounds of electroshocks,\nexperimental drugs and tape-recorded messages played non-stop.131\nCBC\nNews recently reported that the Canadian government reached an out-of-court settlement of\n$100,000 with Allison Steel, the daughter of Jean Steel, a woman who was subjected to horri\ufb01c\nbrainwashing experiments funded by the CIA.\nThe\nsettlement was quietly reached in exchange for dropping the legal action launched by Allison\nSteel in September 2015. The settlement includes a non-disclosure agreement prohibiting Steel from\ntalking about the settlement itself. However, the existence of the settlement and its total amount\nappeared in public accounts released by the federal government in October.\nJean\nSteels ordeal began in 1957, at the age of 33. She was admitted at the Allan Memorial Institute\nin Montreal after being diagnosed with manic depression and delusional thinking.\nIn\nthe following months, Steel became a victim of CIA-funded MKULTRA experiments conducted\nby Dr. Ewen Cameron.\nCamerons\nexperiments aimed to de-pattern the victims mind through intense trauma in order to re-\npattern it afterward. In other words, he was researching the basis of Monarch Programming the mind\ncontrol program that is often discussed on Vigilant Citizen.\nCameron\nbelieved a combination of chemically induced sleep for weeks at a time, massive elec-\ntroshock treatments, experimental hallucinogenic drugs like LSD and techniques such as psychic\ndriving through the repeated playing of taped messages could de-pattern the mind, breaking up the\nbrain pathways and wiping out symptoms of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Doctors could\nthen re-pattern patients. However, the de-patterning also wiped out much the patients memory and\nleft them in a childlike state. In some cases, grown adults forgot basic skills such as how to use the\nbathroom, how to dress themselves or how to tie their shoes.\nCBC\nNews, Federal government quietly compensates daughter of brainwashing experiments victim\nHundreds\nof pages detail the horri\ufb01c experiments Jean Steel was subjected to.\nAccording\nto a report written by Cameron, Steel was kept in a chemically induced sleep for weeks.\nOne series lasted 29 days. A second lasted 18 days. The sleep therapy was accompanied by a series\nof electroshocks. She was extremely confused and disoriented but much more co-operative, Cameron\nwrote in his report. Nurses notes on her charts detail repeated doses of sodium amytal, and how Steel\nwould pace the hall and rail about feeling like a prisoner: Its just like being buried alive. Somebody\nplease do something. This was all said screaming at the nurse and doctor, one note said.\nSteel\nthen began to exhibit bizarre behavior. Her daughter recounts:\nWhen\nyou wanted to talk with her about something emotional she just could not do it, Steel said. Her\nemotions were stripped. It took away her soul. Her mother would sit alone in the dark, writing codes\nand numbers on the walls. One time I came home and the ceiling was spray-painted with red swirls\nall over it, Steel said. She would take wallpaper and cut out little sections of it and she would pin it to\nthe whole room.\nWhile\nMKULTRA is viewed by mass media as a shameful episode of the past, it is also part of\nour present. The program still exists in a much more re\ufb01ned version under the name of Monarch\nprogramming.\nHeres\nan interesting 1980 documentary about MKULTRA experiments in Canada produced by the\nCBC:132", "raw_data": {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "PUBLICATION_SEARCH_SNIPPET", "bib": {"title": "Are you serious?

This has \nforged new opportunities and tactics for \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 to be framed, \nreframed and furthered in a way that suits the diverse array of actors embedded in these \ninterconnect ed environments , now empowered in their own ability for \u2018mass self -\ncommunication\u2019  (Castells, 2007) . \nThis ability to craft and contest \u2018reality\u2019 and steer information flows and frames  \nto suit actors\u2019 goals is especially significant in the context of environ mental issues that \nare often politicised, and subject to problematic information and polarising tactics. \nThis includes the case study for this thesis: climate change and the protection of the \nGreat Barrier Ree f (GBR). Publics come to \u2018know\u2019 and understand these topics \nthrough multimedia networks of communication, yet scholars argue that the \npoliticisation and mediatisation of science has stifled the development of \nenvironmental policy in Australia.  As such, t he primary focus of this study is to \nfurther understand ing about the dynamic interplays between actors  and \ninformation  within social media  news-sharing spaces \u2013 the \u2018social news media \nnetwork\u2019  (Bruns, 2018)  \u2013 in the context of environmental protection .  \nAn integrated mixed methods approach is deployed combining social network \nanalysis, in-depth close reading , and framing analysis . These methods are  connected \nto theories from several different disciplines . Namely, Castells\u2019 network theory of \npower (2011b) is adapted to examine dominant actors, information being circulated, \nand frames, and uses techniques like cluster analysis to consider how \u2018reality\u2019 is  being \ncontested on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook  through the lens of power . Power is \nconceptualised in  these online news-sharing spaces as the ability to capture attention. \nThe network theory of power is operationalised by assigning a series of power \nindicators developed from social network theory to explore differing informational \npower dynamics across the platforms . Hutchins and Lester\u2019s mediatised environmental \nconflict model (2015) is engaged to provide a contextual lens to the case study , and \nKonkes and Foxwell -Norton\u2019s (2021) proposed addition of science as a conflict -\ninducing entity is empirically investigated .  \n \n iiiThis research finds that adversarial framing, the problematic use of science , and \nthe strategic interplay of mainstream media with alternative media actors, politicians \nand ideologically -aligned advocacy groups are three key ways that power is asserted \nand contested in the social news media network  spaces of Twitter, YouTube  and \nFacebook  in relation to this case study . Emerging from th ese findings is the continued \nauthority of mainstream media ac tors, particularly The Guardian  and News Corp , as \ninformation sources  and frame -setters, though via different actor interplays, \ninformational flow dynamics and tactics.  There is also evidence  to support Konkes and \nFoxwell-Norton\u2019s (2021)  argument  that the prominence  of scientists and scientific \nknowledge in climate change  contests makes science a fifth sphere in the mediatised \nenvironmental conflict model (Hutchins & Lester, 2015) . \nThis work furthers  knowledge about the mediatisation and politicisation of \nscience in hybrid communication spaces, spanning online and offline , and meets calls \nfor additional  multiplatform studies in social media research . It also addresses a gap in \nempirical studies that examine power dynamics in social media networks , particularly \nconcerning  the protection of the GBR . These findings are relevant for scientists, \ncommunicators, and policymakers in the context of the GBR\u2019s declining health with in \nthe global threat of climate change  \u2013 a conflict situated within an  era of informational  \nand epistemological transformation . \n \niv  Table of Contents  \nKeywords  ................................ ................................

and Faust, 1994).  \n \nNode An element of a network. Also referred to as actors or vertices, nodes usually \nrepresent individuals, groups or teams. In social media networks, they can \noften be users, for example Twitter accounts, Yo uTube channels or Facebook \npages (Social Media Research Foundation, 2016; Yang et al., 2017).  \n \nEdge Connection between two nodes. It is also known as a tie or link (Social Media \nResearch Foundation, 2016).  \n \nEdges unique  The number of connections where mu ltiple connections between node A and \nnode B are counted only once (Social Media Research Foundation, 2016).  \n \nEdges with \nduplicates  The total number of multiple connections between two nodes (Social Media \nResearch Foundation, 2016).  \n \nEdges total  \n The total number of connections where multiple connections between node A \nand node B are all counted (Social Media Research Foundation, 2016) . \n \nSelf-loops \n An edge that starts and ends in the same node (Social Media Research \nFoundation, 2016) . \n \nConnected \ncomponents \n A group of nodes that are all connected is a component. This is the number of \nseparate sets of connected vertices (Social Media Research Foundation, 2016).  \n \nIsolate \n Also known as a single -vertex (node) connected components, nodes that have \nzero connections are \u2018isolated\u2019 or an \u2018island\u2019 (Social Media Research \nFoundation, 2016) . \n \nDensity Density is the measure of the number edges among a group of vertices over the \ntotal possible number if everyone was connected to everyone. A high graph \ndensity means that most people are connected to many others. A low graph \ndensity means that most people are not connected to many others (Social \nMedia Research Foundation, 2016).  \n \nCentralisation  A global metric that characterises the extent to which the n etwork is centred on \none or a few important nodes. Centralised networks have many edges that \nemanate from a few key nodes, while decentralised networks have little \nvariation between the numbers of edges each vertex possesses (Hansen et al., \n2010). \n \nDegree \ncentrality  The count of the total number of connections linked to a node (Hansen et al., \n2010). The degree is the sum of out -bound (out -degree) and in -bound (in -\ndegree) links (Grandjean & Jacomy, 2019) . \n \n xiiiIn-degree  The number of in -bound links to a node. Being \u2018cited\u2019 is often a good indicator \nof authority/notoriety (Grandjean & Jacomy, 2019). This can manifest as users \nsharing a news outlet\u2019s content, which creates an incoming link to that news \nactor. \n \nOut-degree \n The number of out -bound links from a nod e (Grandjean & Jacomy, 2019). This \nindicates the level that the node is spreading information.  \n \nModularity  \u201cModularity of a network\u2019s structure is a measure of the quality of clustering, a \nnetwork partitioned into a set of interconnected subgraphs (Newman & Girvan, \n2004). Modularity captures the extent to which clusters are disconnected from \none another (a rang e of values from 0 to 1), distinguishing between networks \nwith divided versus unified structures\u2026 Highly modular networks are \ncharacterised by a few highly intraconnected clusters that are loosely \ninterconnected. Networks where users are highly interconnec ted regardless of \ncluster affiliation are, therefore, less modular\u201d (Himelboim et al., 2017, pp. 3 -\n4). \n \nOne-mode \nnetwork A one-mode, or unipartite, network consists of a node set and an edge set that \njoin pairs of nodes (Chang & Tang, 2014). These nodes a re the same type, i.e. \none mode (Hansen et al., 2010, p. 36) . \n \nTwo-mode \nnetwork A two-mode, or bipartite, network consists of two disjointed sets of nodes and \na set of edges in which each edge only joins nodes in different sets (Chang & \nTang, 2014). These  nodes are different types, i.e. two modes (Hansen et al., \n2010, p. 36) . \n \n \nMedia and communications terms  \n \n \nCultural materials  \n  \n\u201cThe ideas, visions, projects and frames that are embedded in \nthe processes of communication\u201d (Castells, 2011 b, p. 776). \n \nDiscourse  \n \u201cA discourse is the language used in presenting a given social \npractice from a particular point of view. Discourses appertain \nbroadly to knowledge and knowledge construction\u201d \n(Fairclough, 1995, p. 56).  \n \nDisinformation  \n \u201cInformation that is false and deliberately created to harm a \nperson, social group, organi sation or country\u201d (Wardle & \nDerakhshan, 2017, p. 20) . \n \nFacebook spaces  \n Facebook public pages, public groups and verified public \nprofiles (Angus et al., 2021, p. 11).  \n \nFrame \n Some aspects of perceived reality are selected and made more \nsalient to \u201cpromote a particular problem, definition, casual \ninterpretation, moral evaluation and/or treatment \nrecommendation for the item described\u201d (Entman, 1993, p. \n52). Framing can be obvious, or more subtle, but is intended \nto manage the audience\u2019s interpretation (Fairclough, 1995, p. \n83). \n \nxiv   \nHomophily  \n The tendency for people to form social ties with others most \nsimilar to themselves (McPherson et al., 2001, p. 416).  \n \nInformation disorder  \n The umbrella term used to including mis -, dis- and mal-\ninformation (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017, p. 10) . \n \nMass self -\ncommunication  \n The ability of  audiences to produce and frame their own \nmessages: \u201cit is self -generated in content, self -directed in \nemission, and self -selected in reception by many that \ncommunicate with many\u201d (Castells, 2007, p. 248).  \n \nMediatised \nenvironmental conflict  \n This is enacted when competing visions of modernity and \nenvironmental futures play out in news and communication \nnetworks between the competing logics of industry, politics, \nmedia, activist and \u2013 most recently added \u2013 scientists \n(Hutchins & Lester, 2015; Konkes & Foxwell -Norton, 2021).  \n \nLogic (e.g. media)  \u201cBundles of technologies, genres, norms, behaviours and \norganizational forms\u201d (Chadwick et al., 2016, p. 4) . \n \nMisinformation  \n \u201cInformation that is false, but not created with the intention of \ncausing harm\u201d (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017, p. 20) . \n \nNarrative  \n Includes two factors: 1) The actual story in terms of a series \nof events and actors involved, and 2) the presentation \u2013 the \nway the story is realised and organised as a particular text \n(Fairclough, 1995, p. 91) . \n \nNetwork society  \n Castells\u2019 understanding that modern society is made up of \nnetworks and the \u201cprevalence of networks as modes of \norganisation of social practice is defining social structure in \nour societies\u201d (Castells, 2016, p. 8) . \n \nPolarisation  \n \u201cThe social process whereby a social or political group is \ndivided into two opposing sub -groups having conflicting and \ncontrasting positions, goals and viewpoints, with few \nindividuals remaining neutral or holding an  intermediate \nposition\u201d (Sunstein 2002; Isenberg 1986, as cited in Guerra et \nal., 2013, p. 1). Polarisation can take different forms: \nideological, affective and news audience polarisation \n(Arguedas et al., 2022).  \n \nProblematic \ninformation  \n Includes mis - and dis-information, along with more \nubiquitous public relations information, advertising and \npublic affairs (Jack, 2017) . \n \nProdusage/produser  \n \u201cThe collaborative, iterative, and user -led production of \ncontent by participants in a hybrid user -producer, or produser \nrole\u201d (Bruns, 2006, p. 1) . \n \nProgrammers  \n \u201cThe ability to constitute network(s), and to \nprogram/reprogram the network(s) in the terms o f the goals \nassigned to the network\u201d (Castells, 2013, p. 45) . \n \n \n xvRelational sociology  \n \u201cRelational sociology investigates social life by studying \nsocial relations\u201d (Powell & Depelteau, 2013, p. 1).  \n \nSocial news media \nnetwork \n \u201cThe thoroughly integrated com plex that includes \nconventional news organisations, alternative and citizen \nmedia outlets, professional and citizen journalists, industry \nand freelance newsmakers, dedicated social news curators and \nordinary social media users\u201d (Bruns, 2018, p. 349) . \n \nSwitchers  \n \n \u201cThe ability to connect and ensure the cooperation of \ndifferent networks by sharing common goals and combining \nresources, while fending off competition from other networks \nby setting up strategic cooperation\u201d (Castells, 2013, p. 45) . \n \nSwitching point  \n In the context of mediati sed environmental conflict, the point \nwhere two o r more spheres of action interlock and contest  \ncompeting goals and logics (Hutchins & Lester, 2015) . \n \n \n \n \nxvi  Statement of Original Authorship  \nThe work contained in this  thesis has not been previously submitted to meet \nrequirements for an award at this or any other higher education institution.

I hope it is a useful experience. And that you have a nice cup of tea \nwith you. Or two. Speaking of tea, I would like to thank my advisors, Dr Maxine \nNewlands a nd Associate Professor Theresa Petray who have been wonderful \nsupporters, and translators of the academic world (which I have been stumbling \nthrough after spending my career to -date in journalism, communications, small \nbusiness, and the public service). In  particular, Max, thank you for introducing me to \nacademia and your guidance, knowledge and passion for the Great Barrier Reef, \nmedia, and politics, including nurturing my inner political nerd. Theresa: thank you \nfor your ongoing wisdom, insightful feedbac k, and providing some key advice when I \nneeded it the most. I also admire your leadership: The monthly cohort meetings that \nyou have assembled with fellow HDR students \u2013 our own \u201ccircle of niceness\u201d1  \u2013 have \nbeen invaluable.  \nOn that note, thank you so mu ch to my HDR colleagues for being a sounding \nboard. Although our topics are all so different, it was so good to be able to call on you \nto share experiences, hear about yours, and cheer each other on through key \nmilestones. I would like to also thank the wo nderfully supportive professionals  from \nmy college (College of Arts, Society and Education) for their ongoing assistance. Your \nhelp made my journey as a student more enjoyable. The same is true of James Cook \nUniversity\u2019s  (JCU) library and IT gurus . Also connected to JCU, I would like to thank \nDr Jon Day for taking the time to provide historical background and context about \nUNESCO and previous Great Barrier Reef decisions. Also Distinguished Professor \nStewart Lockie for the thought -provoking introduction to social theory.  \nMy thanks also extend to some extremely generous people beyond my own \nacademic institution. While I attended their training courses, these experts in their \nfields also went above and beyond to discuss my research with me and offer some \nfurther methodological guidance. This included Dr Marc Smith and Dr Wasim Ahmed \n \n \n1 A term from the Thesis Whisperer (https://thesiswhisperer.com/), whose author, Dr Inger Mewburn, \nand Whisper Collective colleagues also deserve thanks for this fabulous resource.  \n \nxviii  from the Social Media Research Foundation (network theory, methods and assistance \nwith NodeXL) and Professor Rob Ackland (network theory, methods, and providing \nsome key guidance wi th the Facebook data). You didn\u2019t have to help me, but you did, \nand I really appreciate it \u2013 thank you.  \nI would also like to thank the organisations that gave me an opportunity to share \nthis research along the way. Firstly, the Social Science Community fo r the Reef, where \nI delivered my first conference presentation. Also to the Journalism Education and \nResearchers Association of Australia  for allowing me to share some early findings  and, \nlater, the International Network for Social Network Analysis to pres ent some key \nresults. Thanks to my fellow HDR students for the chance to present at our college\u2019s \nconference, and to Q ueensland University of Technology \u2019s Digital Media Research \nCentre for the opportunity to learn, and also share some of this work, at this  year\u2019s \ninspiring summer school.  \nOf course a huge thank you to friends and family. I\u2019m pleased you still recognise \nme after I disappeared for a while. Particular thanks to those who dialled into my \nmilestone seminars, especially to the first -time Zoomers. A special shoutout to Jacqui \nCrummey (otherwise known as \u2018my mum\u2019) for giving me some key data cleaning tips , \nand to Emmett and Lilly : my furry family and home office \u2018co-workers\u2019 who continue \nto provide invaluable perspective . I would have struggled to co mplete this endeavour \nwithout one person in particular: my husband Troy. Thanks for the ongoing moral \nsupport \u2013 particularly over the past six months \u2013 the laughs, keeping me fed, and \ngenerally just having my back. Finally, sincere apologies if I have been remiss and \nforgotten to extend my gratitude to  anyone \u2013 \u2018thesis brain\u2019 is real, the error is entirely \nmine, and the coffee is on me.  \n  \n \n xixStatement of Contribution of Others  \nNature of \nAssistance  Contribution  Names, Titles  and Affiliations of Co-Contributors  \nIntellectual \nsupport Supervision  Dr Maxine Newlands , James Cook University ; A/Prof Theresa \nPetray, James Cook University   \nFinancial \nsupport Tuition fee \nsupport  Commonwealth Supported by Research Training Program Fee \nOffset \nScholarship  Research Training Program Stipend  \nTraining Skills \ndevelopment  Research Methods for the Social Sciences: Coursework subject: \nJames Cook University; Big Data Analysis for Social Scientists: \nACSPRI; Network theory and NodeXL software training: \nSocial Media Research Foundation; Social Theory in Practice \nMasterclass: The Cairns Institute; Digital Media Research \nCentre Summer School 2022: Q ueensland Univ ersity of \nTechnology.  \n \n \n \n\n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  1 Chapter 1:  Introduction  \nA question at the heart of modern political communication  research is about \n\u201chow power works am id the chaos\u201d of the disrupted media environment (Chadwick et \nal., 2016, p. 2). This thesis explores power dynamics in decentralised online  news-\nsharing spaces  and the impact on informational authority, flows and knowledge.  This \ntopic is relevant given contemporary dis cussion about problematic information in \nsocial media  platforms , including the need to understand informational interplays and \ntactics to gain valuable insight into how \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 are shaped and \ncontested , including the  role of mainstream me dia. This problem is investigated  by \nexamining  how power is asserted and contested in the \u2018social news media network\u2019 \n(Bruns, 201 8) in relation to a \u2018mediatised environmental conflict \u2019 event (Hutchins & \nLester, 2015). While this approach will be explained further over chapters to  come, in \nsum, I have applied Manuel Castells\u2019 network theory of power (2011b) to examine \nTwitter, YouTube and Facebook . The ultimate goal of these news-sharing networks \nand the majority of actors embedded within them is attention . As such, I have assigned \na series of indicators  to measure attention , which includes  examining the dominant \nactors, information flows, frames, and the tactics used to re -frame narrativ es \u2013 these \ncan be underst ood as acts of power in these online information -channelling \nenvironments . The case study selected to explore these dynamics is  the mediatised and \npoliticised Great Barrier Reef  (GBR), with a specific focus on the 2021 United Natio ns \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation \u2019s (UNESCO ) World Heritage \u2018in \ndanger\u2019 recommendation . This event generated  attention throughout  multimedia \nnetworks of communication  due to competing claims about the health of the GBR and, \nmore broadly, differing values and worldviews about the environment in the context \nof global climate change . I begin this chapter by outlining the key problems that \nprompted this research inquiry  relating to information , epistemology and the broader \nsocial context, and then move on to situat e the GBR case study within this realm. I \nalso discuss the contributions of this work, limitations, and outline the structure of the \nthesis. \n \n2 Chapter 1:  Introduction  1.1 THE RESEARCH PROBLEM  ASSEMBLAGE  \nThe research problem itself can be conceptualised as a network, or an \nassemblage of different elements that are ever -changing, or \u2018becoming\u2019 , with meaning \ncreated by their connections, or disconnections, with other assemblages ( Braidotti, \n2019; Chadwick et al, 2016; Deleuze & Guattari, 198 8). These elements are all \ninterconnected in various ways and to various extents. Each chapter can be considered \nthe same way ; even this thesis can be understood as a collection of not just its chapters, \nbut also the elements that relate to my background as a researcher, the decisions I have \nmade, and the tools I have used (Fox & Al ldred, 2014). T he knowledge foregrounded \nfor interpretation  can be situated in the context of the wider \u2018knowledge assemblage\u2019  \nof communication and media literature and social science, noting that this \u2018knowing\u2019 \nis never fixed, is impacted by its interactive interplays with other human, non -human \nand social elements in flux, and always \u2018becoming\u2019. This is the conceptual position I \nam coming from when I approach this thesis, and also my own academic journey.  \n1.1.1 Decentralised contemporary communication networks  \nOur modern era has been described as the \u2018network society\u2019 by Manuel Castells \n(2007, 2011a, 2013) , who argues that \u2013 while informa tion and communication have \nalways been fundamental sources of power and counterpower \u2013 they have become so \npervasive, interactive and connected that they are now central to implementing power -\nmaking processes across our interconnected society (Castells, 2 011b). In this largely \ndigitally mediated era, traditional and hierarchical \u2018few -to-many\u2019 communication \nchannels reminiscent of the Habermasian public sphere have eroded, superseded by \nreadily accessible and interconnected digital mechanisms for \u2018many -to-many\u2019 \ncommunication  (Bruns & Highfield, 2015 ; Castells, 2008 ). Once mainly receivers of \nmass communication, audience s are now empowered to produce, frame and respond \nto messages, transforming the hierarchical era of mass communication to a more \ninterconnect ed form of \u2018mass self -communication\u2019  (Castells, 2007 , 2011b). Scholars \nhave also referred to the dynamic and relational modern communications environment \nas the \u2018hybrid media system\u2019 (Chadwick et al., 2016). Those in this system with agency \n\u2013 the actors \u2013 are:  \n\u2026articulated by complex and ever -evolving relationships based upon \nadaption and interdependence and concentrations and diffusions of power. \nActors create, tap, or steer information flows in ways that suit their goals and \n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  3 in ways that modify, enable, or disable others\u2019 agency, across and between a \nrange of older and newer media settings ( Chadwick 2013, as cited in \nChadwick et al., 2016, p. 4 ). \nThis decentralisation of communication networks has key implications for who \ncan communicate, what and how, which creates new frontiers for communicators and \ntheir information flows to shape meaning.  This changed communicative environment \nhas implications for those seeking to frame and channel information in relation to \ncontested issues like the protection of the GBR  and responding to climate change, \nwhich could ultimately impact public support for policy  (see Section 1.4).  \n1.1.2 Information and communication power \u2013 a crisis of\u2026?  \nThe disruption to information flows and traditional communication hierarchies \nhas contributed to a set of interconnected challenges. While social media has unlocked \nthe opportunity for non -elite actors to participate in and shape public debate, the \nexchange  is that the \u2018democratisation \u2019 of these public spaces (Papacharissi, 2002) has \nalso coincided with  what some have described as a \u2018post-truth era\u2019 where feelings and \npersonal beliefs trump so -called \u201cobjective facts \u201d (Oxford Dictionaries, 2016, as cited \nin Farkas & Schou, p. 50; see also Davis 2017; Keyes, 2004 ; Lewandowsky et al., \n2017). While incorrect and misleading information and politically -charged \npropaganda are certainly not new, some have highlighted how \u2018post-truth\u2019 conditions \nhave been fuelled by COVID mis - and dis-information and US political truth -centred \ndiscursive contests ( Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; Lazer et al., 2018; Monsees, 2020; \nPennycook et al., 2020; Peitz et al., 2021 ). As such, recent public discourse and \nscholarly attention has fo cused on \u2018information disorders \u2019 (Wardle & Derak hshan, \n2017) and polarisation, including differing views  about the role of social media \nplatforms  (Arguedas et al., 2022; Dehghan et al., 2020) .  \nYet it could be argued that \u2018problematic information\u2019 \u2013 which includes mis - and \ndis-information, along with more ubiquitous public relations information, advertising \nand public affairs (Jack, 2017) \u2013 and polarisation are potentially products of a much \nbroader and interconnected societal failings. As Freedman and Fent on (2017) state in \nFarkas and Schou (2019), the issue is not \u201cfake news \u201d, rather \u201cfake democracy\u201d (p. \n126). Farkas and Schou continue:  \nWe want to suggest that the current democratic crisis is in fact neither sudden \nnor linked to issues of factuality or re ason alone. More fundamentally, what \n \n4 Chapter 1:  Introduction  is at stake is a crisis of democracy caused by the increasingly pervasive \ndismantlement of proper democratic institutions, popular sovereignty and \npolitical participation . (2019, p. 126)  \nWhile the intention of this wor k is not to study the state of \u2018fake democracy \u2019 per \nse, the point here is that poor quality information \u2013 whether deliberately deceptive or \nnot \u2013 is part of a much larger problematic assemblage (Figure 1.1) . Rather than \nfocusing on these informational outputs alone, it is useful to consider them as \nmanifestations of power contestations to influence meaning in minds. These power \nstruggles also link to the much broader problems of epistemology \u2013 how we come to \nknow what we know \u2013 and legitim acy. In other words, where  and how do we source \nour information, who do we trust, and how are certain discourses and knowledge \nreceived, internalised and accepted as \u2018reality\u2019, or challenged (Castells, 201 6, p. 9)? \nTherefore, considering this research prob lem assemblage in the context of power, and \nspecifically communication power, and how these dynamics could be operating in the \nrealms of the hyperconnected and technologically -mediated network society, has \nallowed me to situate the focus of the  research pr oblem. Rather than being concerned \nabout deeming truth and falsehood \u2013 which is an act of power in itself \u2013 this work \nseeks to examine how reality is framed, re -framed and circulated in our fractured, yet \ninterconnected, modern day digital communication en vironments.  Through \nunderstanding these dynamics we are better placed to understand the heart of \ninformational politics and power \u2013 that is \u201cpower over minds \u201d (Castells, 2016, p. 9).  \n1.1.3 The problem with \u2018the\u2019 science  \nAnother interconnected element of power ov er narratives and so -called \u2018truth\u2019, \nis what is troubling ly referred to as \u2018 the science\u2019 by those wanting to legitimise policy -\nrelated decisions, including environmental protection . The idea that there is a single \ntruth or static science is a problematic n arrative and has the potential to be \ndelegitimising and divisive ( Aklin & Urpelainen, 2014 ). This simplification does not \nreflect the true nature of knowledge or science, and in fact these binaries stand in direct \ncontradiction to the idea that knowledge c hanges and evolves in the manner of an \nalways \u2018becoming\u2019 assemblage ( Deleuze & Guattari, 198 8; Braidotti & Fuller, 2019). \nThis misguided \u2018use\u2019, or operationalisation, of science has become a key factor in this \nresearch inquiry \u2013 something that was not initially intended, but was evident following \ndata collection. Casting scientific doubt or uncertainty is a tried and  tested tactic that \n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  5 scholars have previously highlighted in research about climate change science denial \nand delegitimisation ( Ceccarelli, 2011; Dunlap & McCright, 2011; Jacques, 2006; \nLewandowsky, 2021 ; Oreskes & Conway, 2010 ; Scheufele, 2014 ).  \nMost rece ntly, the mediatisation and politicisation of science has been \ndocumented in the case of the GBR, which is recognised internationally as a site of \nbeauty, ecological diversity and significance for tourism2. In examining recent Reef -\nrelated science contest ations, Konkes & Foxwell -Norton (2021) argue that scientists \ncan be actors in the mediatisation of science communication and contribute to further \npolarising debate about climate change (p. 471). The role of science and scientists and \ntheir ability to enac t conflict and reinforce and contest narratives  and scientific \nknowledge  are explored later in this thesis in terms of information flows, framing and \npower in the contemporary communication environment.  \n1.1.4 Media power in the social news media network  \nThe role of media in framing, reframing and furthering information flows is also \na central element  of this research , which influences how publics come to \u2018know\u2019 . The \nimpact and power of media has been long studied for the ability to capture attention \nand frame reality ( Altheide and Snow, 1979; Carvalho, 2010; Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2008). \nHowever \u2013 as noted by scholars and further explored in Chapters 2 and 3 \u2013 mainstream \nmedia actors are now competing for audience attention with other content creators. In \nthis thesis, mainstream media is understood as media outlets and media professionals \nthat are existing news brands, or are associated with existing news brands, including \ncommercial or public broadcasters (Appendix C).  Yet the extent of the power that \nmainstream media has over other actors and information flows in these multi-nodal \nonline networks is an interesting and empirically underexplored dynamic. There are \nnow dynamic interplays between mainstream media actors, alternative media actors \nand other users within the disrupted mass communication multimedia network, with \nthe lines between news producers and news consumers  blurred (Hermida, 2013). Bruns  \n(2018) defines this network of news -sharing and engagement as the \u2018social news media \nnetwork\u2019, saying it comprises: \u201cconventional news organisations, alternative and \n \n \n2 Although it should be noted, the Great Barrier Reef is far less promoted and publicly understood for \nits enduring connection to Great Barrier Reef Traditional Owne rs, which is of great significance: \nwww.gbrmpa.gov.au/our -partners/traditional -owners/aboriginal -and-torres-strait-islander-heritage-\nstrategy. \n \n6 Chapter 1:  Introduction citizen media outlets, professional and citizen journalists, industry and freelance \nnewsmakers, dedicated social news curators and ordinary social media users, as a \nsocial news media network \u201d (p. 349).   \nThus, a key question emerges: while these lines have been blurred, have \ninformation flows and power relations changed? This question has been  topical in \nrecent public discourse and events in Australia, such as the Digital Platforms Inquiry \nand Senate Inquiry into Media Diversity (Australian Competition and Consumer \nCommission [ ACCC], 2019; Environment & Communications References Committee , \n2021; Flew & Wilding , 2021). As one example, during the time of conducting this \nresearch project, Facebook effectively shut down all news -related Facebook pages in \nAustralia in response to the introduction of the Australian Government\u2019s \u201cworld first \u201d \nlegislation requiring  the tech giant s to pay news media companies for content  posted \non their platforms  (Bossio et al., 2022, p. 2 ). To this effect, this work hopes to enhance \nunderstanding of mainstream media power in the contemporary communication \nenvironment, so mething I further elaborate upon in the project purpose, scope and \nobjectives section below. Firstly, while briefly discussed above, it is important to \nsituate the research problem assemblage within a broader  social realm. \n1.1.5 The broader social context  \nOf course these power relations are not operating in a vacuum, or just within the \nmultimedia mass communication networks of the network society  (Castells 2011 a), \nand the research problem needs to be situated in a broader social context  (Figure 1.1 ) \nAs this assemblage  is extremely complex and interconnected, Figure 1.1  shows only a \nfraction of the contributing elements in the problematic mix of the current social \ncontext, and does not show interconnections. Yet it has been useful for me, as the \ncurious research er, to try to situate my specific line of enquiry and consider the \nsignificance of the findings. To give a brief overview, the cluster in green relates to \nelements that directly relate to the operation of the mainstream media industry, but \nalso crossover i nto digital platforms as information providers and hosts. These \nelements all contribute to how information is accessed in terms of how it is made \navailable, or limited, and how framing may be impacted.  \nThe group in yellow relates to the engagement of \u2018pro dusers\u2019 (Bruns, 2006 , \n2008) \u2013 the hybrid user -producers in digital spaces  \u2013 with content . These factors also \ncontribute to framing and access to information flows, but are more about knowledge -\n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  7 shaping aspects. These can be internal as part of human cogniti on factors and \nbehaviour, or external, and include elements like platform design affordances, \nalgorithms, and strategic use of inauthentic accounts  and/or coordinated activity  \n(Gorwa & Guilbeault, 2020 ; Graham et al., 2020 b). The items in blue relate to \nproblematic contributors  that have epistemological implications, like a  broad societal  \nlack of media, information and scientific literacy, which can impact on how people \ncome to \u2018know\u2019 what they \u2018know\u2019. Specifically, research has shown that a limited \nunderstanding of scientific process \u2013 namely that science does not deal in 100% \nguarantees \u2013 contributes to the manipulation of this as \u2018 scientific uncertainty \u2019 and the \nundermining of science ( Lenzi, 2019 ). The elements that relate to a distorted \nunderstanding of  media and platforms\u2019 objectives have shared concerns: often the lack \nof understanding from \u2018produsers\u2019 (Bruns, 2008) that the main objective of these \nbusinesses (with some exceptions, like non-commercial public broadcasters and \nalternative outlets) is pro fit. In the case of free social media platforms (again, with \nexceptions), if users are not paying to access the product, they become the product, \nand the trade -off is in the form of data and privacy . Castells describes this as  the \n\u201ccommodification of freed om\u201d where audiences are sold the images of their lives  to \nsupport the money-making or influence -producing  goals of the platforms  (2011b, p. \n782). Yet currently there is inadequate education available to help users of digital \nplatforms to understand these rules of engagement to help navigate these challenges.  \nFinally, the elements in grey are some of the b road societal factors that relate to \nthe ability to connect and disconnect, and are central in power dynamics. These include \nfactors that can stoke societal disengagement and prompt certain disempowered social \nactors to oppose dominant institutions and practices as a way of countering power. As \nBruns (2018) notes, this dissatisfaction can fuel problematic information, with some \nbeing prepared to share disinformation and propaganda in a deliberate way, even if \nthey know the information is false, as long as it disrupts the power structures they \noppose (p. 357).  \n \n8 Chapter 1:  Introduction   \nFigure 1.1. An interpretation of some of the elements in  the research  problem assemblage  as part of a \nwider informational and epistemological context . This visualisation is not exhaustive , and the \nobjective is to highlight that there are many contributing factors. The dotted line represents the \npermeable boundary of the research problem  within the current societal era , highlighting this \nproblematic mix is  not fixed. Some of these contributing elements are  shown by  circular subnetworks. \nThis signifies that these  elements are, in-turn, comprised of a series of interconnected elements  that \nare dynamic  and ever-changing. Each of these subnetworks is clustered together in \u2018groups\u2019 of r elated \nelements, indicated by colour . The idea for this visualisation was inspired from the collective literature \nreviewed (Chapter 2 ) and the principles of relational ontology (Braidotti, 2019 ). \n\n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  9 1.2 PROJECT PURPOSE , SCOPE  AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS  \nNoting the research problem and broader context outlined above, the key \nobjective of this inquiry is to explore and understand power dynamics in contemporary \ncommunication environments and the impact on informational authority, flow s and \nknowledge. As such, the research question for this thesis is:  \nHow is power asserted and contested in the social news media network in \nrelation to environmental protection?  \nThis study addresses this question by applying Castells\u2019 network theory of \npower, which adopts his idea that , in the network society , social power is mainly \nexercised by and through networks (2016, p. 10). Specifically, Castells identifies four \ntypes that are relevant to  modern social and technological conditions: networking \npower, network power, networked power and network -making power. While these are \noutlined in Chapter 3, a key point is that each network defines its power relationships \naccording to its goals and objectives. Reflecting Castells\u2019 argument that the goal of \nmultimed ia communications networks is to attract an audience (Castells, 2011b, p. \n781), I therefore argue  that the ultimate goal of the social news media network is \naudience attention. This could be for financial purposes or ideological, though it is \noften a mix of both. To study power interplays in this hyperconnected communications \nspace, it is necessary to determine how this attention manifest s to be able to make \nclaims about power in this specific network.  \nThis involve s considering each of Castells\u2019 four forms of power and assigning \npower indicators that captured the goal of attention -getting that were appropriate to \nonline news -sharing spaces. This included identifying dominant actors, information \nflows, frames, and the tactics used to further or re-frame narra tives and contest power  \nin each social media news network of Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. The theoretical \nthinking underpinning this approach is outlined in Chapter 3, while the methodological \nstrategy, including how indicators  have been adapted to reflect the different \naffordances of each platform , is discussed in detail in Chapter 4.  \nThe case study selected was the mediatised and politicised GBR, which has \nalready been subject to research about its media politics and the way i ts protection has \nbeen framed to meet the goals of certain actors. The specific event was chosen for its \nability to induce \u2018mediatised environmental conflict\u2019 (Hutchins & Lester, 2015) \u2013 a \n \n10 Chapter 1:  Introduction  moment when various actors\u2019 competing goals and logics collide in t he context of \nenvironmental protection. This was UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage \u2018in danger\u2019 \nrecommendation in June 2021 , an event that attracted activity and conflict across \nmultimedia mass communication networks (Section 1.4) . \n1.3 CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE  \nThis wor k makes empirical contributions to knowledge  across multiple \ninterconnected disciplines , including  \u2013 but not limited to  \u2013 media studies, political \ncommunication, environmental sociology and computational social science, and also \noffers a novel way to apply  Castells\u2019 network theory of power to social media news -\nsharing spaces . It contributes to societal and scholarly debate about the role and impact \nof mainstream media in disrupted digital environments  in the context of environmental \nprotection . While this r elationship has been studied (Newman, 2017; Veltri & \nAtanasova, 2017) , there are fewer instances of systematic evaluation  across multiple \ndigital spaces, particularly  within an Australian case study . Understanding the \ndynamics and power of mainstream news media , alternative media and the interplay \nof other embedded actors across multiple platforms in framing, re -framing and \ncontributing to information flows is required to inform contemporary discussions \nabout media power and regulation , and help to address the challenges of problematic \ninformation , especially with potentially divisive topics . \nAt the case study level, this research  addresses a gap in the literature about how \nthe GBR and its protection is contested in contemporary online commun ication \nenvironments. Work has been conducted  that focuses on  mainstream traditional  media, \nbut far fewer studies explore  the media politics of the GBR in digital networks \n(Newlands & Martin, 2018) and work across multiple social media platforms in this \ncontext has not been detected . Furthermore, this work contributes to knowledge at a \nsocial media research level by addressing the call for inquiries beyond Twitter, studies \nthat simultaneous ly consider more than one platform , and draws on mixed \nmethodologies to generate richer insights from the large amounts of data available  \n(Pearce et al., 201 9; Rogers, 2017 ).  \nTheoretically, this work contributes to two main concepts. It applies Castells\u2019 \nnetwork theory of power to do what the schola r has advocated for : testing how his four \nforms of power operate in contemporary mass communication networks. This required  \n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  11 developing a series of social network theory -inspired power indicators appropriate to \ncapturing attention within the social news med ia network , understanding that the \nability to capture and hold attention is a form of power . This included adapting them \nto Twitter, YouTube and Facebook . I have applied these network -specific indicators \nof power to investigate  informational flows and dyna mics within th ese networks \nduring the  specific GBR case study. While I intend to continue to test  and refine  them \nin relevant future work, I hope they are useful for other researchers to use,  modify and \nexpand upon as needed. Finally, this work contributes  empirical evidence to Konkes \nand Foxwell -Norton\u2019s (2021) recent argument  that science is a fifth sphere of action \nin Hutchins and Lester\u2019s (2015) mediatised environmental conflict model. Verifying \nthat scientists and s cience are a social sphere in their own right reflects how science is  \ninvolved in its own power struggles with other spheres, including politics, and plays a \nrole in contributing to environmental conflict  rather than simply informing \nenvironmental policy  (Konkes & F oxwell-Norton, 2021 , p. 479; Pielke, 200 4; \nScheufele, 2014 ; Chapter 3 ). \n1.4 THE CASE STUDY: THE GREAT BARRIER REEF  \n1.4.1 Competing priorities, competing frames  \nAs one of the world\u2019s most recognis able environmental icons , the GBR offers \nthe potential for an enlightening case study. As noted by Anders Hansen (2011), public \ndebates about environmental issues are as much about communicating to win \u201chearts \nand minds\u201d, as they are to communicate science -based evidence (p. 8).  \nThe GBR and its protection has long been the subject of proxy arguments about \nenvironmental protection versus exploitation (Bowen & Bowen, 2002;  Foxwell-\nNorton & Lester, 2017; Lloyd et al., 2016; McCalman, 2013; Wright, 1977 ), but the \nWorld Heritage site has sat more squarely in the global spotlight in the recent decade \ndue to the decline in its health and long -term outlook , including four mass bleaching \nevents in recent years  (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority  [GBRMPA] , 2009, \n2014, 2019 ; Smith & Cook, 2 022). Scientific reports show this decline is \npredominantly due to global climate change  (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange [ IPCC], 2022), yet there are other more domestically -situated threats like \nwater quality, which has been attributed mainly d ue to agricultural run -off; plus \n \n12 Chapter 1:  Introduction  pressures from shipping, coastal development and crown -of-thorns starfish outbreaks \n(GBRMPA , 2022; Creighton et al., 2021; Waterhouse  et al., 2017 ).  \nAside from its global significance both ecologically and economically , the pre-\npandemic GBR was responsible for generating $6.4 billion annually for the Australian \neconomy and 64,000 jobs (Deloitte Access Economics, 2017) . It is also significant in \nthe range of stakeholders who are involved in both its exploitation and protecti on \n(Barnes et al., 2022 ; Fidelman et al., 2013;  Morrison et al., 2019 ). This includes \nnumerous actors, each with competing goals and logics, from tourism operators, \ncommercial fishers, catchment -based cane and beef farmers, major ports and mines, to \nTraditional Owners, local councils, environmental groups, and catchment \ncommunities, including recreational fishers, local GBR users and schools.  \nAdding to the competing goals of the above -mentioned stakeholders, the \noperating environment is also extremely politically charged. Not only do political \nactors need to somehow represent these diverse interests, but as the joint managers of \nthe GBR, both the Queensland state government and the federal government have an \ninterest in ensuring that this management and investment is reflected well on both the \ndomestic and global stages, particularly with the GBR having been subject to \ninternational oversight vi a UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List  since 1981  (Day, 2016; \nMorrison et al., 2020) . Understandably, this has the potential to create a scenario where \n\u2018truths\u2019 and narratives compete in public discourse in accordance with each group\u2019s \nobjectives. This can result in \u2018mediatised environmental conflict \u2019 (Hutchins & Lester, \n2015) where these differing goals and logics collide.  \n \n1.4.2 The media politics of protection  \nThe GBR and its protection ha ve been the subject of media attention for more \nthan 60 years  (Foxwell-Norton & Lester, 2017; Lloyd et al., 2016) , yet most recently \nit has become emblematic of  inadequate climate change action and policy  (Foxwell-\nNorton & Konkes, 2021 ; Hughes et al., 2021 ; Ley, 2021 ). Recent events that have \ninduced mediatised environmental conflict  include the approval to dump dredge spoil \nfrom the expansion of Abbot Point coal terminal into the Great Barrier Reef Marine \nPark in 2014 (Lankester et al., 2015), two consecutive years of mass coral bleaching \nin 2016 and 2017 (Mitchell & Roffey -Mitchell, 2018), the prognosis of the 2019 Great \nBarrier Reef Outlook Report  that the global icon had a \u201cvery poor\u201d outlook \n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  13 (GBRMPA , 2019), and further  mass coral bleaching  events in 2020 and 2022 (Rural \nand Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, 2020 ; Smith & Cook, \n2022). Another pressure point has been the Queensland government\u2019s Reef protection \nregulations, which were strengthened  in 2019 to address water quality impacts to the \nGBR (Environmental Protection and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, 2019; \nQueensland Government, 2022 ). However, this move  met opposition from some \nmembers of the farming community, right -wing politicians, lobby groups and a small \ngroup of scientists who said the science underpinning the environmental policy was \nflawed, resulting in a Senate Inquiry with the laws upheld  (Rural and Regional Affairs \nand Transport References Committee, 2020; Stubbs, 2020) . Subsequent to this, recent \nresearch into GBR water quality communication  found that there was a narrative of \nuncertainty circulating about the health of the GBR (Newlands et al., 2021) . In other \nwords, there are competing stories causing confusion , which creates a \u2018narrative void\u2019 \nfor problematic information to fi ll.  \n1.4.3 World Heritage status threat  \nThe most recent issue for the GBR, which has become the subject of this case \nstudy, is the threat of a World Heritage \u2018in danger\u2019 listing. This threat is not new, with \nUNESCO and the International Union for Conservation of  Nature (IUCN) pulling on \nthis lever in the past to spur the domestic Australian governments into action to lift \ntheir protection efforts  (Hughes et al., 2021 ; Morrison et al., 2020 ). Specifically, the \nGBR\u2019s status was questioned in 2012, and again in 2015 in response to concerns about \nindustry development on the coast and the dumping of capital dredge spoil in the \nMarine Park, respectively. An outcome of these World Heritage  \u2018in danger\u2019 listing \nthreats was the creation of the Australian and Queensland government\u2019s Reef 2050 \nLong-Term Sustainability Plan  to address the key GBR health threats  (Department of \nAgriculture, Water and the Environment  [DAWE], 2021a). Notably, this management \nplan did not originally  include addressing climate change as a threat . This was later \nadded and the plan was further updated  and released  in December 2021 as part of a \nscheduled five -year review  (Commonwealth of Australia, 2021; DAWE, 2021b; \nReadfearn, 2021 ). Alarm bells were al so sounded by the World Heritage Committee \n(WHC) in 2017 due to the impact of back -to-back years of mass coral bleaching, but \nit was not until June 2021 that the \u2018in danger\u2019 listing threat resurfaced with gusto. This \nwas in response to the aforementioned \u201cvery poor\u201d outlook for the GBR signalled by \n \n14 Chapter 1:  Introduction  the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), which called for immediate \naction on climate change ( GBRMPA , 2019). GBRMPA is the federal government \nagency for managing the GBR. As it is of relevance to this study, GBRMPA works \nclosely with another fede ral government agency \u2013 the Australian Institute of Marine \nScience (AIMS) \u2013 which is involved in conducting GBR science, along with James \nCook University\u2019s ARC College of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and several \nother academic and scientific institutions (Waterhouse  et al., 2017 ).  \nThe health of the GBR was on the agenda to discuss at UNESCO\u2019s 44th World \nHeritage Committee session in  July 2020, but this was postponed due to COVID -19 \nand rescheduled to July 2021. However, while the GBR\u2019s health had been  flagged, as \nthe government press release and media coverage shows, the government was not \nexpecting an \u2018in danger\u2019 recommendation, saying it had been \u201cblindsided\u201d and implied \npolitics was at play (Day et al., 2021 a; DAWE, 2021c). Just days before the WHC \nmeeting on July 23, 2021, AIMS released its annual coral cover report. The report \nshowed that the GBR was in a \u201crecovery window\u201d due to a reprieve from extreme \nweather, with coral rising across all regions, yet it caution ed that the GBR still \nremained under intense pressure and climate change action was needed  (AIMS, 2021a ; \nAIMS 2021b ).  \nThe outcome of the July 23, 2021 WHC meeting was to postpone the decision \nfor another year, with Australia required to provide an update on its protecti on efforts \nby February 2022 and the committee set to reconvene in  20223. At the time of writing \nthis thesis, the outcome of this meeting is unknown. For additional context that is \nrelevant to the collected data, China was the chair of the WHC at the time of data \ncollection, but this role \u2013 and appointment to the 21 -seat committee \u2013 rotates between \nthe member parties of the general assembly. Australia and another 10 countries ended \ntheir membership of the committee  in November 2021  and a new committee has b een \nelected (UNESCO World Heritage Centre, 2022).  Further, the lead -up to the 2022 \ndecision was in a federal election year and the incumbent Liberal National Party \ngovernment pledged a n additional  $1 billion towards the GBR\u2019s protection  (DAWE, \n \n \n3 This meeting was initially scheduled for June 2022 in Russia, but has since been postponed. At the \ntime of writ ing, no new date has been set.  \n \nChapter 1:  Introduction  15 2022). This commitment has  received criticism from some as the initiatives do not \ndirectly address climate change ( Evans, 2022; Gordon, 2022 ).  \nThe intersection of the above -mentioned elements creates a ripe environment for \n\u2018problematic information\u2019 and communication flows and power, especially when a \nconflict-inducing event poses a threat to political power  and neoliberal ideology . \nNamely, an \u2018in danger\u2019 listing signal s to the international community that Australia is \nnot doing enough to address climate change, which could increase global pressure for \ngrowth-limiting policy, potentially  threatening the social licence of extractive \nindustries \u2019 continued production  rates, questioning societal consumption  and \u2013 \nultimately  \u2013 challenging the hegemonic neoliberal social order (Jacques, 2006; \nMorrison et al., 2020). As such , the highly mediatised , politicised and emblematic  \nnature of the GBR makes it the ideal case study  to explore how attention is being \nattracted in the social news media network  to convey and challenge the \u2018 reality\u2019 of the \nGBR\u2019s health , the threat of climate change , and \u2013 by extension  \u2013 attitudes, values and \npractices as a society in an era of environmental, inf ormational and epistemological \ntransformation.  \n1.5 LIMITATIONS  \nThere are some limitations of this research that need to be acknowledged. While \nthe scope of this study extends to three social media platforms  and addresses the need \nfor multiplatform analyses (Ch apter 2), the  findings and subsequent discussions relate \nonly to these particular networked news environments. Further, Twitter, YouTube and \nFacebook cannot be directly compared in an \u2018apples to apples\u2019 sense because they each \nhave their own set of platform logics and affordances that affect how information is \ncreated and flows. While the research was designed to reflect those affordances, they \nare still different communication spaces. More over, this study considers English -\nlanguage posts  only and, as such, the data gathered does not account for the \ninformation flows and framing that occur in non -English-speaking contexts. Further, \nthe observations made and interpretations I make from this data are framed by my own \npositionality as a person who has lived only in capitalist liberal democracies. The \nclaims about informational authority, flows and knowledge certainly could not be \napplied to different systems of government or economic conditions as the  multimedia \nnetworks of mass communication interplay with the political and financial networks \nin different ways. These relationships , while fascinating , are not the focus o f this study . \n \n16 Chapter 1:  Introduction  Another limitation to this work is that , while the scope is clear in its goal to \nexplore the social news media network  only and the key actors and information being \nchannelled , these spaces are still impacted by power interplays in the offline world that \nare not captured in the data. While the analysis is extended  by tracki ng the \n\u2018dissemination  careers\u2019 (Bruns & Keller, 2020 ) of some key content items and includes \nthis broader context in the discussion,  further studies may benefit from  strategic semi-\nstructured interviews  with key embedded actors to provide greater analytica l insight. \nFinally, there are of course limitations associated with data collection and analysis, \nwhich I expand upon in Chapter 4.  \n1.6 THESIS OUTLINE  \nFollowing on from this Introduction chapter, which sets the scene of the research \ninquiry, the remaining chapters are as follows:  \nChapter 2  is the literature review where published work  relating to the research \nproblems and case study are explored, including existing work on Twitter, YouTube \nand Facebook that relate to information flows, media frami ng and power. It also \nincludes work-to-date about the Great Barrier Reef in the context of media and politics .  \nChapter 3  outlines the  theoretical \u2018research assemblage\u2019 designed to explore \nand understand the multifaceted problem s highlighted in this chapte r. This includes \nCastells\u2019 network theory of power as the central node, which connects with social \nnetwork theory, framing theory, and Hutchins and Lester\u2019s (2015) mediatised \nenvironmental conflict  concept. The chapter outlines how Castells\u2019 four forms of \npower will be operationalised to explore the research problem , including power \nindicators that relate to attracting attention .  \nChapter 4  explains the integrated mixed methods  approach of this research \ninquiry. This includes how Castells\u2019 network theory of power and my proposed power \nindicators for the social news media network have been deployed via social network \nanalysis metrics, and adapted to meet the affordances of Twitter, YouTube and \nFacebook. This chapte r also includes ethical considerations and methodological \nlimitations.  \nChapters 5, 6 and 7  are the results chapters, which report the findings from \nTwitter, YouTube and Facebook data respectively. Using the power indicators and \nmetrics, these chapters repo rt the most attention -getting actors in the network s (Part \n \nChapter 1:  Introductio n 17 A), dominant information sources and frames  (Part B), and power interplays through \nthe lens of connection and disconnection  (Part C). \nChapter 8  is the discussion chapter, which consider s the research question in \nlight of the results from  Twitter, YouTube and Facebook , outlining some of the key \nways that  power is asserted and contested within the social news media network . It \nalso situates the findings in the broader context of the research pro blem and existing \nliterature.   \nChapter 9  presents the conclusion where this work and its  findings are \nsummarised , including discussing the project\u2019s  broader significance , \nrecommendations, and opportunities for future lines of inquiry.  \n\n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  19 Chapter 2:  Literature Review \n2.1 INTRODUCTION  \nThis chapter situates th e research problem and research questions by exploring \nthe key literature and identifying some gaps that this inquiry intends to address  to \nunderstand power in the social news media network  in relation to environmental \nconflict. The main topics covered are  informational dynamics; science \ncommunication; media networks; politics, media and the environment; and existing \nmedia and social media work that relates specifically to the media politics of the GBR.  \nIt also provides further clarification to some terms a nd concepts that are applied in this \nthesis. This literature review  highlights some key research gaps , including examining \ncontemporary informational interplays in digital networks through the lens of power , \nand exploring how  the protection of the GBR is being contested in social media spaces, \nparticularly  how actors embedded in these spaces are interacting . There is also an \nopportunity  to address the need for further multiplatform work within social media \nresearch, principally  in relation to hybrid news -sharing environments  to consider the \ninterplay between mainstream and alternative  media. Understanding how informa tion \nis being channelled in networks of news sharing , and by whom , would offer a novel \ninsight into how \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 are being conveyed and contested across \nmultiple social media platforms in relation to the protection of the GBR . Literature \nrelating specifically to the research design is outlined in Chapter 4.  \n2.2 INFORMATIONAL DYNAMICS  \n2.2.1 Problematic information and framing  \nOur engagement with information, accessible to us through a variety of means, \ncontributes to our sense  and knowledge -making. Yet while incorrect and misleading \ninformation is not new and has historically been recognised under numerous terms, \nrecent public discourse has seen a focus on \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018disinformation\u2019, \nparticularly following the decent ralisation of communication spaces and global events \nthat have diffracted attention from traditional knowledge sources ( Marwick et al., \n2021). As noted in Chapter 1, the intent of this study is not to attempt to classify \ninformation as \u2018true or false\u2019, rat her, it is more interested in how messages are framed \n \n20 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  to further certain goals. However, it is still useful to define these salient terms in the \ncontext of this inquiry.  \n As such, the term \u2018fake news \u2019 became prolific during recent events in US \npolitics. However, s cholars have since foregrounded its problematic use, describing \nthe term as \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d to capture the complex phenomena of information \ndisorder (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017 , p. 5; see also Freelon & Wells, 2020 ). Carmi \net al. (2020)  and Krasni (2020) note that the term \u2013 originally directed at the media to \ncriticise inaccurate reporting  \u2013 has since been co -opted by political actors to discredit \nnews reports and reported information  they simply do not like, and to undermine \nscience. Contextually, Krasni (2020) situates \u2018fake news\u2019 as an operationalised form \nof the post -truth concept. Other common terms include \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \n\u2018disinformation\u2019 , which Wardle and Derakhshan (2017) group as components  of \n\u201cinformation disorder \u201d (p. 20). They define misinformation as information that is \nincorrect, but not created to intentionally cause harm, while disinformation is \ndeliberately false and intended to \u201charm a person, social group, organisati on or \ncountry\u201d (p. 20).  \nWhile the c onsideration of  disinformation, or propaganda, is appropriate and \nvaluable for many \u2018media politics\u2019 studies ( Faris et al., 2017; Glazunova et al., 2021; \nMarwick & Lewis, 2017 ; Starbird et al., 2019) , it is not a key focu s of this work . \nRather, this  research is about how \u2018reality\u2019 is positioned and contested by and through \ncertain actors in the social news media network , so the term \u2018problematic information\u2019 \n(Jack, 2017) is more useful. Caroline Jack explains: \u201cSome inform ation is problematic: \nit is inaccurate, misleading, inappropriately attributed, or altogether fabricated\u201d (p. 1). \nJack notes the lines between advertising, public relations, and public diplomacy can \nblur with content deliberately designed to manipulate and deceive . Campaigns \ndesigned to impart \u201cpower of minds \u201d (Castells, 201 6, p. 9) can involve both accurate \nand misleading information.  \nThe strategic positioning of information is also understood  in media studies and \npolitical communication  as \u2018framing\u2019  (Entman, 2010) . While framing theory is \nexplored further in Chapter 3, Hansen (2011) and Nisbet (2009) describe how frames \nare strategically deployed and manipulated by central actors in public environmental \ndebates. This impacts the nature of th e media coverage  and public understanding of \ncontroversial and complex environmental issues.  Somerville and Ames  (2020) refer to \n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  21 Goffman (1986), Lepisto -Johansson (2010) and Scheufele (1999) to argue that  media \nconsumers subconsciously draw from the frames  used to report the news to construct \ntheir social reality, with framing occurring during both the delivery of the information \n(by the media) and receiving the content (by the audience).  \nIn relation to scientific information, Scheufele (2014) says  \u201cmediated realities \u201d \n(p. 13588)  are an important conduit between  science and non-expert audiences . The \nmedia capture and distil the relevant information so audiences do not need to, which \nresults in mediated realities impacting public perceptions of science gene rally, but also \nacross specific topics (Scheufele, 2014). While scholars have used this lens to \nunderstand how environmental issues have been packaged from senders (Nisbet & \nNewman, 2015; O\u2019Neill  et al., 2015), more work is needed to understand  how they ar e \nunpacked by different receivers in communication environments ( Hansen, 2011). This \nincludes understanding how actors like scientists, politicians and \u2018lay publics\u2019 accept \nor reject frames (p. 19).  \n2.2.2 Contemporary communication spaces  \nSocial media platforms  and their benefits have been the subject of numerous \nstudies (Becken et al., 2017; Dwivedi et al., 2018 ; Given et al., 2017; Hemsley et al., \n2018;Plant, 2004 ). In the early 2000s, scholars suggested that the Internet could foster \ndeliberative discourse ( Stromer-Galley, 2000 ), thus enhancing the deliberative \ncapacity of society \u2013 a condition that has been described as central to democracy \n(Dryzek, 2009). However, others have cast the spotlight on the drawbacks of digitally -\nmediated spaces. These include concerns about quality and veracity of the information \n(Iyengar & Massey, 2019; Park et al., 2020a ), the ability for platforms to be used as \ntools of manipulation ( Dobson, 2022; Scheufele & Krause, 2019), the potential impact \nof inauthentic accounts  and coordinated activity  (Gorwa & Guilbeault, 2020; Graham \net al., 2020 b; Vosoughi et al., 2018 ) and the tendency for business models to target \nuser attention at the cost of information quality (Krasni, 2020).  \nAlso in this mix are concern s about audiences being served information based \non their preferences and biases, with this personalisation of content prompting public \nand academic discussion about the existence of \u2018echo chamber s\u2019 and \u2018filter bubble s\u2019 \n(Pariser, 2011) , and instigating a h ost of work on Twitter in particular ( Barber\u00e1 et al., \n2015; Bright, 2018; Conover et al., 2011 ; Himelboim et al., 2013 a) and on other \nplatforms to lesser degrees ( Bakshy et al., 2015; Bessi et al., 2016; Bozdag, 2020). The \n \n22 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  argument is essentially over huma n versus algorithmic agency (noting of course \nalgorithms are created by humans) in directing information flows. In an \u2018echo \nchamber\u2019 situation, it is argued a person will only be exposed to information flows that \nsupport their existing views (Sunstein, 20 02, as cited in Bright, 2018 ), largely due to \nmathematical instructions personalising content for social media users  in the form of \nalgorithms (Pariser, 2011 , as cited in Barber\u00e1, 2020 ). However, recent research has \nhighlighted how this metaphor is an oversimplification and reality is far more nuanced \n(Arguedas et al., 2022; Bruns, 2019 b; Gei\u00df et al., 2021) . For instance, it does not \naccount for the information that hybrid user -producers are exposed to offline, or on \nother platforms, or even within diff erent topics or issues on the same platform. Also, \nit does not factor in pre -conditions, like hyper -partisanship (Barbera et al., 2015; \nWischnewski et al., 2021 ) or nuances when encountering information that is contrary \nto beliefs ( Bright at al., 2020; Garrett, 2009).  \nWhile it has been shown consistently offline (Petray, 201 0; Barnes et al., 2016 ) \nand online ( Himelboim et al., 2013 a; Williams et al., 2015 ) that human actors exhibit \na desire to group with like -others, a concept known as homophily (McPherson et al., \n2001), or selective exposure (Himelboim et al., 2013b) ; research into polarisation \nseeks to examine whether this connection is also about disconnection. For instance, \naccording to Guerra et al., 2013, to better understand polarisation, researchers need to \nlook for the presence or absence of antagonism, since \u201chomophily is a pattern present \nboth on non -polarised and polarised networks, but antagonism is expected only on the \nlatter\u201d (p. 5).  \n2.2.3 Refusing to know  \nHuman psychology factors that have been high lighted as knowledge  barriers \ninclude selective exposure (discussed above), motivated reasoning, and confirmation \nbias (Weeks et al., 2017; Lenzi, 2019; Scheufele & Krause, 2019) can impede \nconnection. Scheufele and Krause (2019) link these factors to indi viduals becoming \nmisinformed about political and science information, with audiences choosing to \nnotice and accept information that supports current beliefs  (confirmation bias). This \navoids \u2018cognitive dissonance\u2019: the uncomfortable feeling of encountering new \ninformation that clashes with an established worldview (Scheufele & Krause, 2019). \nThese factors all contribute to a refusal to \u2018know\u2019, even when presented with evidence, \nand can result in the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d (Bail et al., 2018, p. 9217) where information \n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  23 rejectors further dig into their ideological position when faced with counter \u2018truths\u2019. \nAnother interesting idea raised by Popkin (1994) in Scheufele (2013) is the not ion of \n\u201clow information rationality\u201d (p. 14044). This concept suggests that humans receive \nso much information on a daily basis that , in order to process it quickly and efficiently , \nthey employ various shortcuts to prevent decision -making overload, which c an often \ninvolve defaulting to pre -existing values, or cues from mass media about how to \ninterpret scientific issues.  \n2.2.4 Societal factors  \nBroader ranging societal elements can also impact information flows, including \nscience communication. Some of these were highlighted in Chapter 1, but they include \npolitical polarisation ( Bail et al., 2018; Conover et al., 2011; Lenzi, 2019 ; Scheufele, \n2013), growing economic equalities (Scheufele & Krause, 2019), a changing \nmainstream media landscape, including reduced dive rsity, the loss of regional \nnewspapers, decline in science news and science journalists ( ACCC, 2019; Newlands, \n2020; Park et al., 2020b ; Park et al., 2021;  Public Interest in Journalism Initiative, \n2022; Scheufele, 2013 ; Simons & Dickson, 2019 ), fluctuatin g  trust in news (ACCC, \n2019; Farhall et al., 2019; Park et al., 2020a; Park et al., 2020b ; Park et al., 2021 ), and \nlinks between lower socio -economic circumstances and reduced media literacy (Park \net al., 2021) , and insufficient media and data literacy mo re broadly (Carmi et al., 2020) . \nAnother element is the \u2018mediati sation of science\u2019 in the way scientists seek coverage \nto support funding and research exposure, while the media seek stories with conflict \nto draw attention, or that align with its own goals ideologically (Jacques, 2006; \nScheufele, 2014; Konkes & Foxwell -Norton, 2021).  \n2.3 SCIENCE COMMUNICATION  \n2.3.1 Misunderstanding science  \nResearch has also found a failure to understand scientific process plays a strong \nrole in undermining scientific trust and credib ility (de Melo -Martin & Intemann, 2013 ; \nDobson, 2022 ). Stating that \u201cmisinformation works precisely because the public \nmisunderstands science\u201d, Lenzi (2019) argues that scientific illiteracy makes it  \nchallenging to identify reliable scientific claims, or distinguish these from misleading \nclaims. A further problem is science\u2019s commitment to challenge, revision and refus al \nto claim 100% certainty , which is  misinterpreted as science  being \u201cunclear or \n \n24 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  muddled\u201d  (Douglas, 2015, as cited in Lenzi, 2019 , p. 318). Lenzi (2019) further argues \nan audience\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of scientific claims worsens if science is \npoliticised. These thoughts are echoed by Chubb (2012), Scheufele  (2014) and Dobs on \n(2020), with the latter saying the \u201cprovisional nature of science is often used to attack \nthe process in the media, which sends mixed messages to the public and politicians\u201d \n(p. 2), with elected officials often undermining  scientific credibility for pol itical \npurposes. Aklin and Urpelainen (2014) concur, recognising the difficulty for scientists \nto \u201cwin debate in the media\u201d (p. 176).  This has resulted in the use of terms like \u201cjunk \nscience\u201d (Douglas, 2009, p. 10), which morphed into \u201cpoliticized science\u201d  (p. 12), and \nis used to undermine the results of studies that \u201cone did not like rather than science \nthat was truly flawed\u201d (p. 12).  \nHowever,  despite th e recent  politicisation and public discrediting of science  for \nstrategic gain  (examples from the GBR co ntext: Johnson, 2020; Chubb et al., 2020)  \nand some discussing how trust in scien ce has eroded (Iyengar & Massey, 2019; \nDobson, 2022),  other literature suggests scientific trust remains more robust than trust \nin other actors like politicians and media outlets, including confidence in news \npublished on social media  platforms  (Scheufele, 2013; MacKeracher et al., 2018; Flew \net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020b ; Park et al., 2021 ; Park et al., 2022 ). \n2.3.2 Scientific uncertainty  and policy  \nFarkas and Schou (2020) vi ew the \u201cthe truth -telling capacities held by science \nare as much of a product of discursive battles as any other part of society\u201d (p. 27). Yet \nthese discursive battles can have consequences, with  Aklin and Urpelainen \u2019s (2014) \nfinding how communicating even  small amounts of scientific dissent can impact the \naudience\u2019s likelihood to support environmental policy . This means a high degree of \nconsensus is required from the scientific community to successfully convince the \npublic about a problem. As such, the sow ing of scientific uncertainty has become a \nwell-trodden tactic for thinktanks, industry and other organisations are willing to \n\u201cmanufacture dissent simply to derail policies they find economically or ideologically \nundesirable\u201d (de Melo -Martin & Intemann, 2 013, p. 233 , see also  Ceccarelli, 2011; \nDunlap & McCright, 201 1; Jacques, 2006; Lewandowsky, 2021; Miller & Dinan, \n2015; Oreskes & Conway, 2010; Taylor, 2014 ). Dunlap & McCright (2011) cite \nBegley (2007) to describe the collective of contrarian scientists, fossil fuel \ncorporations, conservative thinktanks , amateur bloggers, public relations firms, \n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  25 conservative media and pundits, conservative politicians, and strategically -created \n\u2018grassroots\u2019 lobby groups  as the \u201cdenial machine\u201d (p. 144), saying they are able to \nwork towards the shared goal of undermining climate-related regulation,  even if their \nefforts are not being coordinated.  \nSome argue this approach has served to sow uncertainty in climate science and \ninhibit the development of climate polic y, including  in Australia (Chubb, 2012; \nEnvironment & Communications References Committee, 2021; Lidberg 2019; Meade; \n2020; Parliament of Australia, 2020; Taylor, 2014 ). Lidberg (2018) recognises that \nclimate policy is already a complex area, yet the misin formation and, at times, \n\u201coutright lies regarding climate science \u201d (p. 83) has made it even harder for policy \nmakers to navigate this space . Yet de Melo -Martin and Intemann (2013) caution \nagainst considering all scientific dissent as an obstacle to public policy, saying \ncurtailing scientific debate for fear of confusing the public or policymakers can deter \nscientists from voicing genuine doubts, which can stifle the advancement of both \nscience and policy  (see also Driscoll et al., 2020 a; Driscoll et al., 20 20b; Holst & \nMolander , 2017; Goldberg & Vandenberg, 2021 ). They argue rather than supressing \ndissent, a more effective approach is improving scientific literacy.  Further, Ceccarelli \n(2011) argues public education should involve scientists countering claims  that dissent \nis being silenced an d explaining how science involves open  and lengthy  debates \namongst experts, but \u2013 on the issue of global warming  \u2013 the science has been decisively \nsettled. \n2.4 MEDIA NETWORKS  \n2.4.1 Media logic(s)  \n\u2018Mass media logic\u2019 was conceptualised  more than 40 years ago (Altheide & \nSnow, 1979) to explain the rationality generated in and by media organisations that \npenetrated \u201cevery public domain\u201d (2013, p. 3). It also explains media\u2019s ability to frame \nreality, w hile claiming neutrality when it reports the \u2018truth\u2019 as it perceives  it. As noted \nearlier, this framing impacts the way people perceive this reality ( Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2008 ), \nnoting each receiver will also be affected by internal and external factors, including \nexisting values, demography and current social \u2018realities\u2019. The idea of media logic has \nsince been updated to reflect today\u2019s less hierarchical communication spaces, with \nterms used like \u2018social media logic\u2019 (van Dijck and Poell, 2013) , \u2018network media logic \u2019 \n \n26 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  (Klinger & Svensson, 201 5), and \u2018social news logic\u2019 (Hurcombe, 2019)  used to reflect \nthat the objective of audience attention and advertising dollars remain the same, but \nthe ways of achieving this differ (van Dijck and Poell, 2013).  \nHighlighting the similarities and differences between traditional or mass media \nlogic and social media  logic, van Dijck and Poell (2013) argue that while social media \nlogic needs to be understood as separate from mass media logic, it is increasingly being \nentangled in mass m edia logic , or \u2013 as  Klinger & Svensson (2015) suggest \u2013\n\u201coverlapping\u201d it (p . 1241). Others argue the duality between old and new media is now \nredundant \u2013 instead scholars must look at the dynamic interplay between them within \ntoday\u2019s \u201cfast -moving media eco logy\u201d (Cottle, 2013, p. 20). As such, Chadwick \ndescribes \u201chybrid media logic s\u201d (Chadwick et al., 2016, p. 8), which are intentionally \nplural and combine older and newer media logics in the \u201creflexively connected social \nfields of media and politics\u201d (Chadwi ck et al., 2016, p. 4).  \n2.4.2 A news-making system  \n\u2018Mediated reality\u2019 was once conveyed  to audiences via a linear flow of \ninformation, but technological developments have transformed communication \nsystems into interconnected networks where information flows occur in multiple \ndirections and via numerous actors (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955; Ognyanova, 2017). \nScholars acknowledge how \u2018communication power \u2019 (Castells, 201 3) has become \nradically reconfigured and redispersed in the networked wor ld (Bruns, 2018; \nChadwick et al., 2016; Cottle 2013;  Khosravinik & Unger, 2016; Scheufele , 2013). In \nthis context, power is understood in alignment with Castells\u2019  definition as \u201cthe \nrelational capacity that enables a social actor to influence asymmetricall y the decisions \nof other social actor (s) in ways that favor  the empowered actor\u2019s will, interests and \nvalues\u201d (2013, p. 10). The globally interconnected \u2018network society\u2019 (2011a; Chapter \n3) has changed the roles and power dynamics between \u2018communicators\u2019 a nd \n\u2018audiences\u2019, leading to the creation of terms like \u2018mass  self-communication\u2019 (Castells, \n2007), which refers to the agency of the audience in shaping and producing messages ; \nand \u2018produsers\u2019 (Bruns, 200 8), a term that reflects the hybrid role of content p roducers \nand platform users in digital communication environments. Non -expert publics, \nincluding industry groups, activists and politicians, can now publish directly via social \nmedia networking sites and interact directly with others (Scheufele , 2013). As noted \nby Khosravinik and Unger (2016), this disrupts the traditional linear flow of \n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  27 information from \u201ccertain (privileged) producers to (ordinary, powerless) consumers\u201d \n(p. 206) and has allowed modern media users to produce content in a participatory \nmanner (Papacharissi, 2002; Petray, 2011).   \nAs noted above, Chadwick  and colleagues (2016)  view these disrupted power \ndynamics as a \u201chybrid media system \u201d (p. 8) consisting of \u201cnews making assemblages \u201d \n(p. 24). This hybrid thinking stems from the social theory of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix \nGuattari (198 8), specifically that meaning and power are understood in terms of an \nassemblage\u2019s connections and disconnections with other assemblages. It also builds \nupon Manu el Castells\u2019 understanding of digital media systems as assemblages, where \nthey continually adapt according to the goals being pursued ( Chadwick et al., 2016, p. \n6; Castells, 2016 ). For clarity, Castells uses the term \u2018network\u2019 to describe these \ndynamic systems (Castells, 2011 a, 2011b, 2013, 2016). In Chadwick\u2019s hybrid media \nsystem approach, there are three theoretical pillars used to explore media politics: \npower, the idea of a system (or assemblage ), and media logics (Chadwick et al., 2016). \nThis thinking closely aligns with Castells\u2019 conception of the network society , including  \nframes being embedded in the process of communication to generate meaning  \n(Castells, 2011 b, p. 776; Chapter 3).  \nOther scholars have also understood this news -making assemblage  as the \u2018social \nnews media network\u2019. As noted in Chapter 1, Bruns says this integrated news sharing \nand engagement space is comprised of  traditional news outlets, alternative news \nsources, professional and non -professional journalists, industry and freelance news -\nmakers, news and information curators and  ordinary user -producers (2018). It also \nincludes the social media platforms themselves. Scholars argue that news -making \nneeds to be understood as a networked practice involving multiple stakeholders, with \nestablished media outlets understood as \u201cembedded participants\u201d (Bruns, 2018, p. 359) \nwithin the social news media network, rather than separate actors ( Beckett, 2010; \nHermida, 2013).  \n2.4.3 Media power  \nUnderstanding the interplays between these embedded actors and the \nimplications for information flows in thes e decentralised  online networks provides a \nway to understand power relationships, with a need for further empirical research \n(Arguedas et al., 2022; Bruns, 2018; Cottle, 2013; Chadwick et al., 2016; Hansen, \n2015; Pearce et al., 2019 ; van Dijck and Poell, 2013 ). Recent work has considered  \n \n28 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  information flows in contemporary communication environments . Klinger & \nSvensson (201 5) discuss the role of \u201cpopular online intermediaries\u201d (p. 1249) in the \nform of bloggers, w ho have fewer readers but can be influe ntial as information -\nspreading catalysts , as opposed to traditional gatekeepers .  \nIn a Twitter study examining the influential actors, information flows and frames \nfollowing the release of an IPCC report, Newman (2017) found those who attracted \nthe most at tention were \u2018non -elite actors\u2019 (35%), defined as  \u201cusers that did not have \nan affiliation with a particular media, nonprofit, or scientific organisation\u201d (p. 818), \nand included independent bloggers, activists and concerned citizens. The next largest \ngroup was media organisations (17%). Of these media actors, mainstream media was \nthe most dominant actor (35%), followed by \u2018new media\u2019 (23%), which included \nindividual blogs and online -only media platforms (p. 821). The Guardian  was the most \ndominant mainstream  news organisation in the sample, but Newman  notes the extent \nof mainstream media\u2019s influence was not universal , with 40% of the links being new \nmedia sources, including science and environment news websites  (p. 823).  \nThe Guardian  was also highlighted as a dominant source in Kirilenko and \nStepchenkova \u2019s (2014) Twitter study, with 5% of all tweets containing its domain. \nThis compares to the most attention-getting alternative news sources, which were \nclimate sceptic blogs Watts Up With That  and Climate Depot  (0.2% each) . Likewise, \nVeltri and Atansova  (2017) found that about two -thirds of URLs about climate change \nin their Twitter data went  to \u201cprofessional news organisations\u201d (p. 73 3), which \nincluded newspapers and public broadcasting companies.  Collecting and analysing \nabout 70,000 media stories that were shared on Facebook and Twitter  in the lead up to \nthe 2016 US election campaign , Faris et al.\u2019s (2017) found a difference in news -\nsharing patterns according to political alignment. While there was continued centrality \nin the role of mainstream news outlets across the political spectrum from centre -right \nto left, including sources like The Guardian ; conservative media tended to be mor e \npartisan and insular than the left, with a noticeable gap in authority for news sources \nfrom the centre -right.  \nScholars have surveyed publics across several different countries about their \ninformation consumption habits to understand the significance  of media actors in \ndigital spaces. In Australia, TV remains the main news source  (including for climate \nchange-related news) , but since 2019 there has been a shift towards social media  as a \n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  29 news information provider  (Park et al., 2020; Park et al., 2021). Yet the majority of \nsocial media users do not go to these platforms for news specifically, they tend to \nencounter news content while they are there for other reasons (Park et al., 2021; \nNewman et al., 2021). Taking a view across 46 coun tries, Newman et al. (2021) note \nthat while audiences pay the most attention to information from mainstream news \noutlets on Facebook and Twitter (28% and 31% respectively), attention is directed to \ncelebrities and influencers on platforms like Instagram, S napChat and TikTok (p. 24). \nYouTube is a mix with mainstream news sources and personalities capturing attention \n(25% and 24% respectively). Th ose accessing smaller or alternative sources of news \nremains fairly consistent across all platforms at 11 -16% of information sources. Park \net al. (2021) had similar findings in their study of Australia -based news consumers, \nwith Facebook, Twitter and YouTube users in Australia mostly paying attention to \nmainstream news outlets and professional journalists (p. 65).   \nAmongst the calls  for more research in these spaces , Cottle notes exploring the \ninteractions between \u201cnetworks of operatives\u201d (2013, p. 24) is especially relevant in \nthe context of environmental conflict. This includes considering networks that contain \nactors from institutions like government and science, with further examination needed \nto understand how they are influencing environmental news discourses and mobilising \nonline and offline action. Further, Pearce et al. (201 9) say additional work is needed \ninto the dynamics within and between groups on social media networks to help to \nincrease understanding about the role of civility in climate change conversations (p. \n6). Hansen (2011) identifies a need to map the flows of claims -making and claims to \nsee how me dia attention is achieved, but also how legitimacy and gained and action is \ninvoked (Hansen, 2011, p. 13). Hansen (2011) and Carvalho (2010)  say further \ninvestigat ion is needed about  how different publics interact with the frames in media \nand communication s content, including the interplay of alternative media and other \nactors, and how these messages influence  publics\u2019 understanding, communication and \nactions. \n2.5 POLITICS, MEDIA  AND THE ENVIRONMENT  \n2.5.1 Australian media, politics, and environmental attitudes  \nRecognising that media coverage of climate change feeds into the shaping of \npublic attitudes and policymaking ( Carvalho, 2010; Lidberg, 2018 ; Speck, 2010 ), it is \n \n30 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  significant  that Australia has been subject to about 20 years of \u201cclimate change wars\u201d \n(Kelly, 2017, as cited in Lidberg, 2018 ; see also Taylor, 2014 ). This has seen those \nsceptical of the existence and impact of climate change , along with  mining and fossil \nfuel advo cates, using various tactics to sew dissent and doubt ( Holmes & Star 2018; \nCook et al., 2019; McKnight, 2010; Taylor, 2014 ; Tranter & Foxwell -Norton, 2021 ). \nThe level of government support for policies designed to protect the environment has \nvaried greatly  in an environment that is politically hostile  (Lidberg, 2018; Manne, \n2011; MacNeil, 2021 ), with the current Coalition government being the subject of \ncriticisms levelled at its lack of action on climate change  ( Australian Associated Press, \n2022; Climate Action Tracker, 2021). This focus on the economy at the expense of the \nenvironment is known as \u2018productivism\u2019 , defined by Giddens (2009) as a \u201cstress on \neconomic growth as a prime value\u201d (as cited in Hutchins & Lester, 2015, p. 342).  \nThese attitudes are a lso seemingly reflected within some quarters of the \nAustralian public. While about three quarters of Australians are concerned about \nclimate change (Park et al., 2020b ; Quicke, 2021 ), the Digital News Report  2020 (Park \net al., 2020b), found that the proportion of climate change deniers in Australia was \namongst the highest of the 40 countries surveyed, with nearly one -fifth stating climate \nchange was not a serious issue (Park et al., 2020b, p. 15). Further, the aut hors found \nthat respondents who listened to right -wing commercial AM radio (including 2GB, \n2UE and 3AW) and watched News Corp -owned Sky News  Australia and Fox News  \nwere less likely to think climate change was serious (35 %, 35% and 32% respectively) . \nThis compares to seven percent of Nine Publishing\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald  readers, \nand 12% of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s ( ABC), and 13% of  News Corp -\nowned The Australian \u2019s audiences  (Park et al., 2020b, p. 1 7).  The annual survey also \nfound there was a divide in terms of political preferences and trust about climate \nchange reporting, with 27 % of right-wing news consumers believing climate change \nreporting was accurate, versus 44 % of left-wing consumers  (p.21). Further, 55 % of \nthose who did not trus t the news thought climate change coverage was inaccurate (Park \net al., 2020b).  \n2.5.2 Concentrated media ownership  \nAustralia has a well -documented high concentration of media ownership ( Bacon \n& Jegan, 2020; Papandrea  & Tiffen, 2016; Jones & Pusey, 2010; Lidberg 2019 ; \nStanford, 2021 ). Of the seven commercial media news organisations in Australia, \n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  31 News Corp and Nine Publishing are the largest and cross all forms of traditional media, \nplus have a  popular online presence ( Environment & Co mmunications References \nCommittee, 2021; Lidberg, 2019; Newlands, 2020). The political orientation of offline \nand online audiences in relation to their  news sources is shown in  Figure 2.1  and Figure \n2.2. New Corp\u2019s news brands are distinctly more right -wing (including Sky News , The \nAustralian , the Herald Sun , the Daily Telegraph ), with Sky News\u2019  offline audience \npositioned even further right than Fox News  (Hopkins & Ladd, 2013 ; Merkley & \nStecula, 2018 ). In comparison, public broadcaster the ABC is generally  in the centre, \nwhile Nine Publishing\u2019s audiences are left -leaning, however not as left as The \nGuardian\u2019s  audience (Figure 2.2).  \nNews Corp owns more than half of the Australian newspaper market (Bacon & \nJegan, 2021) , including two -thirds of the metropolita n mastheads, has radio interests , \nand the majority  share of the Foxtel news network ( Environment & Communications \nReferences Committee, 2021 , p. xiii). This includes  the national daily ( The Australian ) \nplus nearly all  newspapers in Queensland (printed and online ), including the majority \nin the GBR catchment area , and the Queensland state daily newspaper ( The Courier \nMail). Concerns about the concentration of ownership manifested recently in the \nSenate Inquiry into Media  Diversity in Australia (2021). It was in response to  more \nthan 500,000 signatures on petition instigated  by former Australian prime minister \nKevin Rudd, with concerns centred on the impact of News Corp to \u2018democracy \u2019 \n(Parliament of Australia, 2020) . It also specifically cited concerns about the \u201cclout\u201d \nthe commercial news outlet had to impact Australian climate policy (2021, p. xiv).  \n \nFigure 2.1.

The political orientation of audiences of online news brands (citations and  as above) . \n \n2.5.3 News Corp\u2019s media power  \nNews Corp has received  considerable  scholarly attention. This includes findings \nthat the publisher is \u201cwoefully biased\u201d (Newlands, 2020 , p. 311); has often privileged \nthe voices of climate sceptics  \u2013 particularly through opinion pieces  and commentary  \u2013 \nelevating them to the status of courageous dissidents against oppressive beliefs or \ncensorship ; has politicised science; and has either den ied or ignored climate science \nnews, including events relating to the GBR (Bacon, 2013; Bacon & Jegan, 2021; \nBlaine, 2019; Chubb, 2012;  Grien & MacNeil, 2022;  Holmes & Star, 2018; Lidberg, \n2019; Manne, 2011; McKnight, 2010; McKnight, 2012 ; Painter, 2013 ).  Work is \ncurrently underway in exploring the impact Sky News Australia  has on Facebook and \nYouTube, with a particu lar focus on the outlet\u2019s role in distributing ideologically \ndivisive and problematic information (Copland et al., 2021).  \nCastells himself, along with colleague Amelia Arsenault (2008) , studied how \nNews Corp and its founder, Rupert Murdoch, have been able to negotiate power \ndynamics of the network society to serve business goals. They suggest the ability to \ncontrol connection points between different networks \u2013 like business, media and \npolitics \u2013 is a critical source of power. The authors found that  Murdoch himself is a \n\u201cswitcher\u201d, having the ability to connect media, business and political networks in the \ninterests of furthering his company\u2019s own goals , and is a businessman above all else  \n(Arsenault & Castells, 2008 , p. 508). \n\n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  33 2.6 SCIENCE COMMUNICATION IN DIGITAL SPACES  \nConsidering the role that social media networks play as a channel to \ncommunicate science information  (Scheufele  & Krause, 2019 ), several studies \nhighlight how science -related information flows across these networks. Using a v ariety \nof research designs and methodology, some of these in vestigate the anti-vaccination \nmovement (Smith & Graham, 2019; Johnson et al., 2020 ; Cinelli et al., 2021 ) and \nCOVID-19 misinformation  and information engagement  (Pennycook et al., 2020; \nSerrano e t al., 2020 ; Wang & Qian, 2021 ), and others examine  environmental issues \nlike climate change (Pearce et al., 2014; O\u2019Neill et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2015; \nAndreotta et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2019) and natural disasters ( Bec & Becken, 201 9). \nTaking a closer look at some of the environment -focused studies, Jaques et al. \n(2019) analysed 900 Facebook comments on the posts of US -based news \norganisations, finding  a \u201cdiscursive struggle over the concept of science\u201d (p. 11). The \ncritical discourse analysis found, while commentators used different tactics, often \nscientific claims were not evaluated on the basis of evidence, rather attacked in \naccordance with the perceived agenda of the scientist or institution, or dismissed based \non emotionally -fuelled reason ing, rather than empirical evidence.  \nPearce et al. (2014) and Andreotta et al. (2019) had similar findings in their \nTwitter stud ies. Pearce et al. (2014) researched  the release of IPCC 2013 Working \nGroup I report, seeking to establish if communities were as polarised about climate \nchange as literature suggested. The hashtags related to science showed polarised views \nin relation to climate science, including hashtags that suggested a \u201cbattle or war is \nbeing fought over science\u2026 with scientists caught in the  middle\u201d (Pearce et al., 2014, \np. 4). Andreotta et al.\u2019s (2019) mixed methods study also detected climate change \ndenial and the legitimacy of climate change and climate science amongst its five main \nthemes. Another key theme was climate change action, wher e users were often critical \nof current progress towards addressing climate change, criticising the approaches by \ngovernments and politicians.  \nA further finding of Pearce et al. (2014) was that people were more likely to \nmake conversational connections (via tags or hashtags) with those who broadly shared \ntheir views on climate change, a consistent finding across those supportive and \nunsupportive of the IPCC (Pearce et al., 2014). Williams et al. (2015) echoed these \nfindings in a four-month-long Twitter study that collected hashtags relating to the topic \n \n34 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  and classified user attitudes to climate change based on message content. The authors \nfound strong attitude -based homophily , the tendency  to group with others that share \nsimilar views,  with \u2018sceptic\u2019 and \u2018activist\u2019 groups segregated  into \u2018polarised groups \u2019, \nbut also detected mixed attitude communities where these ideologically -opposed \nactors interacted. They found that \u2018activists\u2019 were more  active information spreaders \nthan \u2018sceptics\u2019, but further work was needed to understand the \u201cmulti -step flow of \nonline communication about climate change\u201d (p. 136), including how the opinions of \nsocial media users are shaped.  \nIn terms of framing, O\u2019Neill et al. (2015) also studied an IPCC report release \nacross Twitter, finding that the most dominant frame was \u2018settled science \u2019, which \nemphasised the \u2018broad expert consensus \u2019 about climate science, with the authors \nsuggesting that climate change advocates too k the opportunity presented by the release \nof the Working Group reports to legitimise climate science. Newman (2017) built upon \nO\u2019Neill et al. \u2019s (2015) and Pearce et al. \u2019s (2014) earlier findings by studying the 2013 \nreport\u2019s release on Twitter, examining the key actors, information sources and frames. \nThe most salient frame was \u2018public understanding\u2019 (27%) which referred to Tweets \nhelping the public to learn from the report\u2019s findings, with the next being \u2018settled \nscience\u2019 (18%), which re lated to consensus  about the report\u2019s findings, but also the \nrole of humans in climate change. While Allgaier (2019) analysed 200 videos to see \nhow climate change was being discussed  on YouTube, finding that 107 of the videos \ndid not support the scientific consensus on clim ate change, with 16 denying \nanthropogenic climate change and 91 furthering climate -related conspiracy theories.  \n2.7 CASE STUDY: A POLITICISED AND MEDIATISED GREAT \nBARRIER REEF  \nThere are several publications examining GBR mainstream media framing  and \ncommunication tactics. Foxwell-Norton & Konkes (2018) examine the way media \ncoverage was framed during two historical switching points \u2013 the first being the GBR\u2019s \naddition to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List in 1981, and the secon d the threat of \nremoval in 2012. The authors analysed 125 articles from four newspapers, which were \nall from News Corp publications due to the dominance of the publisher in the GBR \ncatchment. The main findings were that the GBR\u2019s protection has increasingl y become \na feature of Australian news; the coverage was marked by the dominance of political \nand industry sources; there was a strong absence of scientists, environmental NGOs, \n \nChapter 2:  Literature Review  35 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as sources, and there was a si gnificant \nincrease in the framing of protection as a negative, or undesirable, between 1981 and \n2012 (Foxwell -Norton & Konkes, 2018). The authors found  that protection of the GBR \nhad become a more contested space since pro-protection framing of news  in 1981 to a \nmore complex mix of positions in 2012, including frames presenting protecting the \nenvironment as a negative outcome for business . \nMitchell and Roffey -Mitchell\u2019s (2018) case study of news reports following the \n2016 GBR mass bleaching event noted scep ticism (about climate science and the cause \nof climate change) was the most dominant frame in the News Corp reports . In The \nAustralian , it was salient in 69% and dominant in 75% of the reports.  In contrast, the \nopportunity frame (specific actions needed to  protect the GBR from climate change) \nwas most dominant in The Guardian  (47 per cent), and ABC reports (30 per cent). The \nGuardian  had the most pieces of content in the data collection (51), closely followed \nby News Corp\u2019s Townsville Bulletin  (50). They found  Australia\u2019s media remains \npolarised regarding climate change and , when faced with a local disaster as a \nconsequence , dominant groups chose to maintain sceptical or censor media reports, \nrather than acknowledging the problem and the cause (Mitchell & Roffey -Mitchell, \n2018).  \nThis was also reflected in Foxwell -Norton and Konkes\u2019 (2021) recent work, \nwhich used Google Trends  to map how a satirical piece of content about the GBR\u2019s \nhealth was use to amplify existing conflict between climate science deniers and those \nadvocating for climate action, undermining efforts to mitigate climate -related risks. \nThey note that the way the GBR is communicated is \u201ccritical \u201d (p. 1) to enhancing \npublic understanding  about climate change and promoting political action . Eagle et al. \n(2018) also expressed concerns about  \u201cpredominately sensationalised and negative\u201d \nmedia coverage about the GBR being a barri er to future policy development (p. 154). \nTheir analysis on online new articles, press releases and blogs during 2016 found that \ninternational media were more likely to use sensationalistic framing about the GBR \nbeing dead or dying, while local outlets  were more inclined to wards adversarial \nframing, criticising the government\u2019s inaction or support for fossil fuels. They note \nwork is needed to understand discussions about the health and future of the GBR, \nspecifically via social media, including YouTube.  \n \n36 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  Lankester et al. (2015) examined how media represented risk during the \ncoverage of the 2014 Abbot Point dredge spoil approval, finding further evidence of \nconflict-focused framing. For instance, articles regularly cast an \u2018industrialism\u2019 theme \nin opposition to \u2018 environmental\u2019 and \u2018 socioeconomic disaster\u2019 themes, pitting \nspokespeople from the Ports Corporation and conservation groups against each other \nto achieve drama. The authors express it would be useful to exami ne how online media \ncontributes to agenda setting, including as a way for scientific experts  to draw attention \nto issues in the mainstream media. Conversely , while Somerville and Ames (2020) \nnoted the politicisation of the environment  in their study about how coverage of the \nAdani project4 was framed by the Morning Bulletin  in Rockhampton , they were \nsurprised to find environmental concerns about the controversial mining project were \ndominant over support for the community\u2019s economic recovery. However, the articles \nused for the content analysis were published in late 2015 when the publication was \nowned by APN. In the time between the research and the publication of data, the \nownership since changed to News Corp, though this was not noted in the paper.  \nFoxwell-Norton and Lester (2017) studied GBR power dynamics by comparing \ntwo key Reef protest even ts. While recent efforts hinder ed development proposals, the \nauthors found that pro -protection proponents had not been successful in convincing \npolitical decision -makers to abandon the projects. This was despite heightened \ncommunication and technology acce ss, like social media. The authors suggest there is \nstill a concerning \u201cpower disjuncture between emerging media and communications \npractices and logics and the enactment of sustained and meaningful policy\u201d (Foxwell -\nNorton & Lester, 2017).  \nPower dynamics were also explored by Konkes and Foxwell -Norton in 2021 in \nthe context of science. Using the case study of Dr Peter Ridd and his challenges to \nGBR \u2018policy science\u2019 in the mainstream media, the authors argue that the politicisation \nand mediatisation of scie nce means it should be considered a fifth sphere in Hutchins \nand Lester\u2019s mediatised environmental conflict model.  They call for enhanced  \nunderstanding about how these  conflict-inducing \u2018switching points \u2019 are enacted so that \nscience and science communicato rs can better avoid being an \u201cact of political \n \n \n4 Previously named Adani, the company has since rebranded to Bravus Mining and Resources and is \ndelivering the Carmichael Mine and Rail projects in north Queensland. See: www.bravus.com.au  and \nhttps://theconversation.com/au/topics/adani -group-19252.  \n \nChapter 2: Literature Review  37 communication \u201d (p. 480; Chapter 3 ). Grien and Macneil (2022) also focused on  Ridd\u2019s \nimpact as a counter -narrative to scientific consensus by comparing the way that \nsceptical and non -sceptical climate experts have been framed by News Corp\u2019s The \nAustralian . The authors  found that selective language is used to convey climate \n\u201cdenialist undertones\u201d (p. 7), which is a way that conservative outlets are still able to \nfurther sceptical narratives at a time when they say \u201coutright denialism\u201d has become \nless publicly acceptable (p. 2).   \nIn terms of social media research focusing on the GBR in general , Twitter has \nbeen used to research  tourism sentiment (Becken et al., 2017 ) perceptions of risk \nfollowing Tropical Cyclone Debbie (Bec & Becken, 2019) , and public sentiment \ntowards reef restor ation projects (Newlands & Melusine, 2018). Chinese social media \nplatform Sina Weibo was used to explore tourism attitudes of various GBR locations \n(Chen et al., 2019).  Coghlan et al.\u2019s (2017) paper look ed at the role of GBR images in \ndepicting the Reef\u2019s health status to tourists, but this study used a Google image search, \nrather than social media data mining. There is currently a gap in work  that examines \nGBR \u2018media politics \u2019 interplays  in hybrid news -sharing environments.  \n2.8 CONCLUSION  \nAs noted in this review of scholarly work to -date, including  considering the \ncurrent social context, there are several gaps in the literature. At a case study level, \nthere is work to be done explor ing how GBR stakeholders engag e online and within \nsocial media platforms to further information  flows, frames, and assert and contest \npower over the \u2018reality\u2019 of GBR protection . This would extend the above -mentioned \nfindings about how mainstream media frames the protection of the GBR . It could also \nhelp to understand  how \u2018mediatised environmental conflict\u2019 (Hutchins & Lester, 2015) \nand the \u2018politics of protection\u2019 (Foxwell -Norton & Konkes, 2018) are unfolding in \nhybrid news -sharing spaces, while also considering the important interplay between \n\u2018networks of operatives\u2019 (Cottle, 2013 ) embedded in these assemblages , including the \nrole of science and scientists in contributing to power contestations (Konkes & \nFoxwell-Norton, 2021 ; Chapter 3 ).  \nMore broadly, there is a  need to empirically examine the influence of  mainstream \nmedia as an a ctor is these decentralised news-making environments  to understand how \ninfluential media information, frames and logics continue to be in these hybrid and \n \n38 Chapter 2:  Literature Review  interconnected systems, and what role media play in constructing and contesting \nframes. Understanding this dynamic is particularly relevant in the context of  Australian \nmediatised environmental conflict, including the GBR and climate change, noting a \nhistory of stifled climate policy, condensed media ownership, and research \nhighlighting  News Corp as a cog in the  climate \u2018denial machine\u2019  (Dunlap & McCright, \n2011; Holmes & Star, 2018 ; Lidberg, 2019 ).  \nIn a social media research capacity , there is comparatively less  work available \nabout communication spaces beyond Twit ter, especially  within the environmental  \ncontext. There is therefore an opportunity to expand knowledge  about contemporary \ncommunications dynamics  across multiple platforms  (Pearce et al., 2019 ; Chapter 4 ). \nAs such, this thesis intends to draw upon the diverse body of existing work to build \nknowledge address some key knowledge gaps . In doing so, my objective is to  further \nunderstand ings of how power is asserted and contested in the social news media \nnetwork in relation to politicised  and mediatised environmental issues like the \nprotection of the Great Barrier Reef . These informational dynamics  could ultimately \nundermine  public support for e nvironmental policy . Moreover,  beginning to better \nunderstand these interactions in this case study offers a broader insight into the way \ninformation is channelled and \u2018reality\u2019 is framed across some of the communication \nnetworks that are so central to steering what we come to \u2018know\u2019 . \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  39 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  \nCommunication networks are the fundamental networks of power -making in society . \n(Castells, 2013, p. 426)  \n3.1 INTRODUCTION  \nThe theoretical approach to this thesis can be considered a network itself, or \u2018resea rch \nassemblage\u2019 (Fox & Alldred, 201 4). In this sense, there are several theoretical elements that are \ninterconnected and their interactions allow me to consider the research question  through this \nlens. Within this theoretical research assemblage, a central  element is Manuel Castells\u2019 network \ntheory of power (2011 b, 2013, 2016). This grounded theory has been applied to understand the \ninteractions between communication and power in today\u2019s digitally -dominant environment. In \nthis sense, it has been deployed in  connection with  social network theory (Freeman, 2004; \nHansen et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014; Himelboim et al., 2017) to interpret power relations that \nare specific to the \u2018social news media network \u2019 (Bruns, 2018). Another interconnected element \nis framing theory (Entman, 1993; Nisbet, 2009), which also directly relates to Castells in the \nway he understands frames as embedded in communication and used to meet the objectives of \ncertain networks  (Castells, 2011 b). These networks  can be understood as dynamic assemblages  \nof humans5 organised around certain projects and objectives . The final node in the assemblage \nis one that provides additional analytical insight to the GBR case study : \u2018mediatised \nenvironmental conflict \u2019 theory (Hutchins & Lester, 2015). Each of these theoretical elements is \nexplained below, including how they will be deployed to answer the research quest ion: How is \npower asserted and contested in the social news media network in relation to \nenvironmental protection?  \n3.2 SOCIAL NETWORK THEORY \nWhile social network analysis offers a methodological approach for the investigation of \nrelationships (Chapter 4), it also encompasses theory for interpreting those relations  (Borgatti \net al., 2009; Wellman 1988) . With foundations in relational sociology  (Mische, 2011; M\u00fctzel, \n2009; Prandini, 2015),  as M\u00fctzel (2009) explains, social network analysis was a reaction to \n \n \n5 Unlike Actor Network Theory and new materialism, Castells focuses on human actors only.  \n \n40 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  functionalism and individualistic theories, and its focus was to identify social structures based \non relations rather than attributes. In other words, social network analysis is chiefly concerned \nwith the interactions (or ties, or edges) between certain actors (or nodes) \u2013 the focus does not \nstart with the properties and attributes of these nodes or people, as it does with other sociological \napproaches ( Hansen et al., 2010, p. 32).  \nSocial network analysis builds on and uses concepts from the mathematics o f graph theory \n(Freeman, 2004; Hansen et al., 2010) and provides a graphical language that can be used to help \ndevelop meaning about the roles and significance of actors within the network based on their \ninterconnections, or lack of connections. These incl ude measures of how popular an actor is, \nhow well connected they are, and their potential role as a \u2018bridge\u2019 to connect otherwise \ndisconnected others. The metrics to cover these theories are outlined in the Glossary and \nChapter 4. This project is specifica lly focused on engaging the centrality concept via the metric \nof \u2018in degree\u2019 to establish the dominance of actors within the social media platform  (Freeman, \n2004; Himelboim et al., 2013 b). In-degree reflects the number of incoming connections to that \nnode, or actor, which relates to how much their content, ideas and frames are being exposed. \nAs noted by Grandjean and Jacomy (2019), being \u2018cited\u2019 is often a good indicator of authority \nand notoriety.  \nAs this thesis is also concerned with communication power,  conceptualised in one aspect \nby connection and disconnection, it draws upon social network theory\u2019s clustering, or \ncommunity detection, for considering relationships between different actors in the network \nbased on their shared connections  (Wasserman & Fa ust, 1994). Practically, this is signified by \naspects like modularity class (the group) that the community detection algorithm assigns to each \nnode (Hansen et al., 2010). Himelboim and colleagues (2017) note that users create pathways \nfor information flow when clusters are formed. As such: \u201cThe resulting groups define the social \nboundaries for information flow; within these clusters, information flows freely, while across \nclusters information flow is restricted by the limited connectivity available across c lusters\u201d \n(Himelboim et al., 2017, p. 3). As noted earlier, t his tendency for people to form social ties with \nothers most similar to themselves is called \u201chomophily \u201d (McPherson et al., 2001, p. 416), or \ncolloquially as \u201cbirds of a feather flock together\u201d (H imelboim et al., 2017, p. 3). While this \nbehaviour is typical in  many aspects of social life , high homophily is displayed  in highly \nclustered networks, and \u2013 at the extreme \u2013 can result in segregation across network where \nconnections  do not extend to other  groups that are different ( Barnes et al., 2016) . Other relevant \nglobal metrics  that can enable group  identification  and help to consider the connectivity \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  41 between these groups  include modularity, which measures the strength of graph partitioning \n(Grandjean  & Jacomy, 2019) . Also density, which considers  internal connections and how \nreciprocated those connections are within the group, versus the connections made outside the \ngroup (Yang et al., 2017; Himelboim et al., 2013 b). In sum, social network theory and its \nassociated metrics for analysis (Chapter 4) provide the foundational mechanisms for \nunderstanding influential actors and information flows in online networks, which can be \nconnected  to sociological theory to further an alyse these interactions as contests of power.  \n3.3 THE ADVANCEMENT OF A NETWORK THEORY OF POWER \n \nCommunications scholar Manuel Castells has spent the past 50 years devising, testing \nand modifying a grounded theory of power to reflect society\u2019s move into an inc reasingly \ntechnologically -connected world (Castells, 2016). Castells\u2019 more recent work proposes a \nnetwork theory of power to reflect the current societal age, which he describes as \u2018the network \nsociety\u2019 (200 7, 2011a, 2013, 2016). Castells describes his pro fessional purpose as: \u201cto build an \nanalytical framework that can be used in research, rectified, and transformed in ways that allow \nthe gradual construction of a theory of power and counterpower in the network society, our \nsociety\u201d (2016, p. 15). The netwo rk theory of power was the result of Castells himself feeling \nlike he was \u201csuspended between the two worlds\u201d (2016, p. 17) in attempting to understand the \nmodern realm. One of those \u2018worlds\u2019 is the tradition of deep social theory, including  the theories \nof social power foregrounded by Michel Foucault (1982)  and Max Weber  (1946, as cited in \nCastells, 2013 ), specifically , discourse and violence as ways of enacting and countering power \n(Castells, 2013).  The other \u2018world\u2019 is the contemporary era, inhabited by network analysis and \ndigital culture , with the prevalence of interconnected networks redefining traditional \nsociological notions of social structure  and the parameters of where, and with whom, power \ncontestations unfold  (Castells, 2016) . As such, Castells\u2019 network theory of power seeks to \nconnect these \u2018worlds\u2019 \u2013 traditional social theories with a modern era  largely medi ated by digital \ntechnology  \u2013 so that power and counterpower can be understood in relation to the contemporary \nnetwork society.  To this end, Castells says the interaction between structure and agency was an \nontological obstacle in his early work, shifting his interpretative lens between structuralism and \nsubjectivism , considering the power of social systems (structures) versus the power of the \nindividual  (agency). Anthony Giddens\u2019 structuration theory  (1984), which considers both  \nstructures and agents  in exploring social relations , offered Castells a way to resolve this binary \nand understand communication in the context of interconnected social practice  (Castells, 2016). \n \n42 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  In that sense, some of the critiques directed a t Castells\u2019 grounded theory are from \nrelational sociologists questioning why, in the age of technologically -mediated communication, \neverything is now considered a network, when they argue networks of relations and power \nfluxes have always existed (USC Annen berg, 2010; Venturini et al., 20 19). According to \nCastells, the network theory of power responds to the transformative impact of technology on \nmodern society.  As the communication environment has significantly changed , and continues \nto change , it represent s a new form of power interactions that need to be investigated (Castells \n2011b, 2016). For Castells, it is therefore not about studying the network in an actor -network \ntheorist sense, but more about studying the flows of power and counterpower that are sp ecific \nto communication networks in relation to other interconnected networks. This follows Castells\u2019 \nempirical observation that, while information and communication have always been \nfundamental sources of power and counterpower, a substantial volume of gl obal processes now \noccur through networks via the new form s of information communication technology. He \nargues that communication networks have become so pervasive, interactive and interconnected \nthat they are now central to implementing the power -making p rocesses of any network \n(Castells, 2011 b, 2013; USC Annenberg, 2010).  This understanding offers an opportunity to \nexplore the role multimedia communication networks are playing in power contestations over \nconstructing the \u2018reality\u2019 of the protection of the  GBR. Firstly, I will explain power in the \ncontext of the \u2018network society\u2019.  \n3.4 DEFINING POWER IN THE NETWORK SOCIETY  \nAs defined in Chapter 2, Castells understands \u2018power\u2019 as: \u201cthe relational capacity that \nenables certain social actors to asymmetrically influ ence the decisions of other actors in ways \nthat favor  the empowered actors\u2019 will, interest and values\u201d (2016, p. 2). He describes power as \nthe \u201cDNA of societies\u201d (p. 2) and says it is primarily exercised in two ways , with these \nmanifestations having theoretical linkages to Weber and Foucault. Firstly, by power over \nbodies, or coercion (the monopoly of violence, legitimate or otherwise, by the state). However, \nthe second way \u2013 which he argues is much more effective an d enduring \u2013 is \u2018power over minds \u2019, \nor persuasion , as opposed to merely manipulation . He describes  this as \u201cthe construction of \nmeaning in people\u2019s minds through the mechanisms of cultural production and distribution\u201d (p. \n2). These mechanisms  will be discu ssed later in this chapter. Meanwhile, Castells argues that \nwhere there is power, there is counterpower : essentially , resistance to power. Power is \nmultidimensional and, in the network society, Castells says power is \u201cconstructed around \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  43 multidimensional ne tworks programmed in each domain of human activity according to the \ninterests and values of empowered actors\u201d (2016, p. 774).  \nThese networks can then be understood as clusters of varied human actors grouped around \nshared goals and objectives, with each ne twork possessing its own logic. Collectively, these \nsubnetworks comprise the network society \u2013 an expansive network itself operating on the \n\u201cmetaprogram \u201d, or \u201csource code \u201d (Castells, 2011 b, p. 778) of global capitalism and \nconsumption. Some of the key subn etworks that form part of the network society include \nbusiness networks, political networks, and multimedia networks of mass communication \n(Castells, 2011 b). Importantly, each network has its own power relationships according to its \nprogrammed goals, meani ng these power exchanges can only be understood in terms that are \nspecific to that particular network . For example, the goal of the political network is to maintain \ngoverning power. Yet networks and their logics can overlap to share resources and further e ach \nnetwork\u2019s own ideas, projects, visions and versions of reality, or frames  (Castells, 2013, p. 426) . \nThese elements, shared by all networks regardless of their goals, can be understood as \u201ccultural \nmaterials\u201d (Castells, 2011 b, p. 776). Castells writes t hat culture is \u201cmainly embedded in the \nprocesses of communication,  particularly in the electronic hypertext6, with the global business \nnetwork and the Internet at its core\u201d (2011 b, p. 776). \nAn example of these cross (inter) network interactions is the connection of multimedia \nnetworks of mass communication with global business networks. While communication and \nbusiness networks were connected long before the digital age, this interconnection and overlap \nof network goals is now prolific , manifesting in the commodification of audience attention and \nthe further empowerment of global multimedia corporate networks ( Braidotti, 2019; Castells, \n2011b). Castells explains  the owners of these networks, who are themselves networks,  \n\u201ctransform humans into audiences by selling us the images of our lives. So they achieve their \ninterests (money making, influence making) by designing the content of our culture according \nto their corporate strategies\u201d (2011 b, p. 782). This includes nascent conce rns about the pursuit \nof human attention regardless of the quality and veracity of the information (known as \n\u2018clickbait\u2019) and the interrelated issues of problematic information and polarisation (Krasni, \n2020; Scheufele & Krause, 2019 ).  \n \n \n6 Castells has previous explained the \u2018hypertex t\u2019 as \u201cculture organized primarily around an integrated system of \nelectronic media, obviously including the Internet \u201d (2000, p. 12).  \n \n \n44 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  3.5 MASS COMMUNICATION AND MASS SELF-COMMUNICATION POWER \nCastells argues that the multimedia mass communication networks are the key \u201cfields of \npower\u201d (2011b, p. 777) in the contemporary networked world, due to nearly everything being \nmediated by communication and technology: \u201cI n the network society, power and counterpower \naim fundamentally at influencing the neural networks in the human mind by using mass \ncommunication networks and mass self -communication networks\u201d (Castells, 2011 b, p. 773). \nAs defined earlier, \u2018mass self -communication\u2019 refers to audiences\u2019 ability to produce and frame \ntheir own messages: \u201cit is self -generated in content, self -directed in emission, and self -selected \nin reception by many that communicate with many \u201d (Castells, 2007, p. 248).  \nTo illustrate the powe r-influencing capacity of communication networks , it is useful to \nthink of them in the relational context of other societal networks.  While the economic network \nis key within the global capitalist system, market responses are most often impacted by updates  \nor news relating to the financial performance, triggering human -induced responses (for \nexample, buying or selling shares). While the political networks have the capacity to regulate \nto communication networks, this is increasingly challenging in a digital age \u2013 particularly for \ndemocratic nations \u2013 especially when communication has the potential to achieve global reach \nand information flows can help to determine political outcomes (Castells, 2011 b). This is one \nof the reasons that Castells argues that all p olitics has now become \u2018media politics\u2019 . While the \nmedia, which includes digital networks of communication, are not the unwavering holders of \npower (this is forever changing due to the complex interactions between other actors within \nmedia, business and po litical networks), they \u201cconstitute the space where power is played out \nand ultimately exercised\u201d ( Castells, 2016, p. 10).  \nOn this note, another finding from Castells\u2019 research  is despite the decentrali sation and \ndigitisation of communication networks and  the rise of \u2018mass self -communication\u2019 , which can \nempower individuals to effect social change , traditional mass media are still dominant actors in \nthese mass communication  networks (2016, p.10). While he says modern communication  \nnetworks could potentially challenge the power of established corporate media, for now global \nmedia corporations and their actors, like Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg , remain \ninfluential  (Arsenault & Castells, 2008; Castells, 2011 b). It is this interplay withi n the social \nnews media network between these embedded, multiple and dynamic nodes \u2013 including the \nresulting power struggles and contesting narratives \u2013 that is of interest to this project, \nparticularly in the context of the \u2018media politics\u2019 (Castells 2007 , 2011b) involved in the \nprotection of the GBR (Konkes & Foxwell Norton, 2021; Newlands, 2020) and the broader \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  45 Australian public discourse about media power and regulation (ACCC, 2019; Australian \nGovernment the Treasury, 2019; Bossio et al., 2022; Environm ent & Communications \nReferences Committee , 2021; Meese, 2021). I will explor e these interactions further using \nCastells\u2019 network theory of power. To that end, I will now go on to discuss the four forms of \npower that Castells proposes as conceptual tools to  understand power relations in contemporary \nsociety. \n3.6 FOUR FORMS OF NETWORK POWER \nAccording to Castells\u2019 theory, there are four forms of network -related power that operate \nunder the social and technological conditions of the network society.  These are networking \npower, network power , networked power , and network-making power . He defines \n\u2018networking power\u2019 as \u201cthe power of the actors and organisations included in the networks that \nconstitute the core of the global network society over human collectives and in dividuals who \nare not included in these global networks\u201d (2011 b, p. 773). \u2018 Network power\u2019 is not so much \nabout exclusion from the network, but rather the need to abide by a set of rules to maintain \ninclusion, essentially  the \u201cprotocols of communication\u201d (p. 775). He describes this as \u201cpower \nresulting from the standards required to coordinate social interaction\u201d (p. 773). \u2018Networked \npower\u2019 recognises that the forms and processes of power are different and specific to each \nnetwork, with each network defining its power relationships  depending on its programmed \ngoals. It is defined as \u201c the power of social actors over other social actors in the network\u201d (p. \n773), yet the source of this power is constantly in flux.  However,  the most \u201ccrucial forms of \npower follow the logic of network -making power\u201d, according to Castells (p. 776). This is \ndefined as \u201cthe power to program specific networks according to the interests and values of the \nprogrammers, and the power to switch different netwo rks following the strategic alliances \nbetween the dominant actors of the various networks\u201d (p. 773).  \nUnder this type of power  logic, the ability for social actors to exercise control over others \ndepends on some key factors : The ability to form a network an d program , or re-program, that \nnetwork in terms of chosen goals , and to connect and cooperate with other networks to exercise \npower. Yet the ability to reprogram these networks in the interests of the subordinate actors is \na fundamental way to challenge po wer. Castells calls the first position \u2018programmers\u2019 and the \nsecond \u2018switchers\u2019 (p. 2016, p. 12) . In most cases, programmers and switchers are not \nindividuals, rather collectives of human actors exercising power via their connections. \nSwitchers can counter  network goals and attempt to introduce new \u2018code\u2019, or reprogram the \nnetwork for their gain. The clash of competing logics and goals is called a \u2018switching point\u2019, \n \n46 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  but the way that these contestations occur are again dependent on each network\u2019s programmed \ngoals. I will now go on to discuss the other elements in this theoretical research assemblage , \nand then explain how exactly I am deploying Castells\u2019 network theory of power to address this \nresearch inquiry. \n3.7 FRAMING THEORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS \nAs noted earlier, frames are one of the \u201ccultural materials \u201d (Castells, 2011 b, p. 776) \ninvolved in programming or reprogramming network s in terms of actors\u2019 goals. These cultural \nmaterials, which also include ideas, visions and projects, are embedded in the process es of \ncommunication (p. 776). While framing theory is used for several purposes in media studies, \npolitical science and communications, it  can be engaged to  investigate how media and \naudiences co -construct news events (O\u2019Neill at al., 2015). Understanding that a ll information \nis framed in some way , these intentional or intuitive positionings  provide the \u201chow of \ncommunication \u201d and guide audience interpretation (Foxwell-Norton & Konkes, 2018, p. 8 ; \nFairclough, 1995 ). Notably, some aspects of perceived reality are selected and made more \nsalient in the text to \u201cpromote a particular problem, definition, casual interpretation, moral \nevaluation and/or treatment recommendation for the item described \u201d (Entman, 1993, p. 52) . \nThese interpretations of reality, for example, as framed by a particular media story, inter act \nwith the audience\u2019s existing schemas, which communications scholar Robert Entman explains \nare largely products of prior framing (Entman & Usher, 2018).  As suc h, when information is \nframed, frames are reinforced, or information is reframed, power or counterpower is exercised \nwithin mass communication networks and mass self -communication networks (Castells, 2011 b; \nHansen, 2011). This sets the parameters for debat e, can impact the amount of attention received , \nand determine who is involved in the discussions  (Nisbet and Newman, 2015). Within political \nand policy debates about the environment, Nisbet and Newman (2015) note that: \u201cpower has \nturned on the ability to n ot only control attention to an issue within policy contexts or in the \nmedia, but to also simultaneously frame the nature of the problem and what can be done\u201d (p. \n326). \nIn the context of the framing of environmental communication in particular, audiences \nrely on frames to make sense of and further discuss complex issues. Media use frames to craft \ninteresting and attention -getting news reports, policy -makers apply frames to define policy \noptions and reach decisions, while experts use frames to simplify techn ical details and make \nthem more persuasive (Nisbet, 2009; Nisbet & Newman, 2015, p. 325). Of course, in the era of \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  47 mass self -communication, social media users are also framers of information in multimedia \nmass communication networks, whether it is content being created, or curated and reframed.  \nSeeking to further examine the role of framing in the social construction of controversies \nand the significance of political decision -making, Nisbet (2009) synthesised previous research  \nabout science -related policy d ebates in news coverage to produce a general typology of frames \napplicable to environmental debates, including climate change ( see also Nisbet & Newman, \n2015). The full list of these  frames is in Appendix D,  with further information in Chapter 4 \nabout how this framing typology was deployed methodologically to investigate information \nflows and power within the social news media network in the context of GBR protection. As a \npoint of theoretical and methodological clarification, while critical discourse theory and \nanalysis will be not formally deployed in this research, I recognise that frames are a cognitive, \nsocial and political process that interplay with language in their construction of meaning \n(Fairclough, 1995 ). While language and specific discursive tactics will not be systematically \nanalysed, they will still form part of the discussion, and the frames interpreted from the data \nwill be situated in a br oader soci al context to consider the contestation of power.  \n3.8 MEDIATI SED ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICT THEORY \nTo further hone in on the environmentally -focused media politics of the case study, it is \nuseful to enlist Brett Hutchins\u2019 and Libby Lester\u2019s \u2018mediati sed environmental conflict\u2019 (MEC) \ntheory (2015), which foregrounds the tension between productivism and ecologically -centred \nworldviews (p. 339), operationalises Castells\u2019 switching point idea , and builds upon Simon \nCottle\u2019s \u2018mediati sed conflict\u2019 concept (Cottl e, 2007). Hutchins and Lester proposed an \nenvironmen t-focused understanding  of mediatised conflict as part of their research into the \nlong-running clash in Tasmania\u2019s forestry industry. They argue that MEC is enacted when two \nor more of these four key \u201cspheres of action \u201d (Hutchins & Lester, 2015, p. 339)  and their \ncompeting logics collide over competing visions for modernity in an \u201cage of ecological crisis \u201d \n(p. 342): \n1. Activist strategies and campaigns;  \n2. Journalism practices and news reporting;  \n3. Formal politics  and decision -making processes; and  \n4. Industry activities and trade.  \n \n48 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  To pause here for a moment for clarity, while Hutchins and Lester (2015) discuss the \nabove four elements as  \u2018spheres of action\u2019  and there is some overlap with Castells\u2019 network  \nsociety actors  \u2013 for example, the multimedia, political, economic/financial  networks \u2013 the \nintention of this work is not to try to re concile MEC\u2019s \u2018spheres of action\u2019 with the networks of \npower in the netwo rk society. Rather, it is to enlist the MEC model for the actors it argues are \ncentral to power contestations  in an environmental context . This also includes considering the \nlogics in these conflicts . The logics of  \u2018journalism practices and news reporting\u2019 are also aligned \nto the goal of audience attention and include the ability to frame and filter reality, or to use \nclick-through-rates as a measure of audience demand ( van Dijck & Poell, 2013).  Given that  \nHutchins and Lester  conceptualise th ese logics as \u201cmuch more than the means through which \nnews and conflicts are relayed to audiences \u201d (Hutchins & Lester, 2015, p. 340), I will use the \nterm \u201chybrid media logics\u201d  (Chadwick et al., 2016, p.  5) to reflect this intenti on. It recognises \nthe dynamic and polycentric  social news media network , and removes the binaries between \n\u2018mass media\u2019 and \u2018social media\u2019 to understand that many actors are using a combination of \nthese logics . For example, a newspaper posting  a digital version of a story to its website,  then \nlinking to it on a platform, then perhaps paying to boost that story .  \nThe \u201cmiddle-range theorization \u201d (Hutchins & Lester, 2015, p. 339) of MEC has been \nincluded in the theoretical research assemblage as i t specifically embodies the key actors \ninvolved in environmental conflict that plays out in the social news media network, which is \nrelevant to the case study of the GBR. Other researchers have also deployed it to study \nAustralian environment conflicts (Cu llen-Knox et al., 2019; Nixon et al., 2021), including the \nframing of GBR protection (Foxwell -Norton and Konkes, 2018), and the role of scientists in \ndebates about the health of the GBR and climate change (Konkes & Foxwell -Norton, 2021).  \nBuilding on MEC\u2019s  four spheres of action, Konkes and Foxwell Norton (2021) recently \nproposed a fifth sphere in the theory to reflect the growing prominence of scientists and \nscientific knowledge in debates about climate change, resulting in the further mediati sation of \nscience communication and polarisation of this issue  (Chapter 2) . Science itself is \nconceptualised as a \u2018social field\u2019 where science is understood as the product, or body of \nknowledge, but also encapsulates the \u201cvarious routines and organisational norms of th e \nindividuals and institutions that produce it\u201d (p. 473). Konkes and Foxwell -Norton argue that \nrather than science being just an element within the other spheres of action, science is a fifth \nsphere in its own right because it is involved in its own power struggles and has the ability to \ncreate and contribute to conflict with the other spheres to enact a power -tipping environmental \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  49 policy-related \u2018switching point \u2019. Part of this research inquiry will include  empirically testing \nKonkes and Foxwell -Norton\u2019s (2021) finding that science and scientists are a fifth sphere of \naction in the MEC model, including considering how scientific actors and information are \ninvolved in asserting and contesting power in the social news media network.  \nThe terms \u2018prog rammer\u2019 and \u2018switcher\u2019 also have specific relevance in the  MEC context. \nAs noted above, a switching point is about power contestation, but exactly in what form depends \non the programmed goals of the network. Hutchins and Lester write: \u201cIn the case of media tized \nenvironmental conflict, switching points are instantiated by the production and circulation of \ncontending messages, representations, debates and strategies emanating from each of the \nspecified spheres\u201d (2015, p. 345). These events can be physical (li ke at protest sites, in political \noffices, or in newsrooms), or mediated (news reports, social networking, mobile \ncommunications) in character. Switching points are also impacted by the timing of political and \nmedia cycles, which includes election campaign s, environmental policy reviews, as well as \nenvironmental and disaster events that focus public and activist attention on pressing \nenvironmental problems.  \n3.9 APPLYING THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  \nI will now explain how I have enlisted parts of these interconne cted theories to enable me \nto study power relationships in the decentralised social news media network, specifically in \nrelation to the case study of the mediatised and politicised protection of the GBR. Firstly, as a \nconceptual and clarifying point: I am situating the social news media network as a cluster, or \nsubnetwork, within Castells\u2019 multimedia networks of mass communication. This reflects the \nintent of this study to focus on news media specifically and the communication power dynamics \nin relation to other media actors within the context of the broader disrupted multimedia \nnetworks, including alternative news outlets. It also recognises that certain actors involved in \nmediatised environmental conflict become part of this network during a switching poin t, with \nnetworks connecting and overlapping to contest power, which sees the production and \ncirculation of contending messages, representations, debates and strategies (Hutchins & Lester \n2015, p. 345).  \nNoting that each network defines its own power relatio nships depending on its \nprogrammed goals, I argu e, in alignment with Castells , that the ultimate goal, or metaprogram, \nof the multimedia mass communication network is to attract audience attention (Castells, \n2011b, p. 781; van Dijck & Poell , 2013). This ex tends to the social news media network as a \n \n50 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  subnetwork within that. Different actors may have different rationales for seeking this attention, \nfor example, a key priority could be to generate revenue to maximise profits, while another \nactor\u2019s priority coul d be to influence or change minds . But \u2013 ultimately \u2013 power is gained in \nthe social news media network by the ability to hook and hold attention. To empirically apply \nCastells\u2019 network theory of power and explore power and how it is being contested within the \nsocial news media network, I needed t o operationalise power  in this context. As such, I have \ndeveloped  some social news media network power indicators \u2013 outlined in the section below. \nThese indicators directly align with  certain social network theory -related metrics and methods \n(Chapter 4 ). \n3.9.1 Social news media network power indicators  \nThe power indicators  in Table 3. 1 consider levels of actor and information attention or \ndominance, plus provide a way to examine power contestations by investigating inter  and intra-\ncluster relations at the subnetwork level. A table showing the social network analysis metrics \ndeployed to operationalise these indicators is included in Chapter 4  (Table 4.3). \nNetworking power  was considered by identifying wh at actors were included in the \nnetworks by actor type. These actor types are based on the MEC model with inductive additions \nand refinements , including  \u2018media\u2019 being broken into subcategories (Chapter 4). I consider ed \nthe top 100 nodes only, so a limitatio n is certain actors may actually be in the network, but not \ninfluential, and thus disregarded in this analysis. Network power  was explored briefly by \nconsidering platforms\u2019 flagging or removal of problematic content, and suspending or banning \nusers from th e networks. Networked power  was a key focus, examining the centrality of \nparticular network actors noting their dominance as node over other nodes include d the \nconnections and relationships they shared with others in the network (incoming ties). Also, the \ndominance of content and frames was considered a networked power indicator in the social \nnews media network, understanding that framing is an act of power (Castells 2011b; Nisbet and \nNewman, 2015) and the ability of th is framed information  to reach audienc es to further the \nprojects of the would -be programmers is dependent on the level of exposure (Castells, 2011 b, \np. 777; Nisbet & Newman, 2015 ). However, the scope of this inquiry does not extend to other \ncontributing factors that make this content more salient , including the role of platform \naffordances, algorithms, impact of \u2018produsers\u2019\u2019 (Bruns, 2008) schemas, and other cog nitive \nfactors. \nFinally, network-making power  was another key aspect. Behaviour was examined \nbetween groups in terms of connection and disconnection, noting connection is needed between \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  51 networks of actors to create a switch ing point to  contest and potentially reprogram the ne twork  \n(conceptualised by Castells as adding code, or \u2013 in more radical cases \u2013 modifying the \u2018source \ncode\u2019, see Castells, 2011 b, p. 780). This resistance includes connecting to form separate \nsubnetworks (Castells, 2011 b, p. 779) and disconnection from the  main network . As part of this \nanalysis, the dominant frames of the global network were compared to counter-frames in key \nsubnetworks . This could be viewed as attempt to switch the program, or narrative, in the \nsubordinate actors\u2019 favour to further their o wn goals, or \u2013 as noted earlier via Chadwick  et al. \n(2016) \u2013 restrict others\u2019 agency. In this case, the information flows relate d to furthering, or \ncontesting, specific views about GBR health and policy, climate change, and ultimately values \nabout environm ent protection within the current social context (Figure 1.1). Network-making \npower was also considered in the context of the actors involved in MEC, including the actors \nthat were  central in contesting information and frames to further their own network goals, \nparticularly  the role of scientists and media in the production of meaning and conflict.  \nThese metrics are by no means exhaustive, but they allow me to consider power \nrelationships i n the form of communication across three social media platforms of Twitter, \nFacebook and YouTube and modify the approach in accordance with  their platform \naffordances. As noted earlier, I  recognise this approach does not  consider other contributing \nfactors for these actors and information sources in achieving these levels of dominance, but \nthese elements are out of the scope of this research inquiry. In other words, I am essentially \nconsidering the outcome of these power interplays, or the result, rather t han the cause.  \n  \n \n52 Chapter 3:  Theoretical framework  Table 3.1  \nPower indicators for the social news media network \u2013 a network that has the \u2018metaprogram\u2019 of audience \nattention \nPower form  Description  Power indicator (attention)  \nNetworking \nPower The power of the actors and \norganisations included in the \nnetworks that constitute the core of \nthe global network society over \nhuman collectives and individuals \nwho are not included in these global \nnetworks.

The power form and description columns are Castells\u2019 definitions, and the indicator column is how I \noperationalise this communications theory using social network theory  (Chapter 4) , understanding that the \nultimate goal of the social news media network is attention.  The key focuses are networked power and network -\nmaking power.  \n \nChapter 3:  Theoretical framework  53 3.10 CONCLUSION  \nUsing this relational theoretical \u2018assemblage\u2019 , which draws upon a range of \ninterconnected theories , this research  explores informational flows and power relationships \nwithin the social news media network. Manuel Castells\u2019 network theory of power  (2011b) is \nthe most central ele ment, which is applied using the practical foundations of social network \ntheory. In an interdisciplinary sense, this approach connects communications theory with social \nnetwork theory to produce the network -specific power indicators, which are then \noperationalised using social network analysis (Chapter 4). The research is situated within the \nenvironmental context  of power contestations  via Hutchins and Lester\u2019s (2015) mediatised \nenvironmental conflict theory and Nisbet\u2019s (2009) environmentally -focused frami ng typology. \nIt is hoped this novel approach will help to understand communication flows that further the \nsocial news media network\u2019s ultimate  power-generating goal: audience attention .  \n \n54 Chapter 4:  Research Design  Chapter 4:  Research Design   \n4.1 INTRODUCTION  \nAs with any research  endeavour , there were numerous conscious decisions made to shape \nthe design of this project. In this chapter I explain how the mixed methods integrated research \ndesign was created to answer the research question . I also discuss the rationale for selecting \nother interconnected  elements, including the social media platforms , software tools, timeframe , \nand case study event.  I then outline the  specific data collection and analysis methods for each \nsocial media network . Each strategy  differed slightly to account for the different affordances \nand functionality of the platforms, but also to accommodate the data that could be collected via \neach platform\u2019s Application Programming Interface (API) (Bruns, 2019 a; Weber et al., 2021). \nRegardless, the objective of each approach was  the same:  to investigate the dominant actors, \ninformation, frames , information flows  and power interplays within the \u2018social news media \nnetwork\u2019 (Bruns, 201 8). To do this, I  developed and  operationalise d social news media network \npower indicators , understanding  attracting audience attention as the ultimate goal of these \nnetworks (Chapter 3) . These are applied in this chapter via social network analysis metrics \n(Table 4.3). The analysis was conducted in th ree main parts across Twitter, YouTube and \nFacebook with the key focus on networked power (Parts A, B and C) and network -making \npower (Part C); though networking power and network power  are also considered in the context \nof dominant actors (Part A) and information (Part B). This analysis was guided by  the following \ndata questions : \nPart A \u2013 Dominant actors (networking power , network power  and networked power ) \no Which actor types were not included, or excluded, from the network?  \no Which actors received the most a ttention? \no Which news media actors received the most attention?  \nPart B \u2013 Dominant information sources and frames ( network power and networked \npower) \no What information received the most attention?  \no How was the most dominant information framed?  \nPart C \u2013 Connection and disconnection ( networked power and network-making \npower) \no How connected, or disconnect ed, is the global network ? \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  55 o How does connection and disconnection at the subnetwork level relate to \nattention, information flow s and frames ? \nThis chapter then discuss es ethical considerations associated with this project , \nparticularly privacy , and conclude s by reflecting upon the limitations of social media research \ngenerally, and this methodological approach  specifically , that have not already bee n noted. \n4.2 WORLDVIEW  \nThe philosophical worldview  is a fundamental, but often less visible,  element of the \n\u2018research assemblage \u2019 (Fox & Alldred, 2014) , and explains the researcher\u2019s general \nphilosophical orientation about the world and the nature of the inquiry (Creswell & Creswell, \n2018; Neuman, 1994 ). The worldview can also be understood as epistemologies and ontologies \n(Crotty, 1998, as cited in Creswell & Creswell, 2018). The worldview I have adopted in  this \nproject is broadly  pragmatic  in the sense that I have sought  to use the most appropriate research \nmethods available to understand the problem without being  committed to any one system of \nphilosophy or reality  (Cresswell & Cresw ell, 2018, p. 6).  \n4.3 METHODOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF SNA  \nNetwork analysis is a  form of structural enquiry that existed long before the advent of \nsocial media platforms . It is based on examining the interactions amongst social actors , both \nhuman and non -human, and is grounded in the notion that these social ties have important \nconsequences  (Chapter 3; Freeman, 2004 ; Wasserman & Faust, 1994 ). According to Freeman \n(2004), m odern social network analysis has the following features: it is motivated by structural \nintuition based on ties linking social actors; grounded in systematic empirical data; draws \nheavily on graphical imagery ; draws upon  mathematical and/or comput ational models ; and \nunderstands that its structural patterning can be used to explore a wide range of problems and \nquestions (p. 3). Furthermore , social network analysis is increasingly engaging mixed and \nqualitative method ology. \nIn \u2018offline life\u2019 we (as actors, or nodes) can experience ties \u2013 also known as  edges \u2013 with \nneighbours, friends, animals, or objects, lik e a bike helmet,  which can be visualised as directed \nor undirected relationships  (Yang et al., 2017 ). A directed relationship is when an action from \none node is expressly directed at another (for example friend A calling friend B ), while an \nundirected relationship is when two nodes share a mutual relationship (for example , friend A \nbeing in the same hiking group as friend B). In online n etworks, the same principles apply, \n \n56 Chapter 4:  Research Design  resulting in networks that are directed o r undirected. For example, actions like \u2018mentioning\u2019 \nsomeone on Twitter or posting a comment under a user\u2019s video on YouTube is a directed \nrelationship which creates and edge or s ocial tie. For the purpose of this study, all networks are \ndirected as the  data analysed  is created by  \u2018account A\u2019 directing an action at  \u2018account B\u2019, or \ninformation B in the case of Facebook, which I will explain shortly.  \nOne-mode and two-mode networks  \nIn this study, the nodes in the  Twitter and YouTube  data form a single set in their \nnetworks. Namely , Twitter is an actor network  where all accounts are nodes, while YouTube is \nan actor network where all channels are all nodes. This is called a one-mode or unipartite \nnetwork, meaning one set of nodes (Chang & Tang, 2014 ). However, it is also possible to have \nnetworks where the node  types are different . Due to the nature of the data that is available \nthrough Facebook\u2019s API, a bipartite, or two-mode network , needed to be created to study \nconnection  between the  different node sets  (Calderer & Kuijjer, 2021 ; Yang et al., 2017 ). This \nmeans that the nodes are two different types, for example, a Facebook page that shared a \nhyperlink and the hyperlink  itself are both nodes.  The connection, or edge, is only between the \ndifferent node sets , as opposed to Twitter and YouTube  where it is  possible to  capture the \ninteractions as different types of edges that form patterns of connections with other nodes within \nthe network (Himelboim et al., 2017).   \nClustering algorithm s are applied to group these nodes according to the ir connections  and \nresulting information flows , which can then be analysed as a visualisation , along with \nconsidering the network\u2019s global and local network metrics  (Venturini et al., 2021). Figure 4.1 \nis an example of local, global and visual network analysis elements (Grandjean & Jacomy, \n2019). However, Facebook  data are more limited and it is not possible to determine wh ich \nactors are enga ging on posts made to pages, so these connections  cannot be calculated or \nmapped. One way to interpret the data is by mapping the relationship between the \u2018Facebook \nspaces\u2019 (a term used by Bruns et al., 2020  to collectively denote Facebook pages, groups an d \nverified profiles) that share certain content and the hyperlink associated with  that content posted \nin that space.  \nI explain the specific methodological approach for each network  later in this chapter, but \nthis initial background is intended to clarify t hese key concepts . \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  57  \nFigure 4.1. The different levels of social network analysis: local metrics (for example, degree centrality), global \nmetrics (like density) and visual analysis (such as clusters).

Copyright 2019 by the a uthors.  \n \n4.4 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  \nAdopting a mixed methods approach allowed me to examine patterns and relationships \nbetween actors and informational flows using  social network analysis . It also provided the \nmeans to drill deeper into the content of the interactions within the social media networks to \nexamine the way information was framed and some of the tactics involved . However , rather \nthan understanding these as completely separate yet interdependent stages , this approach is \nwholly integrated in accordance with Pat Bazeley\u2019s (2018) thinking about integrated mixed \nmethods. Bazeley views the separation and binaries between qualitative and quantitative \napproaches \u2013 and the way they often do not integrate as intende d in mixed methods \u2013 as \nproblematic:  \nIt is in our approach to thinking about things that we begin to divide and classify what \nis, by nature, integrated. The primary way in which we take nature apart is to separate \n\n \n58 Chapter 4:  Research Design  quantity from qualities, but, in so doing,  we ignore other ways of representing a \nphenomenon\u2026 as we can lose the perspective of the whole . (Bazeley, 2018, p. 336)  \nIn other words, data generally contains both qualitative and quantitative components and \nthe meaning can change unless they are viewed  collectively (Anguera and Izquierdo, 2006; as \ncited in Bazeley, 2016). Having a clear delineat ion is particularly  difficult when it comes to \nSNA, which Bazeley argues naturally relies on hybrid methodologies for data collection, \nmanagement and analysis (2 016, p. 191) . With this sentiment in mind, this project has adopted \nan integrated and interconnected approach, with a holistic analysis and \u201cinextricably \nintertwined\u201d  methods (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 41) through data collection and analysis  to \nunderstand the informational interplays within the case study of the GBR . \n4.5 RESEARCH DESIGN  \nThe research was designed to explore actors, information flows, connection, \ndisconnection and , ultimately,  power within the social news media networks of Twitter \nYouTube and Facebook. As such, it was broken down into three main parts, with each part \ndeploying both quantitative and qualitative techniques to understand the informational \ndynamics. SNA was used to calculate global and local network metrics, along with create data \nvisualisations (Hansen, 2010; Smith et al., 2014; Himelboim et al., 2017; Grandjean & Jacomy \n2019). This included considering metrics like centrali sation, modularity, density,  and isolates  \nand visual patterns of connection and disconnection  based on the way people interact and the \nactors and content they connect with  (Angus et al., 2021; Bruns et al., 2020; Himelboim et al., \n2013b; Himelboim et al., 2017 ; Smith et al., 2014 ). Qualitative analysis , including in-depth \nclose reading  (Bruns et al., 2020 ; Graham et al., 2020a ), was integrated within this approach . \nThis included interpreting and coding the top 100  actors and their actor type  from the SNA \ndataset (Foxwell-Norton & Konk es, 2018; Newman 2017 ). Key information sources were then \ncalculated for each network using quantitative techniques, with the top 10 items subjected to a \nqualitative framing analysis (Foxwell-Norton & Konkes, 2018; Nisbet, 2009; Nisbet & \nNewman, 2015) . The global network was then broken into subsets for further analysis of \ninformational interplays  (Dehghan et al., 2020 ; Himelboim et al., 2013b; Himelboim et al., \n2017). For Twitter and YouTube,  this saw two relevant clusters analysed for dominant actors, \ninformation sources and frames, which w ere compared to  each other and  the results from the \nglobal network. Inter and intra-cluster dynamics were also explored at this stage to enhance \nunderstanding of connection and disconnection  (Smith et al., 2014).  The Facebook approach \nused network visualisations to drive the exploration of connection, disconnection and \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  59 information -sharing patterns ( Angus et al., 2021 ; Tan, n.d ). This will be explored in detail in \nthe Data Analysis section of this chapter.  \n4.5.1 Social Media Platform s \nThe majority of  social media  research tends to focus on a single  platform (Pearce et al., \n2019; Driscoll & Thorson, 2015 ). Most work has used Twitter as a study site , partially due to \nthe relative ease of access to data (Andreotta et al., 2019; Bruns, 2020 ; Pearce et al., 2019 ). \nWhile there is expanding  literature available on Facebook , and significantly less on YouTube , \nthere is far less work that uses three platforms for empirical studies  (Pearce et al., 2020 ; some \nexamples of exceptions are Burgess & Matamoros -Fernandez , 2016, who mapped #gamergate \nacross Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr ; Cinelli et al., 2021 who studied informational dynamics \nwith controv ersial topics on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Gab; and Smith et al. 2012 who \nmapped how users were engaging with two retail brands across YouTube, Facebook and \nTwitter). Moreover , there was value in comparing results across more than one platform  due to \ntheir use by different audiences  for different reasons . Results for Twitter may not be echoed on \nFacebook or YouTube, so multiple platforms added to the richness and depth of the study.  \nHowever, there are limitations with comparing platforms directly due to  their differing \n\u201cplatform specific semantics\u201d (Weber et al., 2021, p. 62), programmability \u2018logics\u2019 (van Dijck \n& Poell, 2013)  and available data  (Bruns, 2019 a). This has been addressed as best as possible \nin the choice of metrics, but it is not possible to compare affordances as equivalents  in analyses \nthat span more than a single platform (Rogers, 2017) . \nTwitter, Facebook and YouTube  were chosen for this study as they all ha ve relevance to \nthis research question . Facebook is the most widely used platform in Australia  (Park et al., \n2020b, 2021) and most English -speaking countries  (Newman et al., 2021) . However, use of \nFacebook  is declining, particu larly with younger audiences  (Park et al., 2021; Newman et al., \n2021). This decrease could be related to criticism about mis - and disinformation and the misuse \nof private information (Bruns, 20 19a), and/or the rise of fresher social media offerings, like \nSnapchat and TikTok , which use video as a communication medium \u2013 a format that is accessible \nfor a wide range of literacy levels (Allgaier, 2019) . Perhaps this is a contributing factor to why  \nYouTube is now the second most widely used platform in Australia, and a growing source of \nnews in the past five years (Park et al., 2021 ; Figure 4.2). YouTube\u2019s  popularity and its video \nformat, which offers different insights to text,  make it an important and relevant in clusion for \nthis research inquiry  (Burgess & Green, 2018) . Allgaier (2019) also found that the platform is \nunderexplored in the context of environmental and science communication research.  \n \n60 Chapter 4:  Research Design  Twitter is a notable communication platform for its significance in  political discussion in \nAustralia (Bruns et al., 2021 ; Bruns & Burgess, 2011; Bruns & Burgess, 2015; Graham et al., \n2020a; Pearce et al., 2014 ). A relatively high proportion of its users access it for news (50 % of \nAustralian Twitter users, according to Pa rk et al., 2021) , and it is especially  relevant to this \ninquiry due to its high use by media,  politicians  and activists  \u2013 three of the  \u2018mediatised \nenvironment al conflict\u2019 enactors (Hutchins & Lester, 2015 ). It has also had a key role to play \nin the transformation of journalistic process ( Beckett, 2010; Bruns, 2018 ; Hermida, 2013 ), \nwhich is useful and relevant for examining information flows and power exchanges. While \nTwitter is not as widely accessed as Facebook or YouTube , tweets make their way into  \nloungerooms via their inclusion in  mainstream news bulletins, and can even set news agendas  \n(Ahmed & Lugovic, 2019 ). Including this platform within this study was also important for the \nability to compare findings with existing research. Finally, the thre e platforms all have different \nowners. While the implications of this are not a key  concern for  this study, it is relevant \nbackground in the context of power -making and recent events, including Facebook\u2019s \nrebranding to Meta and Twitter \u2019s ownership discussions  (Fournier-Tombs, 2022; Lockett, \n2021). \n \nFigure 4.2.

Copyright 2021 by News & Media Research Centre.  \n\n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  61  \n4.5.2 Software Tool Selection  \nCareful consideration was given to the software approaches used  to ensure they could \nanswer the research questions within the scope of this project , including meeting my \n\u2018becoming\u2019 computer programming skills as a researcher . I collected data directly from Twitter \nand YouTube using the relevant APIs via packages in R,  while using Facebook -owned data \nprovider CrowdTangle for the Facebook  data collection.  I used Microsoft Excel for data \npreparation  and the qualitative framing analysis.  I conducted  the social network analysis  and \nvisualisations across two platforms : the Social Media Research Foundation\u2019s NodeXL (Smith \net al., 2010 ) and via open -source graph and network analysis software Gephi (Bastian et al., \n2009). Detail about these tools and methods is provided in Sections 4.6 and 4.7.  \n4.5.3 Choosing a Case Study  \nThe primary objective of selecting a case study  was to have an environmental policy  event \nthat prompted significant  media activity  and involved all of the spheres of action \noperationalised in \u2018mediatised environmental conflict\u2019 (Hutchins & Lester, 2015 ; Chapter 3 ). \nUNESCO\u2019s  draft recommendation to put the GBR on the World Heritage \u2018in danger\u2019 list \nprovided such a  \u2018switching point\u2019  event (Chapter 1 ). WHC decisions have been the subject of \nother GBR studies that have examined how environmental protection is framed by t he \nmainstream media ( Chapter 2 ). It provided an opportunity to expand on  these research findings  \nand potentially use the collected data in future longitudinal studies  to compare previous and \nfuture \u2018in danger\u2019 conflicts  (Morrison, 2021 ). \n4.5.4 Refining the Timeframe \nNews of the \u2018in danger\u2019 recommendation was broken as an exclusive by The Australian  \nnewspaper  on Monday, June 21 at 21.08. The headline was: \u2018China-led \u2018ambush\u2019 on the health \nof the Great Barrier Reef\u2019 (Packham, 2021 a; Figure 4.3). The initial tweet appear ed at 22.47 \n(UTC+10) from the journalist who wrote the story (Packham, 2021b ).  \nCoverage spiked on June 22, 2021 across all three social media platforms  in response to \nthe new information . There was also another activity increase , albeit it not  as significant , for \nWHC\u2019s decision not to list the GBR as \u2018in danger\u2019 on the evening of July 23, 2021  (at approx. \n20.00 UTC+10) . There is a  time-series analysis for each of the platforms in the respective \nresults chapters.  \n \n62 Chapter 4:  Research Design  The exact data collection windo w was defined after analysing social media activity over \nthe approximately six -week period between the draft recommendation and WHC decision. \nTime series graphs and tweet and Facebook post counts were collected and cross -checked with \nYouTube activity7. After examining this data in more detail  \u2013 including reviewing the content \nfor relevance \u2013 the data collection window was narrowed to Monday, June 21, 2021, 21 .00 \n(UTC+10) to Sunday, August 1, 23.59 (UTC+10) . This window was selected to capture the \ntwo distinct spikes  and allow for some longer -term media analysis.  \nThis approach also aligns with similar studies featuring environmental policy -related \nswitching points on social media where the collection window ended approximately a week \nafter the event  (Pearce et al., 2014) . Further, having a n extended data collection period is \nconsidered useful in studies of information engagement, as it captures a wide range of users \nwho are active at different times (Himelboim et al., 2013 a). \n \nFigure 4.3. The breaking news story about the GBR \u2018in danger\u2019 recommendation  (Packham, 2021 a). \n \n \n7 I used R package AcademicTwitteR\u2019s \u2018TweetCount\u2019 function , CrowdTangle\u2019s Facebook post activity graph , \nand NodeXL\u2019s YouTube video importer  to collect and review  this data.  \n\n \nChapter 4: Research Design  63 Search Query  \nThe search query \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d8 was used across all three data collections  for \nconsistency . Where possible, the search parameter for English -language only was set. This \ngeneric search string was selected after testing more specific queries across all the platforms \nthat included words like \u201cUNESCO \u201d and \u201cWorld Heritage Committee \u201d. However, running this \nmore event-specific search query risked missing content, as the objective of the study was to \nlook at all narratives during the switching point event timeframe. The limitation is that content \ncontaining only \u201cReef\u201d and \u201cBarrier Reef\u201d  was not collected.  \n4.6 DATA COLLECTION  METHODS  \n4.6.1 Pilot Studies  \nIn the lead -up to formal data collection, several pilot studies were conducted across \nTwitter, Facebook and YouTube. The objectives were to become familiar with the collection \ntechniques and tools  that differed across the platforms, refine the search param eters and \ncollection dates, and develop some initial exploratory understandings to help refine the \nqualitative data collection approach and analysis.  \n4.6.2 Twitter Data Collection  \nTwitter data were collected using Twitter\u2019s API v.2 Academic Research product trac k \n(Twitter, n.d), which enables approved researchers to access a much larger range of data . This \nincludes access to Twitter\u2019s entire historical database of tweets , a monthly tweet cap of \n10,000,000, and the ability to use enhanced filters to source data  \u2013 these features are not \navailable through the standard API (v1.1)9.  \nIn order to make the API calls, I used R package AcademicTwitteR ( Barrie & Ho, 2021 ), \nwhich is designed to help researchers query the Twitter Academic Research product track and \naccess the v.2 API endpoints10. I modified the code provided in the package literature and ran \nit via R Studio to collect the six weeks of data. I used the searc h query \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d, \n \n \n8 This was treated  as \u201cGreat\u201d AND \u201cBarrier\u201d AND \u201cReef\u201d, which includes  \u201cGreatBarrierReef \u201d and the \n#GreatBarrierReef hashtag . \n9 The standard T witter API is readily available and allows for collection of approximately seven days of public \ndata. \n10 Twitter Developer\u2019s \u2018Getting started with the API v.2\u2019 tutorials recommend AcademicTwitteR  for data \ncollection : (https://github.com/twitterdev/getting -started-with-the-twitter-api-v2-for-academic -\nresearch/blob/main/mod ules/6c-labs-code-academic -r.md). \n \n64 Chapter 4:  Research Design  included retweets, set the language to English  (en), and set the tweet number to infinite  to \nattempt to capture every relevant tweet for this specified timeframe.   \nThis resulted in a total of 85,818 tweets. I then imported the  TweetIDs into NodeXL  using \nthe TweetID List Network. T he software uses this unique identifier  to download the tweet data, \nincluding associated actors ( nodes) and activities ( edges) from Twitter. NodeXL\u2019s importer was \nable to import 84,941 of these 85,818 tweets11, which formed two separate sheets within an \nExcel workbook \u2013 edges and vertices (Note: NodeXL uses the term \u2018vertices\u2019, but I will \ncontinue to use \u2018nodes\u2019 for consistency ). The benefit of collecting the tweets via \nAcademicTwitteR and importing them into NodeXL was that I had access to the larger pool of \ndata available through Twitter \u2019s API v.2 Academic Research product track and greater control \nover the parameters of the collected data, while having the benefit of NodeXL\u2019s function ality \nfor initial analysis. The end result from the 84,941 tweets was 37,503 nodes and 118,012 edges \n(Table 4.1). The detailed steps for data collection are outlined in Appendix A. \n4.6.3 YouTube  Data Collection  \nYouTube data  were collected via the  YouTube API v.3, which is obtained through the \nGoogle Developers Console ( Google Developers , 2020). As there is less literature available \non YouTube research than Twitter  (Allgaier, 2019) , it required more trial and error during \npilot studies. I settled on a two-phase method that gave me  confidence I would collect the \nmost relevant results . I used R package TubeR ( Sood, 2020 ), which can be used to collect \nvideo IDs straight from YouTube. This required creating another layer of authorisati on in \naddition to the API key  (OAuth 2.0 consent) . I modified the code to suit my search parameters \nusing the TubeR documentation ( Sood et al., 2020), which included specifying the search \nquery \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d, the type as \u2018video\u2019, and the date window . This returned 464 video  \nIDs.  \nI imported these video IDs into NodeXL using the YouTube User Network importer,  \nsetting a limit of 150 comments and 150 replies12. This resulted in two separate sheets within \nan Excel workbook \u2013 edges and vertices (nodes). While there were some edges containing non -\n \n \n11 When I queried the missing 877 tweets with NodeXL\u2019s developer, a likely reason provided was that these \ntweets had been deleted in the interim . There was an approximately three -week period in between collecting the \nTweets via AcademicTwitteR and then importing the Tweet IDs from them into NodeXL due to hardware issues.  \n12 This number was chosen after reviewing previous data collections and noting that 150 comments and 150 \nreplies covered the bulk of the interactions on most  videos. \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  65 English-language content, I did not remove these from the dataset to ensure consistency with \nthe Twitter approach. \nNodeXL\u2019s importer was able to import  389 of the 464 videos13, resulting in 4326 nodes  \nand 7022 edges  (Table 4.1). The detailed steps for data collection are outlined in Appendix B. \n4.6.4 Facebook  Data Collection  \nThe Facebook data w ere collected through CrowdTangle, which is a database that was \nacquired by Facebook in 2016 that contains data for Facebook\u2019s public pages, groups and \nverified profiles  (Newton 2016, as cited in Bruns, et al., 2020) . As above, I will collectively \nrefer to th ese as \u2018Facebook spaces\u2019, following  Bruns et al. (2020). Changes made to Facebook\u2019s \nAPI in 2018  mean that information posted outside of these public spaces is  no longer available \nto researchers for privacy reasons  (Freelon, 2018) . As explained above, this means it is possible \nto collect data about the activities of pages and groups, but not individual Facebook users, which \nmeans the results of the collection are different from the other networks . While this creates \nconsiderable limitations, valuable insight s can still be generated , particularly if the research is \ndesigned to suit accessible  data (Bruns, 2019 a, Lazer, 2020). Access to the CrowdTangle  \nplatform is available to researchers, but requires approval and the applicant needs to have an \nactive Facebook account  (CrowdTangle, n .d).  \nThe CrowdTangle platform has a user-interface which makes it straightforward to build \nsearch strings and set search parameters. In alignment with  the data collection from Twitter and \nYouTube , the search string used was \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d . The search was conducted across \nFacebook only (as opposed to including Instagram) , it included all public pages, groups and \nverified profiles, all post types, English only  content, and the consistent  date range.  \nA comma-separated values ( CSV) file containing the results was downloaded for further \nanalysis, which included 4663 Facebook posts  (Table 4.1).  \n \n  \n \n \n13 Upon reviewing the data, videos were not imported that had the comment functionality  disabled on YouTube . \nThis is likely to be due to an absence of comments and  replies to comments  creating a lack of edges.  \n \n66 Chapter 4:  Research Design  Table 4.1 \nData collected from each social media platform  \nPlatform  Total Edges Nodes \nTwitter 84,941 tweets 118,012 Twitter accounts: 37,503 \nYouTube  389 videos 7022 YouTube accounts: 4326 \nFacebook  4663 posts \n \n Bipartite \nnetwork 1:  \n4563 \ndomains \n \nBipartite \nnetwork 2:  \n4563 URLs \n Bipartite network 1:  \nFacebook Spaces (unique) : \n2430  \nDomains (unique): 619 \n \nBipartite network 2:  \nFacebook Spaces (unique): \n2430 \nURLs (unique): 3074 \n4.7 DATA ANALYSIS  METHODS  \nThe data analysis for each network t ook a different approach according to the affordances  \nof the platforms and the nature of the data available for collection . Table 4.2 offers an overview \nof the networks and analys is type undertaken  for the social network analysis  component .  \nTable 4.2  \nNetworks and analysis type, including nodes and edges  \nNetwork Network type  Node level  Nodes Edges \nTwitter Directed One-mode Twitter accounts  \n(37,503) Activities \n(Tweet, retweet, \nreply tweet, \n@mention) \u2013 \n118,012  \nYouTube  Directed One-mode YouTube accounts  \n(4326) Activities  \n(Post video, \ncomment, \nreply) \u2013 7022 \nFacebook  Directed Two-mode Network 1:  \n1.

The \nmethod outlined for the three networks is explained under each part: Part A \u2013 Dominant actors; \nPart B \u2013 Dominant information sources and frames, and Part C \u2013 Connection an d disconnection. \nAs noted earlier, t hese parts and their associated metrics operationalise Castells\u2019 four forms of \nnetwork power and the social news media network power indicators for attention. These \nindicators and the associated SNA metrics are shown in Table 4.3.  \nThe choice of clustering algorithm is an important decision when it comes to network \nanalysis, with each using a different formula to allocate actors into communities, resulting in \ndifferent network partitions \u2013 or modularity classes \u2013 depending  on the algorithm enlisted \n(Guest, 2020). Each user can only belong to one community (Williams et al., 2015). Various \nalgorithms have been used in research to -date about connection and disconnection in online \nnetworks, yet often these choices are subjectiv e, with no single algorithm universally \nconsidered  the ultimate for exploring network community dynamics and ultimately interpreting \nmeaning from them (Fortunato & Hric, 2016). For this reason I analysed the Twitter and \nYouTube data  using two different alg orithms. More detail is provided below, but this approach \nproved to be useful for analysis (Chapter 5 ; Chapter 6).  \nTable 4.3  \nSNA metrics used to operationalise Castells\u2019 network theory of power in the social news media network  \nPower form  Power indicator (attention)  Metric \nNetworking \nPower Inclusion of actors in the top 100 for \neach network by type.

See Chapter 3 for a summary of each network power form.  \n \n4.7.1 Part A \u2013 Dominant actors (networking power , network power  and networked \npower) \nOverview  \nPart A was concerned with the presence and dominance of actors in the networks, which \nrelates to Castells\u2019 (20 11b) \u2018networking power\u2019  and \u2018networked power\u2019. The hierarchical  \nposition of nodes was considered in terms of centrality, as per Himelboim et al., 2017 . The \nauthors argue that  hubs, or gatekeepers, in the network can have  greater control of information \nflow (p. 4) (networked power) . The inclusion  and exclusion  of actors in the top 100 list by type \nwas also considered  (networking power  and network power ), noting that actors incl uded have \nmore power than those excluded ( Castells, 2011b).  As only the top 100 nodes are considered  \n(as per Newman, 2017 ; Faris et al., 2017 ), a limitation is that some actors may have been in the \nnetwork, though outside of this parameter . \nPart A also specifically consider ed the centrality of media actors in the network in relation \nto other non -media actors  (Newman, 2017) . Noting \u2018media\u2019 can take many forms in the social \nmedia news network, the  media actors were further classified into \u2018media non -news\u2019, \n\u2018mainstream media\u2019 and \u2018alternative media\u2019  (Appendix C) . While inspired by Newman (2017), \nthese media subcategories were identified inductively through the data and coding process. \nWhile there are limi tations in this classification process as the distinction between mainstream \nand alternative can be difficult to make with some actors  (Hiashutter -Rice & Weeks, 2021), \nmaking these distinctions was necessary to help consider the extent to which mainstream news \noutlets and alternative news outlets had centrality  in the social news media network ( Bruns et \nal., 2021b; Bruns et al., 2021c; Faris et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2020a; Newman, 2017; \nNewman et al., 2021).  \n \n70 Chapter 4:  Research Design  The non-media actors were coded in the  context of mediatised environmental conflict  \n(Hutchins & Lester, 2015 ; see also Foxwell-Norton & Konkes, 2018 ), with classifications \nmodified accordingly  or added inductively  (Appendix C). The term  \u2018activist\u2019 (Hutchins & \nLester, 2015) was replaced with \u2018advocacy\u2019 (a term used in Newman , 2017, although in a \ndifferent way). This was to avoid negative associations linked to activism  (Hanabeth et al., \n2018), and also to encompass  actors who are climate change actio n and policy advocates , and \nalso those who advocate based on concerns or scepticism about GBR health science , or climate \nchange action or policy . Environmental non -government organisations are included in \n\u2018advocacy\u2019 , as are thinktanks ; this category  represents non-media actor s whose logic is to \nchampion an issue, change minds, or make a difference. This was considered a less binary way \nto code the groups, yet captured the same ideologically -motivated logic.  The code \u2018political\u2019 \nalso included government depa rtments and local councils , as they operate from similar public \naccountability logic. The end result was the following list of actors: media non -news, media \nmainstream news, media alternative news, vlogger (with subcategories), advocacy, political, \ninternational, industry, Indigenous, science, community, individuals, unknown, inauthentic . \nThe codebook in Appendix C describes each category , and Chapter 6 explains the inductive \nprocess used to code inauthentic accounts . \nThe top 10 news media actors were then extracted from the top 100 actors list from the \nglobal network. These were further analysed and classified by political stance using Media Bias \nFact Check (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/). Media Bias Fact Check is an independently -\nowned website that classifies the political bias, factual accuracy and credibility of range of \nmedia sources. While it has a defined method to rate all media outlets using the wording of \nheadlines, credibility of sources, story choices, and political affiliation (Mehta & Guz man, \n2018), there are limitations with this resource. Namely, while it is funded by reader donations, \nthird-party advertising and membership subscriptions and makes its Likert -scale methodology \npublicly available, it is not an academic source nor accredite d in any way14. Still, it is used by \nacademics and serves as an adequate resource for this research inquiry . \nFinally, coding was checked with random samples provided to another person who \nunderstood the project and GBR case study context. The samples were crosschecked with the \ncoding instruments (Appendix C; Appendix D ). \n \n \n14 For example, unlike Disinformation R isk Assessment: The Online News Market in Australia  (Glazunova  et al., \n2021), yet this publication does not reveal the outlets deemed higher risk of spreading disinformation.  \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  71 Twitter \nUsing the data imported into NodeXL, the global and local network statistics  were \ncalculated , including modularity, density, the number of isolates, and centrality. These metrics \nall relate to the degree that connections are gathered around just a few actors in the network and \ngive insights into the hierarchy of information flow (Borgatti et al., 2009; Himelboim et al., \n2017). The Wakita-Tsurumi community detection algorithm was sele cted for the Twitter data \nas it is recognised as a suitable choice for larger communities ( Rodrigues et al., 2011 ; Wakita \n& Tsurumi, 2007 ). NodeXL was used to run the  algorithm to analyse  the network data, which  \ngrouped actors into relational communities and g ave them a group number , otherwise known \nas modularity class.  \nTo determine the most dominant actors within the network, the top 100 Twitter accounts  \nwere identified via in -degree. In -degree was the most appropriate measure  of media influence \ndue to it being an indication of the number of incoming connections, or authority (Grandjean \n& Jacomy, 2019 ; Hansen et al., 2010; Himelboim et al., 2017). In other words , from a content \nproducer\u2019s perspective , incoming ties represent ot her actors sharing their content, which is more \nsignificant to this research enquiry than being well -connected (as per betweenness centrality, \nfor example). These actors were then coded as outlined above. This involved checking each \nusername against their Twitter description, the link in their profile and even Googling them to \ndetermine their fit.  \nYouTube  \nUsing the data imported into NodeXL, the Wakita -Tsurumi community detection  \nalgorithm was selected to ensure consistency with the Twitter data analysis. As per the rationale  \nwith Twitter, the top 100 actors were identified via the in -degree centrality metric, although in \nthis instance the nodes were YouTube channels  and the edges were created by the original video \nbeing uploaded, or comments and replies on that video.  \nThe same actor classification process was conducted as outlined above, however new \nactor classifications needed to be added to reflect the different affordances of YouTube  \n(Appendix C). Classifying actors was more diffi cult on this channel due to the high number of \naccounts that appeared to be individuals in the top 100. This involved in-depth close reading of \nprofiles and associated comments to determine if the account seemed authentic (Graham et al., \n2020a). While some  actors had a generic profile photo and few channel subscriptions and no \nvideo content of their own, their comments on other videos had human -like syntax and \n \n72 Chapter 4:  Research Desi gn engagement with other users. Examples are shown in Appendix C. The top 10 media actors \nwere also isolated from the list and further analysed as per the section above.   \nFacebook  \nA different approach was required  with Facebook ( Fan, n.d). CSV files were prepared , \nthen imported into open -source graphing software Gephi using the CSV plugin  (Bastian et al., \n2009; Levallois, 2013 ). The Louvain clustering algorithm was used to identify communities . \nTwo different networks were produced: 1) Facebook spaces and unique URLs, with the \nFacebook spaces as a node type, and the unique links as another node type, and the hyperlinks \nbetween them  as edges; 2) Facebook spaces and unique domains, with the Facebook spaces as \na node type, and the unique domains as another node type, and edges the hyperlinks between \nthem, but expressed as a simplified domain ra ther than a URL  (Angus et al., 2021; Bruns et al., \n2021d). In a practical sense , the edges are the relationships created by a Facebook space account \nposting their own content onto their own page (expressed as an internal or external URL), or a \nFacebook spa ce account posting another actor\u2019s URL to its own page or group.  \nTo examine t he most dominant Facebook spaces, I selected the metric of \u2018degree\u2019 and \nused the Facebook spaces and URLs data . With the other platforms, I chose in-degree to \nmeasure the number in incoming ties. However, in the case of the Facebook spaces, this value \nis \u20180\u2019 because the pages and groups themselves are furthering  the information, whether it  is \nURLs, videos or photos  (out-degree). In reality, other individuals are of course then furthering \nthat information, but this level of detail cannot be captured by the API. \u2018Degree\u2019 was therefore \nchosen to consider the dominance of Facebook spaces . In a directed network, degree is the sum \nof the incoming and out going links, which is an indication of how much information the spaces \nare sharing15 (Grandjean & Jacomy, 2019) . As these spaces are often information -based actors  \n\u2013 like media outlets posting news content to their pages, or Facebook groups linking to exte rnal \nmedia content  \u2013 it is an appropriate measure of information al authority  in this context \n(Grandjean & Jacomy, 2019).  \nHowever, I approached the Facebook spaces and unique domains dataset differently. As \nnoted earlier, the Facebook spaces  account holder s post content on their pages, which \u2013 apart \nfrom the case where it is text only (this was very rare in the data collected , see Chapter 7) \u2013 also \nfeatures a URL. This URL can be internal (for example, to an image or video that has been \n \n \n15 Out-degree could have been used instead, with the same result in this case.  \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  73 directly uploaded to  Facebook and therefore has a Facebook domain), or could be a link to an \nexternal information source, like a news website. In this case, these are all incoming ties to the \npiece of content. Therefore, in -degree was determined to be the most appropriate met ric to \nmeasure the dominance of the domain nodes  as it captured these incoming ties .  \nAs with the other networks, the top 100 actors were calculated for each Facebook network \nand coded (Appendix C ). The top 10 media outlets were then extracted from the lis t and coded \nby political stance using Media Bias Fact Check.  \n \n4.7.2 Part B \u2013 Dominant information sources and frames ( network and networked \npower) \nOverview  \nPart B was focused on the information sources that are dominant with the overall network  \n(Angus et al., 2021; Faris et al, 2017, Newman, 2017) , and consider ed whether the prominence \nof the information was also connected to the centrality of the main actors. This also \ninterconnects  with Castells\u2019 \u2018networked power \u2019. In the case of multimedia  communication \nnetworks, the power of one social actor over another can be exercised via the effectiveness  of \ninformation virality, noting that \u201ccommunication networks are the funda mental networks  of \npower making in society\u201d (Castells, 2011 b, p. 785). Importantly,  differing platform affordances \nmade it necessary to focus on different forms of information sharing to assess prevalence.  \nPart B also consider ed the framing of the information being circulated through this overall \nnetwork and associated patterns.  Hansen (2011) and Nisbet and Newman (2015) say framing \nan issue is \u201can important exercise in power\u201d (p. 325), with framing and reframing used as a \ntactic to program and re -program networks (Castells, 2011b) . Frame schemas can be developed \ninductively (Foxwell -Norton & Konkes, 2018 ; O\u2019Neill et al., 2015 ) or deductively (Mitchell & \nRoffey-Mitchell, 2018), or a mixture of both (Newman, 2017). Due to climate change issues \nbeing strongly connected to GBR protection (Konkes & Foxwell -Norton, 2021), Nisbet\u2019s \ntypology of frames applicable to climate change and environmental debates (Nisbet, 2009; \nNisbet & Newman, 2015 ) was applied to this study with the understanding that this list could \nbe added to inductively if required. The frames outlined in the typology are general organising \ndevices, rather than specific policy positions (Nisbet, 2009). Namely, the frame can include \nsupportive, oppositional and neutral stances.  \n \n74 Chapter 4:  Research Design  Nisbet\u2019s frames are : \u2018social progress \u2019, \u2018economic development and competitiveness \u2019, \n\u2018morality and ethics \u2019, \u2018scientific and technical uncertainty \u2019, \u2018Pandora\u2019s box/Frankenstein\u2019s \nmonster/runaway science \u2019, \u2018public accountability and governance \u2019, \u2018middle way/alternative \npath\u2019, and \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019. These frames  are defined  in Appendix D.  Some content was \neliminated from the framing analysis if it  was deemed either irrelevant, or of low analytical \nvalue. For example, while content did not need to directly mention the WHC or UNESCO \u2018in \ndanger\u2019 recommendation , it did need to be related to GBR protection, GBR policy, GBR \nscience, or threat mitigation. Items that were excluded included general tourism posts that d id \nnot mention threat mitigation , fishing-related videos, and irrelevant non -GBR-related content.  \nFor comparison purposes, irrespective of the number of frames co ntained within each \ninformation source, it was coded once with the most salient frame.  \nFinally, this part  examined the act of limiting information through via \u2018network power \u2019 \u2013 \nthat is, the affordances and roles of the platforms themselves  as facilitators  or boundaries to \ninformation flow.   \nTwitter \nFor Twitter, calculating the occurrence of hyperlinks \u2013 and specifically news hyperlinks \n\u2013 was the most suitable way to consider informational prevalence and power, noting the primary \nobjective of audience atten tion. Twitter has a \u2018micro blog\u2019 format ( Batrinca & Treleaven, 2015 ) \nwith a limited number of characters (280) afforded per Tweet. Therefore an effective way to \nshare information is for platform \u2018publics\u2019 to identify and post URLs to an external source of \ninformation ( Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Bruns & Stieglitz, 2013) . In the case of Twitter, this is \noften to social news media content, noting this is a main reason that users engage with the \nplatform (Park et al., 2021; Newman et al., 2021). As noted by Dehghan (2020), external links \nare an indicator of information sour ces that social media users feel are worthy of sharing. In the \ncontext of studying different actors and discursive powerplays within a network, they offer \nvaluable insights into the information ecosystem and what ideological content and \u2018cultural \nmaterials\u2019 (Castells, 2011 b) actors are connecting and disconnecting over (De Maeyer, 2013).  \nNewman (2017) also notes that studying hyperlink  sources can provide insights into elite media \ninfluence in online environments compared to other actors, like blogs and non -for-profit news \noutlets. \nIn NodeXL, hyperlinks are identified in the tweet text and automatically expanded to \nseparate URL and domain column s within the edges sheet for further analysis. However, in \ncompleting this step of the strategy, I noticed that not  all hyperlinks had been extracted from \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  75 the tweet text during the TweetID import  or expanded from their shortened format . Namely, \nthey were still in the format of Twitter\u2019s shortened links, which appear as in a \u2018http://t.co\u2019 format \n(Twitter, 2021). To addr ess this, I extracted all URLs from the tweet text using Excel formulas \nand resolved the URLs using  a link-expanding tool16. I manually went through the 118,012 \nrows and cleaned any non -resolved links, then reinserted the URLs back into the data using \nVLookUp functions.  \nFrom here, a list of the most frequently -occurring  30 URLs from the entire Twitter \nnetwork was made, along with a list of the top 30 domains. The top 10 URLs were subject to a \nframing analysis  as outlined above . The framing coding process in volved in-depth close reading \nof the content of the link destinations (either a media article, blog article or a tweet), which was \ncoded using the schema  (Nisbet, 2009) . Noting there are potentially several frames present \nwithin each information source, if in doubt, the dominant frame was determined by prioritising \nthe headline, first paragraph, the presence and order of quoted sources  (Foxwell-Norton & \nKonkes, 2018). In the case of a single Tweet  (for instance, a status update) , the frame was coded \nusing the text and accompanying visuals.  \nYouTube  \nDue to the affordances of YouTube, the most prevalent content was considered in terms \nof video interactions. Unlike Twitter , where the key information is shared via hyperlinks, for \nYouTube th e focus was  the content that actors upload ed in the form of videos . In the case of \nnews content, this was mainly news reports that had been broadcast on television and then \nuploaded, or parts of media conferences.  There were 389 unique videos in the global YouTube \ndataset. Metrics were not accessible  in NodeXL for the number of video views or likes, so total \ninteractions was used as a metric to gauge video salience. This involved calculating the total \nnumber of interactions per video and ranking them  in order of prevalence . This included edges \nthat were comments, replies to comments and original video posts that were related to each \nvideo. For additional rigour, a cross -check was completed on the most dominant information \nsources to ensure the number of views were reflective of their ranking.  \nThe top 30 videos were identified per interaction, with the top 10 subject to a framing \nanalysis as  per Nisbet\u2019s (2009) framing schema. This involved watching the video several times \n \n \n16 Urlcheckr Premium , available at  https://www.urlcheckr.com/ . \n \n76 Chapter 4:  Research Design  to assess the dominant frame, including  considering the description text about the video on the \nchannel, the video title and the spokespeople featured. \nFacebook  \nTo assess information dominance  on a platform like Facebook, it is necessary to look at \ninformation shared via hyperlinks  and the content posted to the platform itself to capture the \nengagement of media information that is being shared with audiences in different way s, for \ninstance uploading a video directly. As such, the Facebook spaces and URLs dataset was used \nto determine the most prevalent  content by in -degree \u2013 essentially the number of times a \nFacebook space had cited the link. The top 30 links were identified,  with media links \nhighlighted.  \nHowever, n ot all posts included external links , and internal links (like facebook.com) did \nnot reveal much about the nature of the content, so dominant information sources were also \nidentified via interactions  on posts. CrowdTangle defines engagement as \u201creactions, comments \nand shares\u201d (CrowdTangle, n.d) . The top 30 posts were identified, and media actors were \nhighlighted . A framing analysis, as per Nisbet (2009) was  conducted  on the top 10 Facebook \nposts, which considered the  post text itself, plus any additional content like images, videos and \nthe nature of  external links. Some posts were removed from analysis due to irrelevance to the \ncase study.  An outcome of this process was to inductively add a new frame to Nisbet\u2019s typol ogy. \nThis was \u2018hope or solutions\u2019 to reflect the position that the GBR is under pressure, but there is \nhope for its future, which includes showing evidence of work being done in the field.  \n4.7.3 Part C \u2013 Connection and disconnection ( networked power and network-making \npower) \nOverview  \nPart C examined  the relationship between subgroups  (clusters) noting the critical role that  \nnetwork connection and disconnection play s in steering, furthering, limiting and contesting \ninformation flow s and frames  (Himelboim  et al., 2017) , which I am understanding as  assertions \nand contestations of power.  Using social network analysis  and framing analysis , the dominance \nof actors and information within strategically -selected subnetworks was compared to the main \nnetwork (networked power) . This included examining connectivity and informational sharing  \nbetween these key clusters , noting that selective exposure  can influence the ability of  \ninformation and its associated frames to flow across groups  (Himelboim  et al., 2013b) .  \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  77 Using this data and network visualisations that were mapped with two different \nalgorithms to further explore these informational power dynamics  (noting Twitter and YouTube  \nhad two, while Facebook had two different networks with one algori thm), the analysis \nconsidered whether there was any indication that these subnetworks were contesting, or \nattempting to \u2018 switch\u2019 the dominant narrative  with alternative information and frames . This \nincluded examining the tactics deployed during this powerp lay. This is the form of network \nsociety power that Castells describes as the most \u201ccrucial\u201d: network -making power (Castells, \n2011b, p. 776; Chapter 3). For clarity, I am not implying that these actors were consciously \ntrying to \u2018switch the narrative\u2019  or the programmed go als of the network , they were most likely  \ncirculating information they felt was more in alignment  with their \u2018truth\u2019 in relation to this issue, \nthus \u2018reframing reality\u2019.  \nTwitter \nConnection and disconnection were considered at a global network scale through \nevaluating metrics like density, modularity and isolated actors  (Himelboim et al., 2017 ; Smith \net al., 2014 ). While this overall network approach was used as a starting point, connection and \ndisconnection needed to be explored at the subnetwork, or cluster level, to explore the extent to \nwhich actors were central and what information was getting att ention \u2013 or not \u2013 and what this \ncould mean in a network -making power sense (Castells, 2011 b). \nAs such, the analysis in Part C  was guided heavily by the network visualisations and intra \nand inter-cluster comparisons  (Grandjean & Jacomy, 2019; Smith et al., 2014; Venturini et at., \n2021). The Twitter data was mapped in NodeXL using the Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale layout \nalgorithm ( Harel & Koren, 2001), and using the \u201cmeta -layout\u201d \u2018group -in-a-box\u2019, which uses a \ntreemap space -filling technique to display each of the subnetworks or clusters into segmented \nboxes along with the top keywords identified for that group (Rodrigues et al., 20 11, p. 1). While \nthis approach pulls the p artitioned nodes into separate boxes for visualisation, it also highligh ts \nbridges between clusters  (Smith et al., 2014) . The conversational archetypes identified by Smith \net al. (2014) were also considered at this  stage to consider connection and disconnection.  \nIn addition, t he raw Twitter data \u2013 without any modularity pre -applied \u2013 was mapped in \nopen source network visualisation and manipulation software Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009; \nJacomy et al., 2014). I created separate nodes and edges CSVs and imported th ese data via the \nCSV plugin  (Levallois, 2013) . The CSV files also included the node attribute of follower \ncounts, and the edges attributes of relationship, favourite count and retweet c ount. My first step \nwas to run modularity, which applie d the Louvain community detection algorithm to partition \n \n78 Chapter 4:  Research Design  the nodes  (Blondel et al., 2008). For the layout algorithm, I used ForceAtlas2 (Jacomy et al., \n2014) as per the approach taken by many contempor ary studies. ForceAtlas2 is a force -directed \nlayout algorithm and uses repulsive and attractive forces to connect and disconnect nodes in \norder to produce a visually meaningful composition (Venturini et al., 2021). The outcome of \nthis force -directed layout  was used to help guide the direction of the analysis. While this \nvisualisation  acted as a  meaningful  guide, the further analysis was conducted on the dataset that \nwas created in NodeXL and clustered using  the Wakita-Tsurumi algorithm.  \nThis cluster analysi s was based on Himelboim et al\u2019s (2013 b) selective exposure cluster \nmethod, which compared actors, information sources and sharing patterns between a set of \nnetwork clusters. As such, a subset of data was created from the Group 2 and Group 3 clusters \nin the NodeXL data \u2013 Group 1 was disregarded as the accounts were unconnected isolates, \nwhich were not useful for the phase of this analysis. Group 2 and Group 3 were the next largest \ngroups, plus it was evident from the Gephi visualisation that they were spati ally distinct from \nthe network. The cluster analysis  was done by filtering the data to show the nodes in the relevant \ngroup and  extracting  the members of each group into a separate worksheet. Once these data \nsubsets were created, analysis was conducted to investigate the top 10 actors in each cluster by \nin-degree, including further research and in-depth close reading to code their actor type. The \nmost frequently -occurring  information sources, in the form of URLs, were then identified for \neach cluster and a framing analysis was conducted on the top 10, as per the approach in Part B. \nThe actors and the information sources were then compared across the clusters for evidence of \nconnection and disconnection both at a SNA level, and a \u2018framing reality\u2019  level, which included \nconsidering the roles of any potential bridges ( Smith et al., 2014 ). \nThe final step was to examine the extent of the sharing of information within each cluster, \nversus sharing external to each clusters and , in particular , the instanc e of sharing and \ninterconnection between the  Group 2 and Group 3 clusters (Smith et al., 2014). Comparisons \nwere made again between each cluster within the context of the broader network \ninterconnectivity (Himelboim et al., 2017). This included taking sele ctive qualitative content \ndeep dives when needed to understand certain interactions and potential power interplays. For \nexample, if a certain node appeared prominent in a cluster that was ideologically  opposed to \nthe other cluster  (considering the most cen tral actors and information being shared ), further \ninvestigation was conducted to find out why. For example, was that actor being a ntagonistically \nengaged via @mentions (Graham et al., 2020 a)? \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  79 YouTube  \nThe same approach was taken with the YouTube data . The network was mapped using \nthe Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale layout algorithm in NodeXL, plus ForceAtlas2 in Gephi. The \nforce-directed visualisation was again useful in directing the subnetwork comparison with \nGroup 1 and 5 selected. Group 1 was the largest gr oup, and Group 5 was again spatially distant \nyet was relevant as it had the most dominant video in the entire network . There was also \nevidence of a bridge to explore from a potential network -making power perspective. The top \n10 actors, content and framing analysis was completed across each cluster17. An inter and intra -\ncluster analysis was also conducted to examine connection and disconnection between these \ntwo subnetworks.   \nFacebook  \nThe Facebook network visualisations also provided an inductive direction f or further \nanalysis. The two largest groups were compared in the Facebook spaces and domains networks, \nexamining the type of media actors that shared similar connections. The next part of the analysis \nexamined both datasets to look at the relationships bet ween some of the most prominent actors \nand the prevalen t information sources they were sharing as hyperlinks. The shape of the \nnetwork was considered in the context of whether certain Facebook spaces and URLs were \nspatially removed from the main cluster of the network, including what actors were furthering \ncertain information flows . \n4.8 ETHICS  \nThis research undertaking was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at \nJames Cook University (JCU)  as a project with a \u201c low/negligible risk\u201d category (Ethics \nApproval Number H8410). This level of risk is explained as: \u201c research in which there is no \nforeseeable ri sk of harm or discomfort and any foreseeable risk is no more than inconvenience\u201d \n(National Health and Medical Research Council , 2018, p. 13). However, privacy and consent \nare both complex and debated areas in social media research, particularly in the abse nce of a \nstandardised approach or unifying guideline for human ethics committees (Hibbin et al., 2018). \nHibbin et al. (2018) argue that it is necessary for researchers and review boards to move away \nfrom \u201cold ethical norms\u201d (p. 157) for social media resear ch and instead incorporate \u201csystematic \n \n \n17 There was only one content source in Group 5.  \n \n80 Chapter 4:  Research Design  risk-benefit assessments [of SM research] and new procedural and technology solutions\u201d (p. \n157). \nLeading computational social science researcher and sociology professor, Michael \nSalganik (2019), explains this risk -based approach another way, using Nissenbaum\u2019s (2010) \nconcept of \u2018context -relative informational norms\u2019, where privacy becomes not so much about \npublic or private, but about the \u201cright to the appropriate flow of personal information\u201d (2019, \np. 315). As such, digital researchers should consider three parameters when considering \nprivacy: \u201cactors (subject, sender, recipient), attributes (types of information), transmission \nprinciples (constraints under which information flows)\u201d (Salganik, 2019, p. 315).  \nIn this case, data has been collected from only publicly -accessible content published on \nsocial media networks Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. These sites can be viewed by anyone \nwith internet and computer access \u2013 viewers do not need an account. However, while \ninformation is  readily available, it is recognised that it was not created with the express purpose \nof being part of a research study ( National Health and Medical Research Council , 2018, p. 36). \nAs it is logistically unfeasible to contact every public profile holder directly18, to overcome this \ninability to obtain consent individuals were deidentified, or \u2018anonymised\u2019 , in this inquiry . \nImportantly, individuals in this case are defined as those who are general members of the \npopulation and not a public intellectual, or someone who is in a position to benefit from a public \nprofile. \u2018Benefit\u2019 could be financially, or professionally . Examples of individuals who benefit \nfrom a recognised public profile and a re therefore not anonymised are journalists , celebrities , \npoliticians , public-facing advocates ( for example,  Greta Thunberg) , and scientists with a public \nprofile. A test of this is whether the individual  regularly consents to media interviews, \nappearances , or makes contributions in the form of opinion or commentary .  \nOne public-facing scientist proved to be salient in the data : marine geophysicist Dr Peter \nRidd, who is now leading a Reef -related project  at conservative thinktank the Institute of Public \nAffairs (IPA)19. Dr Ridd\u2019s employment was terminated with JCU in 2018  based on a range of \nconduct, including public criticisms made to media about the veracity of GBR science \n(Swannie, 2021). While I did consider the removal of Ridd\u2019s name due to a concern about a \n \n \n18 For example, YouTube has removed its direct messaging functionality.  \n19 At the time of writing, Dr Ridd and colleague Dr Jennifer Marohasy launched a n initiative  at the IPA called \nthe \u2018Project for Real Science\u2019. Th e project targets \u201cyoung Australians \u201d to show the GBR first -hand to challenge \n\u201cthe media narrative they otherwise consume\u201d (Project for Real Science, 2022). It also aims to address \u201cbad \nscience\u201d and academic censorship  (Project for Real Science, 2022) . \n \nChapter 4:  Research Design  81 perceived conflict of interest , this actor met the criteria outlined above for inclusion , and other \nresearchers have mentioned Ridd by name in recent work that relates to the mediatis ation and \npoliticisation of the GBR and climate change  (Konkes & Foxwell -Norton, 2021; Grien  & \nMacneil, 2022).  Further, Ridd\u2019s dismissal was  before my time as a research student  at JCU. \nWhile I worked at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in the communications team \nfrom 2016 to 2019  which fostered my interest in this topic and case study , I have no professional \nor personal dealings with Ridd, nor the professional knowledge to evaluate his scientific claims  \n(Ridd, 2020) . In this research, I am  situating the resulting informational interplays  of his \ncontrary views within the broader scientific consensus  (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park \nAuthority, 2019; IPCC, 2022; Waterhouse  et al., 2017 ) and consider ing the impact  of these \ncounter-frames in the context of connection, disconnection and power  within the social news \nmedia network . In other words, I am considering Ridd\u2019s impact as a public representative of \nthe science sphere  of action in relation to interactions with other actors  (Chapter 3) , rather than \nevaluating any individual motivation or intent.  \n4.9 LIMITATIONS  \nWhile limitations have been highlighted throughout this chapter, I will elaborate further \non some that were not covered , or that need further expansion . One of the key limitations to  \nthis project is that while it considers the framing of information in the global network and \nsubnetworks , it does not drill down into the responses of social media users involved in those \ninformation flows  or the context of their participation in these de bates. While it has the brea dth \nof the three networks, it does not have the depth. The value of having this additional scope \nwould have allowed for a systematic analysis of the responses to information by \u2018produsers\u2019  \n(Bruns, 2008) , particularly in the cluster analysis  where dominant frames and narratives seemed \nto be contested. This additional work could have provided greater insight into the relationship \nbetween the framed content that certain actors are circulating and its impact, if any, on the \nresponses of other actors embedded in these dynamic news -sharing spaces  in the struggle of \n\u2018power over minds\u2019 . Noting, of course, even with this additional analytical step, there are a \nmyriad of other factors at play in shaping meaning  (Chapter 2; Chapter 3) .  \nAnother limitation relates to data collection. A universal limitation with social media -\nbased data collection is that d ifferent data collection tools have been shown to produce different \ndatasets (Weber et al., 2021) . Also, there is a lack of publicly-available information to explain \nhow exactly the platforms\u2019  APIs collect data. Therefore, it is unlikely that every piece of content  \ncontaining \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d was collected  (as well as relevant content about the GBR that \n \n82 Chapter 4:  Research Design did not include this term, as dis cussed above) . Further, not all collected data could be imported \nfor analysis, as outlined earlier. However, th ese limitation s still enable the exploration of social \nbehaviours and processes via the networks  if the researcher is aware of exactly how the da ta \nwere sourced, the limitations, and the potential impact on conclusions drawn (Weber et al., \n2021). \nSimilarly, there are also limitations in determining the dominance of information sources \nand attitudes in clusters based on using community detection alg orithms alone , which \u2013 as noted \nabove \u2013 can only group actors into a single group based on its connections . For example, an \ninformation source could be circulated in an oppositional way, an actor could be tagged in an \nantagonistically , or journalists could  follow certain accounts professionally while they may not \nshare the same ideological position (Dehghan, 2020). However, due to the connections created, \nthe actor could appear in the same group. This limitation was addressed somewhat with \nqualitative in-depth close reading when outliers were detected, but it also highlights the value \nof further analysis of \u2018produsers\u2019\u2019 (Bruns, 2008) responses in comments, as noted at the start of \nthis section . \nThis thesis will now turn to the results chapters, starting with Twitter.  \n \n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  83 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results \n5.1 OVERVIEW  \n5.1.1 Data collected  \nUsing the methods and parameters outlined in Chapter 4 , 84,941 Tweets  were \ncollected during the June 21, 2021 \u2013 August 1, 2021 timeframe for the query \u201cGreat \nBarrier Reef\u201d. These tweets included 37,503 accounts, or nodes, and 118,012 relational \nties, or edges  (Table 5.1).  \nTable 5.1 \nGlobal Network Metrics for Twitter  \n \nGraph metrics  \n \nGraph type   \nDirected \nNodes \u2013 unique Twitter accounts  37,503 \nEdges unique  87,882 \nEdges with duplicates  30,130 \nEdges total  118,012 \nNumber of edge types  5 \nRetweet 67,660 \nMentionsInRetweet  24,603 \nMentions  9510 \nTweet 11,355 \nReplies-to 4884 \nSelf-loops \n 11,720 \n \nConnectivity metrics  \n \nGroups  \n1,200 \nIsolates 3653 \nConnected components  4688 \nDensity 0.0000647167041633203  \nModularity  \n 0.461069  \nNote. The graph metrics are a  summary of the data collected. The connectivity metrics are  global \nstatistics that relate to connection and disconnection, which will be discussed in Part C.  \n5.1.2 Time series analysis  \nActivity on Twitter peaked as news of UNESCO \u2019s draft recommendation was \nmade public late on June 21, 2021 , and began widely circulating the following day. \nThe two peaks in activity were June 22 with 17,079 tweets and July 23, 2021 with \n \n84 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results  10,184 tweets, with the latter being the day of the WHC\u2019s decision  (Figure 5.1 ). The \nhighest peak at the announcement reflects the impact value of the news to recommend \nthe GBR for an \u2018in danger\u2019 listing. Yet this level of attention was not sustained  \nthroughout the duration of the data collection period , which suggests it was not a key \nissue for the broader social news media network. This is supported when viewing the \nAustralian Twitter News Index for the collection period, with the GBR absent from \nthe top 20 stories shared on Twitter by the 35 Australian news outlets tra cked in the \nsix-week timeframe (QUT, 2021).  \n \nFigure 5.1.

Also, while there \nare politicians, there are no GBR management or  science government agencies in the \ntop 100 (Table 5.2).  \n5.2.2 Which actors received the most attention?  \nForty-six of the top 100 Twitter accounts are media. Of these media actors, the \n46 were further classified into \u2018media non -news\u2019 (three), \u2018media mainstream n ews\u2019 \n(31) and \u2018media alternative news\u2019 (12). Of the remaining most prominent actors, 29 \nare advocacy, 15 are political, three are science, four are industry, two are \ninternational, one is \u2018unknown\u2019 . \n\n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  85  \nTable 5.2  \nTop 100 Actors on Twitter by In-degree  \n Name In-degree Group  Actor type  \n1 \ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf0f Sarah Hanson -Young 2681 7 Political \n2 UNESCO \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f #Education #Sciences #Culture \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf3\ud83d\ude37 2569 5 International  \n3 Terry Hughes  2253 3 Science \n4 Graham Readfearn  1933 3 Media mainstream news  \n5 Sussan Ley  1793 8 Political \n6 David Ritter  1488 15 Advocacy  \n7 Patrick Moore  1320 2 Advocacy  \n8 Climate Council  941 3 Advocacy  \n9 Kevin Rudd  935 4 Political \n10 abc730 882 4 Media mainstream news  \n11 Greenpeace Australia Pacific 853 9 Advocacy  \n12 Reuters 830 10 Media mainstream news  \n13 Scott Morrison  814 13 Political \n14 Paul Meek  799 4 Advocacy  \n15 Michael Pascoe  769 4 Media mainstream news  \n16 Larissa Waters  730 7 Political \n17 GetUp!

While two could not be classified using this methodology, the \nremaining outlets are either \u2018left of centre\u2019 , or what MBFC calls \u2018least biased\u2019, which \nis more politically centre. Eight are mainstream news outlets , four of these are \nassociated with Scott Trust Limited -owned The Guardian Australia  (Graham \nReadfearn, Adam Morton, Lenore Taylor and Ketan Joshi is a columnist), and three \nrelate to Australian nation al broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corporation \n(ABC) (abc730, RN Breakfast, ABC The Drum). The remainder are breaking news \nprovider Reuters; finance commentator Michael Pascoe, who has previously worked \nfor mainstream corporate news outlets and is currently contributing editor at \nindependent news outlet The New Daily ; and academic and journalistic collaboration, \n \n88 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results  The Conversation , which publishes content supplied by academics and edited by \njournalists.  \nAside from their political alignment, these outlets \u2013 or representatives from the \noutlets \u2013 also share anot her common trait: free access to their information, as opposed \nto pay-walled content.  \nTable 5.3  \nTop 10 Media Actors in the Twitter Global Network \n Name In-\ndegree Group Media type   \nPolitical \nstance20 Description21 \n1 Graham \nReadfearn  1933 3  \nMedia \nmainstream \nnews Left-Centre \u201cJournalist doing climate and environment \n@GuardianAus https://t.co/W6UBebViSs Dad. \nBurnley fan.

There were \n85,542 hyperlinks  in total, and 4707 were unique . \nTop 30 URLs  \nThe top 30 hyperlinks (by frequency ) for the entire Twitter network are listed in \nTable 5.4. The Guardian  is the most central information source in the entire network \nin terms of URLs shared. Its content represents 13 of the top 30 URL. In terms of the \nnumber of links (n=  32078), The Guardian  is associated with to 58 per cent of all links \nin the top 30 (18,72 1), including the entire top six . This is consistent with other studies \n(Chapter 2 ) and could be for several reasons. The Guardian  covered the environmental \npolicy event extensively during the data collection period with a total of 31 stories. \nThis include d four on the day of the initial announcement, with a steady flow of content \nthrough the six weeks from news stories to investigative pieces, opinion and podcasts. \nThe full list of Guardian coverage is in Appendix E. As noted earlier, The Guardian\u2019s  \nbusiness model means its content is free to access, and, therefore, more likely to be \nshared than content with restricted or subscriber -only access.  \nWhile the majority of the information sources are politically central or centre -\nleft, and reflect the position o f the scientific consensus, one outlier is EcoSenseNow \n(number seven). This account belongs to  Patrick Moore, who is also number seven in \nthe top 100 actors (Table 5.2 ). Other outliers are the Global Warming Policy Forum \n(GWPF) content (number 22 on this l ist and number 24 in the top 100 actors) and \nZeroHedge (29 here, and 97 in the top 100 actors). Climate scepticism  advocates \nPatrick Moore (Holman, 2021) and the GWPF are discussed in the subnetwork framing \nanalysis later in this chapter . Further backgroun d about the GWPF is provided in the \nfollowing section due to its dominance as a domain. ZeroHedge is described as a \u201cfar -\nright libertarian financial blog\u201d and has more than one million followers on Twitter \n(zerohedge, 2021). While at the time of writing, t he account appeared to be active, it \n \n90 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results  was banned by Twitter in 2020 in an exercise of network power for publishing a \nCOVID19 -related conspiracy theory (Hawkins, 2020) .  \nTable 5.4  \nTop 30 URLs in the Twitter Global Network by Frequency  \n Information source: URL  N= \n1 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/22/great -barrier-reef-should-be-listed-as-in-danger-\nunesco-recommends  3102 \n2 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/21/coalition -believes-it-has-numbers-to-stop-great-\nbarrier-reef-being-listed-as-in-danger 2742 \n3 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/23/world -heritage-committee -agrees-not-to-place-great-\nbarrier-reef-on-in-danger-list 2417 \n4 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/20/joanna -lumley-and-jason-momoa-join-prominent -\ngroup-backing-great-barrier-reef-in-danger-listing 1717 \n5 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/14/fossil -fuel-friends-saudi-arabia-and-bahrain-back-\naustralias-lobbying-on-great-barrier-reef-unesco 1682 \n6 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/un -official-rejects-australias-claim-it-was-told-great-\nbarrier-reef-wouldnt-be-listed-as-in-danger 1537 \n7 https://twitter.com/EcoSenseNow/status/1418593627253534721/photo/123 1322 \n8 https://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/climate -justice/unesco -world-heritage/unesco -protect-our-reef  1310 \n9 https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/22/great -barrier-reef-climate-australia/ 1111 \n10 https://www .theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/13/australian -environment -groups-urge-un-to-put-great-\nbarrier-reef-on-in-danger-list  1094 \n11 https://twitter.com/sussanley/status/1418545556591235079  1025 \n12 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/23/whether -or-not-the-great-barrier-reef-is-listed-as-in-\ndanger-wont-alter-the-fact-it-is-at-risk-from-climate-change 988 \n13 https://twitter.com/ABCthedrum/status/1407982469010264066/video/1  961 \n14 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/30/coalition -criticised-after-great-barrier-reef-\nfoundation -receives-351000-in-jobkeeper -payments  937 \n15 https://twitter.com/david_ritter/status/1417975003182632962  890 \n16 https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/12/the -government -must-take-responsibility -for-the-\ngreat-barrier-reef-and-stop-looking-for-someone-else-to-blame  825 \n17 https://theconversation.com/almost -60-coral-species-around-lizard-island-are-missing-and-a-great-barrier-\nreef-extinction -crisis-could-be-next-163714 701 \n18 https://www.reuters.com/world/asia -pacific/great -barrier-reef-should-be-listed-danger-un-committee -\nrecommends -2021-06-22/ 678 \n19 https://www.afr.com/rear -window/great -barrier-reef-foundation -doubled-revenue-kept-jobkeeper -20210726 -\np58d3w 659 \n20 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021 -06-22/environment -minister-great-barrier-reef-listed-in-\ndanger/100233088  647 \n21 https://www.sbs.com.au/ne ws/australia -accused-of-censoring -science-after-great-barrier-reef-avoids-being-\nadded-to-world-heritage-in-danger-list 624 \n22 https://www.thegwpf.com/peter -ridd-record-coral-cover-of-great-barrier-reef-refutes-climate-alarmists/  602 \n23 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/26/unesco -says-in-danger-listing-would-be-call-to-action-on-\ngreat-barrier-reef 599 \n24 https://news.mongabay.com/2021/07/great -barrier-reef-in-danger-dont-fight-the-diagnosis -fight-the-threats-\ncommentary/  589 \n25 https://www.bbc.com/news/world -australia-57562685  582 \n26 https://www.marineconservation.org.au/leading -australians -urge-the-world-heritage-committee -to-put-\nscience-before-politics-for-the-good-of-the-great-barrier-reef/ 566 \n27 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021 -07-23/great-barrier-reef-avoids-in-danger-unesco-tag/100319652  552 \n28 https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/from -barnaby-joyce-to-the-great-barrier-\nreef-coalition-climate-inadequacy -is-on-parade 545 \n29 https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/record -coral-cover-great-barrier-reef-shames-climate-alarmists-\nmedia 538 \n \n \n23 This also includes the hyperlink https://twitter.com/EcoSenseNow/status/1418593627253534721/  as, although they are \nslightly different links, they divert to the same content. https://twitter.com/EcoSenseNow/status/1418593627253534721/photo/1  \nappeared 1208 times and  https://twitter.com/EcoSenseNow/status/1418593627253534721/  appeared 114 times . \n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  91 30 https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/22/the -government -wants-to-avoid-an-in-danger-\nlisting-for-the-great-barrier-reef-at-all-costs 536 \n \n \nTop 30 Domains  \nThe top 30 domains in the overall network are shown in Table 5.5. There are \n1430 unique domains . As expected by its dominance in the top 30 URLs list, The \nGuardian  is the number one information source by domain. This takes into account \nthe actor\u2019s presence  across the entire network rather than the dominance of particular \npieces of content. Also unsurprisingly, the Twitter domain is in number two position, \nreflecting the volume of status updates that appeared in the data collection24. From \nnumber three to 10 , the next main information sources are centre/centre -left media \noutlets and environmental non -government organisation (ENGO) websites, with both \nGetUp and the Australian Marine Conservation Society  (AMCS) conducting \ncampaigns/petitions to urge the WHC to place the GBR on the \u2018in danger\u2019 list as a way \nto prompt the Australian government to take stronger action on climate change.  \nNumber 11 is right -wing UK -based tabloid mainstream news outlet, The Daily \nMail (Media Bias Fact Check, 2022 a). Mentioned earlier  as a URL, the GWPF is at \nnumber 12 for its dominance as a domain. This group is the campaigning \u2018wing\u2019 of the \nGlobal Warming Policy Foundation, a London -based thinktank (De Smog, 2021 a).  It \nhas a controversial history with the charitable organisation bein g described as a \u201chigh -\nprofile climate change denialism group\u201d that has spread misinformation about climate \nchange (Bloomfield  & Tillery , 2018; Lovett & Hoar, 2021; Ward, 2013 ). However, \nthe organisation says it is \u201copen -minded\u201d about \u201cthe contested scienc e of global \nwarming\u201d, and wants to correct the \u201cmisinformation\u201d that media, public and politicians \nare being \u201csubjected at this present time\u201d (Happer & GWPF, 2011 , p. 17). In October \n2021, the GWPF rebranded to \u2018Net Zero Watch \u2019, with all web URLs and socia l media \nchannels redirecting from www.gwpf.org  to www.netzerowatch.com . According to its \nnew website, its role is to advocate for \u201cmore balanced and transparent scrutiny of \nclimate science and policy research\u201d to avoid \u201chugely expensive climate and energy \npolicies\u201d, saying: \u201cNet Zero Watch will argue for the development of alternative \napproaches that are politically realistic and economically feasible\u201d ( The GWPF, 2022).  \n \n \n24 These always include the Twitter domain as they are in th is format (italics here indicate the \nvariables that change ): \u201chttps://twitter.com/ AccountName /status/TweetID \n \n92 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results  Further down in the list is a small grouping of actors who share similar political \nstances and climate change attitudes: wattsupwiththat.com (number 22), \nclimatism.wordpress.com (number 23), zerohedge.com (number 24), \ntheaustralian.com.au (26) and skynews.com.au (27).

The dominant frames from the top 10 information sources in the Twitter global network.  \n \nThe most common frame in the top 10 items in the Twitter global network was \nconflict and strategy ( n=5), followed by public accountability and governance ( n=4) \nand scientific and technical uncertainty ( n=1) (Figure 5.2 ). The dominance of the \n\u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 and \u2018public accountability and governan ce\u2019 frames is also \nsupported by the prominence of political spokespeople in the reports. This suggest that \nthe Reef and its protection is politicised, but also that the issue is subject to divisive \nand delegitimising tactics  in the sense that half of the most widely circulated \ninformation has elements that present the issue as \u201ca game among elites\u201d and about \n\u201cwho is winning or losing the debate\u201d (Nisbet, 2009, p.18). In this case, the main \nbattles were between the domestic go vernment and the international governance of \nUNESCO,  and ENGOs to a lesser degree . This finding and the potential implications \nwill be discussed further in Chapter 8.  \n \n5.4 PART C \u2013 CONNECTION AND DISCONNECTION  \nNetworked power and network -making power  \nConnection and disconnection were considered at the global network level using \nmetrics like modularity and density to give an overview, but these factors needed to \nbe considered at the subnetwork, or cluster, level to get an in -depth understanding of \n\n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  95 connection and disconnection, information exchange and power interplays  (Chapter \n4). The below section briefly discusses the global metrics, then examines the two \nlargest clusters to study the dominant actors, information sources and intra and inter \ncluster sha ring. \n5.4.1 How connected, or disconnected, is the global network?  \nConnection and disconnection were initially considered at the global network \nlevel to give a high -level initial insight  into informational dynamics . Using the Wakita -\nTsurumi algorithm  in NodeXL, modularity is 0.46 1 for the global Twitter network, \nwhich is evidence of a medium level of community division or quality of clustering \n(Himelboim et al., 2013 b). This could be an indication of both connection (partitioning \nwithin the graph as users connect  with each other in the clusters to create and share \ninformation : homophily ) and disconnection \u2013 the extent that these clusters are separate \nfrom other actors in the graph. The network density is incredibl y low at 0.000064, but \nthis can be typical of large r networks : the more actors there are in a network , the less \nlikely they are to be connected (Himelboim  et al., 2017). The particularly low density \nis also likely affected by the high number of isolates (unconnected users) within this \nnetwork: Group 1 is the largest in the network at 3653 nodes, and these are all isolates \n(Figure 5. 3 \u2013 the top-left square r epresents unconnected nodes). This is typical of \nnewsworthy topics that have a wide -ranging public appeal. As a comparison, Group 2 \nhas 3417 nodes and Group 3 has 2659.  \nEngaging Smith et al.\u2019s (2014) Twitter conversational archetypes, this network \ncould be considered a mix of community clusters with \u2018hub and spoke \u2019 style broadcast \nnetworks due to the media outlets being central in most of the larger clusters. Figure \n5.3 shows the se community clusters indicated by different colours. NodeXL also \ndetects the t op keywords for each cluster , which is shown on this visualisation, but was \nnot formally used in the analysis . The isolate group is shown at the top left as a square, \nand the other groups are labelled with a \u2018G\u2019 (group) and a number. The groups get \nprogressively smaller, which is shown at the bottom right. The top 10 actors in the \nglobal network are added to the graph for clarity.  \n \n96 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results   \nFigure 5.3. Visualisation using  the Wakita -Tsurumi algorithm in  NodeXL and th e Harel-Koren tree -\nmap layout. The top 10 actors in the global network are marked on the relevant clusters . \n\n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  97  \nFigure 5.4. Visualisation using the Louvain community detection algorithm and ForceAtlas2 force -\ndirected layout algorithm with Gephi.  Modularity is by colour and nodes are sized by in -degree, \nfiltered to in -degree of >3.  \nAs noted in Chapter 4, different results are achieved with different algorithms. \nModularity was  also calculated using the Louvain community detection algorithm in \nGephi (Blondel et al., 2008; Bastian et al., 2009). The Louvain algorithm returned a \nglobal network modularity value of 0.529 (compared to Wakita -Tsurumi\u2019s 0.461), \nwith this higher value showing a more intense level of clustering. While these values \nare similar at a global level, the differences in the algorithms are more noticeable at \nthe subnetwork, or cluster level, when users are classified into modul arity classes, or \ngroups. There is further discussion on this topic later in this chapter.  \nWhile the NodeXL data analysed using the Wakita-Tsurumi algorithm has been \nused for the bulk of the analysis for Twitter, the advantage of deploying different \nlayout algorithms at the global network level can be seen when comparing the resulting \n\n \n98 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results  visualisations. Figure 5. 4 shows the Louvain community detection algorithm and \nForceAtlas2 force -directed layout algorithm (Jacomy et al., 2014) using Gephi. The \nHarel-Koren tree-map layout used in NodeXL (Harel  & Koren, 2001) gives a good \nvisual indication of the size of the clusters and the key actors within them, for instance, \nhow certain media outlets act as subnetwork hubs for information flows (Figure 5. 3). \nHowever, the ForceAtlas2 algorithm is useful for visually highlighting the level of \nconnection and disconnection between the groups. Namely, it is visually apparent from \nFigure 5.4 that \u2013 while users are classified into different groups in accordance with \ntheir ties an d shown by different coloured modularity classes \u2013 most actors are \nclustered together spatially. However, the dark grey -coloured group is noticeably \nseparate from the rest of the graph, and there is another group that is even further \nremoved (note: This ha s been cropped from this visual in order to enhance visibility, \nbut is available in Appendix F). While the \u2018Patrick Moore\u2019 group in the NodeXL \nvisualisation is Group 2, in the Gephi visualisation, the dark grey nodes represent the \nPatrick Moore cluster.  \nHowever, due to differences in the clustering algorithms , the dark grey group in \nthe Gephi data does not exactly correlate with Group 2 in the NodeXL data. While the \nalgorithms classified the top 10 actors the same via in -degree in the global networks, \nI was curious to see what the consistency was in the subgroups with modularity class \nclassification. I mapped the top 20 actors in each group (the dark grey group and Group \n2) to compare and contrast what actors were included and excluded  (Appendix G). \nWhile there are varying top 20 actors in the \u2018Patrick Moore Group\u2019 via the Wakita -\nTsurumi (NodeXL) and Louvain (Gephi) clustering algorithms, the key actors remain \nconsistent across the different algorithms\u2019 groupings. Of particular note are Patrick \nMoore, GWPF, Climate Realists, Watts Up With That, Daily Mail , YouTube, \nDonKeiller  and Greta Thunberg. The perhaps unexpected inclusion of the well -known \nclimate change activist of Thunberg will be discussed below . \nIn summary, the Gephi visualisation proved a useful prompt to further explore \nthe \u2018Patrick Moore\u2019 group within the NodeXL d ata, which turned out to be the largest \nsubnetwork of connected users within the broader global Twitter network, and \ntherefore, a worthwhile data subset for further exploration.  \n \n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  99 5.4.2 How does connection and disconnection at the subnetwork level relate to \nattention, information flows and frames?  \nConnection and disconnection within the network, including information flow, \nwas examined by comparing the two largest clusters within the global Twitter network \n(not including the isolate group) in the data analysed wit h the Wakita-Tsurumi \nalgorithm (Chapter 4). These were Group 2  (3417 nodes)  and Group 3 (2659 nodes) . \nWho are the dominant actors in the subnetworks?  \nThe dominant actors in Group 2 are shown in Table 5. 7 by in-degree. By \nanalysing the Twitter bios and furt her researching each account, the majority of actors \nin this group are (non -media) climate scepticism advocates (Patrick Moore, GWPF, \nClimate Realists), right -wing mainstream or alternative media ( Sky News Australia , \nWatts Up With That, Fox News  contributo r and self-professed  \u201cinfluential climate \nscience contrarian\u201d Steve Milloy ; see McKnight 2012 ), and anti -climate action \npoliticians (Matthew Canavan, an Australian pro -coal senator , see Abram et al., 2021). \nThe outliers are businessman and renewal energy a dvocate Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, \nENGO Greenpeace, and well -known environmental advocate Greta Thunberg. A \ntargeted examination of the data suggests that these actors are the subject of \noppositional @mention tagging , which is revealing about the tactics used t o contest \nand oppose narratives  (Graham et al., 2020 a) \u2013 see information source five in Table \n5.9 for one example. However, a more systematic analysis of the interactions is needed \nto confirm this hypothesis, which is outside the scope of this current project.  \nTable 5.7  \nThe Most Dominant Actors in Group 2 by In-degree \nAccount Name In-\nDegre\ne Followed  Followers  Description  \necosensenow  Patrick \nMoore 1320 1239 99009 \u201cBSc Biology PhD Ecology, Greenpeace co -\nfounder, Now a Sensible Environmentalist.Director, \nhttps://t.co/LjFddksLZh.

Noting the aforementioned dominance of The Guardian  as \nan inform ation source, three of the top 10 actors here are from, or represen t this \nmainstream media outlet . \nIn summary, t he two largest subnetworks on Twitter (when disregarding the \nunconnected isolate group, Group 1), are dominated by actors who are very  different \nin their attitudes to GBR protection and climate change.

For \ncomparison, the only piece of content that was coded as \u2018scientific and technical \nuncertainty\u2019 in the global top 10 was the EcoSenseNow  (Patrick Moore) tweet, which \nalso appears at number one in this Group 2 list.

The dominant frames in Group 3 expressed as a bar chart. The horizontal  axis is the frame \nand the vertical axis is the frequency it appeared.  \n \nAs shown in Table 5.1 0 and Figure 5. 6, the appearance of the content in Group \n3 is similar to the most dominant content seen at the global network level above, \nincluding a large representation from The Guardian . Therefore, the framing across the \n10 most commonly -shared sources is also fairly consistent, with the most dominant \nframes being public accountability and governance and conflict and strategy, yet they \nhave swapped first and second places compared to the global network. The notable \nexceptions are the absence of the scientific and techn ical uncertainty frame from Group \n3 and the inclusion of morality and ethics. In summary , the narratives conveyed about \nthe GBR, including the politi cisation at the expense of its protection,  in Group 3 are \nlargely consistent with the dominant narratives o f the global Twitter network for the \nsix-week snapshot in time.  \n\n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  105 5.4.4 How connected or disconnected were the groups?  \nInter-cluster and intra -cluster sharing w ere examined across the two groups. This \nis an indication of connection within the clusters themselves w here information flows \nmore freely, yet recognises information flow can be restricted by the limited \nconnectivity, or disconnection, across other clusters (Himelboim et al., 2017, p. 3).  \n \nGroup 2 intra -cluster and inter -cluster sharing  \nTable 5.11 shows the  intra and inter -sharing between Group 2 and other clusters \nthat had 100 or more relationships. Group 2 has the largest number of connections \nwithin its own group \u2013 9088 of the total 10650 relationships (85.3 %) that started within \nthat group and stayed in that group. It has 302 shared connections with Group 3 \u2013 the \nnext most interconnected group \u2013 which equates to 2.8 % of the total links that \noriginated in Group 2. This is shown with the bar graph in Figure 5. 7. \nTable 5.11 \nThe Number of Intra and Inter-cluster Relationships  in Group 2  \n \nSource group  Target group  Relationships, N=  \n \n2 2 9088 \n \n2 3 302 \n \n2 4 253 \n \n2 8 241 \n \n2 5 154 \nNote.

These are mainly mainstream outlets and , of the most \ndominant media actors , most were politically left -of-centre offering information that \nwas not behind a paywall. In terms of networked power, The Guardian  had dominance \nas an actor . Its environment reporter, who was the producer of most of the stories \nthroughout the data collection period (Graham Readfearn) , was at number 4 in the top \n100 list, and was also  the media actor to receive the most attention in the global \nnetwork. Other Guardian actors contributed to this dominance, with the top 10 media \n\n \n108 Chapter 5:  Twitter Results  list featuring four Guardian -related actors. The mainstream news outlet  was \nconvincingly the most attention-getting information source in the global network, both \nin terms of volume of content within the top 30 URLs, and more broadly as the top \ndomain across the network , even beyond the Twitter domain itself . Most of The \nGuardian \u2019s content was framed using conflict  and strategy and public accountability \nand governance, with its networked power again reflected by these frames being the \nmost dominant in the global network. As such, the central narrative was focused  on \nwhether the government was doing enough to protect  the Great Barrier Reef or was \nmore concerned about appearing to do enough to escape political pressure.  \nHowever, looking at actors and information flows at the subnetwork level shows \nthe potential to counter this framing and switch the narrative  \u2013 the exercise of \nnetworking -making power . When analysing the two largest groups in the network \n(disregarding  the unconnected isolates in Group 1), Group 3 \u2013 the second largest \ncluster \u2013 was largely consistent with the global network in terms of actors, attention-\ngetting information sources and frames (notably, with nine out of the 10 top \ninformation sources being The Guardian ). However, the largest relevant cluster \u2013 \nGroup 2 \u2013 was dominated by actors and information that run counter to the scientific \nconsensus on the status of the health of the GBR and climate change. This includes \nclimate scepticism alternative media sources , and mainstream conservative media \noutlets of the Daily Mail UK , and News Corp\u2019s Sky News  Australia and The Australian . \nThese are very differ ent attention-getting actors, information sources and frames \ncompared to Group 3 and the global network. This is especially interesting due to the \nsize of Group 2, plus other notable factors such as this group containing several actors \nfrom the top 100 glo bal network list, and being responsible for circulating content to \nan extent that some of it appears in the top 30 list  \u2013 both indicators of their attention-\ngetting networked power . Yet most of Group 2\u2019s connections and the information \nflows remain within its own subnetwork (85.3 %).  \nGroup 2\u2019s sharing of similarly -framed content with like -minded others is an \nindication of homophily, where individuals are drawn to others who share similar \nviews (McPherson et al., 2001 ; Petray, 2010 ). In forming these connect ions and \ncirculating content that questions the status of the GBR\u2019s health, the quality of the \nscience used to inform GBR protection policy, and the appropriate response to climate \nchange; the framing of content and interactions in this group are distinctly separate \n  \nChapter 5:  Twitter Results  109 from the rest of the network community. However, is it evidence of polarisation? As \nnoted earlier in this thes is, \u201chomophily is a pattern present both on non -polarized and \npolarized networks, but antagonism is expected only on the latter\u201d ( Guerra et al., 2013, \np. 5). An analysis of Group 2\u2019s dominant information and frames (Table 5. 9) point to \nantagonistic sentim ent and ideological polarisation , however to definitively make this \nclaim more analysis needs to occur . This would include the tweet content within the \ngroups, and other information about the accounts (like description and follows)  to \nestablish attitudes, including the discursive tactics being used (Guerra et al., 2013; \nDehghan, 2020). Similarly, further investigation is needed of the nature of the \ninteractions with Group 3 , including the role of influential actors (Guerra et al., 2013) . \nOutside of Group 2 in itself, most connections are with Group 3 (as opposed to other \nperhaps more ideologically -aligned groups). When investigated via close reading, the \nconnections appear oppositional, but these Tweets need to be more systematically \nqueried to confirm if th ey are indeed antagonistic in nature.   \nRegardless, the above -mentioned findings show there is evidence of Castells\u2019 \nnetwork-making power in the context of contesting and  attempting to  \u2018switch\u2019 the \ndominant frame, story, or reality about the health of the GBR. However, it appears that \nwhile efforts have been made by Group 2 to further this alternative \u2018reality\u2019, its \ninformation has not achieved enough attention at the broader network level to be able \nto achieve the switch. As an outcome of this power contest ation, some interesting \ntactics were revealed , particularly concerning the role of science and scientists in \nenacting power in the space of \u2018media politics\u2019 (Castells, 2011 b), and the amplification \nof mainstream media outlets\u2019 content by ideologically -aligned alternative news actors \nto bridge informational boundaries. These aspects will be discussed later in Chapter 8. \nMeanwhile, the analysis will now shift to the results from YouTube . \n \n\n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  111 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  \n6.1 OVERVIEW  \n6.1.1 Data collected \nUsing the methods and parameters outlined in Chapter 4, 389 unique videos  \nwere collected during the June 21, 2021 \u2013 August 1, 2021 timeframe for the search \nquery \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d. The dataset included 4326 YouTube channels  (user \naccounts), sh own as nodes, and 4947 unique edges , which represent the initial \nuploading of the video, comments by other nodes on videos, or replies to those \ncomments. Table 6.1 shows a breakdown of the data that was collected  and analysed \nusing the Wakita -Tsurumi clust ering algorithm.  \nTable 6.1 \nGlobal Network Metrics for YouTube  \n \nGraph metrics  \n \nGraph type   \nDirected \nNodes \u2013 unique YouTube accounts  4326 \nEdges unique  4937 \nEdges with duplicates  2085 \nEdges total  7022 \nSelf-loops 753 \n \n \nConnectivity metrics  \n \nGroups  \n160 \nIsolates 148 \nConnected components  255 \nDensity 0.000278408  \nModularity  \n 0.645795  \n \nNote. The graph metrics  are a summary of the data collected. The connectivity metrics are  some \nglobal statistics that relate to connection and disconnection, which will be discussed in Part C.  \n \n6.1.2 Time series analysis  \nThere are two main peaks in activity, which reflect the UNESCO  initial draft \nrecommendation and the date of the WHC meeting where the decision was made  \n \n112 Chapter 6: YouTube Results  (Figure 6.1) . Like Twitter, the initial recommendation received the most attention , and \nactivity outside the two key conflict -inducing events was not sustained at the same \nlevel throughout the six weeks.  \n \n \nFigure 6.1. Time series bar graph showing the date (horizontal axis) and the number of edges created \n(vertical axis) to highlight the concentration of YouTube activity around the two MEC events. \n \n6.2 PART A \u2013 DOMINANT ACTORS  \nNetworking power, network power and networked power \n6.2.1 Which actor types were not included, or excluded, from the network?  \nThe top 100 actors for YouTube are quite different from those identified in GBR \nresearch to -date and compared to Twitter (Table 6.2) . Notably, in the context of \nnetworking power, there are no political actors (including government agencies), \nindustry actors are minimal (especially relating to the GBR), and there are no channels  \nthat represent science actors , yet these actors are quoted in the content . As per the \nfindings of previous s tudies, there are no Indigenous actors  represented . As discussed \nbelow, the Russian affiliate channel RT DE was an actor excluded from this network \nas the channel did not meet the rules of inclusion (network power).  \n6.2.2 Which actors received the most attention?  \nYouTube\u2019s logic of accounts being both individual actors that can comment on \nvideos, and channels that can create content to draw audiences, mean t it was necessary \nto identify another actor type that was different from the categorisations of media and \nindividual. As such, a new category was created of \u2018vlogger\u2019, meaning video bloggers, \nwhich was further segmented into \u2018vlogger/advocacy\u2019 ( n=4), \u2018vlogger/travel\u2019 ( n=18) \nand \u2018vlogger/gamer\u2019 ( n=1) to represent their interpreted objectives for seeking \n\n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  113 audience attention. This recognises that these actors do not reflect the logic of news \nmedia, particularly in their approaches to topic selection and framing  of GBR-related \ncontent. While it could be argued that they broadly sit under \u2018media non -news\u2019 due to \ntheir pursuit of audience attention and, often, monetisation through advertising; for the \npurpose of this analysis of power interplays it is useful to kee p them separate.  \nThe category of \u2018vlogger/travel\u2019 represented the second largest actor type \n(beyond individuals), with 18 accounts coded this way. This group is generally \nconcerned with promoting adventure and travel experiences, with their content \nappearing in the data collection due to the keywords of \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d. They do \nnot discuss the \u2018media politics\u2019 (Castells, 2011 b) of the GBR, or offer any views on its \nhealth or management. The \u2018vlogger/advocacy\u2019 group has four actors who are creating \nchannel content with an interpreted intent to champion a particular cause, or essentially \nadvocate a way of thinking. The Oppenheimer Ranch Project  and Difference Frames \nthe World  channels will be discussed in upcoming sections. The final vlogger group is \n\u2018vlogger/gamer\u2019, which represents one account that is focused on sharing content to \nan audience with an interest in gaming. It appeared in the data as \u201cGreat Barrier Reef \u201d \nwas in the title of one of its comic reviews, and \u2013 unlike the other vloggers \u2013 there is \nno objective to either showcase or advocate for or against GBR protection.  \nAs noted above, \u2018individual \u2019 accounts represented the largest actor type with 28 \naccounts. The majority of these are accounts commenting on Sky News Australia  \nvideos. A further 12  accounts were identified as \u2018inauthentic \u2019 and three as \u2018unknown\u2019. \nThe coding instrument  was refined several times during this challenging process, but \nindividuals are essentially accounts used to engage with content on other channels and \nappear genuine ( Appendix C ). Though s ome of these accounts could be \u2018sockpuppet\u2019 \naccounts (Kumar et al., 2017, as cited in Graham et al., 202 0a), which are anonymous \naccounts that feature a constructed profile that are created to manipulate public opinion \n(Crabb et al., 20 15, as cited in Graham et al., 2020a) . This level of analysis is beyond \nthe scope of this study. There were 12 accounts identified as \u2018inauthentic\u2019. On the \nsurface, these look similar to those coded as \u2018individual\u2019 with minimal identifying \ndetail or content on their actual channel, but \u2013 in the case of these actors \u2013 the \ncomments were all about Crypto currency and posted on news -related channels with \nlarger audiences. The one exception to the Crypto -content was an account that was \nposting comments about the GBR: \u201cAustralia opposes this UN repo rt recommendation \n \n114 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  because they think the report is influenced by China. Who would have not guessed \ntheir reasons to oppose the report?\u201d. This same comment was posted on five different \nnews videos ( Sky News Australia , Al Jezeera , France24 , WION and CNA). \nConsidering its content, grammar and repetition across key news channels, it could be \nan account specifically created to counter anti -China narratives , which can be \nunderstood as a form of attempted network -making power . \nMedia represented the next most domin ant actor group, with mainstream media \noutlets comprising the majority (16), followed by media alternative news (2) and non -\nnews media (2). The centrality of the top media actors will be further discussed in the \nnext section.  \nTable 6.2 \nThe Top 100 Actors on YouTube by In-degree \n Name In-Degree Group number  Actor type  \n1 Sky News Australia  739 1 Media mainstream news  \n2 WION 356 2 Media mainstream news  \n3 Back 2 Basics Adventures  272 3 Vlogger/travel  \n4 Sailing La Vagabonde  204 4 Vlogger/advocacy  \n5 wifistudy 2.0  154 8 Industry \n6 RuPaul's Drag Race  149 6 Media non -news \n7 Sky News  146 7 Media mainstream news  \n8 Difference Frames the World  145 5 Vlogger/advocacy  \n9 BlueWorldTV  139 10 Media non -news \n10 ABC News In -depth 134 11 Media mainstream news  \n11 Project Brupeg  115 12 Vlogger/travel  \n12 Vhal Winter  114 13 Vlogger/travel  \n13 Sailing Popao - Underwater Ally Productions  76 14 Vlogger/travel  \n14 7NEWS Australia  57 16 Media mainstream news  \n15 Al Jazeera English  54 18 Media mainstream news  \n16 Oppenheimer Ranch Project  48 19 Vlogger/advocacy  \n17 GT BUSTER  43 15 Industry \n18 All 4 Adventure  40 17 Vlogger/travel  \n19 Smith Shannon  33 22 Inauthentic  \n20 Wet Mammal  32 15 Vlogger/travel  \n21 Coastal Chaos Adventures  31 15 Vlogger/travel  \n22 Aaron Wilson  26 24 Inauthentic  \n23 Life in a Nutshell  24 12 Vlogger/travel  \n24 Caleb Smith  24 25 Inauthentic  \n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  115 25 Guardian News  23 21 Media mainstream news  \n26 Berry Pitty  23 27 Inauthentic  \n27 Theme tuchel  21 28 Inauthentic  \n28 Green Thumbelina  21 26 Inauthentic  \n29 Drishti IAS  21 30 Industry \n30 Sitalpur TV  20 31 Vlogger/travel  \n31 FRANCE 24 English  19 20 Media mainstream news  \n32 Outback Mike  19 32 Vlogger/travel  \n33 Sleepy Classes  19 34 Industry \n34 James Marry  18 23 Inauthentic  \n35 Its not broken  18 1 Individual  \n36 No Operator  18 35 Vlogger/gamer  \n37 Rebecca George  17 23 Inauthentic  \n38 Yui Chan  15 5 Individual  \n39 Quriosity \u0995 \u09cc\u09a4\u09c2\u09b9\u09b2 15 35 Vlogger/travel  \n40 Clint Lloyd  14 17 Individual  \n41 RT DE 14 33 Media alternative news  \n42 Study IQ education  14 38 Industry \n43 PathFinder  14 37 Industry \n44 Silhouette Park Farm  14 39 Vlogger/advocacy  \n45 Logan Beri  13 5 Unknown  \n46 dominic pelle  13 1 Individual  \n47 Tom Park 13 42 Industry \n48 TRT World  12 20 Media mainstream news  \n49 Clinghton Scott  12 41 Inauthentic  \n50 Steven Lim  12 5 Individual  \n51 Josh Norbido  12 43 Industry \n52 Farell Salvador  12 44 Vlogger/travel  \n53 Laron Stehr  11 45 Inauthentic  \n54 Bloomberg Quicktake: Now  11 19 Media mainstream news  \n55 Zachary Schmidt  11 40 Vlogger/travel  \n56 kotlin Wombat  11 1 Individual  \n57 Deo et Patria  11 1 Individual  \n58 The Australia Institute  11 45 Industry \n59 Study Explains - Vinayak Shukla  11 46 Industry \n60 \u66b4\u5f92\u306f\u9ec4\u8272\u3044\u6b7b\u4f53\u72ac\u3067\u6b7b\u3093\u3060  9 16 Individual  \n61 CNA 9 21 Media mainstream news  \n62 EbbTideTV  9 15 Industry \n63 Tricky Boy  9 1 Individual  \n64 Fara\u2019s Adventure  9 48 Vlogger/travel  \n65 Y Lu 8 20 Inauthentic  \n66 Sean Paul  8 2 Unknown  \n \n116 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  67 NBC News  8 21 Media mainstream news  \n68 Down To Earth  8 20 Media alternative news  \n69 motorsportfreak1  8 1 Individual  \n70 Muzzle Flash  8 1 Individual  \n71 Divers Den - Cairns 8 50 Industry \n72 Sandy Sailing  8 49 Vlogger/travel  \n73 logic pathshala  8 51 Industry \n74 halfasheep  7 1 Individual  \n75 Chee Wai Lee  7 5 Individual  \n76 Andrew Graham  7 1 Individual  \n77 Boycott CHYNA  7 1 Individual  \n78 pmjd42 7 1 Individual  \n79 David Anthony  7 1 Individual  \n80 Aliye Sara  7 29 Vlogger/travel  \n81 VOA News  7 52 Media mainstream news  \n82 Offshore Tales  7 57 Vlogger/travel  \n83 FACTOIDS  7 54 Unknown  \n84 Artorex 7 55 Industry \n85 faz 7 59 Media mainstream news  \n86 DEFFIE CLY  6 56 Inauthentic  \n87 Ventura 6 20 Individual  \n88 10 News First  6 69 Media mainstream news  \n89 Al Gore 6 19 Individual  \n90 James Maralyn  6 1 Individual  \n91 weburnitatbothends  6 1 Individual  \n92 M MORE  6 71 Individual  \n93 euronews  6 18 Media mainstream news  \n94 Luke H 6 1 Individual  \n95 Birgitta Birgersdatter  6 1 Individual  \n96 Nic 6 1 Individual  \n97 Sue Phillips  6 1 Individual  \n98 Colonel Angus  6 1 Individual  \n99 Peter Remkes  6 1 Individual  \n100 Idiotic Seeker  6 29 Vlogger/travel  \nNote.

Sky News Australia  \nis the most central node in the largest group (Group 1), and WION is the most central \nin the second largest (Group 2). Sky News  is number three in the list, but this is the UK \nversion and has been owned by ComCast  since November 2018 with this outlet no \nlonger affiliated with News Corp ( MBFC, 2022b).  \nWith the exception of The Guardian , most of these media actors are broadcast \noutlets, which produce content that lends itself to the affordances of YouTube. In terms \nof the political stance of the outlets, there is a range represented with two right -wing \noutlets, two right -centre, three least -biased and three left -centre and with a mix of \ncorporate and state ownership. In ninth position is alternative news outlet  RT DE \n(MBFC, 2022c) \u2013 the German branch (DE) of internal broadcaster RT, formerly Russia \nToday26. RT is funded by the Russian state and is widely -known for its propaganda \nand interference in foreign politics (Crilley et al., 2022), yet has one of the high est \nYouTube viewership rates for a TV channel (Elswah & Howard, 2020). It broadcasts \nin several languages, though it was the German -based outlet only that showed up in \nthis data collection. However, the RT DE YouTube channel has since been removed, \nand the following text shows in the place of the channel\u2019s landing page: \u201cThis account \nhas been terminated for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines \u201d. Upon further \ninvestigation, it seems that RT launched a TV channel in Germany in December  2021, \nwhich \u2013 after about a week \u2013 was taken off the air  by the German media regulator \n(Murray & Marrow, 2021 ). This has interesting implications for considering the \ninterplay of media (in this case alternative news media) with social media platforms \n \n \n25 This was the one actor that appears to have no relevance at all to the keyword search \u2013 there is nothing about the GBR in the \nvideo, or the collected comments or video tags (checked via VidIQ).  \n26 A check of the comments collected in the dataset confirmed t he inclusion of RT DE was relevant to UNESCO and the GBR. \n \n118 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  and government in terms of power over information flows , and can be aligned with \nCastells\u2019 network power .  \nTable 6.3 \nTop 10 Media Actors in the YouTube Global Network  \n YouTube \nChannel In-\ndegree Media type  Political \nstance Description27 \n1 Sky News \nAustralia 739 Media \nmainstream news  Right Real news, honest views.  \n \nThe best award -winning journalists with unique and \nexclusive insights.

There were 389 unique videos  collected. The top 30 \nare shown in Table 6.4 below.  \nTop 30 videos  \nThe video with the most interactions in the global YouTube network was posted \nby a channel called Difference Frames the World  (the video had 35,104 views at 7 \nNovember, 2021). In the \u2018About\u2019 section on YouTube, t his actor says its channel is for \n\u201canybody who likes Chinese Civilization and wants to make friends with Chinese \nPeople, and here you can find a true picture of China through my videos\u201d (Difference \nFrames the World, 202 1). The content features a series of still images with a narrated \nrobotic voice, essentially transcribing the exchanges between journalists and a Chinese \ngovernment minister during a press conference on 5 July, 2021 in China, which \nincludes a discussion about the recommended \u2018in danger\u2019 listing. The content is further \ndiscussed  in the framing section.  \nNot far behind  in second place in the top 30 was News Corp\u2019s Sky News \nAustralia (12,073 views at 7 November, 2021). Also broadcast on free -to-air \ntelevision, this actor\u2019s information  dominates the list with Sky News Australia  content \nrepresenting 43 per cent of the top 30 YouTube videos. Throughout the six -week data \ncollection period, this mainstream media actor published 25 videos related to the GBR. \n(This makes it the second most prevalent GBR-related content  creator behind The \nGuardian , which published 31 pieces of content during the six -week period). The full \nlist of videos is in Appendix E, with 10 videos uploaded on June 22, 2021, the first day \nnews of the recommendation began to circulate publicly. Inform ation drops off \ntowards the middle of the data collection range, and then ramps up again closer to the \nUNESCO decision coinciding with the release of AIMS\u2019 coral cover report (discussed \nfurther in Chapter 8).  \nNew Delhi -based commercial news outlet WION is  the next most prevalent \nsource representing 10 per cent of the content. The other mainstream media news outlet \n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  121 is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s ( ABC) News In Depth , which has an \nepisode of Media Watch  (number 16). Media Watch  is also broadcast  on free-to-air \nTV and describes itself as \u201cAustralia's leading forum for media analysis and critique\u201d \n(ABC News, 2021). The UNESCO GBR recommendation  was featured in this episode \nas a criticism of media outlets around the world for uncritically following the framing \nof the breaking story. The original framing was set by  New Corp\u2019s The Australian , \nwhich said the recommendation was a \u201cChina -led ambush\u201d and the federal government \nwas \u201cblindsided\u201d  (Packham, 2021a). Host Paul Barry criticises News Corp in \nparticular, saying it is \u201cbizarre that such a serious threat to one of the wonders of the \nworld which brings in billions of dollars and thousands of jobs for Australia should be \nblamed on the incompetence of our scientists or on political games played by China\u201d  \n(ABC News In -Depth, 2021 : Table 6.4, number 16 ). Commercial right -leaning News \nCorp and publicly -owned left -of-centre ABC have an ongoing tit -for-tat (Manne, \n2011), with Sky News Australia\u2019s  Andrew Bolt saying soon after the ABC \u201ccannot be \ntrusted\u201d when it comes to the GBR (Sky News Australia, 2021 a). \nWhile 60 per cent of the videos are comprised of these mainstream news media \nactors (Sky News Australia , WION and ABC News ), the remainder are  primarily  \n\u2018vloggers\u2019 that are predominantly focused on GBR-based adventures and fishing. The \none exception is the Oppenheimer Ranch Project  (Table 6.4, number 30) . This has \nbeen coded \u2018vlogger/advocate\u2019 with the video in the data collection featuring an \ninterview with a scientist who is affiliated with Ridd and right-wing thinktank the \nInstitute of Public Affairs  (IPA), including publicly questioning the reported health \nstatus of the GBR and the science used to inform protection policy (Marohasy, 2021; \nInstitute of Public Affairs, 2020). There are also a handful of videos that are not \nrelevant to this case study, which have been removed for the upcoming framing \nanalysis (numbers 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11).  \nTable 6.4 \nThe Top 30 Videos in the YouTube Network by Interactions  \n Information source: \nVideo ID  Video title  N= Channel \n1 xf70pntsuVE  COWA 2021 -0705b: Is Australia Crazy? \nEven The Endangered Great Barrier Reef Is \nChina's Fault?  309 Difference Frames the World  \n2 3f34Dx9PD3A  Failed push to change status of Great \nBarrier Reef a \u2018major loss\u2019 for the CCP  295 Sky News Australia  \n3 SzCTOzj1Wds  Australia hits back at China -chaired \nUNESCO over Barrier Reef's heritage \nstatus | WION World News  244 WION \n \n122 Chapter 6: YouTube Results  4 AuTlDkw5YeE  14 DAYS OF HELL (Surviving Hotel \nQuarantine)  242 Sailing La Vagabonde  \n5 R9yeZLdJjQI  Gravitas Live With Palki Sharma Upadhyay \n| UNESCO downgrades great Barrier Reef | \nWION News  238 WION \n6 q5-eQX_BbHE  Brupeg's New Engine...

The dominant frames from the top 10 information sources in the YouTube global network.  \n \n\n \n124 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  The most common frame in the top 10 items in the YouTube global network was \nconflict and strategy ( n=5), followed by public accountability and governance ( n=4) \nand scientific and technical uncertainty ( n=1) (Figure 6.2). These are the same frames \nreflected in the Twitter data, yet the narratives within them are different. For instance, \nthe source of much of the conflict and strategy framing in this data is not a \u2018battle\u2019 \nbetween ENGOs and the government, or the domestic governments with the \ninternational governance of UNESCO , as was the case of Twitter\u2019s dominant content. \nRather, most \u2018battles\u2019 of the conflict and strategy frame in the YouTube data involved \nAustralia versus China with particular narratives about Australia being victi mised by \nChina (Table 6.5, number 3, 4 ), or Australia winning the battle against the Chinese \nCommunist Party when the WHC voted against listing the GBR as \u2018in danger\u2019 (Table \n6.5, number 2 ). For example,  WION World News  host Palki Sharma Upadhyay  took \nAustralia\u2019s \u2018side\u2019, saying  China was involved in \u201cvendetta politics\u201d : \u201cIt takes a \nstrategic mind to weaponise trade and history, but a sinister one to weaponise nature. \nAnd that's exactly what China is doing to Australia, t argeting their most iconic \ngeographical landmark \u2013 the Great Barrier Reef\u201d ( Table 6.5, number 4 ). Also this from \nSky News Australia  host Chris Smith:  \nWe haven\u2019t had many wins against China in the last year or so, but this is one \nof them\u2026 It could still hap pen, and we need to keep fighting against these \nattempts\u2026. So the scorecard stands at China 10, Australia one \u2013 we\u2019re fighting \nback. (Table 6.5, number 2)  \nThere was one  video that appeared in the top 10 from Sky News Australia  that \npitted the domestic gove rnment and Australian interests against \u201cEuropean bureaucrats \nand international green groups\u201d . This claimed  that the Reef was being turned into a \n\u201cposter child\u201d to push for more ambitious climate targets ahead of the UN Climate \nChange Conference in Glasgow29 (Table 6.5, number 10). Peta Credlin, Sky News \nAustralia host, said this push formed part of \u201can international green conspiracy\u201d (Table \n6.5, number 10).  \nAs the next most frequent frame, \u2018public accountability and governance \u2019 \nrepresented or countered the federal government\u2019s statements that the draft \n \n \n29 The UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, was i n November, 2021: \nhttps://ukcop26.org/  \n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  125 recommendation was \u201cun reasonable \u201d, due process had not been followed, the \nAustralian government had been \u201cblindsided\u201d, and the GBR was the victim of \npoliticisation ( DAWE, 2021c; Table 6.5, number 8,  9). In the case of the top video by \nDifference Frames the World , this could have also been coded conflict and strategy, \nhowever, the language is more conducive to a public accountability and governance \nframe in the way that it narrates and translates Chinese minister Wang Wenbin \nresponding to a question from a journalist from The Paper . For context, this media \noutlet is owned by the Shanghai United Media Group, which is a state media compa ny \nof the People's Republic of China (Wikipedia, 2021).  \nPart of the response is provided below:  \nAustralia should lead by example and respect the opinion of the professional \nevaluation institution. It should face up to its severe failings in world heritage \nprotection and earnestly step up preservation efforts instead of politicising \ntechnical issues, wantonly hurling unfounded accusations at UNESCO and its \nprofessional evaluation body and shifting the blame to others. Moreover, it \nshould exert less pressure on the World Heritage Committee through innuendo \nand sensational media reports to sway the Committee's impartial and just \ndecision. (Table 6.5 , number 1:  narrated comments attributed to Chinese \nminister Wang Wenbin ) \nThe final frame identified was scientifi c and technical uncertainty. This accounts \nfor an interview Sky News Australia  conducted  with Ridd following the public release \nof AIMS\u2019 coral cover report ahead of the WHC decision in July 2021  (Table 6.5, \nnumber 7). In this video the marine geophysicist  discusses the how the report\u2019s data \nshow \u201cunequivocally\u201d that the GBR is in \u201cextremely good condition \u201d, going on to \nquestion the credibility of scientific organisations:  \nThere's been some very spurious figures they've been throwing around , some \nof the scientific organisations over the last couple of years , saying there \u2019s been \nthree bleaching events in the last five years now this is completely \ninaccurate.... there were three bleaching events, but they only impacted certain \nsections of the R eef. (Table 6.5 , number 7:  interview  with Peter Ridd)  \nIn summary, t he dominance of the \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 and \u2018public \naccountability and governance\u2019 frames in the global YouTube network suggest that \nthe GBR and its protection is politicised, and has the potential to be  polarising in the \n \n126 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  sense that half of the most widely circulated information focuses on the issue as a \n\u201cgame amongst elites\u201d (Nisbet, 2009) who are seeking to win an argument, rather than \nfocusing on the issue at hand.  This is a strategy that has been used by partisan media \nto invoke \u201cpartisan social identities\u201d (Levendusky, 2013, p. 567)  and help advertisers \nto target certain audiences (Arsenault & Castells, 2008) . The politicisation of the GBR \nvia the \u2018public accountability and governanc e\u2019 frame also avoids a genuine discussion \nabout the state of the Reef\u2019s health and impacts from climate change by focusing \ninstead on the \u201cunfair\u201d process involved. These findings and the potential implications \nwill be discussed further in Chapter 8.  \n \n6.4 PART C \u2013 CONNECTION AND DISCONNECTION  \nNetworked power and network -making power  \nThe section below outlines how connection and disconnection w ere considered \nat the global network level using metrics like modularity, density and isolates to give \nan overview of t he connectivity and information flows in this network. Visualisations \nmapped in NodeXL and Gephi were used to further interpret these interactions. Then, \nguided by the data, Group 1 and Group 5 were more closely examined to understand \nconnection, disconnec tion and power interplays  (Chapter 4).  \n \n6.4.1 How connected, or disconnected, is the global network ? \nUsing the Wakita -Tsurumi algorithm, modularity is 0.64 for the global YouTube \nnetwork, which is evidence of a high level of community division or quality of \nclustering (Himelboim et al., 2013 b). This could be an indication of both connection \n(partitioning within the graph as users connect with each other in the clusters to create \nand share information : homophily ) and disconnection \u2013 the extent that these clusters \nare separate from other actors in the graph. In the case of the YouTube data, it is \nexpected that this value would be higher than interactions on Twitter, for example, \nbecause of the nature of the information collected where users are often cluste red \naround a single, or handful, of videos , essentially creating hubs. This behaviour is also \nreflected in the low density value of 0.000278, suggesting that there are relatively low \nconnections in the graph, which also impacts the ability of information t o flow within \nit (Himelboim et al., 2017).  \n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  127 The nature of the centrali sation of information flow is reflected in Figure 6. 3, \nwhich shows many of the top actors are at the centre of the \u2018hubs\u2019. While Smith et al. \u2019s \n(2014) conversational archetypes were appl ied to examine Twitter networks only  in \ntheir study , by employing similar principles, this network could be considered a hub \nand spoke -style broadcast network due to the media outlets and vloggers being central \nattention-getting actors in most of the large r community clusters.  \nFinally, there are 148 isolates in the global network (represented by Group 9), \nwhich make up about 3.4 % of the nodes. As noted earlier in this thesis, isolates are \nunconnected actors, and can pose blockages to information flow. Howe ver, to enhance \nthis understanding about information flows, the network needs to be explored at the \nsubnetwork level.  \n  \n \n128 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results   \n \nFigure 6.3. Network visualisation using NodeXL and the Harel -Koren tree -map layout. T he top 10 \nactors in the global network are marked on the subnetworks.  \n \n \n\n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  129 6.4.2 How does connection and disconnection at the subnetwork level relate to \nattention, information flows and frames?  \nGiven that the largest cluster in the global YouTube network is Group 1 ( Sky \nNews Australia ) and the video with the most interactions  is in Group 5 ( Difference \nFrames the World ), these two clusters were selected to further explor e information \nflows, noting their network dominance and significance. This decision was als o guided \nby the data analysis, noting that these two groups share oppositional views, as \nidentified in Part B. Also, mapp ing the data  in Gephi using the Louvain clustering \nalgorithm and ForceAtlas2 force -directed layout algorithm (Chapter 4)  highlighted a \nsingle-account bridge between Group 1 and Group 5  (Figure 6.4) . This provided a \nuseful opportunity to explore connection, disconnection and power . \n \n \nFigure 6.4. The \u2018giant component\u2019 of the global YouTube network  using ForceAtlas2 in Gephi . Sky \nNews Australia  is at the centre and Difference Frames the World  is at the top right. The fishing and \nGBR-related vloggers are situated away from the news -focused cluster  (top). \n \nLexneuron  \n \n130 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  6.4.3 Who are the dominant a ctors in the subnetworks?  \nAn analysis of the top 10 actors was completed for each of the clusters, but there \nis little value in including a table as provided in Chapter 5 as the top actor is the \ninformation source ( Sky News Australia  and Difference Frames the World ) and the \nremaining nine actors are all individuals or unknown actors, who are de -identified. \nThese actors are engaging with the content published by the top actor.  \n \n6.4.4 What information is being shared in both groups and how is it being \nframed? \nThe top 10 information sources (videos), number of interactions , and the \ndominant frame of the content is shown in the tables and figures below. While there \nwere videos from other news sources in Group 1, the top 10 items are all from Sky \nNews Australia  (Table 6.6). Group 5 had a single piece of content, which was the \nDifference Frames the World  video. \nDominant information and frames \u2013 Group 1 \nTable 6.6 \nDominant Information Shared and its Framing in Group 1  \n Information \nsource - Video \nID N= Title Frame \n1 3f34Dx9PD3A  262 Failed push to change status of Great Barrier Reef a \n\u2018major loss\u2019 for the CCP  Conflict and strategy  \n2 Bpb6zD-ZVuk 189 Great Barrier Reef 'China's latest shot' in its \n'victimisation of Australia'  Conflict and strategy  \n3 vEsclklEaxM  170 Government \u2018delighted\u2019 at UNESCO Great Barrier \nReef decision  Public accountability and \ngovernance  \n4 oOaSaxSP02I  145 The UN process has seen the Great Barrier Reef as \na 'poster child' for climate targets  Conflict and strategy  \n5 ST6xYhFp2d8  137 Data \u2018unequivocally\u2019 shows Great Barrier Reef is \nin \u2018extremely good condition\u2019  Scientific and technical uncertainty  \n6 j7JJMoAChYs  116 International ambassadors tour Great Barrier Reef \nahead of UNESCO decision  Conflict and strategy  \n7 2y1oaUwj_OA  102 Great Barrier Reef avoids UNESCO 'in danger' \nlisting Conflict and strategy  \n8 p_9z3r5RG2I  98 China-chaired UNESCO 'hasn't visited Great \nBarrier Reef since 2012'  Conflict and strategy  \n9 5r9rCYOCDL\nU 95 Outrageous' JobKeeper payments to Great Barrier \nReef Foundation 'should be repaid'  Public accountability and \ngovernance  \n10 \n  DejhDPs2QzM  \n  88 \n  China-backed UNESCO was 'politicised' to \nrecommend listing Great Barrier Reef as 'in danger' \n  Public accountability and \ngovernance  \n  \nNote.

The dominant frames in Group 1 expressed as a ba r chart. The horizontal  axis is the frame \nand the vertical axis is the frequency it appeared.  \nThe interactions in Group 1 related to 25 videos in total, with the most prevalent \n14 being published by Sky News Australia . The remaining videos are from mainstream \nnews media outlets and vloggers (travel and advocacy). The frames represented in the \ntop 10 information sources in Group 1 (Figure 6.5) largely reflect the most dominant \nframes of the global network, which is to b e expected given the dominance of Sky \nNews Australia  as an actor.  \nThe top 10 most dominant videos \u2013 all by Sky News Australia  \u2013 had a mix of \nframes, and generally featured elements of all three highlighted in the graph, with the \nmost dominant fram e indicated. For instance, in the case of number 9, the bulk of this \nstory was about the Jobkeeper payments claimed by the Great Barrier Reef \nFoundation, but the last part involved host Chris Kenny asking guest Nationals Senator \nMatthew Canavan about the outcome of  the WHC decision. Canavan says it was a \n\u201cbittersweet victory\u201d, going on to say that the Reef had fully recovered and UNESCO\u2019s \nrecent attention was the fault of problematic scientific reports, implying ulterior \nmotives were at play:  \nUNESCO, to give them th eir due, they were just quoting from the Queensland \nand federal government reports that have been written in recent years with the \nmost doomsaying, exaggerated threats about the Reef so when they read these \nreports of course they're going think it's in dan ger. When, apparently, surprise, \n\n \n132 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  surprise, wasn't it such a coincidence Chris that last week just before it came \nup on the agenda, one of these organisations \u2013 the Australian Institute of \nMarine Science \u2013 released a report, saying it's all OK. The coral is  back to \nrecord levels! [laughs]. It \u2019s all fine. That needs to be investigated too Chris: \nHow come that report just popped up last week when we \u2019ve been saying that \nfor years and ignored and ridiculed . (Table 6.6, number 9 ) \n \nThere are other snippets that re late to scientific reports and agencies being \npresented as problematic or inaccurate within the top 10 information sources. This \nincludes the Cairns Tourism Association president saying in a Sky News Australia  \ninterview that GBR science and management agen cies AIMS and GBRMPA need to \nhave \u201cnuancing\u201d in their reports to ensure the \u201cfactual portrayal \u201d of the health of the \nGBR (Table 6.6, number 1 ). Also, this comment from a Sky News Australia  host \nnarrating a story following the WHC decision: \u201cEnvironment min ister Sussan Ley says \nthe outcome is an opportunity for site managers and marine scientists to display the \nsuccess of the outstanding work across the Reef\u201d  (Table 6.6, number 7) , which hints \nat a desire to counter the \u2018bad news\u2019 of the science with the \u2018go od news\u2019 of the \ninvestment being made, thus mixing media and politics with science.  Of interest too, \nin this same story, the host in the broadcast version says this of the progress report that \nwas requested to be provided to the WHC by February 2022: \u201cThe proposal was based \non concerns about water quality and claims not enough has been done to combat \nclimate change\u201d, yet in the YouTube version, the text has been edited from  the less \ndoubt-inducing \u201cclaims\u201d to \u201cfears\u201d ( Table 6.6, number 7 ). This is consisten t with Grien \nand Macneil\u2019s  (2022) findings about conservative media outlets, namely The \nAustralian , using selective language to convey climate \u201cdenialist undertones\u201d (p. 7). \nThe role of science in mediatised environmental conflict and its politicisation will be \nfurther discussed in Chapter 8.  \nDominant information and frames \u2013 Group 5 \nTable 6.7 \nDominant Information Shared and its Framing in Group 5  \n Information source - \nVideo ID  N= Title Frame \n1  xf70pntsuVE   309  COWA 2021 -0705b: Is Australia Crazy? Even \nThe Endangered Great Barrier Reef Is China's \nFault?  Public accountability and \ngovernance   \nNote. N is the number of interactions on the video in the form of comments, or comment replies.  \n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  133  \nGroup 5 had a single information source, which was the video by Difference \nFrames the World  that was the most dominant across the global YouTube network. \nThe other edges in this cluster are comments on the video. While they require a \nsystematic analysis that is outside the scope of this project, there are recurring themes \nthat include the Australia/China tensions (comments about the victimisation of China), \ndiscussions about the GBR\u2019s health status, and other broader environmental threats. \nWhile the frame of public accountability and governance ranks highly in the global \nnetwork\u2019s information sources, this narrative is from the opposing perspective of Sky \nNews Austral ia\u2019s \u2018reality\u2019 , questioning the Australian government\u2019s politi cisation of \nthe GBR.  \n6.4.5 How connected or disconnected are the groups?  \nConsideration of the number of shared connections between the groups   supports \nthe earlier premise that most connections stay within the same group, with a hub at the \ncentre acting as an information authority, and the other users having few \ninterconnections between them. Table 6.8 shows the intra and inter -cluster sharing \nmainly with Group 1 and Group 5. There were no direct conn ections between these \ntwo groups . Evaluating inter -cluster connections more broadly, G roup 16 was the only \ngroup with 10 or more relationships with the network\u2019s largest subnetwork of Group \n1. While Group 1 had connections with other groups, this small qua ntity shows that \nmost of the interactions remain within the cluster. Group 5 was even more insular, with \nall of the edges that started in this group remaining there.  \nTable 6.8 \nIntra and Inter-cluster Connections  \nSource group  Target group  Relationships, N=  \nG1 G1 1610 \nG1 G16 10 \nG1 G5 0 \nG5 G5 309 \nG5 G1 0 \nNote. The number of intra and inter -cluster connections that started in Group 1 and 5.  Group 5 did not \nhave any connections  with G1. G16 is the only group that has 10 or more connections with G1.  \n \nInterestingly from a networked power and network -making power perspective , \n\u2018Lexneuron\u2019 is a single node that acts as a bridge between Group 1 and Group 5. \n \n134 Chapter 6:  YouTube Results  Classified by the Wakita-Tsurumi algorithm as  Group 21  and interacting with content \nin groups 1 and 5 , it forms a single tie between the otherwise disconnected clusters . \nThis node is either an individual or a \u2018sockpuppet \u2019 account. It has two subscribers to \nits channel and a generic image, yet it has a diversity of channel subscriptions. \nLexneuron posted the same comment on three different videos that are located in \ngroups 1, 5 and 21. The comment consists of a series of fi ve links explaining the GBR\u2019s \nailing health, the impact of climate change and action that can be taken to protect it. \nWhile a framing analysis was not conducted on each link, a high -level content analysis \nsuggests they can be broadly classified as having \u2018 morality and ethics\u2019 fram ing. The \nlist of links and the channel names are shown in Appendix H. It should be noted that \nthese three comments are no longer visible on the videos.  \nTwo of the videos that Lexneuron  commented on are mainstream commercial \nnews outlets: Sky News Australia  (G1) and Singapore -government owned Channel \nNews Asia  (G21), which MBFC classifies as \u2018least biased\u2019 and credible ( MBFC, \n2021a). The third is Difference Frames the World\u2019s  video (G5), which was coded \nvlogger/advocate, and has a d onation-based business model. These videos present \nthree views about China\u2019s level of involvement in the \u2018in danger\u2019  recommendation and \nwhether or not it was politically motivated or legitimate. This is relevant as blaming \nChina is a delegitimising tactic to contest concerns about the health and the \nmanagement of the international icon and , by extension , defend \u2018productivism \u2019, \nessentially economic growth. The headline of the Sky News Australia  video that the \nLexneuron comment appears on is \u201cGreat Barrier Re ef \u2018China's latest shot \u2019 in its \n\u2018victimisation of Australia \u2019\u201d. This was discussed earlier, but briefly, it is extremely \ncritical of China, was coded \u2018conflict and strategy \u2019 and uses two Liberal National Party \npoliticians as the only spokespeople. CNA\u2019s headline is \u201cAustralia to challenge \nUNESCO downgrade of Great Barrier Reef\u201d and is journalistically balanced, \npresenting Australia\u2019s claims, China\u2019s rejection of those claims,  and quotes \nEnvironment Minister Ley and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as spokespeople. As \nnoted earlier, The Difference Frames the World  video\u2019s headline is \u201cCOWA 2021 -\n0705b: Is Australia Crazy? Even The Endangered Great Barrier Reef Is China's \nFault?\u201d. I t is extremely critical of Australia and quotes a Chinese minister at a press \nconference.  \n  \nChapter 6:  YouTube Results  135 While it can be said that Lexneuron does not have a large \u2018switching\u2019 impact (for \ninstance, the actor has an in -degree score of 0, meaning it had no reactions to its \ncomments), its role as a bridge between these three information sources with diverse \nframes \u2013 and the nature of the information it shares \u2013 is interesting in the context of \nnetwork-making power and attempts to reframe narratives , albeit unsuccessfully . \nWhile it is outside the scope of this research, the next step would be to look at the \ncomments on these three videos for a \u2018below the line \u2019 analysis ( Graham & Wright, \n2015) to see how other actors are responding, including examining the discursive \ntactics use d to reinforce or contest frames and narratives circulated by the more \nattention-getting actors in the network, including mainstream media outlets.  \n \n6.5 CONCLUSION  \nThrough the analysis in Parts A and B and examining the Group 1 cluster further \nin Part C, Sky News Australia  is a super -node in relation to its dominance  and ability \nto exercise networked power  during the data collection period. It has the highest in -\ndegree value by far and its information features in 13 out of the 30 most attention-\ngetting content . As noted by Himelboim et al., (2017), the hierarchical structure of \nnetworks can impact information flow. Namely, a network where one or a few actors \nattract a large and disproportionate number of connections depends heavily on these \nactors for informatio n flow and sharing (p. 4). This high level of network centrali sation \nis referred to as \u2018hub and spoke typology\u2019 (Hsu & Park, 2011 , as cited in Himelboim \net al., 2017 ) with one influential actor at the \u2018hub\u2019, surrounded by several unconnected \nactors. This s tyle of network is evident on YouTube where the central nodes are often \nthe content producers, with other accounts (whether authentic  individuals  or not), \ncommenting on the information, or replying to each other. This creates in -coming ties \nto these \u2018hubs\u2019 , making these central actors  information authorit ies. This is particularly \nthe case with Sky News Australia : it has 739 in -coming interactions, and just one \noutgoing ( N=1). The networked and network -making power of Sky News Australia  is \nsignificant  in this network  in terms of the framing of GBR protection , use of tactics \nlike sowing scientific doubt to contest narratives,  and for considering the power of \nmainstream media actors in hybrid news -sharing spaces. This will be further explored \nin Chapter 8. The next chapter will cover the results from Facebook.  \n  \n \n136 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results   \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  \n7.1 OVERVIEW  \n7.1.1 Data collected  \nUsing the methods and parameters outlined in Chapter 4, 4663 posts  from 2430 \npublic Facebook pages and groups were collected during the June 21, 2021 \u2013 August \n1, 2021 timeframe for the search query \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d. The term \u2018Facebook \nspaces\u2019 will be used hereafter to refer to Facebook pages, groups and verified profiles \n(Bruns et al., 202 0). These posts had a total of 464,886 interactions (reactions, \ncomments and shares). Table 7.1 shows a breakdown of the data that was collected \n(note: there were no verified profile  accounts30 detected for this data collection ).  \nTable 7.1 \nSummary of the Data Collected from Facebook  \n \nFacebook data collection  \n \nTotal number of posts (pages and groups)   \n4663 \nTotal number of interactions  464,886 \nTotal number of unique Facebook spaces  2430 (1862 pages, 568 groups) \nTotal number of links (including internal)  4563 \nTotal number of unique links  3074 \nTotal number of unique domains  619 \n \n \n7.1.2 Time series analysis  \nThere is a distinct activity peak at the point where the World Heritage \nCommittee\u2019s draft recommendation was publicly reported, with the story broken as an \nexclusive by The Australian  at about 21.30 on Monday, June 21  (Figure 7.1 ). The first \nFacebook post on the topic appeared in the results is from Flora 4 Fauna \u2013 Australia, \nan environmental conservation organisation, which shared the story from The \nAustralian  around 07.00 on Tuesday, June 22, 2021. There is a sharp spike in activity \n \n \n30 An example of this type of account would be a celebrity, or someone with a high public profile.  \n  \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  137 over the next 24 hours, which gradually peters off. A much smaller spike around July \n10, 2021 aligns with the news that Australian Environment Minister Sussan Ley was \nflying to Europe to \u201clobby  World Heritage Council members\u201d against the proposed \ndowngrade (Ore, 2021), followed by another activity increase on July 21, 2021, which \nis the lead -up into the World Heritage Committee\u2019s decision on Friday, July 23 , 2021. \nLike the other platforms, t he initial draft recommendation received much more \nattention than the final decision. It is also of note that the initial activity was not \nsustained throughout the month for this issue.  \n \nFigure 7.1. Activity for  the search term \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d across Facebook spaces from June 21, \n2021 to August 1, 2021.  \n7.1.3 Two-mode network metrics  \nDue to the nature of the data available through CrowdTangle, bipartite \u2013 or two-\nmode \u2013 networks were created to analyse these data. In the case of this study, one of \nthe networks was to explore the relationship between Facebook spaces and URLs and \nthe other was to study Facebook spaces and domains. The network statistics from each \nof these are shown below in Table 7.2 and Table 7.3 res pectively.  \n \nFacebook Spaces and URLs  \nTable 7.2 \nGlobal Network Metrics for Facebook  \n \nGraph metrics  \n \nGraph type   \nDirected \nNodes \u2013 unique Facebook spaces  2430 \nNodes \u2013 unique URLs  3074 \nEdges (URLs)  4563 \nNumber of edge types  1 (URLs)  \nConnected components  Weakly connected (1499), strongly \nconnected (5505)  \nDensity 0.00031 \n \n \n31 Density returned a  \u20180\u2019 value in Gephi, however, the software  shows values up to three decimal \nplaces. I used Datta (2021) and referred to Peng et al. (2021) to manually calculate the density  with a \n\n \n138 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  Modularity  \n 0.933 \nNote. Nodes are unique Facebook spaces and unique URLs, and edges are the connections between \nthese node sets (as hy perlinks).  \n \nFacebook Spaces and domains  \nTable 7.3 \nGlobal Network Metrics for Facebook  \n \nGraph metrics  \n \nGraph type   \nDirected \nNodes \u2013 unique Facebook spaces  2430 \nNodes \u2013 unique domains  619 \nEdges (domains)  4563 \nNumber of edge types  1 (Domains)  \nConnected components  Weakly connected (486), strongly \nconnected (3052)  \nDensity 0.00032 \nModularity  0.666 \n \nNote. Nodes are unique Facebook spaces and unique domains, and edges are the connections between \nthese node sets (as hyperlinks).  \n \n7.2 PART A \u2013 DOMINANT ACTORS  \nNetworking power, network power and networked power  \n \nTop 100 Facebook spaces  \n7.2.1 Which actor types were not included, or excluded, from the network?  \nIn terms of networking power, t here are no international organisations like \nUNESCO or science -related actors in the top 100 list, noting these actors were \nprominent on Twitter. Like the other networks, there are also no identifiable \n \n \nresult of 0.000147 . However, I  cannot be sure it is correct as the bipartite calculation is more complex. \nGiven the lack of importa nce to this specific value to this research inquiry and inability to compare it \nto the one -mode networks , it is sufficient to say  density is low.  \n32 See footnote on Table  7.2. The result manually calculated was 0.00031 , which is low.  \n  \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  139 Indigenous actors.  In terms of network power, Facebook flagged  content as \nproblematic, which will be discussed in Part B.  \n7.2.2 Which actors received the most attention?  \nOnly 22 per cent of the top 100 Facebook spaces are media outlets, with 16 being \nmainstream news and six alternative news. Scott Trust Limited -owned The Guardian \nAustralia and New Corp\u2019s Sky News Australia  are in fifth and sixth places respectively. \nThis is discussed further in the top 10 media actors section below. The majority of \nactors in the top 100 were coded \u2018advocacy\u2019, but this group is diverse repre senting \nGBR health and climate action advocates, as well as those advocating for GBR health \nand climate scepticism. Some examples include \u2018Fight For Our Reef\u2019, \u2018Climate Action \nAustralia\u2019 and \u2018Rise Up for Climate Change Action\u2019 , along with the \u2018Australian \nClimate Sceptics Group\u2019, \u2018Climate change is natural\u2019, \u2018Green Shirts Movement QLD\u2019, \nand \u2018Property Rights Australia\u2019. The last two have been critics of the Queensland \nGovernment\u2019s Reef Regulations mentioned in Chapter 1. There were also Facebook \nspaces coded as advocacy that are politically -motivated yet sharing diverse political \nstances. For example pro -conservative spaces including \u2018I\u2019ll stand by Tony Abbott\u201933 \nand \u2018Tony Abbott\u2019s Support Page\u2019, along with spaces critical of the incumbent Liberal -\nNational Coa lition government (LNP) including \u2018The Fiberal Party of Australia \u2013 Lies \n& Misdemeanours\u2019, \u2018We Loathe Dutton & Morrison\u2019, and \u20181,000,000 Strong Against \nThe Liberal National Party\u2019. Other political groups are also reflected, like \u2018Australian \nGreens politics , news and discussion\u2019 and \u2018The Greens Little Bag of Stupidity\u2019. Other \ntypes of advocacy groups are also active , including one that is pro-free speech and \ncritical of COVID -19 restrictions (Wake Up Aussies & Stay Safe), and another that is \ncritical of publ isher News Corp (Stop Evil Murdoch's Monopoly).  \nThe next most dominant actor type was \u2018industry\u2019, comprising mainly tourism \n(21). This is a much larger representation compared to Twitter and YouTube. Next is \n\u2018political\u2019 (10), which are mainly politicians  with a range of stances from the Greens \nand Labor to more conservative politicians like Bob Katter and George Christensen. \nChristensen has been associated with spreading disinformation about vaccinations via \nhis social media accounts (Williams, 2021). Within this are two government agencies, \n \n \n33 Tony Abbott is a prev ious Australian LNP prime minister who is known for his scepticm towards \nthe threat of climate change, and for his repeals to climate -related policy (Hudson, 2017).  \n \n140 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  including the federal agency for managing the Great Barrier Reef , the Great Barrier \nReef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) , and a local council . The remaining actors \nhave been classified as \u2018community\u2019 (3) representing gras sroots groups that do not \nmeet the criteria of the other categories, and two are unknown.  \nFocusing on the top 10 in the list, the most central actor is the \u2018Fight for Our \nReef\u2019 page. This movement has a long association with Great Barrier Reef protection \ncampaigning. In its previous form it was \u2018Fight for the Reef\u2019 \u2013 a partnership between \nthe Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) and the World Wildlife Fund \n(WWF) that fo rmed in 2012 in response to a previous \u2018in danger\u2019 recommendation \n(Foxwell-Norton & Lester, 2017; WWF, 2018)34. However, it seems the recent \ncampaign activities are being led by the AMCS (AMCS, 2022). In second position, \nthe centrality of the \u2018Federal ICAC  Now !!!\u2019 Facebook group is perhaps unexpected \nin this environmental context, but it can be linked to a \u2018federal government corruption\u2019 \nand \u2018politics over protection\u2019 narratives that were later detected in the framing \nanalysis. ICAC is the Independent Comm ission Against Corruption, which is \nresponsible for \u201cfighting corruption in the NSW public sector\u201d (NSW Independent \nCommission Against Corruption, 2019) \u2013 it does not currently exist at the federal \ngovernment level. The title of this group implies that an  anti-corruption watchdog is \nrequired for federal politics. Looking at the information this Facebook group shared \nvia URLs, its presence in the data collection relates to its view that the government \nlobbied against the \u2018in danger\u2019 listing, with the group sharing The Guardian  story \nabout how the Coalition believes it has \u201cthe numbers\u201d to stop the listing ( Table 7.9, \nnumber 1 ). However, the strongest edge relates to the federal government allowing the \nGreat Barrier Reef Foundation to receive the COVID -induced Jobseeker payments \n(Table 7.9, number 10 ). The context here relates to an ongoing corruption narrative as \nthe federal government faced heavy criticism in 2018 after awarding the same Great \nBarrier Reef -focused charity $443 million without following the g rant-awarding \nprocess (Australian National Audit Office, 2019). This thread was also seen across \nYouTube and Twitter.  \n \n \n34 Of note, the original campaign to advocate for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef against \nindustry interests began in 1967  and was called \u2018Save the Reef\u2019  (Lloyd et al., 2016 ; Foxwell -Norton & \nLester, 2017 ). \n  \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  141 The strong presence of two climate change advocacy groups \u2013 \u2018Climate Action \nAustralia\u2019 and \u2018Climate Action Launceston\u2019 \u2013 shows how the pro tection of the GBR \nis strongly connected to the broader issue of climate change and Australian climate \nchange policy. This theme is reflected throughout the data for all networks. \u2018Great \nBarrier Reef Legacy\u2019, \u2018Reef Ecologic\u2019 and \u2018Master Reef Guides\u2019 are al l groups that \nare actively involved in conducting Reef protection work within the World Heritage \narea in various forms, with the latter being associated with GBRMPA, the Association \nof Marine Park Tourism Operators and Tourism and Events QLD ( GBRMPA, 2022b ). \n \nTable 7.4 \nTop 100 Facebook Spaces by Degree \n Facebook space  Degree Type Group Actor type  \n1 Fight For Our Reef  36 Page 115 Advocacy  \n2 Federal ICAC Now !!!  31 Group 135 Advocacy  \n3 Great Barrier Reef Legacy 30 Page 115 Advocacy  \n4 Climate Action Australia  25 Group 831 Advocacy  \n5 Guardian Australia  24 Page 115 Media mainstream news  \n6 Sky News Australia  22 Page 372 Media mainstream news  \n7 Climate Action Launceston  22 Group 115 Advocacy  \n8 Australian Marine Conservation Society  21 Page 115 Advocacy  \n9 Reef Ecologic  21 Page 137 Industry \n10 Master Reef Guides  20 Page 450 Advocacy  \n11 Movies Change People  18 Page 1212 Advocacy  \n12 Iowa Climate Science Education  18 Page 1499 Advocacy  \n13 Senator Peter Whish -Wilson 17 Page 115 Political \n14 The Bulletin  16 Page 115 Media alternative news  \n15 The National Tribune  16 Page 1317 Media alternative news  \n16 Great Barrier Reef Foundation  15 Page 831 Industry \n17 Australian Greens politics, news and discussion  15 Group 268 Advocacy  \n18 Fridays For Future Greta Thunberg \n#Climatestrike #FFF  15 Group 135 Advocacy  \n19 Protest Australia -

The top 100 actors for Facebook spaces w ere defined in terms of \u2018degree\u2019. This table also \nidentifies if the Facebook space is a page or a group (\u2018 type\u2019), the modularity class it belongs to \n(\u2018group\u2019) and the type of actor. Media actors are highlighted in yellow.  \n* While similarly named, \u2018Whitsunday Chat\u2019 and \u2018Whitsundays Chat\u2019 are two different spaces.  \n \n7.2.3 Which news media actors received the most attention?  \nThe top 10 news media actors were isolated from the list and are shown in Table \n7.5. All these actors are Facebook pages (n il are Facebook groups). The table also \nshows their group (modularity class), their media type classification, and their political \nstance. This stance was coded by using Media Bias Fact Checker (MBFC) (Chapter \n \n144 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  4). The dominance of The Guardian Australia  and Sky News Australia  is interesting in \nthe context of the extreme difference in political stance and environmental attitudes \nshared by these two mainstream news outlets. Further, its significant noting The \nGuardian\u2019s  dominance in the Twitter results (Chapter 5) and Sky News Austr alia\u2019s \nsuper-node status in the YouTube results (Chapter 6). As previously stated, both \noutlets circulated the most GBR-related content of any media node throughout the data \ncollection period with The Guardian Australia  publishing 31 pieces of content and Sky \nNews Australia  25 pieces in the six -week period  (Appendix E) .  \nThere are three News Corp -owned outlets in the top 10 list: Sky News Australia , \nthe national daily The Australian  and the Cairns Post , which is the local paper for one \nof the largest GBR tourism hubs (GBRMPA, 2022 c). The Bulletin  and The National \nTribune are independent outlets. They are not included in MBFC\u2019s database, but \nfurther research shows that The Bulletin  is actually the \u2018 Auspoll Bulletin\u2019 and based in \nWestern Australia, saying on its website: \u201ca trusted news service that reports the truth \nand the stories the Murdoch press wont [sic]\u201d (The Auspoll Bulletin, 2021). A high -\nlevel look at the content shows it is extremely critical of the feder al government. The \nNational Tribune  is based in southern Queensland, and its website advocates for \ngreater transparency and access to information that is \u201cfree from encroaching \ncorporate, ideological or any other interests/influences\u201d (The National Tribune  \nAustralia, 2021). The National Times  is another independent outlet that says publishes \nits own original content as well as Australian and international news articles ( The \nNational Times, 2022). It publishes these stories directly to Facebook, rather than \nlinking to a website. As noted in Chapter 6, WION stands for \u2018World Is One News\u2019 is \nbased in New Delhi, India, and says it examines, \u201cglobal issues with in -depth analysis\u201d \n(WION, 2022). MBFC lists the outlet as \u2018 least biased\u2019, although it was found in \nChapter 6 that this outlet p ositioned its coverage in \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 terms . \nCommercial television news station 7News features strongly, with two local stations\u2019 \nFacebook pages in the top 10, but a total of six Facebook pages in the top 100 reflecting \nthe relevance of this issue to its local audience in the GBR catchment area.  \nOf these top 10 media actors, 70 per cent are mainstream news outlets, showing \nthat while there is a presence from other media actors, mainstream media still has \ndominance, especi ally noting the centrality of The Guardian Australia  and Sky News \nAustralia, which both have substantially  higher degree scores than the other outlets.  \n  \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  145  \nTable 7.5 \nTop 10 Media Outlets by Facebook Space and Degree  \n Facebook space  Degree Group Media type  Political \nstance About \n1 Guardian \nAustralia 24 115 Media \nmainstream \nnews Left-\nCentre All the latest news, comment, culture and \nsport from Guardian Australia: \ntheguardian.com/au  \n2 Sky News \nAustralia 22 372 Media \nmainstream \nnews Right Real news, honest views.

The top 100 actors for domains was defined in terms of \u2018in degree\u2019. This table also identifies the \nmodularity class it belongs to (\u2018 group\u2019) and the type of actor (\u2018 actor type\u2019). Media actors are \nhighlighted in yellow.  \n \n7.2.4 Which actor types were not included,  or excluded, from the network?  \nWhile there was a more diverse range of actors in the domains data, identifiable \nIndigenous actors were still missing from the communications space.  \n7.2.5 Which actors received the most attention?  \nThe domain \u2018facebook.com\u2019 was by far the most dominant in the data. It has a \nmuch higher representation due to the internal links created when a native video, photo \nor status post is made as the content is housed at the facebook.com domain; for \nexample, when Facebook space nodes upload co ntent to their page. This is the case \nwith Sky News Australia \u2019s videos \u2013 some link to a facebook.com domain, while others \n  \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  149 link to the outlet\u2019s actual website. Some of the Sky News Australia  content also \ncontains links to its YouTube channel. Regardless of this potential skew to the data, \nseventy-three of the top 100 domains shared belong to media outlets. Of this, 44 are \nmainstream news and 28 are alternative news. Eight of the top 10 overall actors are \nmedia outlets, with one of the remaining two being You Tube, noting that media \ncontent could also be uploaded here, yet is not identifiable without further analysis. \nThis shows that the content provided by media is attracting the most attention in this \nnetwork and it is likely that advocacy, industry and polit ical actors identified in Table \n7.1, are sharing this information to their Facebook spaces to further their particular \nGBR-related \u2018reality\u2019 (noting that there could be cases of oppositional sharing).   \nIndependent climate change denial blog Watts Up With That is ranked 2 1 by in-\ndegree (Table 7.6) . Also appearing  in Chapter 5, this alternative news outlet is ranked \nby MBFC as \u201c conspiracy -pseudoscience\u201d with \u201clow\u201d factual reporting, which includes \n\u201cpromoting consistent human -influenced climate denialism prop aganda\u201d ( MBFC, \n2022d)35. Watts Up With That  has also featured in other studies as a problematic \ninformation source ( Bloomfield  & Tillery ; Dunlap & McCright, 2011; Kirilenko and \nStepchenkova\u2019s, 2014) . It has a total of 6313 interactions (across four posts), which is \nnearly double the interactions of mainstream news outlets like the BBC (3675), and \nmore than double Nine Publishing\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald  and Australian public \nservice TV station SBS. Other independent blog -style news outlets that had higher \ninstances of their domain occurring were the Australian Independent Media Network  \n(theaimn.com), Pearls and Irritations Public Policy Journal  (johnmenadue.com), and \nEarth.org . This continues to raise in teresting questions about how these independent \noutlets engage with the more mainstream outlets in terms of amplification and \ndissemination of information flows.  \nThe other prominent nodes that are non -media actors are made up of a mix of \nenvironmental non -government organisations and advocacy groups like AMCS, Sea \nShepherd,  Global Warming Policy Forum, True Nature Foundation, Climate Council , \nClimate Action Australia , and Advance Australia  (number 14)  \u2013 an independent  lobby \ngroup that champions \u201cmainstream Australian values\u201d to \u201crestore the balance from \n \n \n35 In the examples MBFC cites of failed fact checks, the information about record high coral cover on \nthe Great Barrier Reef is incl uded, with this information featuring strongly throughout all three \nplatforms ( https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/watts -up-with-that/) \n \n150 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  \u201cwoke politicians and elitist activist groups\u201d  (Advance, 2022).  Industry organisations  \ninclude Academy of Management  (journals.aom.org ), Tourism Tropical North \nQueensland , Queensland Education Experiences , and Tourism Whitsundays.  There are \nalso political actors (greens.org.au), science  in the form of AIMS  (aims.gov.au), \ncharities or charitable platforms (petition website change.org, \ntherainforestsite.greatergood.com, action.hsi.org.au) and online service prov iders \n(imgflip.com, mailchimp.com, survey.confirmit.com.au, eventbrite.com), and a \nwebsite that publishes short stories (shortstorytown.com). In the mix is also the IUCN \n(iucn.org), which is the official advisor on nature to the UNESCO World Heritage \nCommittee (IUCN, 2022). \n7.2.6 Which news media actors received the most attention?  \nIn terms of media actors, freely available news outlet The Guardian\u2019s  domain \nhas the highest in -degree of all media outlets (200) and its links to its stories have \nsignificantly more interactions than the other domains at 24,111. When the overall \nactor list is condensed to show the top 10 media outlets ( Table 7.7) it is evident that it \nis largely dominated by Australian outlets (aside from the UK\u2019s BBC). These have a \nrelatively broad range of ownership by Australian standards, noting the country\u2019s \nsignificant news market concentration ( Papandrea  & Tiffen, 2016; Li dberg, 2019; \nBacon & Jegan, 2020 ). \nIn terms of the political stance of these media actors, 50 per cent of top 10 outlets \nare left-centre, according to MBFC . This includes theguardian.com, Australian public \nbroadcaster abc.net.au, Nine Publishing -owned smh. com.au ( Sydney Morning \nHerald), British public service broadcaster bbc.co.uk ( BBC), and Australian \nmulticultural public broadcaster sbs.com.au ( SBS). Thirty-per-cent of the outlets are \nclassified as right-centre, including New Corp\u2019s The Australian , which is Australia\u2019s \nnational daily newspaper with most of its content behind a paywall; the Australian \nFinancial Review , predominantly a newspaper owned by Nine Publishing ; and 7News, \na commercial TV station owned by Seven West Media . There was no data availabl e for \nThe New Daily  on MBFC, but it is an independent free online news provider (The New \nDaily, 2022). The Conversation  \u2013 a platform featuring academic content that is free to \nread and republish under creative commons \u2013 has been classified as \u2018 least biased\u2019, \nwhich reflects its aim to \u201cto provide access to quality explanatory journalism for \nhealthy democracy\u201d (The Conversation, 202 2). \n  \nChapter 7: Facebook Results  151  \nTable 7.7 \nTop 10 Domains \u2013 Media Only \n Domain name  In-degree  \nGroup  \nMedia actor type  Political stance  \n1 theguardian.com  200  \n188  \nMedia mainstream news  Left-Centre \n2 abc.net.au  69  \n192  \nMedia mainstream news  Left-Centre \n3 theconversation.com  29  \n188  \nMedia alternative news  Least Biased  \n4 smh.com.au  25  \n188  \nMedia mainstream news  Left-Centre \n5 thenewdaily.com.au  22  \n188  \nMedia alternative news  Data not available  \n6 theaustralian.com.au  21  \n212  \nMedia mainstream news  Right-Centre \n7 bbc.co.uk  20  \n367  \nMedia mainstream news  Centre-Left \n8 sbs.com.au  19  \n188  \nMedia mainstream news  Left-Centre \n9 afr.com 16  \n212  \nMedia mainstream news  Right-Centre \n10 7news.com.au  16  \n234  \nMedia mainstream news  Right-centre \nNote.

To obtain a broad picture, it was necessary to look at \ninformation shared via hyperlinks, plus the content directly posted or uploaded to the \nplatform itself to understand the prevalence of information  circulated in Facebook\u2019s \nsocial news media netwo rk. Table 7. 8 provides an overview about the nature of the \ncontent. \n  \n \n152 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  Table 7.8 \nFacebook Data Collection and Information Type Summary \n \nFacebook data collection  \n \nTotal number of posts (pages and groups)   \n4663 \nTotal number of interactions  464,886 \nTotal number of unique Facebook spaces  2430 (1862 pages, 568 groups)  \nTotal number of links (including internal)  4563 \nPosts without links  100 \nPost type: \u201cLinks\u201d (external)  2354 \nPost type: \u201cPhotos\u201d  1558 \nPost type: \u201cNative Video\u201d  493 \nPost type: \u201cStatus\u201d  95 \nPost type: \u201cVideo\u201d  87 \nPost type: \u201cYouTube\u201d  64 \nPost type: \u201cLive Video Complete\u201d  12 \nTotal number of unique links  3074 \nTotal number of unique domains  \n 619 \nNote. The top section of this table is repeated from Table 7.1 for ease.  \n \nA total of 4563 links were posted  and, of these, 3074 were unique. There were a \ntotal of 2354 external links. All but 100 of the 4663 posts had a hyperlink included, \nwhich captures both i nternal and external links. An example of an internal link is if a \npage or group uploaded a video ( \u2018Native Video \u2019) or included an image in the post, \nwhile external links are to sources of information outside of Facebook itself, for \nexample, to a news story  on another website. This metric is relevant for this study, \nnoting that 51.5 % \u2013 about half \u2013 of the posts contained external links.  \n \nTop 30 URLs  \nThe top 30 URLs shared by in -degree are shown in Table 7. 9. Media actors are \nmarked in yellow. This data is from the Facebook  spaces and URLs dataset and \nincludes the number of incoming ties to the link and the number of total interactions it \nreceived. Twenty out of the 30 links (66.6 %) are to content from media actors. In terms \nof the most frequently occurring links, stories from The Guardian  rank one, two and \nthree, and this source represents 40 % of all URLs in the top 30.

While \u2018conflict \nand strategy\u2019 is lower, \u2018publi c accountability and governance\u2019 remains a salient frame. \nThe \u2018scientific and technical uncertainty\u2019 frame is the strongest it has been across all \nthree global network s. These three instances all relate to Ridd and/or AIMS coral cover \nreport, which was the  subject of the scientist\u2019s column in The Australian . Ridd\u2019s \ncolumn was subsequently republished on Watts Up With That , the climate change \ndenial blog that ranks at number 2 1 in the top domains list in Part A. Watts Up With \nThat took the content from behin d a paywall to readily accessible and sharable. Mike \nHuckabee \u2013 a conservative US politician and former governor whose Facebook page \ndescribes him as \u201cthe host of \u2018Huckabee\u2019 on TBN, a Fox News  and Western Journal  \ncontributor\u201d \u2013 shared this content on his F acebook page (Table 7. 11, number 3 ). \nHowever, the platform has since put a content warning on the post (Figure 7. 3). This \nis an example of the social media platforms themselves playing a role in information \nflows, and can be considered a form of network p ower. Conservative lobby group \nAdvance Australia share d a link to their blog which uses the results from the AIMS \ncoral cover report and Ridd\u2019s assurances \u201cthe Reef is fine\u201d to counter \u201clies\u201d that \nQueensland industry is destroying the GBR (Table 7.11, numb er 7; Advance, n.d). One \nNation politician Pauline Hansen also invokes truth claims, saying that GBR science \nis \u201cdodgy\u201d and has damaged the economy, hashtagging Sky News Australia  \ncommentator Andrew Bolt and Ridd  in her post (Table 7.11, number 10).  \n \nFigure 7.3.

This group includes media actors \nThe Guardian , The Conversation , the Sydney Morning Herald , The New Daily , SBS, \nThe Age, The Australian Independent Media Network  (theaimn.com), Pearls and \nIrritations Public Policy Journal  (johnmenadue.com), Mongabay  (\u201cMongabay: News \nand Inspiration from Nature's Frontline \u201d, news.mongabay.com), news.com.au , the \nCanberra Times , Al Jazeera , Renew Economy , the Northern Territory News , The Hill \n(US policy and political news site), WA Today , Time Magazine , and Hawaii Public \nRadio, and The Shovel . These are generally left, centre-left and/or independent outlets, \nexcept for News Corp -owned news.com.au , which Media Bias Fact Check classifie s \nas right-centre, and the Northern Territory News  (ntnews.com.au), which is not in the \nMBFC database, but is also owned by News Corp and describes itself as \n\u201cunconventional, bold, unique and unashamedly Territorian\u201d  (NT News, 202 1). Also, \nThe Conversation  and The Hill were ranked \u2018 least biased\u2019 by MBFC  (see also Bruns \net al., 2021d; Faris et al., 2017) . Although Australian news site The Shovel  is openly \nsatirical, MBFC says \u201cmost stories mock the right\u201d ( MBFC, 2020).  \nThe next largest modularity group that  is evident in the top 100 actors table is \ngroup 212  (coloured orange in Figure 7. 4). Members of this cluster that are also \nprominent media actors by domain include The Australian , the Courier Mail , the \nAustralian Financial Review (AFR), the Spectator (Australia), the Epoch Times , the \nBrisbane Times , and 2GB Radio . The first t wo are owned by News Corp and are \nconsidered right-centre by MBFC. The Spectator is the Australian version of the \nBritish-based right-centre website and magazine ( MBFC, 2021b), and Nine Publishing \nowns the Brisbane Times , 2GB and the AFR . The AFR is right -centre (MBFC, 2022e) \nand, while the others  are not classified by MBFC, I would suggest the Brisbane Times  \nis centre-left and Sydne y-based talk back radio station 2GB is conservative due to \nsome of the views expressed by its outspoken presenters (Saxon, 2019). Unlike the \nothers, the Epoch Times  does not have an Australian base \u2013 the Epoch Media Group \n \n162 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  publishes across 35 countries acco rding to MBFC  (2022f) and its right-wing outlet is \nconnected to \u201cconspiracy theories, pseudoscience, propaganda, fake news, [and] failed \nfact checks\u201d, including pro -Trump conspiracy theories ( MBFC, 2022f). \n \nFigure 7.4. Domain nodes by in-degree range 1-1268, which removes Facebook (degree = 1269). \nNode colour = modularity class, size = in -degree. The labels are indicative and there are exceptions in \neach group.  \nFurther, examining the posi tioning of these actors  gives an indication of media \naffinity in the context of information sharing  (Figure 7.4 ). As noted earlier, the cluster \nof the largely left -centre media outlets can be seen in towards the bottom left in green, \nwhile this right and r ight-centre groups are in a distinctly separate cluster above. The \nexception is the Epoch Times , which despite being classed in the same modularity \ngroup, is sitting spatially removed. This could be because it, or the media outlets \naround it, were interact ing on an antagonistic basis, sharing an ideologically -opposed \nstory to counter its framing and narratives. It is interesting to note the other non -media \nnodes that feature in each cluster. In the left -wing media cluster there are state and \nfederal governm ent department domains, UNESCO and some environmental \nactivist/campaign websites. The right -wing media cluster includes climate change \ndenial blog Watts Up With That , the Global Warming Policy Forum (also Net Zero \n\n  \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  163 Watch),38 and \u2013 slightly lower \u2013 conservat ive advocacy group Advance Australia. ABC \nNews Australia  and some of the government domains, including AIMS, share the same \nmodularity group as these conservative groups, despite being spatially separate . This \ncould be due to the sharing of content antagon istically or strategically , for example, \nthe AIMS domain could appear due to the  coral cover report.  The cluster to the right \nof the graph is made up of two modularity classes and, from a media perspective, seems \nto represent more mainstream commercial out lets\u2019 domains, including 7News, The \nWest Australian , Yahoo News , and WION. The outlets towards the bottom right and \nalong the bottom of the graph appear to be largely international news outlets, including \nCNN, the Inquirer, Manila Standard , Bloomberg , China Daily  and the Washington \nPost, which is quite near the politically -left cluster.  \nThese relationships, including connections and disconnections , are explored \nfurther in Figure 7.5. Unlike the previous visualisation, it includes Facebook spaces \nand the connections to the domains. N odes are coloured by type (domains are green, \ngroups are orange and pages are purple)  and the strength of the connection is shown \nby the thickness of the edge. The Guardian  is an information source heavily shared by \nclimate action groups ( \u2018Climate Action Australia \u2019, \u2018Climate Action Launceston \u2019, \u2018Rise \nUp for Climate Action \u2019, \u2018Climate Crisis Queensland \u2019), plus other advocacy groups like \n\u2018We Loathe Dutton & Morrison\u2019 and \u2018Stop Evil Murdoch\u2019s Monopoly\u2019. Figure 7. 6 \nshows some of the connections to The Guardian  (>4 degree). In comparison, The \nAustralian  and Sky News Australia  domains have far less incoming ties, and these are \nfrom conservative advocacy groups like \u2018I\u2019ll Stand by Tony Abbott\u2019 and \u2018The Greens \nLittle Bag of Stupidity\u2019, along with the \u2018Australian Climate Sceptics Group \u2019. Figure \n7.7 shows some of the connections to The Australian  (>4 degree). An outlier is the \n\u2018Australian Greens politics, news and discussion \u2019 group, which shar ed some of The \nAustralian \u2019s content  antagonistically . As noted earlier, \u2018Flora 4 Fauna Australia \u2019 was \nthe first actor to sha re The Australian \u2019s breaking story to Facebook.  \nThese cluster  analyses highlight the role that advocacy groups \u2013 either motivated \nby political stance or attitudes to climate action and policy \u2013 play in further ing \ninformation that supports their network go als. This is significant noting the dominance \n \n \n38 As noted earlier, Net Zero Watch  was previously known as the Global Warming Policy Forum and \nrejects mainstream climate change science (https://www.desmog.com/2021/10/11/climate -science-\ndenial-group-rebrands-as-net-zero-watch/). \n \n164 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  of these actors as Facebook spaces in the network, and the centrality  of both Sky News \nAustralia and The Guardian  as content shares via their pages (which includes all \ncontent, not just external links), and The Guardian  also as a domain. Further, these \nclustering patterns are consistent with the media groupings found by Bruns et al ., \n(2021d), which considered media affinity in the context of The Conversation . \n \nFigure 7.5.

Strength of connection s is shown by edge thickness.  \n\n \n166 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results   \nFacebook spaces \u2013 URLs \nAnother way to visualise these relationships is through looking at the \ninformation that the most prominent Facebook spaces are sharing in the form of links, \nwhich is l argely to media information. Figure 7. 8 provides an overview of the \nFacebook spaces and URLs network. The labels have been removed from the graph \nfor clarity , the nodes are coloured by modularity class , and sized by degree . The most \nstriking insight is the comparatively disconnected and separate cluster at the top left. \nThis visualisation reflects the top 100 actors from the Facebook spaces data, with the \nlarger nodes  in the main cluster  being \u2018Fight for Our Reef\u2019, \u2018Federal I CAC Now !!!\u2019, \n\u2018Great Barrier Reef Legacy\u2019, \u2018Climate Action Australia\u2019 and The Guardian . Yet Sky \nNews Australia  is removed from the other top actors  \u2013 it is in the dark grey group  on \nthe left. The next visual will zoom in on this cluster  to explore the key actors and \ninformation sources . \n \n \nFigure 7.8. Facebook spaces and URLs, node colour by modularity, node size by degree.  \n\n  \nChapter 7:  Facebook Results  167  \n \nFigure 7.9. Facebook spaces -URLs, close-up of top left of graph . Filtered by a degree range >4, node \ncolour by type (URL = purple, group = orange, page = green) , size by degree.  \n\n \n168 Chapter 7:  Facebook Results  Figure 7.9, takes a closer look at the cluster that was spatially distant  from the \nmain group , towards the top  left (node colour now reflects node type) . By examining \nthe names of Facebook spaces and the URLs shared it is possible to see that this cluster \nappears ideologically different from the main cluster. Information sources  include Sky \nNews Australia , The Australian, climate sceptics the GWPF, Watts Up With That, and \nthe Spectator  and their associated content that uses AIMS\u2019 coral cover report to argue \nthe Reef has recovered. The pages and groups are right -wing politicians Katter\u2019s \nAustralia Party , George Christensen,  and Senator Matt hew Canavan (discussed \nabove); marine geophysicist  Peter Ridd ; conservative politics advocacy groups  \n(discussed above) ; and climate scepticism actors like \u2018Wake up to the Climate change \nhoax\u2019, \u2018Climate change is natural\u2019, and the \u2018Australian Climate Sceptics Group\u2019. These \nFacebook spaces are sharing the ideologically -aligned content that draws upon AIMS\u2019 \ncoral cover report to further the \u2018reality\u2019 that coral cover is at a record high, climate \nchange alarmists are overreacting, the science is flawed, and argue growth-limiting \npolicy is not needed .  \n \n7.5 CONCLUSION  \nThe dominance of the scientific and technical uncertainty frame and use of \nscience information to support certain actors\u2019 goals  is particularly salient within the \nFacebook element of the social news media network. The interactions in this network \nalso highlight the networked power  of advocacy and political actors in furthering \ninformation that reinforces their goals  (Figure 7.6; Figure 7.7). Another key finding \nwas the ongoing dominance of The Guardian  and News Corp as mainstream media \nactors (Table 7.4)  in the context of network -making power , yet they are spatially \ndistant in the network visualisations  and their information is being furthered  by \ndifferent actors  and in different ways . These information  flow dynamics are consistent \nwith Faris et al. (2017) who found an asymmetry between left and right  media \nconsumers , with progressive actors more likely to share mainstream sources, while \nconservatives paid more attention to partisan outlets.  The implications of these \nfindings will be further discussed in the next chapter.  \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  169 Chapter 8:  Discussion  \n The truth -telling capacities held by science are as much of a product of \ndiscursive battles as any other part of society. (Farkas & Schou, 2019, p. 27) \n \nThis chapter draws upon  the key findings from the results chapters to discuss \nhow power is asserted and contested in the social news media network in relation \nto environmental protection . I have understood  power in this \u2018news-making \nassemblage\u2019  as the ability to attract audience  attention (Chapter 3) . This could be in \nthe pursuit of profit -making, persuasion, or a mix of both to varying degrees. I have \nanalysed my data according to  Castells\u2019 four forms of n etwork power (Chapter 4) to \nconsider what actors and content are getting the most attention in the contemporary \ncommunication spaces of Twitter  (Chapter 5) , YouTube  (Chapter 6)  and Facebook  \n(Chapter 7) , and explore how these actors and information are positioning the \nprotection of the Great Barrier Reef. This included  examining the informational \ndynamics across clusters to see if and how these frames are  contested. This component  \nof the analysis \u2013 Part C \u2013 is where \u2018power over minds\u2019 is contested  in the for m of \nnetwork-making power. In this exchange, certain networks of actors seek to \u2018switch\u2019 \nthe \u2018program\u2019 of the network. In this case, the  program is the  \u2018reality\u2019 about the health \nof the GBR and the actions needed to ensure its ongoing protection. This \u2018reality\u2019 is \nsituated in  a broader ongoing discourse about climate change  and the values , actions \nand fundamental changes  needed to create a shared and sustainable  future. This \nanalysis also considered the interplay of certain actors in creating , furthering  and \ncontesting informational flows and  frames, including evaluating the centrality of  \nmainstream media  in these hybrid and dynamic news -sharing spaces.  \nThis research inquiry finds that power is asserted and contested in the social \nnews media ne twork through the use of attention -getting adversarial39 framing, the \n \n \n39 I use the word \u2018adversarial\u2019 to denote the conflict -provoking and often divisive nature of the three \nmost dominant frames. However, Karlberg (1997)  uses \u2018adversarial frames\u2019 to explore the way \nenvironmental issues are framed. While Karlberg\u2019s term is useful to this work, it is similar to Nisbet\u2019s \n(2009) \u2018conflic t and strategy\u2019 . Rather than risking conflating the two, my use of \u2018adversarial frames\u2019 is \nin its capacity as an umbrella term to group the three most salient frames I have found in this work.  \n \n170 Chapter 8: Discussion  problematic use of science , and the strategic interplay of mainstream media with \nalternative media  outlets, political actors and ideologically -aligned advoca tes that are \nfurthering information flows and frames in the interests of their network goals . \nEmerging from this is the finding that mainstream media continu e to play a central role \nin these communication networks in setting the frames and narratives, w ith this \ninformation  then disseminated by others to selectively further certain knowledge, \n\u2018reality\u2019 and interests . There is also evidence to support Konkes and Foxwell-Norton\u2019s \n(2021) argument that science is a social sphere in its own right that can co -create and \ncontribute to mediatised environmental conflict. These findings  and implications  are \ndiscussed in the sections below.   \n8.1 ADVERSARIAL  FRAMES  \nAs recognise d in Chapter 3 , frames are cultural material s embedded in the \nprocess of communication and help to shape meaning  (Castells, 2011b). While co -\nconstituted by sender and receiver, f rames are a logic used in hybrid media \nenvironments  to construct social realit y and exercise power (Chapter 2 ; Chapter 3 ). In \nthe instance of complex environmental issues like climate change and the protection \nof the GBR, the use of frames by media and other communicative actors in \ncontemporary communication spaces can help shape how an issue is understood  and \nwho might engage with it (Nisbet, 2009; Nisbet & Newman, 2015).  While differing in \nsalience across Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, t he sum of the dominant frames \nacross all three global networks shows that \u2018public accountability and governance\u2019  \n(11), \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 (11), and \u2018scientific and technical uncertainty\u2019  (5) were \nthe main lenses used across the six weeks to convey  the \u2018reality\u2019 of the GBR\u2019s health \nand the level of action required to ensure its protection.  \nA common ality of these frames is their adversarial nature, especially compared \nto the other interpreta tions available in Nisbet\u2019s framing typology for environmental \ndebates (2009) . While the full descriptions are available in Appendix D, other options \nincluded communicating the mediatised environmental conflict event through a social \nprogress perspective, which foregrounds solving problems or living in harmony with \nnature; highlighting a middle way, or alternative path between two conflict ing or \npolarised views; or framing the issue in terms of morality and ethics (this occurred \nonce in the global network , see Table 7.11 ; and once in the cluster analysis, see Table \n5.9), or economic opportunity. Instead , the three strongest frames deduced f rom the \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  171 data are adversarial to  varying degrees . This approach is consistent with media logic, \nnow understood as hybrid media logics (Chadwick et al., 2016; Chapter 3) to attract \naudience attention through conflict and drama (Aalberg et al., 2011), particu larly to \nencourage  audiences to engage in environmental issues that seem temporally and \nrelationally  remote from day-to-day life. In this sense, when the network goal is to \nachieve attention and a measure of this is the engagement a piece of content receiv es, \ninformational actors may deliberately or intuitively opt for these more adversarial \nframes. This was found in recent interviews conducted with GBR catchment -based \nmedia professionals , namely that commercial newsrooms  in particular  are often driven \nby click-through-rates, which can influence if and how narratives  are covered and \npositioned (Newlands et al., 2021) . Further, a s the time series graphs from all three \nnetworks show, the interest in the Reef as an issue peaked during the initial \nannouncement o f the \u2018in danger\u2019 recommendation, and dropped substantially until the \nWHC\u2019s decision created another smaller spike.  While it is not possible to determine \nthe exact cause from th ese data, it is fair to say that, true to hybrid media logics, the \nhealth and f uture of the Reef \u2013 and by extension climate change \u2013 attracts attention \nthrough mediatised environmental conflict.  \nHowever,  framing is also a way to define the terms of the debate , help to shape \npublic opinion (Nisbet & Newman, 2015) , and position \u2018reality\u2019 to meet the goals of \ncertain actors ( Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2008) . Therefore  the use of these frames also offers a \nwindow to understanding how \u2018power over minds\u2019 is being asserted about the health \nand protection of the GBR  in digital news -sharing spaces.  \nThe politicisation of the GBR is well-documented by scholars, with some noting \nit has become the \u201ccentrepiece in Australia\u2019s climate change politics \u201d (Konkes & \nFoxwell-Norton, 2021 , p. 471) and the prioritisation of mitigating reputational threats  \nhas sometimes occurred at the expense of its protection  (Foxwell-Norton & Lester, \n2017; Newlands, 2019 ; Morrison et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2021 ). This politicisation \nof the Reef is reflected in the results of this work, including through the frames and \nstances used to communicate information related to the \u2018in danger\u2019 listing threat . One \nof the two most  dominant frame s in all three global networks was  \u2018public \naccountability and governance\u2019 , which had two distinct and opposing narratives. \nFirstly, it was the \u2018reality\u2019 conveyed by the federal government in response to \nUNESCO\u2019s draft \u2018in danger\u2019 listing recommendation: that it had been \u201cblindsided\u201d, \n \n172 Chapter 8:  Discussion  was the victim of improper and unfair process and \u201cpolitics\u201d, and the proposed listing \nwas not based on the latest science  (DAWE, 2021c; DAWE, 2021d ). In the framing \nanalysis, this was the position reflected by Sky News Australia  (Chapter 6: Table 6.5, \nnumber 6, 9).  \nShifting the source of the blame to the procedural flaws of the recommendation \nand adopting a victim role  is an attempt by political actors to assert networking -making \npower by furthering frames that support the ir programmed goals: to maintain political \npower. Yet this tactic also directs attention away from the issue at hand : the health of \nthe GBR and whether enough is being done to protect it. This is situated in the broader \npolitical context of climate change  being the biggest threat to the Reef, which has been  \nacknowledged by the government\u2019s  scientific reports  (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park \nAuthority, 2019) , domestic science institutions  and the international scientific \ncommunity  (Dixon et al., 2022; Hughes et al., 2017; IPCC, 2022)  and recognised  by \nthe federal environment minister (Ley, 2021). Yet a potential \u2018in danger\u2019 listing does \nnot bode well politically. Scholars say this status  would make approvals for catchment -\nbased fossil fuel developments more challenging, and make it difficult to minimise \nnational climate commitments (Morrison, 2021; Morrison et al., 2020). This is \nproblematic given that Australia\u2019s  governing institutions and the Australian economy \nare still heavily committed to fossil fuels , despite their contribution to global warming , \nwith some attributing  this dissonance to inadequate climate policy action  (Bacon & \nJegan, 2020 ; Chubb, 2012; Holmes & Star, 2018; Tranter & Foxwell -Norton, 2021 ).  \nThe other key narrative in this frame foreground ed the Australian govern ment\u2019s \nblame shift as a political play . Mainstream m edia actors furthering this \u2018reality\u2019 \nincluded The Guardian , The Washington Post , and ABC News . Specific content \nincluded a story from The Guardian  about UNESCO rejecting Australia\u2019s claims about \nan unfair process (Table 5.6, number 6); ABC\u2019s Media Watch  critiquing the \ngovernment\u2019s blame shift ( Table 6.5, number 8), and The Washington Post  (Table 5.6, \nnumber 9) and UPI (Table 7.11, number 4) relaying the Australian government\u2019s \nclaims the draft recommendation was  politically motivated, but foregrounding  \nUNESCO\u2019s reasoning.  This was also the stance taken by satirical alternative news \noutlet The Betoota Advocate , which had two posts in Facebook\u2019s top 10 (Table 7.11, \nnumber 8, 9) that both used humo ur to suggest political actors were not doing enough \nto protect the Reef. Other actors and content implying  politics was being prioritised \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  173 over protection included advocacy group GetUp with a petition calling on the WHC \nto list the GBR as \u2018in danger\u2019 , calling for urgent action f rom the government to \u201ccut \nclimate pollution\u201d (Table 5.6, number 8) ; and Difference Frames the World \u2019s salient \nvideo with the translation  of a Chinese minister criticising Australia\u2019s politicisation  of \nthe issue (Table 6.5, number 1) . Discussing the implications of this type of framing in \nthe US context, Nisbet (2009) notes that it has \u201coutraged and intensified\u201d (p. 20) \nclimate action advocates, leading them to label climate sceptics as \u201cdeniers\u201d and attack \npolitical opponents (p. 20). Yet for other non -advocates, Nisbet (2009) says the \u2018public \naccountability and governance\u2019 frame can i ncite apathy, or even alienation. This is \npotentially problematic for those seeking to build understanding and \u201cwin hearts and \nminds\u201d (Anders, 2011, p. 8) about the actions and policies needed to protect the GBR.  \nAnother key frame across all three networks  was \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 , where \nthe issue was presented as a \u201cpower game among  elites\u201d (Nisbet & Newman, 2015, p. \n328). This attention-getting though  often-divisive tactic supports other findings about \nthe polarisation of climate discourse and reporting (Bacon & Jegan, 2020 ; Holmes & \nStar, 2018 ; Roper 2016 ). There was a main  narrative and counter narrative  within this , \nwith a couple of additional  conflict-centred stances. The main position  was the \nUNESCO \u2018in danger\u2019 recommendation was an attack on Australia by China. This \nangle was  taken by WION on YouTube (Table 6.5, number 3, 4) which was explicitly \ncritical of China for \u201cweaponising nature\u201d  to target Australia in \u201cvendetta politics\u201d \n(Table 6.6, number 4) .  This angle was also consistently pursued by News Corp , which \ncalled the recommendation China\u2019s \u201clatest shot\u201d in its \u201cvictimisation of Australia\u201d \n(Table 6.5, number 5). The decision not to list the GBR as \u2018in danger\u2019 was presented \nas a \u201cmajor loss for the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] \u201d (Table 6.5, number 2), and \nengaged game tropes like a scorecard . This positioning  was also heavily echoed by \nright-wing politicians, either in Sky News Australia  interviews, or via the  political \nelites\u2019 own social media accounts, for instance Matthew Canavan, Pauline Hansen and \nBob Katter\u2019s Facebook pages  (Table 7.11). This included nods back to News Corp , \nincluding hashtagging controversial Sky News Australia  commentator  and The \nAustralian opinion columnist  Andrew Bolt (Table 7.11, number 10; see also Bacon & \nJegan, 2020).   \nFurther, w hile The Australian \u2019s breaking story that positioned the \nrecommendation in the context of \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 (dominant frame) and \u2018public \n \n174 Chapter 8:  Discussion  accountabili ty and governance\u2019 was not ranked as a top 10 attention -getting \ninformation  source in any of the global networks, it was in the top 10 list for the Group \n2 cluster on Twitter (Table 5. 9) and appeared within the top 30 list on Facebook (Table \n7.10), and also set the tone for other news reports internationally. Captured in the \nYouTube data was a video from ABC\u2019s Media Watch  questioning the way some \nmainstream news outlets had uncritically run with th ese original frame s that focused \non the WHC/China conflic t and the Australian government\u2019s claims of unfair process  \n(Table 6.5, number 8). \nThe Guardian  also engaged \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 as a frame, but rather than \npositioning the  conflict as an attack by China, it focused on the Australian \ngovernment\u2019s confli ct with UNESCO and the strategies and games involved in \nlobbying other  WHC countries for support. Two of these stories were particularly \ndominant  across Twitter: One was about the government \u201chaving the numbers\u201d to stop \nthe listing  (Table 5.6, number 2) , and the other reported the decision not to list the Reef \nas \u2018in danger\u2019, saying UNESCO\u2019s recommendation was \u201cignored\u201d and the inclusion \nof an early quote called it a \u201cvictory for cynical lobbying\u201d  (Table 5.6, number 3). In a \nmuch lesser sense, \u2018conflict and  strategy\u2019 was also represented in the results by a \npolitical-environment group conflict narrative. Examples of this include d the \u2018in \ndanger\u2019 recommendation being part of a \u201cglobal green conspiracy\u201d ( Table 6.5, number \n10), or environment groups being quoted in opposition to the government,  siding with \nUNESCO  (Table 5.6, number 10). As noted earlier, conflict-focused framing reflects \nhybrid news media logic s. While effective at gaining attention in the news -sharing \nnetworks, using partisan and divisive tactics in certain conflict angles has the potential \nto be polarising (Faris et al., 2017), which could  be problematic for GBR pro tection. \nThough this lens can be empowering by voicing concerns from both sides , an overtly \npartisan focus on conflict rather than the issue could be delegitimising  to international \ncalls for climate action  and act as a barrier to productive public discussion  about \ntransitioning to sustainable energy sources. Particularly when this call to \u201cpartisan \nsocial identities\u201d (Levendusky, 2013, p. 567) encourage s publics to take sides , or get \ncaught up in distracting side issues while potential threats to the GBR are sidelined .  \nThe third key frame was \u2018scientific and technical uncertainty\u2019. At a global \nnetwork level, this frame was the most dominant position on Facebook, yet on \nYouTube and Twitter it was also important in the sense that information flows  \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  175 questioning GBR and climate science  emerged strongly as counter narratives to pro-\nenvironmental protection. This finding emerged in Part C of Chapter 5 and 7 in \nparticular  when Castells\u2019 most crucial element in his network theory of powe r was \nattempted  by some actors : network -making power. This is further discussed below as \nthis use of science to attempt to switch the \u2018reality\u2019 of the GBR\u2019s health and associated \nprotection  proved to be a key way to assert and contest power in digital news -sharing \nspaces. The frame of scientific and technical uncertainty was represented by the \nnarrative that \u2018the science \u2019 being used to inform GBR policy is flawed or obfuscated \nby lies (Table 5.6, number 7; Table 7.11, number 3, 7, 10 ). This included claims  that \nthe GBR is actually in \u201cextremely good condition\u201d (Table 6.5, number 7) with the site \nbeing the victim of \u201cextinction  alarmism\u201d (Table 7.11, number 10).  \nThis well -worn frame and associated tactics of using doubt to stifle climat e \nchange awareness, support for change , and the implementation  of less anthropocentric \npolicy has been extensively captured by scholars over decades ( Jacques, 2006;  \nCeccarelli, 2011; Dunlap & McCright, 2011 ; Goldberg & Vandenberg, 2021 ; Nisbet, \n2009; Oreskes & Conway, 201 0). The strategic  \u2018manufacturing\u2019 of scientific \nuncertainty aligns with economic goals and logics that support an ongoing social \nlicence for extractive and exploitative industries to operate with minimal  government \ninterference, or restriction in growth and profit  (Oreskes & Conway, 201 0; Ceccarelli, \n2011). Namely, if the science is wrong, or the threat is exaggerated, then there is no \nneed to change behaviours or activities. As Jacques (2006) notes: \u201cenvironmental \nscepticism defends the structure of dominant social values in world politics, such as \nthe state system, expansive resource exploitation under world capitalism, and  a \nhegemonic and consumptive North\u2026\u201d (p. 95). Hutchins and Lester discuss this value \nof economic growth at all costs using Anthony Giddens\u2019 (2009) term, \u2018productivism\u2019 : \n\u201ca stress upon economic growth as a prime economic value \u201d (Hutchins & Lester, 2015, \np. 342). They note that the dominance and political influence of those who champion \nproductivism is secured by the interests of those who seek to benefit the most from \nthis capital, including mining companies, pollution -generating industries, property \ndevelopers and other exploitative ventures . This of course includes those who mutually \ngain from being interconnected to this economically -focused network, which includes \nmedia and  the sphere of science.  \n \n176 Chapter 8:  Discussion  Notably, all instances of this frame across  the three netw orks relate to either Ridd \nor AIMS\u2019 coral cover report, or both. In these instances, \u2018the science\u2019 about the Reef\u2019s \nhealth was selectively framed and subject to both political and hybrid news media \nlogics. The problematic use of science  is further discussed below ( Section 8.2), \nincluding how it is engaged to support the interests of certain actors who \u201ccreate, tap \nand steer information flows in ways that suit their goals\u201d (Chadwick et al., 2016, p. 4), \nwhich includes furthering  their \u2018realities\u2019 about the health of the GBR. Firstly, a \nlimitation must be noted w hen considering how adversarial frames have been used to \nassert and contest power in these networks . As highlighted in Chapter 3, this study \ndoes not consider other ways that these frames could be furthered, including by the \naffordances of platforms themselves. As it is out of scope, t he framing analysis also \ndoes not account for  the response of \u2018produsers\u2019 (Bruns, 2008) in these spaces to \ninvestigate  how power is contested via the a cceptance or countering of these \npositionings.  Of course , this would also need to take into account that there are many \nother factors at play in shaping meaning (Chapter 2).  \n8.2 PROBLEMATIC USE  OF SCIENCE  \nAnother way that power was asserted and contested  in the social news media \nnetwork was via the problematic use of science, which includes its strategic use beyond \nthe \u2018technical and scientific uncertainty\u2019 framing; namely, its mediatisation and \npoliticisation. The AIMS coral cover report was salient across  all three platforms and \ncentral to the contestation of Great Barrier Reef -related \u2018reality\u2019  in the way its findings \nwere framed and used to support certain actors and their goals and logics . Throughout \nthe social news media network there was an  interplay between politics, media \n(mainstream and alternative), advocacy groups and the sphere of science  in an attempt \nto exercise networked power and network -making power  by framing, reframing and \nfurthering scientific information to  reinforce or challenge programmed  goals. \nAs discussed in Chapter 1 , AIMS\u2019 coral cover report was released at the start of \nthe week of the WHC decision  (July 19, 2021) . Accompany ing the report\u2019s publication  \nwere two media release s: one from the federal environment minister, and another from \nthe science agency itself. The messages of these media releases are largely consistent, \nsaying that coral recovery across the GBR had been widespread due to a respite from \nweather events , but they have different nuances. The minister\u2019s release  notes the ability \nfor the GBR to adapt and recover when facing favourable conditions  and highlights \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  177 how the proposed \u2018in danger\u2019 listing had not been based on the \u201clatest information \u201d \n(DAWE, 2021d). The AIMS  version describes the increase as  a \u201crecovery window\u201d \nand notes there are limits to the GBR\u2019s resilience  (AIMS, 2021b) . It also foreground s \nthat the high rates of coral cover were largely driven by a coral species that was \u201cfast \nto grow\u201d, but \u201coften the first to go\u201d  (AIMS, 2021 b). Furthermore, in September 2021 , \nABC News published the outcome of a Freedom of Information (FoI) investigation, \nwhich showed the minister\u2019s office had pressured AIMS, as its science agency, to \nspeed up the release of the coral cover report ahead of the WHC vote (Slezak, 2021) . \nAccording to ABC News\u2019 report, the government also planned a  \u201cpre-targeted release\u201d \nor \u201cleak\u201d of the information to News Corp\u2019s The Australian  and The Courier Mail . \nThese informational threads and actor interactions  reinforce the politicisation of the \nGBR\u2019s protection  (see above; Foxwell -Norton & Konkes, 2018; Morrison et al., 2020) , \nbut also highlight the politicisation of the science  informing policy . Moreover , by \npulling on these threads across the social news media network, it provides useful \ninsights into the interpla ys involved in the politicisation and mediatisation of  science \nused to inform GBR policy.  In this particular case study, this includes  how the AIMS \ncoral cover report  \u2013 a tangible example of \u2018the science \u2019 \u2013 was strategically  framed, \nreframed and furthered by certain actors to assert and contest power in the social news \nmedia network  in pursuit of their goals .  \nInformational flows about the coral cover report and/or Ridd\u2019s interpretation of \nthe GBR\u2019s recovery were \u2018tapped\u2019 and \u2018steered\u2019 (Chadwick et al., 2016) in different \nways across the three platforms . Yet a common tactic seen across Twitter and \nFacebook was that ideologically -aligned alternativ e media actors and certain non -\nmedia actors , including advocates and political actors,  were able to repurpose  and/or \namplify content from mainstream media to further messages about the health of the \nReef that aligned with their goals . In this sense mainstream media continue to  have a \ncentral role as information sources and  frame-setters in these online spaces , but this \ninformation is  then co-opted by certain actors for their own means  (Section 8.3) . \nYouTube  was different in that  mainstream news outle t Sky News Australia  was a \nsuper-node in this space and drew upon adversarial  framing and countering GBR and \nclimate consensus science to further capitalise on this attention, a finding reflected in  \nother studies (Arsenault & Castells, 2008; Bacon & Jegan,  2020; Copland et al., 2021 ). \nIn this case  study, Sky News Australia  foregrounded  Ridd, a contrarian scientist \n \n178 Chapter 8:  Discussion  associated with the climate sceptic conservative thinktank the IPA  (Dunlap & \nMcCright, 2011) , who conveyed an alternative scientific \u2018reality\u2019 that echoed the \nmedia and advocacy actors\u2019  neoliberal  productivism  views. This \u2018reality\u2019 was then \nreinforced with conservative political voices  that share d the same economic  \ndevelopment  and free-market values. The interplay of these particular actors, \ninformation flows , frames and tactics  (Chapters 5-7) are straight from the \n\u2018manufacturing \u2019 scientific doubt playbook ( Ceccarelli, 2011; Dunlap & McCright , \n2011; Oreskes & Conway, 2010 ). This finding is significant and is fu rther discussed \nlater in this section.  \nThe coral cover  report\u2019s initial release  was covered by news organisations , \nincluding by The Australian , The Guardian  and ABC News, but did not receive \nsignificant attention  as shown by its absence from the dominant information sources \nin Chapters 5 , 6 and 7. On Friday, July 23, 2021 \u2013 the day of the WHC decision  \u2013 The \nAustralian  published a column from Ridd, which was headlined, \u201cScience and media \ndoomsayers ignore good news on reef\u201d ( Ridd, 2021). This opinion column  discussed \nthe report and data as \u201cgood news\u201d , with the record high result \u201cdespite all the doom \nstories by our reef science and management institutions\u201d . It went on to  say, \u201cRecord \ncoral cover means there was no disaster on the reef. The only disaster is the quality \nassurance at the science organisations\u201d  (Ridd, 2021). \n This content was behind a paywall  \u2013 an act of network power \u2013 however, several \nalternative media outlets  known to be climate change scepticism  advocates  re-\npublished the column, or commentary about the content of the column or the marine \ngeophysicist\u2019s views on their online platforms, including Climatism , Watts Up With \nThat, ZeroHedge, Climate Change  Dispatch, and JoNova (joannenova.com.au) ; plus \nclimate sceptic ism advocacy groups like Net Zero Watch/GWPF and Advance \nAustralia. These links were shared on Twitter and Facebook, which are shown and \ndiscussed in Chapters 5 and 7. Ridd was also interviewed on Sky News Australia , with \nthe story published  to its YouTube  channel (Table 6.5, number 7) . Within the Twitter \nand Facebook ne tworks, the informational flows about the GBR being recovered and \nscience being flawed are  largely disconnected  from the main component in the \nnetworks (Figure 5.4; Figure 7.8)40.  \n \n \n40 These network visualisations were produced using the same clu stering and layout algorithms.  \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  179 In the case of Twitter , the re-publishing of Ridd\u2019s opinion column from The \nAustralian  on alternative news sites , and subsequent sharing of this content on the \nsocial media platform , proved to be a central way for climate change scepticism \nadvocates to contest the otherwise dominant information sources and narratives in this \nnetwork. Namely, the largest subnetwork (Group 2)  was dominated with coral cover \nreport-related information,  with claims that the GBR\u2019s health is fine and the science is \nflawed present in 70% of the most dominant sources  in this cluster  (Table 5.9) . The \nkey actors in this group included information sources that have been flagged as \nproblematic by independent outlets like Media Bias Fact Check for the nature of the \ncontent, or \u2013 in the case of Climatism  \u2013 Twitter exercised network power and banned \nthe account for its problematic information. Some of these alternative media actors are \nlong recognised as  \u201cvital\u201d cogs in the  \u201cdenial machine\u201d (Dunlap  & McCright , 2011, p. \n153), including Watts Up With That, Climateaudit.org41 and Marc Morano\u2019s \nClimatedepot.co m42, which is heavily supported by US conservative politic al actors \nand thinktanks (Dunlap & McCright, 2011).  This cluster also included Nationals \nSenator Matthew Canavan, who se views about the GBR being \u201cfully recovered\u201d  and \neconomic -limiting protection measures being un warranted , were also  threaded through \nFacebook and YouTube and appeared in the most attention -getting content.   \nWhile the network visualisation of  YouTube  showed more of a \u2018hub and spoke \u2019 \ntypology with activity arranged around key information sources ( Figure 6.3; Smith et \nal., 2014) , the problematic use of science occurred mainly through Sky News Australia , \nwhich interviewed Ridd about the coral cover report, yet did not conduct any \ninterviews with other sc ientists, from AIMS or otherwise43. This story  was published \nto its YouTube channel with the title: \u201cData \u2018unequivocally\u2019 shows Great Barrier Reef \nis in \u2018extremely good condition \u2019\u201d (Table 6.6, number 4) . The minimal use of scientists \nin stories is reflecte d in Bacon and Jegan\u2019s (2020) research into four News Corp \nmastheads , finding that very little attention was paid to climate scientists and \nacademics, who made  up just 6% of the sample (p. 71). Those who were quoted \n \n \n41 Not in top 10 in Group 2 so not mentioned in Chapter 5, but number 1723 in G2.  \n42 As above, number 23 in G2.  \n43 It is of course possible that interview requests were made to other scientists, but were declined. \nHowever, there  is a very limited range of scientific sources engaged with by this outlet  (Bacon & \nJegan, 2020) . Also, climate scientists have refused to engage with The Australian  in the past, due to its \novert climate scepticism (McKight, 2013, p. 225).  \n \n180 Chapter 8:  Discussion  included \u201cwell -known sceptics or individuals on the fringes of climate science\u201d (p. \n73). One of the sources they identify is Ridd, who is positioned as a free speech \nchampion, worthy of exposure, while the vast majority (99%) of scientists who align \nwith the consensus  remain absent . Sky News Australia  also conducted interviews that \nincluded mentions of the report, including an interview with Nationals Senator \nMatthew Canavan where he  was critical of the Queensland and Federal government \nreports that have \u201ct he most doomsaying, exaggerated threats about the Reef\u201d, and sa id \n\u201cthe coral is back to record levels\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s all fine\u201d  (Table 6.6, number 9 ). This \nfinding is again consistent with Bacon and Jegan (2020) who say News Corp is twice \nas likely to quote a p olitician than a scientist in a story about climate science (p. 71).   \nThe framing and use of the coral cover report as evidence that the GBR\u2019s health \nwas \u201cfine\u201d and climate change action was not required was also salient on Facebook  \n(Chapter 7) . As a domai n, aims.gov.au was number 96 in the top domains list (out of \n619) showing that the report itself generated interest, which is also evidenced  in the \ntop 10 content items . The coral cover report is used in three of these posts to argue that \nthe GBR had recovered . Further, a s noted earlier (Figure 7.9 ), these information flows \nwere largely confined to a subnetwork away from the main network activity, and saw \nclimate change scepticism  advocacy actors like the \u2018Australian Climate Sceptics \nGroup\u2019, \u2018Climate change is natural \u2019, and \u2018Supporting Conservatives in Queensland \u2019, \nalong with right -wing politicians Katter\u2019s Australia Party, George Christensen, and \nSenator Matt hew Canavan, sharing information from The Australian , Watts Up With \nThat, The Spectator , GWPF/Net Zero Watch, and the blog of conservative  advocacy  \ngroup Advance Australia , which all touted the recovery of the GBR. \nThe problematic use  of science as outlined in this section is significant for two \nkey reasons in the context of this research. Firstly, through forensically tracking the \ninformation flows associated with AIMS\u2019 coral cover report , interactions are made \nclear between actors th at have been identified  in existing scholarly work  as key agents \nin \u2018manufacturing \u2019 and furthering scientific uncertainty to undermine  growth-limiting \nclimate policy  (Dunlap & McCright, 2011; Miller & Dinan, 2015; Oreskes & Conway, \n2010; Taylor, 2014) . This has worked in the United States, but Dunlap  and McCright \n(2011) note that the \u201cdenial machine\u201d  (p. 144) has spread to other nations with \nconservative governments and established  conservative thinktanks, like Australia and \nthe UK. They document the impact  of the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA)  on \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  181 Australian climate policy, and express concerns for the \u201cglobalization of organized \nclimate change denial\u201d and the international  impact on constraining  the ability of \npolicy-making to deal with \u201cthe reality of c limate change\u201d (Dunlap & McCright, 2011, \np. 156). This study offers an insight into how the actors driving the climate change \n\u201cdenial machine \u201d (p. 144)  in Australia are contesting  power in these key \ncommunication spaces , which is particularly relevant given that scholars have already \nobserved how domestic climate policy has been stifled by such interactions ( Chubb, \n2012; Holmes & Star, 2018).  \nSecondly, these findings empirically support Konkes and Foxwell -Norton\u2019s \n(2021) argument that science is the fifth sphere in mediatised environmental conflict  \ndue to its ability to enact and engage in power struggles  with other spheres of action . \nThis verification is significant  because, as noted by the authors, the role of scientist s \nas actors in the mediatisation of science communication contributes to the \u201cvexed \npolarisation of debate about climate change\u201d (p. 471). This finding also poses \nimportant questions about the role of scientists in these polycentric communication \nspaces. N amely, does this mean that scientists should stay out of public debate \naltogether  to avoid confusion ? Or not voice any concerns that run counter to the \nconsensus? As de Melo -Martin and Intemann (2013)  highlight, th is silencing of dissent  \ncould be equally a s problematic and damaging, particularly if it limits the opportunity \nto correct strategic framing and problematic use of science ( Holst & Molander, 2017 ; \nDriscoll et al., 2020 a; Driscoll et al., 2020b ). This raises the question about how \nchallenges to sci entific information should be addressed in a way that fosters the \ncreation of the best -available science and fit -for-purpose and effective environmental \npolicy (Ceccarelli, 2011; Douglas, 2009) . Though equally, if not more pressingly, it \ncalls for public education about science and hybrid media logics and tactics  (Chadwick \net al., 2016) . This would empower embedded members of these news -sharing spaces \n\u2013 the \u2018produsers\u2019  \u2013 in the shaping of their knowledge assemblages. This idea is \ndiscussed further i n Chapter 9.  \n8.3 INTERPLAY OF MAINSTREAM MEDIA WITH OTHER ACTORS \nThe dominance of mainstream media actors in relation to alternative news media \nactors and the interplays with other \u2018networks of operatives\u2019 (Cottle, 2013) embedded \nin these dynamic information s paces works slightly differently across all three \nnetworks. A common thread is the dominance of both The Guardian  and News Corp -\n \n182 Chapter 8:  Discussion owned media outlets as information sources, although these information flows are \nfurthered by different actors in different ways  to assert and contest power within the \nsocial news media network .  \nAn online -only outlet in the Australian context with a number of different spin -\noff publications including The Guardian , The Guardian Australia  and Guardian \nEnvironment , this actor\u2019s  dominance was evident across both Twitter and Facebook, \nand it was present \u2013 albeit far less dominant  \u2013 in the YouTube network. The attention -\ngetting capacity of The Guardian  as an information source  is shown in Chapters 5 and \n7. This mainstream media outlet\u2019s key role in the social news media network  is \nhighlighted  by the attention generated by its embedded journalists  and other \ncontributors ; its prevalence as an information source  in the form of URL s and its \ndomain; and the salience of its frames . This is consistent with findings from Kirilenko \nand Stepchenkova (2014) , Newman (2017) , and Mitchell and Roffey -Mitchell (2018) . \nFaris et al. (2017) also identified The Guardian  as a popular source for progressive \n\u2018produsers\u2019 (Bruns, 2008) of Twitter in particular, and Facebook . \nHowever, another key mainstream media actor is perhaps equally as central, but \nthe way its information flows unfold presents a far more complex picture in these \nhybrid news -sharing spaces. This actor is News Corp, which has several different \nforms of media outlets under its banner from traditional print, to broadcast, to online ; \nthough the logics of contemporary communication environments have largely turn ed \nthese information  sources into hybrid resources . For instance, a col umn that is \npublished in The Australian \u2019s print newspaper  is also posted online behind a paywall, \nor a segment is aired on Sky News Australia  and published to YouTube  for audiences \nto access for free . News Corp also promotes its content and actors across p latforms to \nfurther the reach of its content . For example , it will have a Sky News Australia  \npresenter as a columnist in The Australian , or the newspaper\u2019s environmental editor \ncould be interviewed as a source in a television  segment, as seen in Chapter 6  (see also \nBacon & Jegan, 2020) . \nConsidering  the top 100 actors list on Twitter  (Table 5.2) , News Corp has \nseemingly minimal dominance  in this digital space . Sky News Australia  appears at \nnumber 82 and \u2013 despite having broken the story about the UNESCO recommendation \n\u2013 The Australian  is not even in the top 100 list, although does rank number 25 in the \ntop 30 domains list.  However, through the subnetwork analysis it became clear that \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  183 News Corp\u2019s information and frames were indeed generating attention within the \nnetwork, due to the re -publication and amplification by alternative news outlets  \nadvocating for reef science and climate change scepticism . These information flows \nwere furthered by other advocate and political actors who shared these views . \nCrucially, t hese alternative news outlets received more attention as domains than the \nmainstream news outlet that originally published the content , yet via these \ndecentralised flows, the  News Corp -driven \u2018reality\u2019 still captu red attention.  \nConversely, News Corp has a  more obviously dominant presence within the \nYouTube element of the social news media network, which is generated from the \nvolume of interactions with the Sky News Australia content. In this network it is the \nmost attention -getting actor and information source by far. While a systematic ana lysis \nof the video comments was out of scope , anecdotally , many appear to be advers arial, \nwhich has been suggested to be part of Sky News Australia\u2019s  digital business strategy \nand requires further investigation ( Bacon & Jegan, 2020; Copland et al., 2021).  For \ninstance, the channel has attracted nearly one million additional subscribers in the \ncourse of a year: 1.42 million in April 2021 (Copland et al, 2021) compared to 2.37 \nmillion in April 2022 . This contrasts with the ABC\u2019s 1.6 million,  which experienced a \nmuch smaller increase from its 1.32 million subscribers in April 2021 (Copland et al., \n2021). Considering the dynamics of Sky News Australia\u2019s  audience as outlined in \nChapter 2, the potential footprint of  this mainstream and interconnected media actor  is \nof interest  in the context of environmental policy discourses and are further explored \nin Section 8.4. \nOn Facebook, the informational authority is  less immediately evident  due to the \naffordances of the platform and the available data. Specifically, it would be misleading  \nto look at URLs and domains alone in this network, as Sky News Australia\u2019s  content \nin particular appears in several different formats , including  links to its website, but also \nto videos on YouTube and content uploaded directly to its page  as \u2018native videos\u2019. Yet \nthe dominance of  Sky News Australia  can be seen by the volume of co ntent it shares \nto its Facebook page (ranking it on a similar level to The Guardian ), and via the \nprevalence  of The Australian\u2019s  domain at number 7 on the top 100 actors list  (Table \n7.6). Also, while it does not have dominance as a URL, its content achieve s salience \nvia amplification by ideologically -aligned actors . Namely, posts made by conservative \npartisan politicians like George Christensen and Matthew Canavan that feature links \n \n184 Chapter 8:  Discussion  to The Australian\u2019s  information received some of the highest engagement lev els in the \nFacebook network  (Table 7.10)44. This is also the case for Advance Australia  and New \nCorp\u2019s Fox News  contributor Mike Huckabee who link to content that has Ridd\u2019s  \nframing of the report, including alternative media actor Watts Up With That . These \nposts are attention -getting, ranking in  the top 10 list for engagement  (Table 7.11). Of \ncourse, another indicator of News Corp\u2019s dominance is the point made earlier about \nother mainstream and alternative news outlets all over the world adopting similar \nframing, or at least using the Australian government\u2019s \u2018blindsiding\u2019 or China\u2019s \n\u2018victimisation\u2019 of Australia  as a hook into their reporting.  \nIn summary, mainstream media remain a dominant source of information in the \nsocial news media network, especially in the ability to set  certain frames, while the \nsteering of information flows relies on the dynamic interplay of embedded actors  who \nchannel the framed content  to suit their goals . In the case of News Corp  in particular , \nthese online information flows are impacted by a range of diverse and decentralised \nalternative news and partisan actors who are furthering these information sources and \nframes in ways that make use of the hybrid media logics of the social news network. \nThese findings are consistent with Faris et al. (2017) who studied US politics  on \nTwitter and Facebook and found that there were different traditions and logics \nassociated with le ft and right-learning media outlets. Namely,  that liberal audiences \ngravitate towards more established media organisations that reflect traditional \njournalistic norms, while conservatives pay more attention to highly partisan media \noutlets. \nWhile this interplay is another way that power is asserted and contested in the \nsocial news media network, this finding also has broader implications for discussions \nabout media power and regulation . Namely, arguments that Australia\u2019s concentrated \nmedia ow nership is less problematic in the context of decentrali sed digital platforms  \n(Environment & Communications References Committee,  2021). As these results \nindicate, there may be a plurality of voices , yet in the context of environmental \nprotection , mainstream media and political elites still play a central role in the contests \nof \u2018power over minds \u2019. However, the important question  \u2018to which degree ?\u2019 cannot be \n \n \n44 Some of the UR Ls in the posts are not visible as they were cut when the text was shortened due to \nspace constraints, but the full text is in Appendix I.  \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  185 answered in this work, as this would require examination of \u2018produsers\u2019\u2019 (Bruns, 2008) \nresponses to this information . This would help to understand  if these attempts to win \n\u2018hearts and minds \u2019 (Hansen, 2011 ) are gaining traction  to challenge this agenda setting \nand framing , and if network-making power is being enacted . Regardless, it highlights \nan important area for further investigation.  \n8.4 NEWS CORP\u2019S NETWORKED AND NETWORK -MAKING POWER  \nThe finding about News Corp\u2019s continued centrality as a media actor is also \nsignificant in the context of previous  work \u2013 both scholarly and non-scholarly \u2013 that \nhas examined its power as a multimedia corporate actor, and its role in the \npoliticisation and mediatisation of science ; in particular, climate science  and policy  \n(Arsenault & Castells, 2008; Bacon, 2013; Bacon & Jegan, 2020; Blaine, 2019; Chubb, \n2012; Manne, 2 011; McGaur & Lester, 2013; McKnight, 201 0; McKnight, 2012; \nNewlands, 2020) . Holmes and Star (2018) say it is not possible to understand climate \nchange communication in Australia without considering the interplay of the fossil fuel \nindustry, politics and mainstream media, s tating: \u201cAustralia offers a lesson on how a \ndysfunctional relationship between a country\u2019s media, its political culture and its \nscientific institutions can seriously impede progress on climate action\u201d (p. 153). They \nnote polarisation in media reporting emerged in the early 2000s, with left -wing media \naccepting the scientific consensus and reporting accordingly on impacts and potential \nsolutions, while some tabloid press and commercial broadcasters either avoided the \ntopic, or have been \u201cstridently hostile\u201d (p. 153). News Corp has been especially \ncomplicit in this (Bacon, 2013; Bacon & Jegan, 2020; Holmes & Star, 2018;  \nMcKnight, 201 0), questioning the science itself and politicising climate change policy.  \nIn particular, Manne notes The Australian  has been a \u201ctireless defender of the \ncoal industry\u201d (p. 45), has attacked and  villainised environmentalists and the \nAustralian Greens, and has \u201cconducted a prolonged and intellectually incoherent \ncampaign against action on climate chang e, which has undermined the hold in public \nlife of the central values of the Enlightenment, Science and Reason\u201d (p. 113). He goes \non to note this has made it difficult for the government to take action on climate \nchange.  \nYet News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch has repeatedly rebuked accusations of  \n\u2018climate denialists\u2019 at his company , most recently  in 2019 and 2020  (Bacon & Jegan, \n \n186 Chapter 8:  Discussion  2020. p. 6 ), and he announced in October 2021 that  News Corp  supported the \nAustralian Government\u2019s pledge to reach net -zero emissions by 2050 ( Environment & \nCommunications References Committee , 2021, p. xiii ; Mocatta, 2021 ). However, as \nnoted by McKnight  (2012), Murdoch made this same commitment in 2007 , which \nproved to be a fleeting venture, the media company soon returning to  its role as a \n\u201cplatform for climate scepticism\u201d (p. 229). Recent studies show that the reporting itself \nis far less problematic than the opinion columns , with Bacon and Jegan finding in their \n2020 study of four News Corp mastheads that two -thirds of the c limate-related content \nwas in the format of opinion and , of those, two-thirds presented sceptical views of \nclimate change and the related  science. They also found that the content of these \nopinion pieces w as amplified across News Corp\u2019s other platforms, in cluding Sky News \nAustralia, with these partisan tactics used to drive attention  and create \u201can impression \nthat readers [or audiences] are being mobilised to defend assaults on their ideas and \nvalues\u201d (Bacon & Jegan, 2020, p. 43 ; see also Bacon, 2013; Holmes & Star, 2018; \nManne, 2011 ). As noted earlier, this can be part of selling advertising to specialised \nmarkets: \u201csensationalism sells\u201d  (Arsenault & Castells, 2008). Some of these key \nscepticism-advocating  commentators  appeared throughout my findings, including Peta \nCredlin, Andrew Bolt and Chris Kenny.  \nBut how much power does News Corp have? While it controls 70% of the print \nmarket (Wright, 2021), has a near monopoly on print -based publications in some states  \n(Bacon & Jegan, 2020)  \u2013 including the GBR\u2019s home of Queensland  \u2013 and Sky News \nAustralia is now available for free on commercial television  (Copland et al., 2021) ; \nsome have question ed its impact in the concentrated market  due to the decentralised \nnews-sharing environment  offered by online media platforms , including Facebook \nitself. In a submission to the Senate Inquiry into Media Diversity  in Australia  in 2021, \nthe tech giant said:  \nTechnology has democratised the sharing of ideas and information. \nAustralians are no longer dependent on a small number of gatekeepers in order \nto access information; they are able to access information about newsworthy \ndevelopments  from international media publications, freelancers and \nbloggers, or from direct contact with journalists or newsmakers (Facebook, \nSubmission 50, p. 7 , as cited in Environment & Communications References \nCommittee, 2021 ). \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  187 Amongst those who have recently raised concerns about News Corp\u2019s  impact on \nAustralian policy and democracy  are former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who \nwas the proponent of the petition that garnered half a million signatures and prompted \nthe Senate Inquiry  (Parliament of Australia, 20 20). Rudd commented :  \n\u2026if you look at the impact of the Murdoch print media operation, it's a bit like \nthis: print seeks to determine and drive the national news agenda on a given \nday. The electronics \u2014go to radio \u2014bounce their stories each day usually, not \nalways, but usually, out of what's in print. The televisions, who do not have \nindependent journalistic resources to do their own investigative programs \nmuch, are also directly influenced by what appears in print... [Then there is] \nthe wash through onto onl ine platforms \u2014 ironically Google and Facebook \n[from] the print origins of the story or the colouring of the story that day. That \nthen completes the picture\u2026 [Murdoch] knows that by owning print, even if \nit no longer delivers profitable revenue lines, he ha s enormous influence over \nthe nation's future political and policy agenda. That's why he's in the business . \n(The Hon Kevin Rudd AC, Private capacity, Committee Hansard , 19 February \n2021, p. 14 , as cited in Environment & Communications References \nCommittee,  2021) \nRecent interplays with the digital platforms \u2013 foregrounded above by both \nFacebook and Rudd \u2013 offer interesting and relevant insights into  enacting network, \nnetworked and network -making power. News Corp\u2019s Facebook pages were amongst \nthe media organi sations that were temporarily de -platformed during Facebook\u2019s \ncontestation of the Australian government\u2019s News Media and Digital Platforms \nMandatory Bargaining Code , which called for the tech giants to compensate legacy \nmedia companies for their content po sted on the digital platforms (Bossio et al., 2022 ; \nNicholls, 2020 ). Flew and Wilding (2021) highlight the politics at play in the lead -up, \nsaying how large digital platforms like Google and Facebook were \u201cpitted\u201d against \n\u201cthe giants of traditional media, most notably Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation\u201d \n(p. 50). Confidential and seemingly lucrative deals have since been struck between the \nmain players to ensure information flows continue to circulate, including a multi -year \ndeal for News Corp\u2019s major Austral ian publications with both Facebook and Google \n(Bossio et al., 2022, p. 11). Sky News Australia  was also subject to a show of network \npower in August 2021 when YouTube banned the broadcaster from uploading any new \ncontent for a week in response to concerns  about the News Corp channel  circulating \n \n188 Chapter 8:  Discussion  COVID-related misinformation  (Houghton, 2021 ). Sky News Australia\u2019s  response was \nto delete a series of videos, and returned to being fully operational with little indication \nfrom YouTube about what community standar ds were breached, or if there w ould be \nany ongoing monitoring (Taylor, 2021). While these  digital platform power tussles \nexist, the above examples suggest network power over information flows is asserted \nby the digital platforms  in an ad hoc manner , but these actions are not ultimately \ndamaging to News Corp\u2019s attention -seeking and longer-term income-generating goals.  \nIn fact as noted above, in the case of Sky News Australia , its YouTube audience has \ngrown by nearly a million subs cribers in a year.  \nFurther to this , Arsenault and Castells (2008) have described Rupert Murdoch as \na key enactor of network -making power in the network society for his ability to \nconnect media, political and business networks in pursuit of his own economic  goals. \nThey argue that a perception of control over public opinion, real or not, provides \npolitical leverage, which then supports Murdoch\u2019s ultimate goal of business expansion \nand growth. This can include lobbying politicians for favourable media regulati on \noutcomes  (Lidberg, 2019) . Further, while Murdoch himself possesses conservative \npolitical views, he has shown a willingness to support any political agenda that \nadvances his overarching business goals (Arsenault & Castells, 2008). This is \nevidenced  in his support for Kevin Rudd \u2019s prime ministership  in 2007 and British \nLabor leader Tony Blair in 2006 (Arsenault & Castells, 2008; Manne, 2011).  Thus \nsome suggest that the influence of The Australian  stems from the perception of the \npower it wields from the p olitical class who read it, with the newspaper displaying a \ntrack record of impacting political powerplays  (Manne, 2011).  \n News Corp \u2019s and Murdoch\u2019s influence  on public opinion is harder to state. \nThere is a lack of empirical evidence about the link between its climate change \nreporting and audiences\u2019  attitudes towards climate change . Yet this knowledge is \nparticularly  relevant in a communications environment where  social media amplif ies \nmainstream media messages ( Holmes and Star, 2018,  p. 152) and portions of the  \nAustralian population still seem reluctant to support climate -related action  (Park et al., \n2020b), though there are encouraging signs that these sentiments are changing \n(Quicke, 2021). Noting the politicisation and mediatisatio n of the GBR and \nenvironmental policy, th ese informational power  dynamics are particularly important \nto understand in the lead -up to elections , especially in the historically divided state of \n  \nChapter 8:  Discussion  189 Queensland where protection of the environment is often seen to oppose economic \nsecurity (Bacon & Jegan, 2020; Blaine, 2019; Lester et al., 2014 ). This false binary \nalso reinforces the \u201cfossil -fuel industry, politics and mainstream media nexus\u201d \n(Holmes & Star, 2018, p. 151) , activates the scientific doubt playbook,  and stifles the \ndevelopment of meaningful policy .  \n\n  \nChapter 9:  Conclusions  191 Chapter 9:  Conclusions  \n9.1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  \nThrough examining the news -sharing spaces of Twitter, YouTube and \nFacebook , this research found that three key ways that p ower is asserted and contested \nin the \u2018social news media network \u2019 (Bruns 2018) during a case study of the Great \nBarrier Reef protectio n are: adversarial framing, the problematic use  of science, and \nthe interplay of mainstream media with alternative media actors, politicians and \nideologically -driven advocacy groups  to further information flows .  \nThis research contributes to knowledge empi rically in environmental media and \npolitical communications studies in particular,  and operationalises Castells\u2019 network \ntheory of power for social media networks . In the context of the problematic use of \nscience and the \u2018networks of operatives\u2019 (Cottle, 2013) associated with the furthering \nof information flows, this work  produces empirical evidence of the interplays between \nactors in the climate \u201cdenial machine\u201d  (Dunlap & McCright, 2011, p. 144)  in the \ncontext of Australian environmental protection within interconnected news-sharing \nspaces. There is  an underrepresentation of work that has tracked how informational \nflows have s owed scientific doubt across multiple social media networks, with this \nresearch beginning to address a gap  by mapping  these digital networked interactions \nin relation to the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s \u2018politics of protection \u2019 (Foxwell -Norton & \nKonkes, 2018) . This work also  provides empirical evidence to support Konkes and \nFoxwell-Norton\u2019s (2021) argument that science has become a  sphere of action in its \nown right as an enactor of \u2018mediatised environmental conflict \u2019 (Hutchins & Lester, \n2015).  \nThis study also contributes to existing research  about the role of mainstream \nmedia in relation to other actors embedded in contemporary communication spaces in \nframing \u2018reality\u2019 and furthering information flows  to assert and contest \u2018power over \nminds\u2019 (Castells, 2016) . In the context of the protection of the GBR, mainstream media \nactors continue to play a central role  in the networked spaces of Twitter, YouTube and \nFacebook. This is  particular ly evident with  The Guardian  and News Corp as frame-\nsetters, though this \u2018knowledge\u2019 and  \u2018reality\u2019 is furthered  via differen t interplays  of \nactors, informatio n flow dynamics , and attention-getting tactics. In other words, w hile \n \n192 Chapter 9:  Conclusions  other actors embedded in these hybrid news -sharing spaces have a key role in \u2018tapping\u2019 \nand \u2018steering\u2019 information flows to suit their goals  (Chadwick et  al., 2016)  \u2013 which \ncan include attempting to \u2018switch\u2019 the \u2018reality\u2019 of the GBR\u2019s health and impact of \nclimate change  \u2013 it is still largely the traditional actors involved in media politics  that \nare creating and legitimising the information t hat frames this \u2018reality\u2019.  \nThe continued dominance of mainstream media actors in this capacity is \nimportant  considering previous scholarly research about News Corp\u2019s network -\nmaking power  (Arsenault, & Castells, 2008 ), particularly its role in politicising and \npolarising climate change debates and stifling environmental policy advancement  \n(Bacon & Jegan, 2020; Chubb 2012 ; Holmes & Star, 2018; Konkes & Foxwell -Norton, \n2021; Manne, 2011; Taylor, 2014 ). The findings are  also relevant given current \ndiscussions about  media diversity in Australia in the context of decentralised \ncommunications spaces  (Environment & Communications References Committee, \n2021; Flew & Wilding, 2021; Meese, 2021) , and escalating pressure from the global \ncommunity for Australia to take meaningful and substantive action on climate change \n(ABC News, 2022).  \nFinally, in enlisting Manuel Castells\u2019 network theory of power, this work \nadapted and operationalised  this concept  to investigate  interplays  within the social \nmedia network  elements of Twitte r, YouTube and Facebook. In doing so , it aligned \nCastells\u2019 four forms of network power to social network theory -inspired power \nindicators and SNA metrics to study power dynamics in the attention-focused social \nnews media network.  Through c onsidering the ce ntrality of actors, dominance of \ninformation, salience of frames and efforts to reframe and steer information to suit the \ngoals of certain embedded actors, these indicators  \u2013 and the way they were used \u2013 \nrevealed patterns of attention-getting actor interactions and information  flows that \nwere being co-opted to contest environmental protection.  \n9.2 SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Great Barrier Reef and climate policy assemblage s in Australia are \ninterconnected, complex, and the sites of  ongoing power contestations , with the \nmultimedia communication networks  \u2013 and the social news media network in \nparticular  \u2013 constituting the dynamic environment  for many of these interplays . Publics \nare informed about Great Barrier Reef and  climate change  science and policy  through \n  \nChapter 9:  Conclusions  193 multimedia networks, yet, as found in previous work and supported by this research ; \nmainstream media continue play an important role in framing information and agenda \nsetting. Furthermore , this inquiry finds the  distribution and leveraging  of these \ninformation flows is  impacted by alternative news outlets and political and advocacy \nactors who are \u2018tapping\u2019 and \u2018steering\u2019 content in ways that suit their own goals. In the \ncase of mainstream media  content that under mines science or delegitimises the need \nfor enhanced environmental protection , these information flows are often channelled  \nby actors who oppose climate action  or government interference  in the free market . \nThis include s conservative  partisan politicians  and mainstream and alternative media; \nadvocacy groups, including economically -driven thinktanks ; and a contrarian scientist . \nWhile scientific information often informs policy making (Jasanoff, 1990, as cited in \nPielke, 2004) , in the case of the GBR\u2019s protec tion, this work shows how \u2018the science\u2019  \nis being politicised and mediatised to suit the particular goals of the actors embedded \nin dynamic news -sharing networks. From a Castells\u2019 network theory of power \nperspective , the sphere of science and its associated goal  to provide meaningful and \nwell-rounded policy advice is being \u2018switched\u2019 to serve political, economic and media \ninterests.  \nThis is generally problematic, but specifically concerning when coupled with the  \npressures faced by the GBR , the mounting global threat of climate change , and the \nongoing political  lack of appetite  in Australia  for meaningful and d ecisive climate-\nfocused policy to benefit all living beings \u2013 human and non -human. Yet, while these \nfindings contribute new knowledg e in the sense that these digital news-sharing spaces \nand the dynamics between actors have not previously been studied in this way and at \nthis scale in the context of the politics of Great Barrier Reef protection, there is nothing \nnovel about the tactics b eing used by actors to further their goals ( Ceccarelli, 2011; \nDunlap & McCright, 2011; Oreskes & Conway, 201 0; Taylor, 2014 ). The playbook of \nthe \u201cdenial machine\u201d  (Dunlap & McCright, 2011, p. 144) is  simply transposed into \ncontemporary communication spaces . Understanding these information flows and \ntactics that are specific to the Australian context could offer benefits in mitigating \ndamaging impacts , such as the extent t o which climate change has bee n polarised in \nthe US (Dunlap & McCright, 2011 ; Merkley & Stecula, 2018 ). It could also provide \nguidance to GBR policy -makers and science communicators when faced with similar \nmediatised environmental conflict events.  \n \n194 Chapter 9:  Conclusions  9.3 RECOMMENDATIONS  \nThe findings from this  study, including the homophilous  problematic science \nclusters within Twitter and Facebook, and the partisan framing of GBR science and \nclimate change by the dominant Sky News Australia  on YouTube, suggest further work \nneeds to be done to understand inform ational dynamics around potentially divisive \nenvironmental issues in Australia. Understanding the drivers and tactics used in \npolitical communication  and then sharing this knowledge and educating  \u2018produsers\u2019 \n(Bruns, 2008) as both consumers and creators of content is crucial. This includes \nforegrounding how science is part of political communication  and how hybrid media \nlogics work in these  dynamic news and information spaces.  These findings reinforce \nthe call for widescale and targeted media and data literacy , but also political and \nscience literacy so audiences understand why and how their attention is being targeted  \nand the implications and connections to the wider social context  (Carmi et al., 2020; \nGraham et al., 2020a ; Lenzi, 2019 ). This should encompass  fostering understanding \nabout the goals and logics of embedded actors, particularly within the multimedia mass \ncommunication networks, but also the political and economic networks  in the network \nsociety (Castells, 2011a) . \nFor example , some of the drivers of \u2018power over minds\u2019 c ould be foregrounded \nvia the disclosure of connections that actors have which could impact the way \ninformation is framed and furthered  to achieve those goals . For example, the average \nviewer of Sky News Australia  or reader of The Australian  may not know that these \noutlets are owned by the same publisher. They also may not be aware that contributor \nand GBR science critic Dr Peter Ridd is professionally a ssociated with right-wing \nthinktank the Institute of Public Affairs (Project for Real Science , 2022), and even if \nthey did, they may not realise the organisation\u2019s  history of climate contrarian  attitudes \nand activities, and financial contributors  (Dunlap & McCright, 2011) . While the IPA \ndoes not disclose who its f inancial sources  are, journalists have reported that an \nAustralian mining magnat e has funded up to half of its activities (Seccombe, 2018). \nThis transparency may provide useful context into its goals, logics and associated \nresistance to climate action and policy.  As Ceccarelli (2011) notes , identifying these \n\u201cunambiguous linkages\u201d (p. 216) helps to dispel the notion of contrarian  scientists as \n\u201cclear-eyed\u201d (p. 216) heroes following the evidence  and can help reverse the dynamics \nof uncertainty. This is particularly relevant in the News Corp context where research \n  \nChapter 9: Conclusions  195 has found the publisher  presents dissenting scientists as \u201cfree speech champions who \ndeserve exposure\u201d (Bacon & Jegan, 2020, p. 80), or underdogs fighting for the truth  \n(Roper, 2016 ). Noting that  scholars have found that opinion pieces and commentators \nare responsible for the majority of problematic information (Bacon & Jegan, 2020; \nMcKnight, 2010), a small but potentially effective mitigation strategy could be greater \ntransparency about contribut ors\u2019 connections and potential motivations. For instance, \nintroducing a requirement  for each piece of commentary to state  the name of the \norganisation(s) the contributor represents, a link to the \u2018About Us \u2019 webpage or current \nannual report of those entitie s, and the disclosure of any commercial interests that \ncould impact the views expressed in the column . A similar principle could apply to \nexpressing the connections between media actors in the context of ownership . \nAlthough this approach would be difficult , if not impossible, to enforce for alternative \nmedia actors, it would at least encompass the frame -setting mainstream media  and \ntheir associated network-making power . \nIn a case study sense, considering the tactics  and interplays  identified in this \nresearch and the politicisation and mediatisation of the Reef identified in previous \nmedia politics work, it is likely that the upcoming 2022 WHC decision about the \nGBR\u2019s World Heritage status will prompt similar informational dynamics and frames  \n(though, the \u2018conflict and strategy\u2019 Australia vs China angle will most likely not be as \nsalient as China is no longer the Chair ). Yet looking  beyond this imminent MEC event \nand considering the impact of GBRMPA\u2019s previous Outlook Reports in prompting \naction from  UNESCO (Chapter 1), the next GBR Outlook Report (due 2024) provides \nanother central opportunity  for the politicisation and mediatisation of GBR science. It \nis therefore recommended that scientists and science communicat ors prepare as much \nas possible  in advance of these mediatised environmental conflict events  to ensure that \n\u201cwhen their work becomes an act of political communication it better conveys the \nintended message\u201d (Konkes & Foxwell -Norton, 2021, p. 480).  This is especially \nrelevant given that  political actors collectively continue to play a greater role  in \nsteering information flows than scientists  via networked power , though not to the \nextent of advocates, and mainstream and alternative media actors. This points to a \nsituation where GBR science is likely to continue to be used as an element in network -\nmaking power by those seeking to achieve their network goals \u2013 goals that may not \nalways prioritise the Reef\u2019s  protection.  \n \n196 Chapter 9:  Conclusions  As these challenges will be ongoing , it is important  to continue to study  and \nunpick the interactions, informational flows and the way  that \u2018knowledge \u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 \nare being furthered and contested in the  primary fields of power \u2013 the multimedia \ncommunication networks . While the battle of \u2018power over minds\u2019 (Castells, 2016) will \nbe ongoing , knowing the strategies and tactics used will mean \u2018produsers\u2019 (Bruns, \n2008) in these dynamic communication spaces are better equipped to navigate them, \nwhile informational, scientific and political literacy can be directed accordingly .  \n9.4 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES  \nWhile this work provides a  useful insight into the powerplays that are unfolding \nin these polycentric spaces to shape \u2018reality\u2019, this inquiry has also foregrounded further \navenues for investigation. One of these  reflects the observation about homophilic \nclusters containing  news outlets and  ideologically -aligned actors within Facebook and \nTwitter in particular. In the case of these networks, the right -wing media, conservative \npoliticians and climate change denial advocate actors are distinctly removed from the \nmain cluster . In the case of Tw itter (Chapter 5) , there were very minimal inter -cluster \ninteractions  between the segregated group (Group 2) and the main cluster  (Figure 5.7) . \nFrom the data that could be mapped in Facebook , it appears that the group that was \nspatially separate to the top left  of the visualisation (Figure 7.8 ) had very similar actors \nto those in the disconnected cluster of Twitter . In both networks these actors appeared  \nideologically distinct from the main clusters . YouTube was spatially different in the \nsense that most actors were organised around the \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 style broadcast \nclusters represented mainly by mainstream media or vloggers , with the biggest hub \ncreated by partisan mainstream news actor Sky News Australia . There was minimal \nsharing between thes e clusters.  \nHowever, these homophilous interactions also serve as flags that there is further \nanalytic value in exploring the subclusters for evidence of disconnection, or \npolarisation. Namely, the in-depth close reading and framing analysis on the select \nsubclusters indicated that there were signs of ideological opposition to attitudes about \nclimate and GBR science, and also signs of antagonism and affective polarisation in \nthe way that some of these actors  referred to those with differing worldviews as li ars, \ncorrupt, part of a conspiracy , or just \u201cloathed\u201d them  (Table 7.4). It is also of specific \ninterest that the two most authoritative mainstream news actors \u2013 News Corp and The \nGuardian  \u2013 and their audiences represent opposite ends of the political spect rum \n  \nChapter 9:  Conclusions  197 (Figure 2.1). Understanding these interactions would help to address  a significant gap \nin work to -date, particularly as there are few empirical studies of this interdisciplinary \nnature that focus on Australian mediatised environmental conflict  and polarisation \n(Arguedas et al., 2022 ). \n9.5 FINAL WORDS  \nThis work and its findings address current gaps in knowledge about how \ninformation flow s and power are contested in contemporary digital communication \nspaces in relation to Australian environmental pol icy, and specifically the Great \nBarrier Reef. It is hoped the knowledge generated can be used to wards enhancing \nscience communication and environmental policy outcomes. It is important to continue \nto study dynamic interplays in the knowledge -shaping spaces  of the social news media \nnetwork (Bruns, 2018) to gain valuable insights into how \u2018power over minds \u2019 (Castells, \n2016) is asserted and contested in relation to some of the most central issues facing \nsociety. Namely, the global crisis of climate change, and  \u2018produsers\u2019\u2019 (Bruns, 2008) \nrelationship s with  information , knowledge  and power  in the \u201cchaos\u201d (Chadwick et al., \n2016, p. 2) of disrupted , hybrid and interconnected communications networks . \n \n \n \n\n  \nReferences  199 References  \nAalberg, T., Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, J., & de Vreese, C.

Tweets were collected for parameters outlined in Chapter 4 by using \nAcademicTwitteR, though I had an extended date range to have a data buffer.  \n2. AcademicTwitteR  confirmed that 177 pages were queried. The data was \ncaptured as JSON objects. I used AcademicTwitteR to bind the data into a \ntibble (a dataframe). I then used Eric Mill\u2019s website ( https://konklone.io/json/ ) \n\u2013 recommended by Twitter\u2019s Developer Platform45 \u2013 to convert the \u2018User\u2019 \nJSON files into a CSV. These contained the TweetIDs \u2013 a unique identifier that \nTwitter creates for each Tweet. At this stage, there were a total of 86,677 tweets \nin the CSV.  \n3. I reduced these tweets to the date range , resulting in a total of 85,818 tweets.  \n4. I isolated these TweetIDs and used an Excel formula to replace the \u2018x\u2019 \ncharacter at the start of each ID (the \u2018x\u2019 is added to stop Excel automatically \nconverting the data to a number).  \n5. I then imported the TweetIDs into NodeXL using the data importer.  \n6. There was extensive cleaning required of the URLs, with many not expanding  \nfrom the http://t.co\u2019 format , or requiring an extra step if the expanded version \nwas then a bit.ly . I used Urlcheckr Premium  (https://www.urlcheckr.com/ ) and \nuploaded the data in batches , with the unexpanded  links then manually \nresolved. Cleaning also included the removal of URL tracking codes.  \n7. Note RE point 5 : I could have i mported the CSV (from the JSON files) into \nNodeXL instead of the TweetIDs, but during the pilot studies, I found that this \nwas more less effective than simply importing the data straight into NodeXL \n \n \n45 (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/five -ways-to-convert-a-json-object-to-csv) \n \n230 Appendices  from the Twitter Import option. There are no restrictions  on the Twitter API \n(v1.1) NodeXL uses when importing data via a TweetID List Network (for \ninstance, as there would be if I was sourcing the Tweets directly from \nNodeXL).  \n8. As an additional step for comparison purposes, I also prepared the raw data in \nCSVs and imported it into Gephi for further analysis. See Chapter 4 and \nChapter 5.  \n  \n  \nAppendices  231  \nAppendix B  \nYouTube Method \u2013 Detailed Steps \nThis is the step -by-step guide used for the YouTube data collection:  \n1. To collect YouTube data, access is needed to the YouTube API v.3, \nwhich i s actioned through the Google Developers Console \n(https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting -started).  \n2. I initially created one API key, but then added an initial nine to reach the \nmaximum of 10. This is because each API key has a total credit of \n10,000, with different elements in a data collection worth different \namounts of \u2018credits\u2019. To ensure I was collec ting all the data, I collected \nit in smaller segments with different API keys.  \n3. I sourced R package TubeR (Sood et al., 2020), which can be used to \ncollect Video IDs straight from YouTube. This required creating an \nOAuth 2.0 Consent ( https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/extracting -\npre-processing -youtube-comments ) in addition to the API key.  \n4. I modified the code to suit my search parameters using the TubeR \ndocumentation (Sood et al., 2020), which included specifying the search \nquery \u201cGreat Barrier Reef\u201d, the type as \u2018video\u2019, the date window (same \nas Twitter \u2013 21/06/21 \u2013 01/08/21). As was the case with Twitter, I \nremoved any videos afterwards that appeared outside o f the final date \nrange. This returned 464 video IDs.  \n5. I saved this dataframe as a CSV file and prepared the data in Excel for \nimport into NodeXL, including removing the \u2018x\u2019 character at the start of \nthe video IDs. I imported these in batches of 50 into Nod eXL using the \nYouTube User Network importer, and enlisted a different API key for \neach batch to ensure I captured as much data as possible.  \n6. Other parameters selected on the importer were opting to create an edge \nfor every user that commented on a video an d replied to a comment on a \nvideo (as well as posting a video). A limit was set to 150 comments and \n \n232 Appendices  150 replies after reviewing previous data collections and seeing that this \ncovered the bulk of the interactions on each video. Also, previous advice \nin NodeXL training sessions suggested 100 comments, but I made this \nwider given the credits available due to the additional API keys.  \n7. Once the complete dataset was returned in NodeXL in the format of \nseparate edges, vertices (nodes), groups and other tabs, I com pared the \ncollected data with previous experimental collections using both TubeR \nand NodeXL\u2019s data importer directly. Through cross -checking the \ncontent and actors, I confirmed that the final collection returned the most \ncomplete representation of the data  of all methods tried. In other words, \nit had maximum relevancy (no irrelevant COVID -19 videos and few \nspam, yet had still captured the most dominant content showing up in the \ntest datasets relating to the Great Barrier Reef). However, I did later \nnotice a limitation that 389 of the 464 video  IDs collected via TubeR had \nbeen imported into NodeXL . Further investigations showed that videos \nthat had comment functionality disabled  did not import due to a lack of \nedges, which was the result of  the absence of comments and comment \nreplies. \n8. Note: While there were some edges containing non -English-language \ncontent, I did not remove these from the dataset to ensure consistency \nwith approach taken with Twitter (I did not remove edges in this respect \neither). \n \n  \n  \nAppendices  233 Appendix C  \nCoding Instrument for Actor Types \nCodebook for classifying actor types  \nMedia non -\nnews+ Anyone, or outlet, that is in the mainstream media sphere, but is not \nnews.  \nMedia \nmainstream \nnews+ Media outlets and media professionals that are existing news \nbrands, or are associated with existing news brands. Often \ncorporate, but can also be funded in other ways (like the ABC and \nThe Guardian ). Also includes retired media professionals who \nworked fo r corporate or public service news outlets.  \nMedia \nalternative \nnews+ Media outlets or media professionals that are news -focused, yet are \nnot associated with mainstream media entities, e.g. independent \noutlets. Also encompasses smaller outlets, including bl ogs, or \noutlets with different journalistic affordances, like The \nConversation  where content is supplied by experts, but edited by \njournalists, or science magazines with news.  \nVlogger Created inductively from the YouTube analysis. A form of media \n(goal is attention and often monetisation), but not mainstream \nmedia, and not news either. Different objectives in relation to the \nGBR and climate change, and different logics. Subcategories ar e \noutlined in Chapter 6.  \nAdvocacy* Anyone, organisation or group concerned about bringing about \nchange, championing an issue or viewpoint, or campaigning \u2013 their \ngoal is making a difference. Includes those advocating for GBR \nhealth and climate action/poli cy, but also those advocating for \nscepticism towards GBR health and climate claims . While these are \ndifferent arguments, the logic is the same as they are both driven by \nthe need to convince people of their way of thinking. In bios, it is \npeople who state their position for or against something (e.g. a \npolitical party, climate views, or even vaccination  support), or \nindicate they are promoting social change of some kind. For \norganisations, they are communicating or promoting a cause or \npolicy for the good of society, or a particular group of society. Can \ninclude people who have written books, if they are  not primarily \nauthors; i.e., wrote the book to convey their views and make a \ndifference to their main priority of the social issue/cause. NOTE: \nEnvironmental Non -Government Organisations (ENGOs) are \nincluded here.  \nPolitical* Government members and spokes people of local, state and federal \ngovernments, includes public service government departments \n(unless otherwise coded science).  \nInternational* International governance organisations like UNESCO and the \nIUCN. \nIndustry* Businesses , companies,  and those with a strong economic interest.  \nIndigenous* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations.  \nScience* Scientists, research institutions, and those who speak on behalf of \nscientific organisations and authorities.  \nCommunity  Added inductively with Facebook data. Not individuals,  rather \ngrassroots groups like community forums. Not advocating and not \nnews, but just sharing hyperlocal information. \nIndividuals  Individual users that needed to be deidentified  for privacy reasons. \n \n234 Appendices  Unknown* Not able to be classified based on the available information.  \nInauthentic  Spam accounts.  \n \nNote.  \n* These classifications are based on Newman, 2017; Foxwell -Norton & Konkes, 2018, and Konkes & \nFoxwell-Norton, 2021. Although, unlike Hutchins & Lester (2015) and Foxwell -Norton & Knonkes, \n(2018), ENGOs have been put into the advocacy category. Advocacy was determined to be a more \nsuitable term than \u2018activist\u2019.  \n+ Rather than \u2018media\u2019 being one group as it w as in the above -mentioned studies, this actor group has \nbeen split into sub categories to allow for more in -depth analysis  of power. While inspired by \nNewman (2017), t hese classifications were informed inductively by the data.  \n \nExamples of YouTube coding: individuals vs. inauthentic  \nThis user was coded as an individual: \u201c@User all the below average cold \ntemperatires [sic] really show global warming though don\u2019t they.

Mr Katter\u2019s comments \nfollows a push by a China -chaired UN committee to declare the Great \nBarrier Reef \u201cin danger\u201d.

The hearing will likely be over \nby mid-afternoon. The case has been distilled into a narrow debate \nabout academic freedom of speech. Should a scientist with 30 years \nworking on the Great Barrier Reef be able to say that work coming \nfrom other reef science organisations had insufficient qual ity \nassurance, and was thus not trustworthy? Or should he be fired because \nit was discourteous and disrespectful? The documentation for the \nhearing can be found at https://www.hcourt.gov.au/cases/case_b12 -\n2021 It is a clash between the Intellectual freedom  of speech clauses in \nthe JCU work contract, which give a broad right to have a robust \nintellectual discussion, and the \u201ccode of conduct\u201d. The code of conduct \nwould force all speech to be courteous, and any criticism of fellow \nacademic\u2019s work would contrav ene the code because it would not \n\u201cuphold the reputation of the university\u201d and be discourteous and \ndisrespectful. The science itself will not be analysed by the Judges. \nThat is not their job. That is the job of scientists in universities and \nscience insti tutions. But if scientists and academics are not allowed to \ndo that, due to codes of conduct that effectively forbid a robust debate, \nit is easy to lose confidence in some of what we are told about \nimportant issues. I think we have a better than average ch ance of \nwinning. But it will be a tense hearing. It will also likely take a couple \nof months for the final decisions to be handed down.

It's \nimpossible to tell how much damage has been done to Australia's \neconomy and reputation by the outrageous claims spread by th ese \nalarmists but hopefully, as evidence of their dodgy science continues to \nbe exposed, over time we can repair some of the harm. #PaulineHanson \n#OneNationAus #AndrewBolt #PeterRidd #TheGreatBarrierReef  \n17 Katter's \nAustralian \nParty Photo 3,329 We've said it before and we'll say it again: It's time we left China -\ncontrolled UNESCO. Bob Katter has previously called on the Federal \nGovernment to cancel its membership with the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) which h e \nsays has become controlled by the dictatorial Chinese regime. Mr \nKatter\u2019s comments came after a push by a China -chaired UN \ncommittee to declare the Great Barrier Reef \u201cin danger\u201d. The Katter\u2019s \nAustralian Party (KAP) Federal MP says the move by UNESCO is not \nrelated to environmental concerns but a further bullying move by the \nChinese regime. \u201cUNESCO has moved to classify one quarter of \nAustralia\u2019s oceans endangered, well how come only five years ago the \nleading world authority on nature, David Attenborough , said the reef \nwas \u2018the most magical place on earth\u2019,\u201d Mr Katter said. The KAP \nbelieves the Great Barrier Reef is being used by international political \nsuperpowers as a political 'whipping boy' for a radical environmentalist \nagenda; and to deflect from th eir own poor environmental standards. \nKAP's leader Robbie Katter MP said: \u201clocal tourism operators and \nsmall businesses that work on the Reef should not have to suffer \nbecause a group of foreigners, who mostly have far worse \nenvironmental condition than Au stralia, decide to misrepresent the \nGreat Barrier Reef and cause international implications to our tourism \nand related industries.\u201d #KAP #KAPteam #UNESCO #China \n#greabarrierreef  \n18 Rappler Link 3,132 #FactCheck: GMA News initially released a graphic that mistakenly \nused an image of the Great Barrier Reef that has been on the internet \nsince 2014.

New HGA coming soon  \n21 Dr Peter Ridd  Photo 2,893 Reef-scientists often claim that coral bleaching is a new phenomenon \nthat only started in the 1970\u2019s due to climate change. But a remarkable \nnew paper published by Tomas Cedhagen, of Aarhus University in \nDenmark has uncovered a very early lithograph showin g bleaching in \n1862. Before I go on, the High Court hearing went reasonably well but \nit is impossible to predict the result which could take three months. But \nback to bleaching. There are actually many other early observations of \nbleaching, including by Si r Maurice Yonge in the first major science \nexpedition to the Great Barrier Reef in 1929 (if you don\u2019t count \nCaptain James Cook\u2019s scientific exploration of the reef in 1770). But \nEugen von Ransonnet\u2019s remarkable lithograph, taken from an \nincredibly crude di ving bell, seems to be the earliest picture. People \narguing that bleaching is new might argue that the important point is \nthat there was no MASS coral bleaching before the 1970/80's. Von \nRansonnet's lithograph is evidence only of bleaching on a small scale . \nThis argument is incredibly weak for the following reasons. (a) In order \nto observe mass coral bleaching, it requires a major monitoring effort \ndesigned to measure such a large -scale event. Before about 1970, there \n  \nAppendices  245 were very few marine biologists and no major institutions capable of \ndoing such monitoring. Von Ransonnet, in his diving bell was certainly \nnot in that position. Marine science is a very new discipline, so it is not \nsurprising that the mass coral death events, and the huge coral \nspawning events  were unknown to science until a few decades ago. The \nfirst proper aerial surveys were not carried out until 1998. And would \nanybody argue that mass coral spawning, that was only discovered in \nthe early 80\u2019s, never happened before that date. (b) If a few c orals \nbleached in 1862, or 1929 (Yonge), due to hot or cold water, why \nwould we suppose that the same hot/cold event did not bleach corals \nelsewhere in the same region? (c) On purely statistical grounds, large \nscale very hot events must have occurred befor e 1970. Perhaps not as \nfrequently as today due to the warming climate, but they must have \noccurred. And its not as though the climate has got very much warmer \nin the last 100 years (from whatever cause). The reef water is at most \njust 1oC hotter. Major ble aching events must have occurred in the past \nunless you believe that all the corals on earth were precariously close to \ntheir upper thermal limit. But despite this, Prof Hughes of JCU stated \non ABC radio \"a critical issue here is that these bleaching event s are \nnovel. When I was a PhD student 30 years ago regional scale bleaching \nevents were completely unheard of. They are a human invention due to \nglobal warming.\" This seems highly improbable.

This is important to us as a \nnation, as I hope everyone will realize after reading this column. The \ntiny Florida -based tech company, Simularity , in the past week, had \ngone on a campaign to claim that Chinese vessels were heavily \npolluting the Union Banks area in the Spratlys with what it outrightly \nreferred to \u2013 in its supposed scientific paper \u2013 as \u201cpoop\u201d and \u201cshit.\u201d \nThe firm cleverly got to spr ead its fake news through gullible media, \nnotably GMA 7 and Channel 5\u2019s \u201cOneNews,\u201d by posting together with \nits supposedly objective but questionable analysis a photograph taken \nfrom a low -flying airplane of a ship with a brownish trail anyone would \nconclude, because of the report\u2019s headline, as human waste discharged \nby the vessel. The photo, however, was immediately tracked down by \n \n246 Appendices  an alert netizen as one appearing in Australia\u2019s Daily Mail in 2014 in \nthe Great Barrier Reef in Cairns. The unidentified shi p wasn\u2019t even \ndischarging waste. It was undertaking dredging operations with the \nbrown material being the usual sediments at the sea\u2019s bottom. \nSimularity\u2019s supposed \u201canalysis\u201d that Chinese vessels were polluting \nthe Spratlys are so seriously flawed that th ey were obviously fake news \ndisguised as scientific findings. First, there is no proof that the ships \nwere Chinese as fishermen from Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines \nfish in the Spratlys. Satellite images Second, and more importantly, \nSimularity\u2019s \u201canal ysis\u201d was based on satellite images from the \nEuropean Space Agency, which it interpreted solely using its \nproprietary software it calls \u201cAI -driven satellite image anomaly \ndetection.\u201d Simularity has used the technology solely on detecting \nchanges on the ear th\u2019s surface. Set up in 2011, Simularity has had few \ntakers for its technology with only three clients so far. The firm\u2019s \nclaims, in fact, that chlorophyll -a around a ship can be detected from \nimages taken by a satellite hundreds of kilometers in space or even that \nit automatically means human waste have no scientific basis. In its \n\u201cshit\u201d report, Simularity listed over 10 scientific articles as references. I \nplodded tortuously through all of them: none talked about Simularity\u2019s \nway of detecting shit through  the presence of chlorophyll -a. In its \nTwitter account, Simularity claims it was founded in 2011 in Delaware \nto create the impression it has been that way many years in offering its \nservices. However, it seems to have been struggling all those years \nbecause of few clients. It was only in 2018 that it was given a probably \nlife-saving capital infusion when Abaya\u2019s Makati -based Shatter Tech \nVenture Holdings invested $1 million in it on July 17, 2018. Simularity \nthen, for some reason, moved in 2020 to Florida b y incorporating a \nbranch there, under the category of \u201cforeign for profit,\u201d obviously \nbecause all it had was the funding from Abaya\u2019s Filipino company \nShatter Tech Venture Holdings. Abaya was the third company director \nafter the couple Elizabeth and Raymon d Derr. Funding Abaya\u2019s fund \ninfusion has been Similarity\u2019s sole funding as reported both in its \nwebsite and by its vice president for media Peter Koning in an email to \nme. In an email, I asked Koning: \u201cHas the US State Department \ncontracted Similarity to produce these \u201cSouth China Sea Rapid Alert \nReports?\u201d He replied, \u201cReports are not paid for. Our investor is Shatter \nTech and our customers are confidential.\u201d What could have happened \nin 2018 that got Abaya to invest in Simularity? That was the year when \nSimularity changed its studies (\u201cto demonstrate the power of its \nsoftware\u201d) from a few Middle East countries (apparently to attract US \ndefense contracts) to the Spratlys. After Abaya\u2019s investment, \nSimularity came out with several studies on Mischief Reef, cl aiming \nthat the Chinese were building massive fortifications there. It set up in \n2020 its \u201cSouth China Sea Rapid Alert Forum,\u201d in effect announcing \nthat its focus of studies would be on the disputes in the South China \nSea, which turned out to be practicall y fake news on China\u2019s allegedly \nvillainous activities in the South China Sea, such as the alleged \ninvasion, it reported last May of China\u2019s maritime militias in Union \nBanks (which is largely a Vietnam -controlled area). Wittingly or \nunwittingly confirming that it is part of the massive anti -China \ncampaign on the fifth anniversary of the arbitration award handed \ndown on July 12, 2016, Simularity\u2019s fake claim on massive pollution \nby Chinese vessels in the Spratlys was announced in the virtual forum \norganized by top Sinophobe Albert del Rosario\u2018s dubious institute \n\u201cARD-Stratbase\u201d on that day.
